      This is an observational study that evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Korean&#xD;
      integrative treatments in patients with peripheral facial nerve palsy. Adulthood patients&#xD;
      aged between 19 to 69 who were diagnosed with peripheral facial nerve palsy and receive&#xD;
      Korean integrative treatments for facial palsy will be enrolled in the study and the change&#xD;
      will be followed according to the Facial disability index (FDI) at the 3 month moment after&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;

      This is an observational study that evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Korean&#xD;
      integrative treatments in patients with peripheral facial nerve palsy. A total of 100&#xD;
      patients who are in age of from 19 to 69, diagnosed with peripheral facial nerve palsy, in&#xD;
      acute to subacute stage, and who receive Korean integrative treatments for facial palsy will&#xD;
      be enrolled in this study. This study is an observational study and the intervention will be&#xD;
      decided not by researchers, but by physicians in the real clinical practice. The treatment&#xD;
      will be entirely determined according to each subject's medical conditions by an experienced&#xD;
      clinician who has received more than 6 years of education and more than 3 years of training.&#xD;
      This study will only record the contents of the intervention. Among all the data generated&#xD;
      during the study period, data deemed necessary can be collected in the case record forms. The&#xD;
      intervention will also be determined by the clinician, and the researcher presented&#xD;
      assessment and data collection timepoints, which is independent of the treatment schedule.&#xD;
      The on-treatment visit schedule will be once a week during the treatment is ongoing, and&#xD;
      follow-up visit schedule will be on the 5th, 14th, and 53rd weeks after the baseline.&#xD;

    <measure>Facial disability index</measure>
    <time_frame>week 14</time_frame>
    <description>This is a questionnaire made to evaluate the subjective sensations of patients on the ability to use facial muscles and their emotional state. It is composed of 10 items, and 1-5 is composed of 5 points per item for movement state, and 6-10 is composed of 6 points per item for sociological state and emotional state.</description>

    <measure>House-Brackmann facial palsy grade system (HB grade)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 1, 5, 14, 53 and every week during treatment (for survival analysis in complete recovery)</time_frame>
    <description>HB grade is a scale to evaluate facial palsy into 6 stages based on the severity of facial palsy, especially the muscles around the mouth and the muscles arount the eyes.</description>

    <time_frame>week 1, 5, 14, 53</time_frame>
    <description>FNGS 2.0 is calculated based on the total score by section by section in facial part and additional score with synkinesis movement. The result of FNGS 2.0 well indicate the palsy status, with the grade of 1-6 and 4-24 points.</description>

    <description>Any kind of Korean integrative medicine will be applicable and the treatment will be entirely determined by experienced clinicians. On the premise of the above, the following examples are the treatments applicable to the subject of this observational study.&#xD;
Chuna: Chuna therapy is performed on the face and cervical spine to induce decompression of the captured facial nerve. In addition, SJS Non-Resistance Technique-Facial palsy (SJS NRT-F), a technique of Chuna, can be performed to stimulate the intrinsic receptive sensation of the facial muscles to promote the neuromuscular response.&#xD;
Acupuncture: acupuncture can be applied on paralyzed muscle and others to improve symptoms and paralysis status.&#xD;
Pharmacopuncture: pharmacopuncture can be applied on paralyzed muscle and others to improve symptoms and paralysis status.&#xD;
Herbal medicine: It is prescribed according to clinical judgment according to the patient's symptoms and disease status.</description>
