  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sjögren syndrome is an autoimmune disease, responsible for xerostomia and xerophthalmia.&#xD;
      Other organs and tissues can be affected: the skin, vaginal and nasal mucous membranes. As&#xD;
      well, olfactory disorders have been also described in Sjögren syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xerostomia often causes significant functional impairment of taste function. Impairment of&#xD;
      taste function has been poorly evaluated in Sjögren syndrome like olfactory or (intra-nasal&#xD;
      and oral) trigeminal disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate olfactory, taste (intra-nasal and oral) trigeminal&#xD;
      functions in patients with Sjogren's syndrome compared to patients without sicca syndrome.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Successive dilutions of odorants by a factor 2 will be realized with distilled water as solvent.&#xD;
The odorant stimulus will be presented in a white glass bottle filled with 4 ml of liquid. The bottle will be presented for 3 seconds, medially 1 cm under both nostrils. Odour thresholds will be assessed using an ascending staircase, binary (stimulus vs. blank) forced-choice procedure, with inter-trial intervals of 90 seconds. The two bottles will presented to the subject in random order. After sniffing each stimulus, the participant will be asked to identify the one who smelled stronger. An incorrect choice will led to increase the concentration of the stimulus in the next trial. The dilution step at which the odorant stimulus will be first detected correctly three times in a row will be recorded as the detection threshold.</description>
