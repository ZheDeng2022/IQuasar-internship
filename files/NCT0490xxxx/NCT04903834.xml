      This project aims to undertake a high-resolution analysis of previous cases of COVID19&#xD;
      infection to determine from all available clinical data recorded over the timeline of&#xD;
      admission, who might benefit best from specific interventions designed to target a hyper&#xD;
      inflammatory response in this condition. This approach offers a timely contribution to the&#xD;
      field where the first phase of unselected clinical trials is already underway, and the second&#xD;
      phase will require a more targeted approach. Southampton offers a unique opportunity to&#xD;
      undertake this work, as it is widely accepted that the investigators lead the UK in clinical&#xD;
      data informatics. This project links the investigators research efforts at the clinical level&#xD;
      to current understanding of disease pathways, for which the investigators have effective&#xD;
      interventions and the problem the investigators aim to solve is, who will benefit from the&#xD;
      available novel anti-inflammatory approaches and when should this treatment be given?&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this research is to identify an early warning for hyperinflammation in&#xD;
      COVID19 so that interventional trials of anti-inflammatory agents can target this sub-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection causing COVID-19 is estimated to be 3.7%&#xD;
      globally. The principal cause of death due to COVID-19 is respiratory failure due to acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome. Early reports have suggested that a subgroup of individuals&#xD;
      suffer a hyperinflammatory state with a high mortality which is associated with high levels&#xD;
      of IL-6 and CRP. Recent randomised controlled trial data has shown that the anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      agent dexamethasone can reduce mortality in severe COVID-19 in an unselected COVID-19 cohort.&#xD;
      Whilst impressive, these results suggest that if the anti-inflammatory interventions could be&#xD;
      targeted early to individuals with hyperinflammation, even greater benefit in mortality may&#xD;
      be seen, and this approach may additionally reduce the morbidity of COVID-19 by preventing&#xD;
      escalation to high dependency and intensive care. The purpose of our study is to identify&#xD;
      hyperinflammation early because there are specific therapies which are in clinical use which&#xD;
      treat hyperinflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperinflammation has been previously described secondary to acute infection and termed&#xD;
      cytokine release syndrome / cytokine storm (CRS / CS), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS),&#xD;
      macrophage-cytokine self-amplifying loop (MCSAL) and secondary haemophagocytic&#xD;
      lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). Viral infections are the commonest cause of sHLH, and symptoms of&#xD;
      hyperinflammation resemble those of general sepsis, therefore hyperinflammation has generally&#xD;
      been under-recognised at an early stage leading to a high mortality. Blockade of the key&#xD;
      pathways in hyperinflammation such as IL-1 have been shown to be effective in sepsis&#xD;
      triggered cases without increased adverse events . Early data in a single arm open label&#xD;
      study of 21 severely ill COVID-19 patients with increased IL-6 expression, showed that&#xD;
      inhibition of IL-6 signaling with tocilizumab caused rapid clinical improvement in 75% of&#xD;
      cases, with some improvement in all cases .&#xD;
&#xD;
      During COVID19 infection, the initial viral invasion of epithelial tissues causes direct&#xD;
      cytotoxic damage but subsequently progresses to an inflammatory response at 7-10 days. While&#xD;
      an inflammatory response is likely to be needed to eliminate virus, there is a risk of&#xD;
      ongoing activation with inflammatory mediators causing end organ damage. Therefore, it seems&#xD;
      that targeting hyperinflammation (e.g. IL-6) during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection requires the&#xD;
      timing of blockade to be finely balanced to avoid early on impairment of host antiviral&#xD;
      responses. Similarly, intervening too late is likely to show minimal benefit. Due to the&#xD;
      urgency, despite this uncertainty, clinical trials to address the effectiveness of anti-IL-6&#xD;
      are already underway with Tocilizumab (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04317092, REMAP-CAP,&#xD;
      RECOVERY) and Sarilumab (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04315298). The entry criteria for&#xD;
      the UK trials of such interventions have largely been unselected, ie not specifically&#xD;
      targeting individuals who have hyperinflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is not yet clear how to identify those COVID-19 cases in whom&#xD;
      anti-hyperinflammation strategies are required. Retrospective examination of IL-6 expression&#xD;
      in 150 cases of COVID-19, estimated that in survivors median IL-6 level was approximately&#xD;
      6.9ng/ml (5-8.8 ng/ml), whereas in those who died was 11.25 ng/ml (7.75-16.25) (p&lt;0.001) .&#xD;
      Overall, 46 cases with IL-6 &gt;7.75 ng/ml 63% died whereas 47 cases IL-6 &lt;7.75ng/ml showed only&#xD;
      23% mortality. Similar data were identified in a second study to examine IL-6 levels, but&#xD;
      only showed these to be elevated in 6 out of 48 cases (mortality 50% in IL-6 high) . This&#xD;
      suggests that IL-6 expression levels may provide a useful biomarker of outcome, but IL-6&#xD;
      measurement alone is not sufficient and additionally this is not widely available. Although&#xD;
      dexamethasone has been reported to reduce mortality in unselected cases with severe COVID-19,&#xD;
      dexamethasone has a well-known side effect profile and risk of complications. Indeed, it is&#xD;
      not surprising that for those patients with less severe COVID the non-significant trend was&#xD;
      that dexamethasone caused harm (death compared to controls, OR 1.22, [0.86 to 1.75]).&#xD;
      Therefore, it is likely that strategies to identify hyperinflammation and targeted&#xD;
      intervention will offer the most effective approach to management of COVID-HI. Indeed, as&#xD;
      well as anti-IL-6 other cytokines released in hyperinflammation for which existing biologic&#xD;
      therapies are available are also potential targets for intervention including TNF-Î±&#xD;
      (Infliximab), IL-1 (Anakinra), and JAK-inhibitors (e.g. Ruxolitinib). In addition, secondary&#xD;
      events may prove potential check-points in hyperinflammation for blockade and IL-6 is also&#xD;
      known to regulate Th17 differentiation and induction of CD8 cytotoxic T cells which are&#xD;
      important in anti-viral responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To facilitate diagnosis of hyperinflammation, the 'HScore' which is a validated score and was&#xD;
      developed in the context of secondary sHLH because of evidence that early recognition and&#xD;
      intervention is beneficial. Some authors have recommended using the HScore in COVID-19 to&#xD;
      identify hyperinflammation. However, very few COVID patients fulfil the current HScore&#xD;
      criteria. So, it is unclear whether COVID hyperinflammation (COVID-HI) is an attenuated form&#xD;
      of sHLH but with a similar mechanism or whether it is a distinct entity. Indeed, there are&#xD;
      unique aspects to SARS-CoV-2 infection such as the unusual coagulopathy that arises in up to&#xD;
      67% of cases which suggests that perhaps COVID-HI is a unique entity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal aims to examine the HScore parameters in NHS clinical and laboratory records of&#xD;
      patients admitted to Southampton with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an aim to&#xD;
      determine the relevance to COVID19, and will explore whether other routine NHS parameters&#xD;
      could be incorporated to enhance the sensitivity of hyperinflammation diagnosis. To&#xD;
      facilitate a validation of this scoring approach, the study will confirm how such a scoring&#xD;
      system differentiates between the COVID-19 cohort and control cohort of hospitalised patients&#xD;
      stratified for key parameters. This analysis primary objective is to develop a clear&#xD;
      algorithm (COVID-HI score) for identification of the COVID19 subset with COVID-HI, and expect&#xD;
      these results will inform the next phase of COVID19 interventional clinical trial design in&#xD;
      anti-hyperinflammation therapy, such as the ACCORD study (CI, Prof T Wilkinson, Southampton)&#xD;
      . To identify hyperinflammation, the investigators will specifically examine the data for&#xD;
      trajectory changes in individual patients that reflect a hyperinflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Our primary hypothesis is that it is possible to develop a scoring system from&#xD;
      existing NHS clinical and laboratory parameters to facilitate early identification of&#xD;
      COVID-HI. Our secondary hypothesis, for examination in a subsequent study, is that this score&#xD;
      will offer an important pre-screening tool for COVID19 cases for entry to clinical trials of&#xD;
      anti-hyperinflammation therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the primary hypothesis, the aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Correlate the existing HScore with outcomes in our dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine in granular detail those cases who meet or partially meet the HScore threshold&#xD;
           for hyperinflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Utilise non-hypothesis driven approaches to determine other clinical or laboratory data&#xD;
           which would improve the sensitivity of the identification of hyperinflammation in&#xD;
           COVID19 to identify a Soton HI score.&#xD;
