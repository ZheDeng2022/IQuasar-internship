  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if theta burst stimulation (TBS) can reduce chronic&#xD;
      headaches caused by a traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBS is a safe, drug-free brain&#xD;
      stimulation technique that uses magnets to create electricity and stimulate nerve cells in&#xD;
      the brain. After repeated TBS sessions, the increased stimulation of nerve cells can alter&#xD;
      the way the brain communicates with itself (by creating new neural pathways) which, in turn,&#xD;
      can reduce pain symptoms. Participants in this study will complete a baseline assessment&#xD;
      followed by four weeks of daily home headache assessment. Participants will then receive four&#xD;
      weeks of TBS administered three times per day and three days per week. After TBS is&#xD;
      completed, participants will complete an additional four weeks of daily home headache&#xD;
      assessment and return for a one-month follow-up assessment. Participation is expected to last&#xD;
      three months.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of theta burst&#xD;
      stimulation (TBS) for the management of post-traumatic headaches to improve outcomes and&#xD;
      quality of life for individuals who have suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI). To improve&#xD;
      tolerability and logistical burden, we have developed a novel design whereby participants&#xD;
      will receive three doses of TBS on alternate days of the week. This design will allow us to&#xD;
      assess efficacy while leveraging an accelerated treatment course (nine stimulation sessions&#xD;
      per week). We have three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. To determine the efficacy and safety of TBS for the treatment of&#xD;
      post-traumatic headache among individuals who have sustained a mild TBI. Hypothesis 1a: TBS&#xD;
      will be safe, well-tolerated, and reduce the number of headache days. Hypothesis 1b: TBS will&#xD;
      improve function and quality of life outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the efficacy and safety of an accelerated time-course of TBS for&#xD;
      the management of post-traumatic headache. Hypothesis 2a: The accelerated-time course will be&#xD;
      safe, well-tolerated, and improve quality of life outcomes. Hypothesis 2b: The accelerated&#xD;
      time-course will produce greater and faster improvement in headache symptoms than that&#xD;
      reported in the literature for standard repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To examine the durability of treatment response to accelerated TBS during a&#xD;
      one-month observational period. Hypothesis 3: Accelerated TBS will result in enduring&#xD;
      treatment response of post-traumatic headache symptoms over the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be an open-label pilot study and will enroll 20. Participants will complete&#xD;
      four weeks of pre-intervention headache assessment via Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA).&#xD;
      Participants will then receive TBS intervention three times a week for four weeks. TBS will&#xD;
      be administered in 10-minute sessions, three times per day with 20 minutes between sessions.&#xD;
      TBS intervention will be completed using the Magstim Horizon Performance Transcranial&#xD;
      Magnetic Stimulation (Magstim Company, Ltd.) device or the MagVenture MagPro X100 with&#xD;
      MagOption Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation device (MagVenture, Inc.). Both devices are&#xD;
      FDA-cleared to provide TBS for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder and will be used&#xD;
      off-label for this study. After TBS intervention, participants will complete an additional&#xD;
      four weeks of EMA headache assessment and return for a one-month follow-up assessment.&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed with multiple instruments and at multiple timepoints including&#xD;
      interviews, questionnaires, and cognitive functioning assessments.&#xD;
