  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neutral argon plasma vaporization shows little damage to normal tissue and allows a complete&#xD;
      removal of tumor tissue, that is, without leaving any cell debris viable tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of neutral argon plasma on&#xD;
      peritoneal implants with different dosimetry in vivo and ex vivo.&#xD;

    <description>Pathological evaluation, in the Pathological Anatomy service of the University Hospital Reina Sofía, of both samples of peritoneum and evaluation of the presence of cells tumors and degree of tissue destruction, after performing the procedure according to the indications of the &quot;Interventions&quot; section.&#xD;
The specimens will be fixed in formaldehyde for about 48 hours and cut and fixed in paraffin. They will be stained with hematoxylin and eosin according to protocol, after being cut in the area of greatest macroscopic lesion produced by the device. It will be used microscopy and optical micrometer to measure the depth of vaporization of the tissue, as well as damage to adjacent healthy tissue.&#xD;
Depth is measured from a line parallel to the surrounding tissue to the point deeper tissue evaporation. As all quadrants will include tumor implants, they will also have flat tissue without tumor and it will be which the depth is measured from.</description>

    <description>Use of plasma of neutral argon in the eradication of tumor implants at the mesentery level, with different doses (established according to the percentage of energy used) and distances of application and time.

    <description>Evaluation of the mesentery or peritoneum area infiltrated by miliary implants that is going to be treated. Determination of the PCI. Collection of several samples of the mesenteric peritoneum or parietal peritoneum with tumor involvement (implants between 1-2.5mm of diameter).&#xD;
It will established a matrix which will be divided into 12 quadrants where the tissue with implants will be placed and it will be treated according to specific power (80-100%), and for an action time of 2-4 seconds or until macroscopic tumor destruction. For each power, application of Plasmajet at 1, 2 and 3 cm from the target tumor tissue.&#xD;
The in-vivo effect will be evaluated with the use of ball-tip in terms of damage to the serosa or vascularization of the mesentery.</description>
