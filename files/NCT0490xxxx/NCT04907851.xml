  <brief_summary>

      This study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of RXC004 monotherapy in&#xD;
      advanced solid tumours that have progressed following SoC treatment.&#xD;

      This Phase II, modular, open label, multicentre study will initially open with ring finger&#xD;
      protein 43 (RNF43) loss of function (LoF) mutation-positive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      (PDAC) (Module 1) and biliary tract cancer (BTC) (Module 2) modules. 15 evaluable patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled in each module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the preliminary efficacy of RXC004 in each&#xD;
      module in terms of progression free survival (PFS) at 6 months. Following radiological&#xD;
      progression, patients will be followed-up for safety and survival.&#xD;
