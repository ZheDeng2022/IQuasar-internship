      &quot;Physical activity and diet in children and young people with arthritis&quot; A qualitative study&#xD;
      of exploring stake holder's experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is the most common type of arthritis in children under&#xD;
      the age of 16. The disease and its therapeutic management can cause serious long-term&#xD;
      complications, which affect general activities and quality of life. The lack of specific&#xD;
      guidelines for safe physical activity and appropriate management of any nutritional deficit&#xD;
      aiming our study to find out your views and opinions about the needs of children and young&#xD;
      people with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We want to improve our knowledge about the impact&#xD;
      of physical activity and eating habit on juvenile idiopathic arthritis and we want to develop&#xD;
      a tool to help evaluate care. Few studies targeting quality of life and wellbeing in children&#xD;
      adolescent populations have adopted the diet and physical activity perspective or approaches,&#xD;
      consequently, this research project will help to address this gap through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Interview: to look at young people's current experiences with JIA as well as their&#xD;
           parents/caregivers and health care professionals. Study findings will provide a snapshot&#xD;
           of the current experiences of participants, helping to improve our knowledge about JIA,&#xD;
           physical activity, and diet. Qualitative studies exploring people perspectives on their&#xD;
           experiences, when collected systematically, adds valuable depth, insight and&#xD;
           understanding into the issues related to JIA not possible through quantitative&#xD;
           methodologies. This study uses a qualitative approach known as framework methodology to&#xD;
           understand stakeholder's experience of what helps and what hinders improving the quality&#xD;
           of life in children and young adult with JIA. 21-30 stakeholders will be recruited in&#xD;
           Oxford UK, to take part in individual semi-structured guided interviews lasting&#xD;
           approximately one hour. Participant responses will be transcribed by the chief&#xD;
           investigator and analysed to extract themes that will answer the research question.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Delphi study: which aims to develop a diet and physical activity intervention for&#xD;
           children and young adult with JIA.&#xD;

      adolescent populations have adopted diet and physical activity perspective or approaches,&#xD;
      consequently this research project will help to address this gap through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Systematic review: to evaluate current evidence about diet, health and health related&#xD;
           quality of life in children and young adult with JIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Interview: to look at young people's current experiences with JIA as well as their&#xD;
           parents/caregivers and health care professionals. Study findings will provide a snapshot&#xD;

           question.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Delphi study: which aims to develop diet and physical activity intervention for children&#xD;
           and young adult with JIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol covers the second and third approaches only (interview and Delphi).&#xD;
