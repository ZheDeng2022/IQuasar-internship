  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is a significant public health concern. Transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS) is a non-invasive form of brain stimulation that has already displayed remarkable&#xD;
      potential for producing novel, non-pharmacological interventions for depression and cigarette&#xD;
      smokers. In this study, we will use brain MRI to guide TMS therapy for smoking cessation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking cessation is difficult, despite the demonstrated efficacy of several&#xD;
      pharmacotherapeutic agents and cognitive behavioral therapies. This may be due to imbalanced&#xD;
      neuronal circuits, including elevated functional connectivity in the drive-reward circuit&#xD;
      (medial orbital frontal cortex [mOFC] to nucleus accumbens [NAc]) and decreased functional&#xD;
      connectivity in the executive control circuit (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex[ DLPFC] to&#xD;
      NAc). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a new class of therapeutics that&#xD;
      has already displayed remarkable potential for producing novel, non-pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous studies have reported that rTMS&#xD;
      decreased cue craving, reduced cigarette consumption, and increased smoking quit rate in&#xD;
      tobacco use disorders(TUDs). However, the treatment parameters and exact mechanism for rTMS&#xD;
      increasing smoking quit rate need further refinement. The goal of this study is to develop a&#xD;
      circuit-based precision rTMS therapy for smoking cessation further. In the 2-year UG3 phase,&#xD;
      we will recruit 45 TUDs. Participants will undergo a baseline cue-exposure fMRI and a&#xD;
      resisting-to smoke fMRI session. Participants will be randomized into three groups: 1) Sham&#xD;
      rTMS over the left mOFC or the left DLPFC. 2) Active, inhibitory low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS)&#xD;
      over the left mOFC (1 Hz, 900 pulses, E-field modeling, 15 minutes, smoking cue exposure&#xD;
      fMRI-guided target). Or 3) Active, high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS) over the left DLPFC (10 Hz,&#xD;
      3000 pulses, E-field modeling,15 minutes, resisting-to-smoke fMRI guided target). Fifteen&#xD;
      sessions of rTMS will be completed over three weeks, after which we will acquire fMRI scans.&#xD;
      We will also test the imbalanced function of drive-reward and executive control before and&#xD;
      after 3 weeks of treatments to compare the imbalanced function between groups.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be fitted with two electrodes on the scalp just below the hairline. Electrodes will be connected to an Epix VTÂ® Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation Device with adjustable output amplitude and powered by a 9-V battery. We will use electrode stimulation with 10 Hz over DLPFC, total 3000 pulses or 1 Hz over mOFC total 900 pulses. The sham-TMS scalp discomfort was matched to that of active TMS. During real TMS there was no current flowing through the scalp electrodes.</description>
