  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves the use of an investigational cell therapy known as DVX201. DVX201 is an&#xD;
      investigational cell therapy that contains a type of white blood cell called natural killer&#xD;
      (NK) cells. NK cells are a normal part of your immune system and have a lifespan of only&#xD;
      about two weeks. They are called natural killer cells because they have the natural ability&#xD;
      to identify and kill cells in the body that are abnormal, like cancer cells or virally&#xD;
      infected cells. But fighting cancer can also lead to exhaustion and abnormal function of NK&#xD;
      cells. It can also result in a significant decrease in the number of NK cells in the blood,&#xD;
      making it more difficult for the immune system to control the disease. We believe that&#xD;
      infusion of healthy, functional NK cells into patients with AML or MDS may boost the immune&#xD;
      system and help by killing cancer cells that remain after chemotherapy. DVX201 is an&#xD;
      investigational NK cell therapy that may provide a rapid and temporary source of healthy NK&#xD;
      cells that are better able to fight those cancer cells.&#xD;

    <description>Lymphodepleting (LD) chemotherapy will be administered daily for 3 days to all subjects prior to DVX201. Lymphodepleting chemotherapy will consist of the following:&#xD;
Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 IV over 30 to 60 minutes daily x 3 (day -5 to day - 3)&#xD;
Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes daily x 3 (day -5 to day -3)&#xD;
Patients will receive DVX201 at one of 3 prespecified doses infused on day 0 and 7 (± 1 day) for 1 cycle.</description>

    <description>Based upon the occurrence of DLT (does limiting toxicity), the MTD will be estimated as the highest dose at which the toxicity probability is the closest to the target probability (denoted pT=0.30) following up to 2 doses of DVX201. The corresponding dose allocation methodology is a modified toxicity interval design based upon (Ji et al., 2010; Ji et al., 2013).&#xD;
All patients who have at least one dose initiated will be included in the safety analysis. Patients who are enrolled but never exposed to investigational product will be replaced for all analyses. Patients who get exposed to lymphodepleting chemotherapy will be followed and reported for outcomes overall, but for determination of safety and efficacy, only those subjects who have been exposed to the investigational agent will be included.</description>
