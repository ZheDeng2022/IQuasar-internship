  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucagon is secreted from pancreatic alpha-cells in response to protein-rich meals and during&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. A physiological feedback system exists between the liver and the pancreatic&#xD;
      alpha cells termed the liver-alpha cell axis and signifies the role between amino&#xD;
      acid-stimulated glucagon secretion and glucagon-stimulated amino acid metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease have increased levels of glucagon&#xD;
      (hyperglucagonemia) and amino acids (hyperaminoacidemia), which suggests that hepatic&#xD;
      steatosis may uncouple glucagon's effect on amino acid metabolism (i.e. reduced glucagon&#xD;
      sensitivity). Since hyperglucagonemia contributes to diabetes progression - due to its&#xD;
      potentiating effects on hepatic glucose production - hepatic steatosis may create a&#xD;
      diabetogenic circle. This study aims to develop and evaluate a test for measuring glucagon&#xD;
      sensitivity in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators (Associate Prof. Nicolai J Wewer Albrechtsen, Prof. JÃ¸rgen Rungby and Prof.&#xD;
      Jens Juul Holst) will investigate whether amino acid metabolism is attenuated in individuals&#xD;
      with hepatic steatosis (steatosis assessed by magnetic resonance imaging) due to impaired&#xD;
      glucagon sensitivity and if glucagon's effect on hepatic glucose production is intact&#xD;
      compared to individuals without hepatic steatosis suggestive of biased signaling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amino acids administered orally or intravenously stimulate glucagon secretion from the&#xD;
      pancreas and in turn, glucagon is a powerful stimulus for hepatic amino acid turnover through&#xD;
      transcriptional (long-term) and non- transcriptional (acute) mechanisms. Several groups&#xD;
      including the investigators have linked glucagon secretion to hepatic amino acid metabolism&#xD;
      suggesting a mutual feedback cycle, termed the liver-alpha cell axis. A disruption of this&#xD;
      axis, which has been shown both pharmacologically using glucagon receptor antagonists and&#xD;
      genetically in glucagon receptor knockout mouse models, leads to increased glucagon&#xD;
      (hyperglucagonemia) and amino acid (hyperaminoacidemia) concentrations. This phenotype is&#xD;
      also evident in subjects with biopsy-verified non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)&#xD;
      independent of type 2 diabetes suggesting reduced hepatic glucagon sensitivity in the&#xD;
      presence of hepatic steatosis. Glucagon increases amino acid catabolism by potentiating&#xD;
      ureagenesis, a pathway exclusive to the liver, and hepatic accumulation of triglycerides may&#xD;
      reduce glucagon's ability to augment amino acid turnover. Some amino acids are more potent in&#xD;
      stimulating glucagon secretion (glucagonotropic amino acids), including alanine, and the&#xD;
      glucagon-alanine index is currently used as a surrogate marker for the hepatic actions of&#xD;
      glucagon on ureagenesis. The fate of amino acid turnover depends on both glucagon and insulin&#xD;
      dynamics by stimulating amino acid catabolism and synthesis, respectively. Studying the&#xD;
      effects of glucagon in individuals with type 1 diabetes will allow one to differentiate&#xD;
      between the combined effects of glucagon and insulin compared to the effects of glucagon&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore hepatic glucagon sensitivity towards amino acid metabolism in&#xD;
      individuals with and without hepatic steatosis (based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the effect of endogenous and exogenous glucagon on plasma&#xD;
      amino acid levels are impaired in individuals with NAFLD (based on hepatic steatosis measured&#xD;
      by MRI) compared to controls.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Glucagon Sensitivity test consisting of an amino acid tolerance test and a bolus infusion of glucagon</intervention_name>
    <description>The test consists of two experimental trial days:&#xD;
Day 1 includes an intravenous (iv) bolus-infusion of glucagon (2 mg) and thereby evaluates the effect of exogenous glucagon on amino acid disappearance. Two blood samples will be obtained at time -10 minutes and 0 minutes following an overnight fast. Immediately after the blood sample at time 0 minutes, a bolus infusion will be administered iv. Blood samples will be obtained until time 120 minutes and a maximum of 100ml blood will be sampled.&#xD;
Day 2 includes a 45-min iv infusion of mixed AAs (331 mg/min/kg body weight) to evaluate the liver-alpha cell axis (sensitivity of endogenous glucagon signaling). Two blood samples will be obtained at time -10 minutes and 0 minutes following an overnight fast. Immediately after the blood sample at time 0 minutes, the amino acid infusion will start and continuously be infusion until time 45 minutes. Blood samples will be obtained until time 180 minutes and a maximum of 200ml blood will be sampled.</description>
