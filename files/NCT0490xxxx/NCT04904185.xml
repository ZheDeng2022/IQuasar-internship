  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the introduction of checkpoint inhibitors substantial improvements have been made in the&#xD;
      treatment of malignant melanoma (MM). Despite this still a a subset of patients,&#xD;
      approximately 50 %, experience no response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the strategies to overcome these obstacles have been ACT with tumour infiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocytes (TILs). Most TIL based ACT products are non-specifically expanded providing&#xD;
      growth preference to co-infiltrated virus specific T cells, and it is currently challenging&#xD;
      to expand T cells in an antigen-specific manner, while at the same time obtaining the ideal&#xD;
      functional characteristics for specific and strong tumour-killing capacity with sufficient&#xD;
      persistence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase I trial artificial antigen-presenting scaffolds for antigen-driven T cell&#xD;
      expansion are used. These scaffolds will generate a MASE-T cell product enriched for selected&#xD;
      specificities towards antigens known to be expressed by melanoma cells The aim of the study&#xD;
      is to demonstrate that treatment with af MASE-T cell product i safe and feasible. Further the&#xD;
      study will elucidate whether treament with the MASE-T cell product leads to objective&#xD;
      responses and improves progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are around 350-400 new cases of patients with metastatic melanoma (MM) per year in&#xD;
      Denmark. MM is a very aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis. Traditional oncological&#xD;
      treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy have a poor effect, and the&#xD;
      5-year overall survival has hitherto been less than 10 %.Substantial improvements have been&#xD;
      made in the treatment of MM; especially immunotherapy is showing promising results with&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and Cytotoxic T&#xD;
      Lymphocyte-associated Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) blocking antibodies administered as standard&#xD;
      treatment in the frontline. The 5-year overall survival has now reached 52 %, 44 % and 26 %&#xD;
      in nivolumab/ipilimumab, nivolumab, and ipilimumab respectively. However, a subset of&#xD;
      patients - approximately 50 % experience no response to therapy, with clear primary&#xD;
      resistance. One of the strategies to overcome these obstacles have been ACT with tumour&#xD;
      infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). A crucial condition for optimal ACT based on TILs is the&#xD;
      generation of sufficient numbers of tumourreactive T cells. However, the expansion of TILs&#xD;
      requires extensive ex vivo culturing often at the cost of T cell differentiation and&#xD;
      functional activity. Most TIL based ACT products are non-specifically expanded providing&#xD;
      growth preference to co-infiltrated virus specific T cells, and it is currently challenging&#xD;
      to expand T cells in an antigen-specific manner, while at the same time obtaining the ideal&#xD;
      functional characteristics for specific and strong tumour-killing capacity with sufficient&#xD;
      persistence. Recent data suggest that the majority of tumour specific T cells responsible for&#xD;
      tumour rejection under CPI are recruited from peripheral blood and lymph system, while not&#xD;
      present in the tumour prior to treatment. This is supported by the finding that most tumour&#xD;
      resident T cells are dysfunctional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome the current limitations in the treatment of malignant melanoma artificial&#xD;
      antigen-presenting scaffolds for antigen-driven T cell expansion, generating a MASE-T cell&#xD;
      product enriched for selected specificities towards antigens known to be expressed by&#xD;
      melanoma cells has been designed. The antigen-scaffolds will ensuring optimal T cell&#xD;
      stimulation by mimicking the in vivo stimulation of T cells by dendritic cells in the lymph&#xD;
      nodes. The scaffolds contain both the antigen specific element - in the form of a peptide-MHC&#xD;
      molecule and cytokine (IL2 and IL21), to provide growth and functional signals to the antigen&#xD;
      specific T cell. As a result of this T cell expansion strategy, we can obtain a T cell&#xD;
      product enriched for tumourantigen specific T cells. Superior functional activity towards&#xD;
      tumor cells and antigen recognition compared to conventional T cell expansion strategies has&#xD;
      been demonstrated in-vitro. Importantly, antigen-specific T cells in the MASE-T cell product&#xD;
      possess a 'younger' phenotype, which has previously been described to correlate with improved&#xD;
      in vivo persistence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a phase 1, non-randomized study. The trial will be conducted in two parts (A and&#xD;
      B). Patients will be treated as followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A (6 patients): Lymphodepleting chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day i.v.&#xD;
           on day -4, -3, -2 and fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day i.v. on day -4, -3) followed by i.v.&#xD;
           infusion of the MASE-T product on day 0. If the production of the MASE-T cell product&#xD;
           was feasible for the majority (≥50%) of patients intended to treat in Arm A and the&#xD;
           toxicity was acceptable, six patients will further be included in part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B (6 patients): Lymphodepleting chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day i.v.&#xD;
           on day -4, -3, -2 and fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day i.v on day -4, -3) followed by i.v&#xD;
           infusion of the MASE-T product on day 0. Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg will be administered on&#xD;
           day -1 and day +21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the MASE-T treatment alone&#xD;
      or in combination with Pembrolizumab in patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma according&#xD;
      to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 5.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate T cell profile and persistence in vivo from tumor&#xD;
      biopsies and blood samples as well as evaluation of the clinical efficacy of the treatment&#xD;
      according to RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST. In addition, best overall response (BOR), duration of&#xD;
      response (DOR), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) will be monitored.&#xD;
