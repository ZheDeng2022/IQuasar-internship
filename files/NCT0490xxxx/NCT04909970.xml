  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, stress particularly affects family caregivers because of the intensive help they&#xD;
      provide on a permanent basis to people losing their autonomy at home. This care work is often&#xD;
      considered as a &quot;burden&quot; and has all the characteristics of a chronic daily stress factor.&#xD;
      The prevalence of stress among caregivers is high and the level of stress varies according to&#xD;
      the type of care provided to seniors at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This chronic stress has harmful effects on the health of family caregivers (depression,&#xD;
      fatigue, insomnia, onset of chronic diseases, early mortality). It can be detrimental to&#xD;
      their well-being and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, ageing well at home for older people is based on this essential pillar: the&#xD;
      caregivers. They must remain in good physical and psychological health. Reducing their daily&#xD;
      stress is becoming a public health challenge and a national priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the management of caregiver stress is based on several measures and devices.&#xD;
      Non-conventional care practices such as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, meditation,&#xD;
      relaxation and yoga are offered to family caregivers. Initial results of studies on the&#xD;
      effect of these complementary medicines show an improvement in psychological stress. However,&#xD;
      research in this field is relatively recent. The conclusions must therefore be approached&#xD;
      with caution. Moreover, no medium or long-term evaluation has been found in the scientific&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-hypnosis is becoming a common practice in healthcare. It has demonstrated its&#xD;
      effectiveness in reducing pain and anxiety in both adults and children. In addition, other&#xD;
      recent scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of hypnosis in stress management. In&#xD;
      France, no study on caregiver stress and its management by self-hypnosis has been identified&#xD;
      in the literature. The hypothesis is that the stress level of caregivers of elderly people at&#xD;
      home could be reduced through daily self-hypnosis practice at home.&#xD;
