      The Assessment of Brain Tau Burden in Participants with Parkinson's Disease in the PPMI Study&#xD;
      (PPMI Tau PET Imaging) will evaluate if [18F] PI-2620 facilitates better understanding of Tau&#xD;
      deposition in the brain in Parkinson's disease (PD).&#xD;

      The Assessment of Brain Tau Burden in Participants with Parkinson's Disease in the PPMI Study&#xD;
      (PPMI Tau PET Imaging) is a companion study to the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative&#xD;
      Clinical protocol (PPMI-002; NCT04477785). After consenting to the PPMI Clinical protocol,&#xD;
      participants interested in completing an additional scan under this study will be asked to&#xD;
      complete consent, additional activities, and one [18F]PI-2620 PET imaging scan as part of&#xD;
      this study. Enrollment in the PPMI Tau PET Imaging companion study will facilitate comparison&#xD;
      of tau deposition to clinical, imaging, blood and CSF tau already acquired in these PPMI&#xD;
      participants under the PPMI Clinical protocol. The primary goal of this imaging study is to&#xD;
      test whether positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F] PI-2620 can visualize in vivo&#xD;
      brain tau deposition in participants with PD. The secondary goal is to evaluate tau&#xD;
      deposition in PD LRRK2 mutation carriers given recent data that tau pathology may be present&#xD;
      in those individuals.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrolled in PPMI Clinical protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or Female (Females must meet additional criteria specified below, as applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females must be of non-childbearing potential or using a highly effective method&#xD;
                  of birth control 14 days prior to until at least 24 hours after injection of&#xD;
                  [18F]PI-2620.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-childbearing potential is defined as a female that must be either&#xD;
                  postmenopausal (no menses for at least 12 months prior to PET scan) or surgically&#xD;
                  sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Highly effective method of birth control is defined as practicing at least one of&#xD;
                  the following: A birth control method that results in a less than 1% per year&#xD;
                  failure rate when used consistently and correctly, such as oral contraceptives&#xD;
                  for at least 3 months prior to injection, an intrauterine device (IUD) for at&#xD;
                  least 2 months prior to injection, or barrier methods, e.g., diaphragm or&#xD;
                  combination condom and spermicide. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) is not acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females of childbearing potential must not be pregnant, breastfeeding or&#xD;
                  lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females of childbearing potential have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
                  [18F]PI-2620 injection on day of PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to an effective radiation dose of 50 mSv, which would be above the acceptable&#xD;
             annual limit established by the US Federal Guidelines during the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other medical or psychiatric condition or lab abnormality, which in the opinion of&#xD;
             the Site Investigator might preclude participation.&#xD;
