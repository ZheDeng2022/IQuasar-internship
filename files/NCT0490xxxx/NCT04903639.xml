    <textblock>
      The conjunction of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obstructive sleep apnea&#xD;
      (OSA) is known as Overlap Syndrome (OS). The coexistence of these diseases have&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of&#xD;
      OSA in COPD patients. 100 COPD patients (obese and non-obese) performed sleep questionnaires&#xD;
      and polysomnogram.&#xD;

      300 patients were enrolled in this prospective observational study who were attended at chest&#xD;
      department, outpatient clinic Benha university hospitals for follow up between August 2018&#xD;
      and October 2020. According to medical history, clinical examination and pulmonary function&#xD;
      tests, only stable COPD patients (100 patients) were included. The research ethics committee&#xD;
      at the faculty of medicine has approved the study and all patients provided informed consent&#xD;
      before participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD patients were divided according to their body mass index (BMI) into two groups ; group&#xD;
      A: 50 obese COPD patients (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) and group B: 50 non obese COPD patients (BMI ≤ 29.9&#xD;
      kg/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: COPD patients were diagnosed according to the Global initiative for&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on the basis of (GOLD, 2017). Included patients who had&#xD;
      chronic cough, sputum production, dyspnea and /or a history of exposure to risk factors for&#xD;
      the disease and confirmed by the presence of a post bronchodilator forced expiratory volume&#xD;
      in the 1st second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) &lt; 70% .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria included patients with COPD exacerbation, patients with decompensated&#xD;
      heart failure, thyroid dysfunction, ears, nose and throat (ENT) causes of OSA or patients&#xD;
      with impaired hepatic and renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD patients were characterized by their postbronchodilator FEV1 into mild (FEV1 ≥ 80%&#xD;
      anticipated), moderate (50%≤FEV1 &lt; 80% anticipated) and severe (30%≤FEV1 &lt; 50% anticipated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included in this study were subjected to full history taking, physical&#xD;
      examination (general including BMI and neck circumference (NC), local chest examination, oral&#xD;
      and ENT), questionnaires [The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) which translated to Arabic,&#xD;
      STOP-Bang Questionnair (SBQ), modified medical research council (mMRC) breathlessness scale&#xD;
      which was translated ta Arabic, spirometry which was done using JAEGER carefusion Germany 234&#xD;
      GmbH Lelbnizstr .7, 97204 Hoechberg, Germany. Spirometry was done during stability of the&#xD;
      disease. Echocardiography, liver, kidney and thyroid function tests were done .Overnight&#xD;
      Polysomnography (PSG) (SOMNO Screen Plus; SOMNO Medics GmbH, Randersacker, Germany). The&#xD;
      polysomnography consists of electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG),&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG), pulse oximetry, thoracic and abdominal straps,&#xD;
      body posture sensor, nasal thermistor and nasal cannula to assess respiratory flow and&#xD;
      pressure and bipolar channel limb movements (tibialis anterior). Electrodes and sensors were&#xD;
      attached to patients by sleep physiologist. Data collection was obtained following signal&#xD;
      perception by preprocessed computer (DOMINO Software, ver. 2.6.0; SOMNO Medics GmbH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients considered having OSA if they had apneic episodes occurred in the existence of&#xD;
      respiratory muscle effort and lasted 10 seconds or more, or have a combination of apneas and&#xD;
      hypopneas. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is gotten from the absolute number of apneas and&#xD;
      hypopneas separated by the total sleep time. Cutoff levels on AHI incorporate 5-15 episodes&#xD;
      per hour for mild, 15-30 episodes per hour for moderate and more than 30 episodes per hour&#xD;
      for severe OSA&#xD;
