      EMPOWER is a multidisciplinary research and innovation effort aiming to developing,&#xD;
      implementing, evaluating and disseminating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a&#xD;
      modular eHealth intervention platform to promote health and well-being, reduce psychological&#xD;
      distress, prevent common mental health problems and reduce their impact in the workplace. In&#xD;
      collaboration with stakeholders, we will adapt existing effective interventions focused on&#xD;
      different components (awareness and stigma, workplace conditions and psychosocial factors,&#xD;
      stress, common mental health symptoms, early detection, comorbidity, lifestyle, and return to&#xD;
      work) to created a combined online modular platform feasible in various workplace settings by&#xD;
      culturally and contextually adapting it. The intervention will be implemented through a&#xD;
      stepped wedge cluster randomized trial directed to employees and employers of small and&#xD;
      medium sized enterprises and public agencies from three European countries (Spain, Finland&#xD;
      and Poland) and United Kingdom. Both qualitative and quantitative methods will be used in the&#xD;
      evaluation of the individual health outcomes, cost-effectiveness (from a social, economical,&#xD;
      employer and employees perspective), and implementation facilitators and barriers.&#xD;
      Implementation strategies relevant to the uptake of the EMPOWER intervention will be&#xD;
      identified, including a realistic appraisal of barriers to uptake as well as evidence-based&#xD;
      solutions to these barriers. Through scaling-up pre-existing effective and cost-effective&#xD;
      interventions, EMPOWER is aimed at addressing the overarching challenges from different&#xD;
      perspectives, including individual level (e.g., addressing stigma, mental health, well-being&#xD;
      and lifestyles, taking into account legal, cultural and gender issues) and organizational&#xD;
      level. The main outcomes effort will help employees, employers and policymakers in decision&#xD;
      processes of new legal and contractual framework at EU and national level covering the new&#xD;
      economy landscape.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EMPOWER Project's main objective is to develop, test and evaluate a multi-modal and&#xD;
      inclusive e-Health platform, compiling the most feasible, brief and cost-effective&#xD;
      interventions currently available in Europe to promote health and wellbeing, prevent mental&#xD;
      health problems and reduce the impact of mental health problems in the workplace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, three intervention levels will be represented by interventions within the&#xD;
      eHealth platform that are specially designed for the relevant populations and desired&#xD;
      outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Universal (primary) prevention: interventions to improve awareness and reduce stigma; to&#xD;
           reduce psychosocial risk factors and providing early detection of mental disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary prevention programs: interventions designed to improve wellbeing and reduce&#xD;
           psychological distress and to promote healthy lifestyles. EMPOWER individual eHealth&#xD;
           intervention will be based on the following components:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Psychoeducational material.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Challenges&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tracking&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Tertiary prevention program: return to work intervention. The intensive collaborative&#xD;
           approach will design strategies to overcome the barriers that have already been&#xD;
           identified for the widespread implementation of programs to promote wellbeing and reduce&#xD;
           mental health problems in the workplace. EMPOWER aims to address the increasing burden&#xD;
           of mental health problems in the workplace and improve mental health in the EU working&#xD;
           population, having a positive impact on productivity. Partners from the consortium are&#xD;
           coming from countries such as Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, UK, Switzerland and&#xD;
           Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An eHealth platform to reduce the impact of mental health problems at the workplace Mental&#xD;
      health problems cause an enormous burden both for the individual and the society. A number of&#xD;
      interventions have been developed to promote wellbeing and prevent or treat mental disorders&#xD;
      in the workplace. Attempts to implement interventions by means of digital technologies have&#xD;
      had statistically significant but minimally positive effects in reducing overall mental&#xD;
      health problems, such as depression, anxiety and stress. However, most eHealth interventions&#xD;
      focus on a single mental health condition and neglect comorbidity, particularly in the case&#xD;
      of the more common mental disorders. Although effective and cost-effective workplace&#xD;
      interventions are available, widespread implementation face a number of barriers. The stigma&#xD;
      and discrimination at the workplace have been associated with delayed access to treatment,&#xD;
      weakened social support, difficulties in the performance of occupational and social roles,&#xD;
      unemployment, and diminished self-esteem. Although anti-stigma interventions targeting the&#xD;
      general population and workplace settings have been implemented, there is room for&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collaboration among stakeholders is essential when developing and implementing effective&#xD;
      interventions to reduce the impact of mental health problems at the workplace and evaluate&#xD;
      their impact. The organization of work is rapidly changing. This growing diversity of what it&#xD;
      means to work makes it clear that addressing mental health issues at the workplace will&#xD;
      require ingenuity and flexibility to tailor interventions to the realities of the workplace&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Framework Directive on Occupational Safety and Health, 89/391/EEC, lays down the&#xD;
      employers' general duty to ensure workers' health and safety, &quot;addressing all types of risk&quot;.&#xD;
      Although the Framework does not explicitly address mental health issues in the workplace, it&#xD;
      implicitly addresses them since it requires the employer to be aware of and address all types&#xD;
      of health-related risks. At the same time, the European Commission's 2008 European Pact for&#xD;
      Mental Health and Well-being20 and the 2016 European Framework for Action on Mental Health&#xD;
      and Well-being21 have clearly raised the issue of mental health as a public health priority&#xD;
      across society and the economy, mentioning workplace mental health as one target area.&#xD;
      Although there has not as yet been a direct regulatory focus on mental health in the&#xD;
      workplace, there is certainly a general consensus that it is incumbent on European employers&#xD;
      to adequately identify and address known psychosocial risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the fragmented landscape of interventions and related implementation barriers, there&#xD;
      is an urgent need for a multi-modal and integrative eHealth platform aimed at reducing mental&#xD;
      health problems in the workplace and improving employees' wellbeing, by compiling the most&#xD;
      feasible, brief and cost-effective interventions currently available in Europe. The platform&#xD;
      will take advantage of proven cost-effective tools and address the need to reduce stigma,&#xD;
      increase help-seeking behaviour, raise awareness about and minimalize psychosocial risks,&#xD;
      improve self-management strategies, taking into account mental and physical comorbidities,&#xD;
      and promote a healthy lifestyle - all while considering gender and cultural differences that&#xD;
      impact successful implementation. This is especially relevant for small and medium&#xD;
      enterprises (SMEs), which represent the majority of all enterprises in the EU but have very&#xD;
      limited resources. The development and implementation of a multi-modal and integrative&#xD;
      eHealth platform should, finally, be guided and supported by close collaboration with&#xD;
      stakeholders, including employee and employer organisations, insurance companies, patient&#xD;
      associations, and health professionals.&#xD;
