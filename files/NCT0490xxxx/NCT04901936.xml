  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and biological activity&#xD;
      (how the investigational medication is processed by the body) of pegcetacoplan in 12-17&#xD;
      year-olds (adolescents) who have paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to evaluate pegcetacoplan in people with PNH who are 12-17 years&#xD;
      old for up to 5 months (20 weeks). At the completion of the study treatment period,&#xD;
      participants will either enter a long-term extension period or a 2-month follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible study participants will receive pegcetacoplan, administered via subcutaneous&#xD;
      infusion twice a week at home. The subcutaneous infusion requires two small needles to be&#xD;
      inserted into the fatty layer of tissue under the skin and the investigational medication&#xD;
      will flow into the body. Study participants and/or caregivers will be trained on home&#xD;
      administration of pegcetacoplan.&#xD;
