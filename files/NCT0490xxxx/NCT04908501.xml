  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-appropriateness of care is a common and serious phenomenon that affects healthcare&#xD;
      institutions in France. Appropriateness in health care is about adequacy of any type of&#xD;
      health care with patient's needs. Relying on structuring innovative tools, the hospital&#xD;
      university centre of Bordeaux is implementing a health care appropriateness assessment and&#xD;
      support programme (&quot;sPREAd pertinence&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using a mixed method, the project's main objective is to evaluate programme effectiveness&#xD;
      on the improvement of care appropriateness in hospital university centre of Bordeaux. Other&#xD;
      assessments are considering impact on: specific care appropriateness indicators, care related&#xD;
      adverse events frequency, organizational climate, and work life satisfaction. The economic&#xD;
      impact of this program in terms of induced costs and avoided costs will be evaluated. A&#xD;
      qualitative approach will be used to identify the programme transferability conditions with a&#xD;
      view to produce an Operational Model for the Implementation of Appropriateness at a&#xD;
      Healthcare Institution.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Non-appropriateness of care is a common and serious phenomenon that affects healthcare&#xD;
      institutions in France. Appropriateness in health care is about adequacy of any type of&#xD;
      health care with patient's needs. It means that a health care is necessary and relevant,&#xD;
      given a specific indication, with regard to updated practice recommendations or&#xD;
      justifications of experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospital university centre of Bordeaux is making Health care appropriateness a policy&#xD;
      priority. Relying on structuring innovative tools, it is implementing a health care&#xD;
      appropriateness assessment and support programme (&quot;sPREAd pertinence&quot;). This programme&#xD;
      comprises two parts, one regarding interventional aspects and the other concerning&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sPREAd-Pertinence programme's objectives Project's primary objective is to evaluate programme&#xD;
      effectiveness on the improvement of care appropriateness in hospital university centre of&#xD;
      Bordeaux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project's secondary objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess impact on specific care appropriateness indicators, care related adverse&#xD;
           events frequency, organizational climate and work life satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the actual use of GAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to measure the costs of implementing the sPREAD Perti program and to identify the&#xD;
           additional costs incurred in comparison with the mobilization and support approach to&#xD;
           care appropriateness already existing at the Bordeaux University Hospital;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to compare the costs of the program with the consequences observed in terms of specific&#xD;
           care appropriateness improvement, changes in serious adverse events frequency,&#xD;
           organizational work climate and work life satisfaction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to estimate, if necessary, in terms of avoided costs, the reduction of serious adverse&#xD;
           events frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify, using a qualitative approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The determinants of programme acceptability and efficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The appropriation by professionals of the mobilization and support program&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The impact of the program on professional practices: changes in practices and&#xD;
                perceived effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The conditions for programme transferability with a view to producing an&#xD;
                Operational Model for the Implementation of Appropriateness at a Healthcare&#xD;
                Institution Study design The project is based on a mixed method approach. Study&#xD;
                design for the quantitative part is a Stepped-Wedge cluster randomized controlled&#xD;
                trial, completed by a control group not receiving the intervention. The clusters&#xD;
                are the clinical services of the Bordeaux University Hospital. Up to six volunteer&#xD;
                clinical services will be randomly selected to determine the order in which they&#xD;
                will start the implementation of the intervention. A control group will be made up&#xD;
                of clinical services that meet the inclusion criteria and do not belong to the&#xD;
                group of six participating services. The control group will receive the usual&#xD;
                support for improving the appropriateness of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative section of the project will analyse the mechanisms of program effectiveness using&#xD;
      an exploratory approach based on semi-structured interviews and direct observations of PAG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global proportion of patient stays appropriate regarding health cares concerned with feedback&#xD;
      indicators available at the start of the trial.&#xD;

    <description>Dimension Scores of the Comet (&quot;Contexte Organisationnel et Managérial en Etablissement de santé&quot; / Organizational and Managerial Context in Healthcare Establishments) questionnaire measuring the Organizational Climate (for each dimension, proportion of professionals giving the answers &quot;completely agree&quot; or &quot;agree&quot;);</description>

    <measure>Work life satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>two months before and fourteen months after applying the programme in the first cluster.</time_frame>
    <description>Work life satisfaction score measured by the validated ESVP (&quot;Echelle de Satisfaction globale de Vie Professionnelle&quot; / global professional life satisfaction scale) questionnaire. It consists of 5 items and assesses the overall satisfaction of individuals with their work life. This score is calculated by summing the responses to each of the 5 items. The answers materialize a position on a scale of agreement going from &quot;1&quot; (Not at all in agreement) to &quot;7&quot; (Totally in agreement). The possible range of scores on this scale can thus oscillate from 5 (low satisfaction) to 35 (high satisfaction). The higher the score, the greater the perceived satisfaction with work life.</description>
