    <textblock>
      This study is a 16-week intent-to-treat randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 120 suicidal&#xD;
      juvenile justice (JJ)-involved transition-age (TA) youth (age 15-21 years) and a primary&#xD;
      caregiver (dyads). Dyads will be randomly assigned to iKinnect2.0 (n=60 dyads) or Life360&#xD;
      (control app) plus an electronic suicide resources brochure (n=60 dyads). This design will&#xD;
      test IKinnect2.0's new features for suicide prevention against TA youth awareness of and&#xD;
      access to high-quality suicide prevention resources, while simultaneously testing features&#xD;
      relating to conduct problems and parent management against parents knowing the TA youth's&#xD;
      whereabouts in real-time and controlling for dyad member engagement in technology (Life360).&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at baseline, 4, 8 and 16 weeks. Primary youth-reported outcomes&#xD;
      relating to suicide risk include: Suicidal behaviors (ideation, planning, attempts),&#xD;
      non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors, self-efficacy in coping with distress, and use of&#xD;
      imminent distress coping strategies (behavioral skills, use of crisis stabilization plan).&#xD;
      Youth will also report on their criminal behavior. Primary caregiver-reported outcome&#xD;
      variables relating to youth suicide include: Self-efficacy in applying family-based&#xD;
      suicide-prevention strategies and reported use of those strategies; caregivers will also&#xD;
      report on their own functioning (efficacy/confidence in parenting skills, life stress), TA&#xD;
      youth functioning (internalizing and externalizing symptoms), parental management behaviors&#xD;
      (expectation clarity, parental monitoring, discipline effectiveness/consistency, use of&#xD;
      rewards), and parent-youth relationship quality (communication, conflict, support). App&#xD;
      satisfaction and use of technology outcomes (i.e., degree of app usage, features used) will&#xD;
      be examined and reported descriptively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this 33-month Fast Track study is to significantly expand iKinnect, an&#xD;
      efficacious paired mobile app that supports parents (in delivering) and youth (in receiving)&#xD;
      evidence-based techniques to reduce youth problem behaviors such as delinquency and drug use.&#xD;
      iKinnect2.0 will be expanded to also prevent non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), suicidal&#xD;
      behaviors, and death by suicide in juvenile justice (JJ) involved youth while continuing to&#xD;
      prevent criminal recidivism. iKinnect was originally designed based on Multisystemic Therapy&#xD;
      (MST) principles to help youth with serious conduct problems. Results from a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT; N=72) demonstrated its efficacy in reducing externalizing behaviors&#xD;
      and improving parent effectiveness. This project seeks to significantly expand iKinnect to&#xD;
      prevent NSSI, suicidal behaviors (ideation, planning, attempts), and death by suicide in&#xD;
      JJ-involved transition age (TA) youth while continuing to decrease externalizing behaviors&#xD;
      and prevent recidivism. Usability and acceptability testing will be conducted to test new&#xD;
      features with target end-users (youth and their parents/guardians) and key stakeholders&#xD;
      (probation officers, parole/re-entry officers, administrators, people with lived experience).&#xD;
      Once usability and acceptability is achieved, an eight-week pilot will be conducted to test&#xD;
      study procedures followed by a 16-week randomized controlled trial comparing iKinnect2.0 to&#xD;
      an active control mobile app. We expect that iKinnect2.0 participants will report a&#xD;
      significantly greater decrease in youths' suicidal, NSSI, and conduct-problem behaviors, and&#xD;
      less recidivism. Furthermore, iKinnect2.0 participants will report significantly greater use&#xD;
      of behavioral skills and suicide prevention strategies (TA youth and parents), and greater&#xD;
      self-efficacy in coping with emotional distress (TA youth). iKinnect2.0 parents will report&#xD;
      greater awareness of and confidence in applying evidence-based strategies to prevent&#xD;
      suicide/NSSI and to support their TA youth through a suicide crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that in comparison to the active control condition, iKinnect participants will&#xD;
      show significantly better outcomes from baseline to the 4, 8, and 16-week assessment points&#xD;
      such that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. iKinnect parents will report greater increases in parenting and suicide prevention&#xD;
           efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. iKinnect youth will report greater decreases in suicidal, NSSI, and delinquent/criminal&#xD;
           behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. iKinnect youth will report greater increases in coping with imminent distress and use of&#xD;
           suicide prevention coping strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. iKinnect parents and youth will report greater increases in clarity of expectations,&#xD;
           parental monitoring, discipline effectiveness, parent consistency, use of rewards, and&#xD;
           positive parent-youth relations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. iKinnect parents will report greater decreases in youth problem behaviors.&#xD;
