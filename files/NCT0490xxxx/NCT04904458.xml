  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of body image can be described as &quot;the intentional content of consciousness&#xD;
      comprising perceptions, attitudes and beliefs relating to one's body&quot;. Over the years, there&#xD;
      has been a growing interest in this topic, highlighting that body image can be distorted in&#xD;
      people suffering from pain conditions, especially in the case of chronic pain. One way of&#xD;
      modulating the perception of pain through the perception of body image is through the use of&#xD;
      interventions based on visual feedback. In this regard, some studies have highlighted the&#xD;
      possibility of reducing the perception of pain in healthy and clinical populations with the&#xD;
      use of &quot;illusions&quot; of one's own body created through immersive virtual reality. For example,&#xD;
      through the use of synchronous visual-tactile multisensory stimulation on one's own face /&#xD;
      body and on that of others (fake body), is possible to induce illusions of self-recognition&#xD;
      in other fake bodies. In the case of the face, this type of illusion of belonging of other&#xD;
      faces is commonly known as the &quot;enfacement illusion&quot;, through which is possible to change or&#xD;
      modulate the self-representation, with important implications for all those subjects who have&#xD;
      distorted body representations, such as patients suffering from chronic pain. The main goal&#xD;
      of the present protocol is to evaluate the effects of an experimental treatment based on&#xD;
      enfacement illusion on the perception of pain (VAS scale) with respect to a control condition&#xD;
      (pleasant virtual environment exposure). The secondary objective is to study any correlations&#xD;
      between pain and body image, personal, clinical and psychological intrapersonal variables.&#xD;
      One-hundred patients with chronic headache will be randomly assigned to the two conditions:&#xD;
      experimental group (based on the &quot;enfacement illusion&quot;) and control group (exposed to a&#xD;
      pleasant virtual environment). Both conditions include an immersive virtual reality treatment&#xD;
      of 3 sessions of 15 minutes each, during one week.&#xD;

      The concept of body image can be described as &quot;the intentional content of consciousness&#xD;
      comprising perceptions, attitudes and beliefs relating to one's body&quot;. Over the years, there&#xD;
      has been a growing interest in this topic, highlighting that body image can be distorted in&#xD;
      people with pain, especially in the case of chronic pain. In the context of migraine, some&#xD;
      studies have shown that the perception of pain can alter both the facial recognition capacity&#xD;
      and the visuospatial perception compared to healthy subjects. Furthermore, other studies have&#xD;
      shown that by reducing the altered perception of body image in patients with migraine&#xD;
      associated with overuse of drugs, it is possible to induce beneficial effects on their&#xD;
      affective state and on the perception of pain. One way to modify the perception of pain&#xD;
      through the perception of the body image consists in the use of interventions based on visual&#xD;
      feedback. Other studies have also highlighted the possibility of reducing the perception of&#xD;
      pain in healthy and clinical populations with the use of &quot;illusions&quot; of one's body created&#xD;
      through immersive virtual reality. In a pilot study conducted at IRCCS Mondino, the effect of&#xD;
      different visual feedback conditions (facial expressions): positive, neutral, negative and&#xD;
      white screen (control condition) on the modulation of pain perception in a sample of 38&#xD;
      patients with chronic migraine, demonstrated that the observation of a positive emotional&#xD;
      face stimuli, when compared to other conditions, decreased their pain perception. Further,&#xD;
      other studies demonstrated that the use of synchronous visual-tactile multisensory&#xD;
      stimulation on one's face / body and on that of others (fake body) is able to induce&#xD;
      illusions of self-recognition toward the others body part. This illusion of belonging of&#xD;
      other faces thus created is known as &quot;enfacement illusion&quot; and seems to be positively&#xD;
      correlated to the empathic traits of the subjects mediated by emotion regulation. Other&#xD;
      studies show that the &quot;enfacement illusion&quot; seems to be a good strategy for changing the&#xD;
      self-representation, with important implications for all those subjects who have distorted&#xD;
      body representations, such as patients suffering from chronic pain. This study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate whether through the &quot;enfacement illusion&quot; of representing oneself in a happy face&#xD;
      exposed through an immersive virtual reality system (experimental group) it is possible to&#xD;
      reduce the perception of pain in patients with chronic migraine. This effect would be&#xD;
      mediated by an improved body image and empathy for positive emotions. In order to demonstrate&#xD;
      the effects of the &quot;enfacement illusion&quot; on their own body representation and pain&#xD;
      perception, a control group will be subjected to a positive exposure (pleasant environment)&#xD;
      in an immersive virtual environment, which seems to be able to produce distracting effects on&#xD;
      pain perception in patients with chronic migraine. It is hypothesized that patients with&#xD;
      chronic migraine exposed to the &quot;enfacement illusion&quot; will experience greater pain relief and&#xD;
      improve the perception of their body image compared to the control group. Therefore, the&#xD;
      present study aims to show a possible relationship between the distortion of the body image&#xD;
      and pain perception and, therefore, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the use of&#xD;
      &quot;enfacement illusion&quot; as a cognitive behavioral intervention aimed at alleviating pain in&#xD;
      clinical populations. Patients in the experimental group will be exposed to the &quot;enfacement&#xD;
      illusion&quot; condition, conducted similarly to other studies. In detail, patients will see,&#xD;
      through a virtual reality helmet, a virtual body sitting in front of them with a happy face&#xD;
      expression. Each session will consist of three phases: (1) habituation to the virtual&#xD;
      environment, (2) observation of the virtual facial expression, (3) multisensory stimulations&#xD;
      (visuo-tactile stimulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase (1) habituation to the virtual environment: For approximately 2 minutes the&#xD;
      experimenter will ask patients to describe what they see in the virtual environment, as well&#xD;
      as the virtual body positioned in front of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase (2) observation of facial expression: the experimenter will ask patients to focus&#xD;
      attention on the face of the virtual body sitting in front of them for about 1 minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase (3) multisensory with a brush. The multisensory (visual-tactile) stimulation is&#xD;
      necessary to induce the sensation of belonging to the virtual body, and specifically to&#xD;
      induce the sense of ownership toward the virtual face. The multisensory stimulation will last&#xD;
      for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group of this study, will be exposed to a visual stimulation by observing a&#xD;
      pleasant immersive virtual reality environment for the duration of 5 minutes. As in the&#xD;
      experimental group, in the first 2 minutes of immersion in the virtual environment, the&#xD;
      experimenter will ask the patient to describe the virtual environment. Then, the patients&#xD;
      will be immersed in the virtual environment for about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this frame, the primary goal of this double-blind randomized controlled trial is to assess&#xD;
      whether the &quot;enfacement illusion&quot; of representing oneself (inducing the sense of ownership)&#xD;
      in a happy face through an immersive virtual reality may reduce the perception of pain in&#xD;
      patients with chronic migraine. A secondary goal is to evaluate the effects on the perception&#xD;
      of one's body image and on the affective and emotional state of a treatment based on&#xD;
      &quot;enfacement illusion&quot; with respect to a control condition. Both treatment protocols consist&#xD;
      of 3 session/week, 15 minutes/day, of the virtual reality enfacement illusion exposure vs&#xD;
      pleasant virtual environment exposure. Female patients with chronic migraine accomplishing&#xD;
      the clinical characteristics included in the ICHD-III version for chronic migraine, with pain&#xD;
      perception between 20 and 80 on a 0-100 visual analogue scale will be recruited from Headache&#xD;
      Science center Unit of IRCCS Mondino Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo the following assessment measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre / post treatment (T0-T1): all subjects will be assessed as regards their affective and&#xD;
      emotional state with: Body Satisfaction Scale (BSS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale&#xD;
      (HADS), Emotive Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) , and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation&#xD;
      Scale (DERS), Pain-Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Body Image Questionnaire (BIQ), and Positive&#xD;
      and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre / post visual exposure session: all subjects will be assessed with the Pain-Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale (VAS), Body Image Questionnaire (BIQ) and Positive and Negative Affect&#xD;
      Schedule (PANAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each visual exposure session: the patients of the experimental group will fill in a&#xD;
      questionnaire relating to the level of sense of belonging (embodiment) of the virtual body.&#xD;
      The control group will fill out a questionnaire relating to the level of immersion in the&#xD;
      virtual environment.&#xD;
