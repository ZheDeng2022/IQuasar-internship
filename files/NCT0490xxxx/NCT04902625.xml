  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although bariatric surgery is currently the most effective treatment for morbid obesity,&#xD;
      weight regain occurs in 16-37% of the patients (1). Weight regain is not regularly treated&#xD;
      with antiobesity medications (AOMs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mysimba (Contrave in US) is a AOM, it is a combination of naltrexone hydrochloride extended&#xD;
      release and bupropion hydrochloride extended release for the treatment of obesity, and is&#xD;
      used with lifestyle modification. Bupropion is a mild reuptake inhibitor of dopamine and&#xD;
      norepinephrine. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist has minimum effect on weight loss on its&#xD;
      own. Naltrexone is thought to block the inhibitory effects of opioid receptors activated by&#xD;
      the β-endorphin released in the hypothalamus that stimulates feeding, thus allowing the&#xD;
      inhibitory effects of α-melanocyte stimulating hormone to reduce food intake. In patients&#xD;
      with obesity usage of Naltrexone/Bupropion (NB) results in up to 8.2% weight loss (2). There&#xD;
      is some evidence that also in bariatric patients with weight regain NB leads to additional&#xD;
      weight loss (3, 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Nederlandse Obesitas Kliniek (NOK) weight regain at follow-up is currently treated&#xD;
      with the Back on Track (BOT) program. The BOT program is an extra intervention our clinic&#xD;
      provides for the patients who have weight regain after surgery, this is part of our standard&#xD;
      care program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to study the effect of naltrexone/bupropion in combination with the&#xD;
      BOT module on successful weight loss(&gt;5% weight loss) after 22 weeks in patients with weight&#xD;
      regain after bariatric surgery, compared to the regular BOT module.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Throughout the years it has become clear that lifestyle intervention is the cornerstone for&#xD;
      all types of bariatric treatment. Educating patients about behaviour, physical activity and&#xD;
      intake strategies will help built a skills set, which patients can fall back on throughout&#xD;
      their lives. Without additional lifestyle intervention a non-surgical, pharmacological or&#xD;
      surgical treatment will be less effective. (5, 6) Besides lifestyle interventions, adjuvant&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment has also proven to be effective in maintaining adequate weight&#xD;
      loss. Pharmacological treatment is mostly performed in patients who are not eligible for&#xD;
      bariatric surgery but do suffer from obesity and related comorbidities. Patients with a Body&#xD;
      Mass Index(BMI) of ≥ 30kg/m2 or a BMI ≥ 27kg/m2 with an obesity-related comorbidity are&#xD;
      advised to use pharmacological treatment. (7) In general the pharmacologic treatment affects&#xD;
      appetite and therefore causes weight loss, provided that lifestyle interventions are added to&#xD;
      the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with a BMI of ≥ 40kg/m2 or a BMI ≥ 35kg/m2 with comorbid conditions bariatric&#xD;
      surgery is advised. There is a variety of surgical treatment options, with Sleeve Gastrectomy&#xD;
      (SG) and the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) being the most common. (8) An alteration of the&#xD;
      gastro-intestinal tract is performed, which causes a change in gut hormones, bile acids and&#xD;
      microbiota. These changes also have their effect on appetite and energy consumption causing&#xD;
      an even higher weight reduction. (9) Although lifestyle interventions are the cornerstone of&#xD;
      obesity treatment, bariatric surgery has proven to be a superior treatment. (9-11) Besides a&#xD;
      positive effect on weight, bariatric surgery also has a positive effect on comorbidities,&#xD;
      such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cancer incidence, cardiovascular events and&#xD;
      cardiovascular deaths. (9, 10, 12-14) All in all we can state that bariatric surgery&#xD;
      currently is the most effective treatment for patients suffering from morbid obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment, not all patients maintain&#xD;
      their weight loss. As mentioned before weight regain occurs in 16-37% of the patients. (1)&#xD;
      Currently these patients can be treated in our clinic with an extra module, the Back On Track&#xD;
      (BOT) module. The BOT module consists of 4 extra sessions, 3 with the physiotherapist,&#xD;
      psychologist or dietitian, and 1 with the medical doctor. During these sessions lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications will once again be the main focus. A study performed with data from our own&#xD;
      clinic shows an overall stabilisation of weight after this module. The regained weight will&#xD;
      not be lost with the help of this module. Therefore other options should be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the possibilities is the use of medication, in combination with lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions (BOT module), to not only cause stabilisation of weight, but also weight loss&#xD;
      at the end of our module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological therapy with other medication in post-bariatric patients is described to be a&#xD;
      viable option. As described in the review performed by Sudlow et al, different medical&#xD;
      options are being investigated. (15) At the moment most research has been focussing on&#xD;
      pre-operative use of medication. In this review only four out of 20 studies described&#xD;
      post-operative use of medication. Of these four only two studies researched the effect of&#xD;
      naltrexone and bupropion combined in post-bariatric patients. Although these studies only&#xD;
      have a small amount of participants (e.g. n=10), they do show a possible positive effect on&#xD;
      weight loss. (3, 4, 15) Since there is a lack of research on the effect of pharmacotherapy as&#xD;
      an addition to lifestyle interventions in post-bariatric patients, no clear guidelines can be&#xD;
      created at the moment. (16)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mysimba (Contrave in US) is Anti-Obesity Medication (AOM), it is a combination of naltrexone&#xD;
      hydrochloride extended release and bupropion hydrochloride extended release. Naltrexone,&#xD;
      mostly used for treatment of alcohol and opioid dependence, is thought to block the&#xD;
      inhibitory effects of opioid receptors activated by the β-endorphin released in the&#xD;
      hypothalamus that stimulates feeding, thus allowing the inhibitory effects of α-melanocyte&#xD;
      stimulating hormone to reduce food intake. Bupropion is a mild reuptake inhibitor of dopamine&#xD;
      and norepinephrine, which is used for treatment of depression and later for smoking&#xD;
      cessation. On their own the effect on weight loss is minimal, when combined their effect on&#xD;
      weight loss is synergistically positive. When combined with lifestyle interventions most&#xD;
      successful results will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with obesity usage of Naltrexone/Bupropion (NB) has a stronger effect and results&#xD;
      in up to 8.2% weight loss (2). A study performed by Apovian shows a significant difference in&#xD;
      successful weight loss after 4 weeks, when comparing patients who use NB to patients with&#xD;
      only lifestyle modifications. Their study had a follow-up period of 56 weeks with a extra&#xD;
      measure timepoint at 28 weeks. All patients were measured and monitored every 4 weeks. The&#xD;
      results at 4 weeks already showed a significant difference with the placebo group. (2)&#xD;
      Furthermore, in a study conducted by Greenway et al after 16 weeks of follow up a significant&#xD;
      difference in successful weight loss was observed. (17) So far not many studies have been&#xD;
      conducted in post-bariatric patients. Even though the results thus far are scarce, they are&#xD;
      promising. Two studies, both with a study population of 10, showed a positive result of&#xD;
      around 5% more weight loss in post-bariatric patients. (3, 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will examine the effect of 2 tablets of Mysimba 8/90mg 2 times daily as&#xD;
      addition to the Back On Track module for patients with weight regain after bariatric surgery.&#xD;
