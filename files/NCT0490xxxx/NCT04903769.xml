  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SMART-PD is an 8-session program designed to decrease the physiological, emotional, cognitive&#xD;
      and behavioral effects of stress in participants with Parkinson's disease and their&#xD;
      caregivers by teaching cognitive-behavioral techniques and relaxation skills to help&#xD;
      participants learn to elicit the relaxation response, alter cognitive appraisals, improve&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle behaviors and access social support. The SMART program has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective for reducing mental health symptoms such as depression and anxiety as well as&#xD;
      physical symptoms such as pain and in promoting positive health behaviors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study sponsored by the Parkinson's Foundation designed to measure&#xD;
      the feasibility, acceptability, and initial impact of the SMART-PD program on participants&#xD;
      with a recent (less than five years) diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and their caregivers.&#xD;
      This program provides information and tools to help patients and their caregivers cope with&#xD;
      the new PD diagnosis and manage the stress and negative mental health symptoms (such as&#xD;
      anxiety and depression) associated with the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMART-PD is a manualized 8-week intervention that teaches cognitive-behavioral techniques and&#xD;
      relaxation skills to help participants learn to elicit the relaxation response, alter&#xD;
      cognitive appraisals, improve healthy lifestyle behaviors (i.e., sleep, nutrition, physical&#xD;
      activity) and access social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take baseline and follow-up questionnaires to ascertain the impact of the&#xD;
      program on outcomes such as quality of life, emotional health, coping skills, and healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle behaviors.&#xD;

    <measure>SMART Group Feedback Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Designed to assess the accessibility of the SMART-PD program, The SMART Group Feedback form contains six Likert-scale questions such as, &quot;On a 10-point scale, how would you rate the following items: helpfulness/effectiveness of SMART group&quot; and four open-ended questions such as, &quot;What has been the most helpful part of the group for you?&quot;</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline General Quality of Life at 1-week post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a quality of life measure that assesses eight aspects of health through the use of 36 multiple choice, yes/no, and Likert-scale items. An example question is, &quot;Compared to one year ago, how would you rate your health in general now?&quot; The SF-36 consists of eight scales (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health). Scores are converted into z-scores with a scale of 0-100 with 0 indicating the greatest level of disability and 100 the least.</description>

    <description>The Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39) consists of 39 Likert-scale questions asking how often in the last month the participant experienced something due to having Parkinson's disease. An example question is, &quot;Had difficulty doing leisure activities which you would like to do?&quot; with response options for all questions being &quot;never&quot;, &quot;occasionally&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, &quot;Often&quot;, and &quot;always or cannot do at all&quot;. The overall score from the PDQ-39 can be used for a global assessment, and scores can also be broken down into the following individual scales: mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, social support, cognitions, communications and bodily discomfort.</description>
