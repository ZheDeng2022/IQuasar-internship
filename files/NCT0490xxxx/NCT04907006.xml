The subjects in both groups will be fasted within 4 hours after taking the medicine, and drinking water is forbidden within 1 hour before and after taking the medicine.&#xD;

          -  From one month before the informed consent to three months after the last medication,&#xD;
             the subjects and their partners had no plans to have a child, take effective&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  In the past, there were serious systematic diseases or family history (including&#xD;
             cardiovascular system, digestive system, urinary system, etc.), the researchers judged&#xD;
             that the disease status could significantly change the absorption, distribution,&#xD;
             metabolism and excretion of the drug used in the trial, or the risk of the subjects&#xD;
             would be increased by taking the trial drug.&#xD;
