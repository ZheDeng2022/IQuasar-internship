      The goal of the present study is to assess the safety of a topical probiotic (probiotic&#xD;
      strain; SS-POR11) on acne prone-skin, and the impact of SS-POR11 on the distribution of&#xD;
      porphyrins, in subjects with mild-to-moderate acne [Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA)&#xD;
      1-3].&#xD;
