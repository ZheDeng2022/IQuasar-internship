  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus (POI) is one of the most common causes of prolonged hospital stays after&#xD;
      abdominal surgery. The pathophysiology of POI is multifactorial and complex.It is known to be&#xD;
      associated with sympathetic neural reflexes,local and systemic inflammatory mediators,and&#xD;
      changes invarious neural and hormonal transmitters.Sympathetic (adrenergic) hyperactivity&#xD;
      results in reduction of propulsive motility,and an increase in sphinctertone.Parasympathetic&#xD;
      (cholinergic) hypoactivity results in adecrease in gastrointestinalmotility. Various agents&#xD;
      called prokinetic drugs,including erythromycin, metoclopramide, cholinergic agents have been&#xD;
      assessed in an effort to improved gastrointestinal motility. Mosapridecitrate is another&#xD;
      prokinetic drug that selectively activates 5-HT4 receptors. Mosapride stimulates serotonin&#xD;
      receptor in the digestive tract and increases acetylcholine release to promote upper&#xD;
      digestive tract (stomach and duodenum) and lower digestive tract (colon) motility and gastric&#xD;
      emptying without cardiac side effects. We therefore investigate the effect of mosapride on&#xD;
      postoperative gastrointestinal motility after open and laparoscopic colectomy in a&#xD;
      prospective randomized, controlled study in patients under going colectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective blinded (participants,researchers,investigators) randomizedcontrolledtrial&#xD;
      (RCT) is aimed to study the efficacy of the prokinetic agents, specifically, Mosapride on&#xD;
      gastrointestinal recovery in patients under going colorectal cancer surgery. The patients are&#xD;
      divided into two groups and each group will receive oral Mosapride and placebo,respectively.&#xD;
      The primary outcome is to study the efficacy of Mosapride compared with placebo on&#xD;
      gastrointestinal recovery in patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were randomly assigned to receive mosapride (22patients) or to serve as&#xD;
      placebo (22patients). Patients first were randomly assigned to one of the two groups. The&#xD;
      mosapride group received 15 mg of mosapride by mouth or feeding via NG with 50 ml of water&#xD;
      three times a day, starting on the morning of postoperative day 1, until hospital discharge&#xD;
      or for a maximum of 10 postoperative days if the patient remained hospitalized. The control&#xD;
      group received15 mg of placebo drug with 50ml of water on the same schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral feeding was allowed when the first bowel sound and the first passage of flatus was came.&#xD;
      A clear liquid diet is the first postoperative meal. If patient well tolerated, next step&#xD;
      diet was applied (full liquid diet, soft diet, regular diet). Patients were discharged when&#xD;
      the following criteria were fulfilled: 1) regular diet was tolerated without discomfort; 2)&#xD;
      bowel movements had returned; and 3) body temperature was normal, with no major complications&#xD;
      present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration on first time bowel movement or first passage of flatus, postoperative hospital&#xD;
      stay and adverse effects will be evaluated. The This trial was designed to have 90 percent&#xD;
      power to detect a 20 percent decrease in median postoperative time to the first of bowel&#xD;
      movement at a significance level of 5 percent. The necessary patient accrual to detect this&#xD;
      difference was determined to be 20 patients per group and 10 % drop off was calculated so the&#xD;
      totally patient was 22 patients per groups.&#xD;
