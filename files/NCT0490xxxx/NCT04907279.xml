      To characterize the real-life clinical use of AOM in a hospitalized patient population with&#xD;
      schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or BP1 requiring LAI therapy and evaluate its&#xD;
      short-term effectiveness associated with its clinical use in the proposed patient population,&#xD;
      including time to discharge, efficacy, safety, tolerability, and patients' satisfaction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, Canadian, prospective multi-site study in schizophrenia,&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder and BP1 among in-patients treated with AOM at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician and followed for the duration of their hospital stay. With the objective&#xD;
      of characterizing the real-life, in-patient clinical uses of AOM, this study will not impose&#xD;
      any treatments outside of what is recommended by the attending physician. As such, only&#xD;
      patients admitted into hospital and prescribed AOM as a part of their physician's treatment&#xD;
      recommendation will be included in this study. Study assessments and administration of&#xD;
      questionnaires will be limited to baseline measurements occurring within the first 72 hours&#xD;
      of AOM administration and at the end of study participation. All patients will be treated&#xD;
      with AOM at the dose that is as per the treating physician's judgment. The decision to treat&#xD;
      the patient with AOM must be reached independently and in advance of recruitment in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
