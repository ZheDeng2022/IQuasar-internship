    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial study aims to investigate the impact of home-based&#xD;
      differential learning on tooth brushing, in particular on the reduction of plaque and&#xD;
      maintenance of gingival health in children aged 3 to 8 years, compared to the habitual tooth&#xD;
      brushing and instruction/demonstration tooth brushing learning method.&#xD;

      This two-parallel arm single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial will be undertaken at&#xD;
      the Department of Preventive and Pediatric Dentistry at the University of Greifswald. The&#xD;
      examination of the patient will be undertaken in a dental chair set up using standard&#xD;
      infection control guidelines for a dental examination used at the department. The allocation&#xD;
      of the patients to the two groups will be done through asking the patients to pick up an&#xD;
      envelope randomly from a box which contains the information and explanation for home&#xD;
      brushing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first visit, the baseline dental examination and patient acceptance survey will be&#xD;
      done to comprehensively assess each participant's oral health status, their oral hygiene&#xD;
      status, caries experience and periodontal condition will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess oral hygiene status we will use plaque index (PI) (Quigley Hein, 1972) on a scale&#xD;
      of 0 to 5. Dental caries experience will be recorded by counting the numbers of teeth that&#xD;
      are decayed (dt/DT), missing due to caries (mt/MT), and filled (ft/FT) to generate a&#xD;
      dmft/DMFT score. Periodontal condition will be recorded using the papillary bleeding index&#xD;
      Index (PBI) on a scale of 0 to 4. One trained and calibrated examiner will perform the&#xD;
      clinical examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study and its objectives will be explained to the patients. For the control group,&#xD;
      regular instructions and advice will be provided as in any regular prophylaxis session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the test group, the exercises and movements to be performed when brushing the teeth will&#xD;
      be explained. The patients in both groups will be also provided with explanation leaflet with&#xD;
      the exercises and a free toothbrush. There will be no restriction on the type of the&#xD;
      fluoridated toothpaste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training sheet will include the following exercises:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tooth brushing while lying down.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tooth brushing with one eye covered (i.e. with the hand).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tooth brushing wearing large gloves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tooth brushing with the non-dominant hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tooth brushing using both hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Different sequence of tooth brushing compared to the practical demonstration (i.e.&#xD;
           starting with cleaning the lingual surface instead of occlusal surface).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tooth brushing while both eyes are closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tooth brushing with an obstruction on the elbow of the dominant hand (i.e. wraps a piece&#xD;
           of cloth/ scarf around the elbow).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tooth brushing while watching 3-5 minutes video (i.e. using YouTube). The parent/ child&#xD;
           will be requested to perform each exercise one time a day for 3 days in a row before&#xD;
           moving to the next exercise. All parent/ child will be asked to do the exercises in the&#xD;
           same sequence. After completing the exercise for each day, children will be asked to put&#xD;
           a sticker in the calendar table, which will be provided to them as a motivation to&#xD;
           perform the exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 2 follow-ups; the first follow-up after one month will include dental&#xD;
      re-examination, using the same methods and criteria as the baseline examination as well as a&#xD;
      questionnaire for the parents to assess their experience and acceptance of the used method.&#xD;
      The second follow-up will be after 3 months and it will include dental re-examination, using&#xD;
      the same methods and criteria as the baseline examination.&#xD;
