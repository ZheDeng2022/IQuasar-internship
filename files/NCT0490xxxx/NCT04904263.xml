      platform where clinicians from all over the world can request advice from a group of experts&#xD;
      on the field of Cancer and Pregnancy. The platform will contain different national advisory&#xD;
      boards, with their own coordinator and members, as well as an overarching international&#xD;
      advisory board with an international coordinator and members from different national boards.&#xD;

      Clinicians can fill in a format (attached) requesting for advice, using only pseudonymized&#xD;
      patient data after agreeing a disclaimer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information filled in in the 'request advice' format needs to be regarded as anonymous or&#xD;
      pseudonymous data. We recommend you to inform your patient and ask for approval when needed,&#xD;
      based on the rules and regulations applicable in your country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The filled out request will be sent to the specific national board of their own country, and&#xD;
      if no national board is available, to the overarching international board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . To investigate the impact of this platform, a year after its launch, data regarding the&#xD;
      incoming requests will be extracted from the website, as well as all recommendation letters.&#xD;
