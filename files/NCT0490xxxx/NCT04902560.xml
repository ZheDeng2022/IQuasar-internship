  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexual health centers (CeGIDD, in France) manage the majority of STI in France, especially&#xD;
      gonorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients wanting STI screening can consult either they are symptomatic or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If they are symptomatic, they can be treated immediately. If they are not symptomatic, they&#xD;
      must come back seven days after in order to get their results and to be treated if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before any treatment for gonorrhea, subjects should be sampled for bacterial culture in order&#xD;
      to perform AMR surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After every treatment for gonorrhea, subjects should realized a test of cure (TOC) according&#xD;
      to current recommandation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response rate to ceftriaxone 1g IM for treating gonorrhea has never been evaluated in France&#xD;
      while being used widely over the past months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance to current recommandation at CeGIDD Montpellier has never been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the response rate to ceftriaxone 1g IM as gonorrhea treatment by&#xD;
      realizing a test of cure 14 days after each treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Patient compliance may be lacking in sexual health center and non-compliance participate in STI spreading.&#xD;
Subject not looking for their results after being tested positive for gonorrhea will be notified by phone call. The necessity of calling the patient will be notified in the study.&#xD;
If the subject does not attend the medical consultation for treatment, he will be consider as lost to follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Rate of realized TOC</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Test of cure (TOC) is a PCR test realized at the previous positive site of contamination, approximately 14 days after treatment, in order to confirm the efficacity of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Rate of time before realizing the TOC.</measure>
