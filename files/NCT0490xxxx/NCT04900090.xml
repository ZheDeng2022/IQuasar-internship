  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gout is a chronic disease caused by the deposit of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in body&#xD;
      tissues secondary to hyperuricemia. Patients with gout suffer severe attacks of acute joint&#xD;
      pain. As the disease progresses, the joint pain becomes chronic and associated with disabling&#xD;
      and deformative manifestations called tophus. This disease is strongly associated with&#xD;
      several comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney failure. Gout is a&#xD;
      very common disease, which is affecting 0.9% of the adult population in France and nearly 4%&#xD;
      of the North-American population. Data from New Zealand show a particularly high prevalence&#xD;
      of gout among Polynesians (minority populations in New Zealand and other islands of the South&#xD;
      Pacific) that would be explained by genetic susceptibility and frequently interrelated&#xD;
      metabolic diseases. Data on the Polynesian population in New Caledonia suggest prevalence&#xD;
      figures close to 7% and prevalence in French Polynesia is assumed to be higher. International&#xD;
      genomic studies of gout and hyperuricaemia have identified alleles associated with the&#xD;
      occurrence of gout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to focus on families with several gouty members (numerous in French Polynesia, and&#xD;
      geographically clustered) in order to enable the study of individuals with monogenic gout or&#xD;
      with a low number of variants (= cases) determining in the occurrence of gout, as well as a&#xD;
      non-gouty family member (= controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual-energy CT scan (DECT) allows identification and quantification of UMS crystal deposits&#xD;
      in the tissue. The volume of crystals correlates not only with the inflammatory activity of&#xD;
      the disease but also with the comorbidities that complicate it. Dual-energy scanning has&#xD;
      shown the presence of UMS crystals in some hyperuricemic individuals, which could help to&#xD;
      identify those individuals most at risk of developing the disease as they already have the&#xD;
      stigma of sub-clinical inflammatory activity.&#xD;

    <description>Genome-wide association study (GWAS) aims at identifying genetic variants (genotype) that associated with specific traits (phenotype).&#xD;
The link between the genetic variants and the stage of the disease will be sought using a bivariate analysis: Chi-2 tests or Fisher's exact tests in case of small numbers will be implemented</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multiple correlation between disease stage, comorbidities, environmental and metabolomics data</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The link between variants will be stablish using a multivariate logistic regression model.- The comorbidities analysed are the following: initial uraemia, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), hypertension, chronic heart failure, diabetes, obesity (BMI &gt; 30), obliterative arterial disease of the lower limbs, history of myocardial infarction, history of cerebrovascular accident&#xD;
- The environmental data analysed were as follows: habitus data (alcohol consumption, soft drinks, physical activity)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multiple correlation between severity of gout, its impact (pain, disease impact, and quality of life), presence of certain genetic variants, metabolomic changes and comorbidities</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The link between variants will be stablish using a multivariate logistic regression model. Quality of life will be assessed by the EuroQol questionnaire; perception of hyperuricemia-related illness by the Brief Hyperuricemia Perceptions Questionnaire (BIPQ); body and foot pain in the previous week by a VAS out of 100; activity limitations by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-II); foot pain and disability by the Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Index (MFPDI).</description>

    <measure>Multiple correlation between genetic variants, comorbidities, environmental factors, presence of gout</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The link between variants will be stablish using a multivariate logistic regression model. Health status will be assessed by the following elements:&#xD;
Perceived health status: good (modalities &quot;very good&quot; and &quot;good&quot;) / bad (&quot;average&quot;, &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;very bad&quot;)&#xD;
Total number of visits to a health professional in the last 12 monthsThe presence of gout will be determined using a calculation combining and weighting different responses to the questionnaires.&#xD;
The diagnosis of gout is retained if the patient meets the 2015 ACR/EULAR criteria for diagnostic classification of gout.</description>
