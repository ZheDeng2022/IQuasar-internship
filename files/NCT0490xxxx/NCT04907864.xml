      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer Cachexia (CC) is a multi-factorial process characterized by progressive weight loss,&#xD;
      muscle mass and fat tissue wasting, and adversely affecting their quality of life and&#xD;
      survival in patients with advanced stage of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Megestrol acetate (MA), which can help maintain body weight in advanced cancer patients, has&#xD;
      not been proven to be effective in improving quality of life or lean body mass. Furthermore,&#xD;
      its use is often limited due to various adverse event such as Cushing syndrome, adrenal&#xD;
      insufficiency, or thromboembolic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CC has a complex and multi-factorial pathophysiology, and there is no established standard&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis CC is irreversible once it occurs and is also difficult to suppress its&#xD;
      progression with any single treatment modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that a multi-modal intervention comprised of&#xD;
      anti-inflammation, omega-3-fatty acids, oral nutritional supplement with counselling by&#xD;
      nutritionist, physical exercise, psychiatric intervention as well as Bojungikki-tang which&#xD;
      mediates immune-modulation and reverse both of chronic inflammation and wasting condition as&#xD;
      a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) could prevent the development of CC or improve&#xD;
      the CC in advanced cancer patients during chemotherapy compared to those who received usual&#xD;
      supportive.&#xD;

For the raw score, less points are considered to have a better outcome.&#xD;
The EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3) uses for the questions 29 and 30 a 7-points scale. The scale scores from 1 to 7: 1 (&quot;very poor&quot;) to 7 (&quot;excellent&quot;). Half points are not allowed. The range is 6. First of all, raw score has to be calculated with mean values. Afterwards linear transformation is performed to be comparable.
