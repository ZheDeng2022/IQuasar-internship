  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of new oculometry techniques allows fine and dynamic measurements of&#xD;
      pupillary diameter and use in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preliminary results obtained with innovative devices on healthy sjuets make it possible&#xD;
      to envisage a clinical study on a population of patients suffering from retinal pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a &quot;proof of concept&quot; study, which, if the expected results are confirmed, will make&#xD;
      it possible to consider a study on a larger population, as well as the industrial development&#xD;
      of a commercial device.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single-head study that will take place at the National Ophthalmology Hospital&#xD;
      Center (CHNO) and the Vision Institute (Streetlab) and the total duration of the study is 24&#xD;
      months .&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to include 60 participants divided into different groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 healthy subjects, called controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 patients with retinitis pigmentosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 patients with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 patients with Stargardt's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be pre-selected on files at the CHNO clinical investigation center based on the&#xD;
      visual assessment carried out on the day of their arrival, the doctor may suggest that they&#xD;
      participate in the study if the inclusion criteria are respected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control subjects will be recruited thanks to the database of the Vision Institute at&#xD;
      Streetlab.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of the right eye / left eye and binocular monocular pupillary reflex: pupillary response measured for 5 seconds with 3 levels of screen luminance, each stimulation will be separated from the next by a delay of 5 seconds</description>

    <measure>RAPD measurement</measure>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Endogenous pupillary oscillation measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Pupil oscillation frequency, for each eye and in binocular: during this test the participants observe the stimulation screen (central fixation point) for 45 seconds during which the lumnance of the screen is calculated to be proportional to the size of the pupil&#xD;
in real time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of pupillary activity by frequency marking</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>This test consists of the simultaneous presentation of 5 areas of the screen, each of which is luminance modulated at a specific frequency.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pupillary measurement of color vision</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>In this test, 2 background colors alternate at low frequency over time.&#xD;
The physical luminance of one color is fixed while the other is adaptively changed during a test to reduce pupillary response.</description>
