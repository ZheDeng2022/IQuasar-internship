    <textblock>
      Use of intracoronary acetylcholine to investigate endothelial function in coronary arteries&#xD;
      treated with either drug coated balloon angioplasty of drug eluting stents.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to establish the differences in vasomotor response of a DCB and DES&#xD;
      treated artery by measurement of the percentage change in coronary surface area pre and post&#xD;
      acetylcholine administration. This will be measured with incremental doses of acetylcholine&#xD;
      at levels both proximally and distally to the site of treatment Also is to see how far&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction may propagate from an interventional site by measuring drug induced&#xD;
      dilatation/constriction as in response to acetylcholine administration. This vasomotor&#xD;
      response will be measured in the target vessel at extended distances from the treated&#xD;
      segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve a meaningful comparison, 34 patients will be recruited of which 17 patients would&#xD;
      form either arm of the study having had either a DCB or DES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital and patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled prior to a second procedure. This may occur immediately after their stent or drug&#xD;
      coated balloon treatment or if they re-attend hospital in the following recruitment period&#xD;
      and this may include patients for a variety of different indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have a scheduled, clinically indicated procedure will be eligible to be&#xD;
      recruited as participants. They must also fulfil the inclusion criteria and not be affected&#xD;
      by any of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the research team will provide the Patient Information Sheet to potential&#xD;
      participants and confirm that they would be happy to be contacted subsequently to discuss the&#xD;
      proposed research. The subsequent contact will be undertaken by a clinical research fellow,&#xD;
      who is both a member of the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital NHS clinical team as well&#xD;
      as the research team, prior to their subsequent visit to discuss the study, answer any&#xD;
      questions and confirm if they fulfil the inclusion criteria. In view of Covid-19, to reduce&#xD;
      in hospital exposure, we might instead opt to send the patient information to the eligible&#xD;
      patients by post, and follow with a telephone call to confirm receipt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Patients will be prepared in the usual way as per clinical practice for their&#xD;
      procedure. They will attend via a standardised case pathway depending on the indication for&#xD;
      repeat angiography (staged procedure versus re-presentation acutely for another reason such&#xD;
      as chest discomfort). There are a series of routine checks performed to ensure that the&#xD;
      patient is on appropriate medications. For the purpose of the study, anti-anginal medications&#xD;
      will need to be stopped for 72 hours prior to the procedure. The anti-anginal medications&#xD;
      that would require cessation include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardio selective Beta 1 selective blockers (Atenolol, Bisoprolol, Carvedilol, Esmolol,&#xD;
           Metoprolol and Nebivolol )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diltiazem&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nicorandil&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isosorbide Nitrate preparations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ranolazine The particular medication regime will vary on a patient to patient basis and&#xD;
           the appropriateness of this and nature of drug cessation will be discussed at the&#xD;
           enrolment process and patients will be given clear instruction on adjustments to their&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary Angiography will be performed as per common clinical practice. At the beginning of&#xD;
      the study portion of the procedure, there will be two orthogonal angiographic views taken of&#xD;
      the treated segment which will then be denoted as the reference views for the rest of the&#xD;
      procedure (used after every administration of agonist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acetylcholine (ACh) will be diluted into 0.9% normal saline at different dilutions (to a&#xD;
      total volume of 5mL). NB - these solutions of Acetylcholine are usable within a two-hour&#xD;
      period, beyond this time a new solution should be used. When reassessing the previously&#xD;
      treated artery, an infusion of intracoronary acetylcholine will be administered via the&#xD;
      guiding catheter. The first ACH infusion (&quot;low dose&quot;) will be 0.182micrograms/mL (10^-6mol/L)&#xD;
      given at a rate of 1Ml/min for two minutes by a mechanical infusion pump (50). After the&#xD;
      infusion, intracoronary contrast will be injected and images acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are no adverse features, the investigator can proceed with the subsequent increments&#xD;
      with each infusion to complete, followed by a five-minute interval. The next increments would&#xD;
      be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;medium dose&quot; 1.82mcg/ml (10^-5mol/L) ACH in 5ml normal saline - given over 20 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;high dose&quot; 18.2mcg/ml (10^-4mol/l) ACH in 5ml normal saline - given over 20 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then after a further five minutes - a bolus dose of GTN (400mcg) will be administered&#xD;
           over 20 seconds and then a further contrast acquisition taken within two minutes. Also&#xD;
           see Appendix C for lab flow chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once these images have been taken, the guide catheter will be removed the procedure will then&#xD;
      be completed in the usual way. The patient with then be moved to the appropriate recovery&#xD;
      area as per the standard protocol following PCI procedures.&#xD;
