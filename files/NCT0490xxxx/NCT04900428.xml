  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind study designed to investigate the efficacy, safety and PK of a single&#xD;
      dose of COVI-DROPS or matched placebo in outpatient adults who have tested positive for&#xD;
      COVID-19 and are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized 2:2:1 to receive a single dose of COVI-DROPS 10 mg, COVI-DROPS 20&#xD;
      mg or matched placebo in a double-blind manner. Investigational product (COVI-DROPS or&#xD;
      matched placebo) will be administered once as two separate 0.5 mL instillations (0.5 mL up&#xD;
      each nostril). Subjects will be followed to Day 60.&#xD;
