  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators research was designed as a single-center, prospective, randomized&#xD;
      double-blind study. The patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery in Istanbul&#xD;
      University Istanbul Medicine Faculty Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology will be&#xD;
      included. Patients or persons who are legally authorized to make decisions on their behalf&#xD;
      will be informed about the research and their written consent will be obtained. Patients who&#xD;
      do not give consent will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given US guided PENG blocks using a 22 gauge 10 mm block needle after&#xD;
      compliance with the rules of asepsia and antisepsis in the supine position according to the&#xD;
      group of patients in which they were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PENG block will be done for postoperative analgesia. After the PENG block, a single dose of&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia will be applied as a regional anesthesia method, in a sitting position,&#xD;
      using the appropriate spinal needle, as is routinely applied in the investigators clinic.&#xD;
      After the block is completed, the pinprick test will be done and the operation will be&#xD;
      started after the successful completion of the block is confirmed. Oxygen will be given to&#xD;
      the patients with a face mask at 4 lt / min throughout the operation. ECG, saturation,&#xD;
      invasive / noninvasive blood pressure monitoring of the patients will be done. Measurements&#xD;
      made at 5-minute intervals will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigators clinic, the use of PENG block and PCA (patient controlled analgesia)&#xD;
      device with intravenous morphine for postoperative analgesia is routinely performed. In this&#xD;
      study, four randomized groups will be formed together with the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local anesthetic solution given by the supervisor, whose doses of local anesthetic are&#xD;
      predetermined (the investigators and participants do not know the dosage), with a total&#xD;
      volume of 20 cc will be used. Local anesthetic agent will not be applied to the control&#xD;
      group. As mentioned above, spinal anesthesia will be performed after PENG block and the&#xD;
      operation will be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain score and total morphine consumption will be determined by visual pain scoring (VAS) at&#xD;
      the postoperative 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48th hours by providing the use of a PCA device with&#xD;
      intravenous morphine applied in routine practice to all four groups. As in routine practice,&#xD;
      when VAS&gt;4 after each interrogation, morphine 0.05 mg/kg iv will be administered as&#xD;
      additional analgesia and the maximum will be increased to 10 mg. Pain management will&#xD;
      continue when VAS &lt;4.&#xD;

      The investigators research was designed as a single-center, prospective, randomized&#xD;
      double-blind study. After the approval of the Ethics Committee, the study will start and is&#xD;
      aimed to be completed in 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery in Istanbul University Istanbul&#xD;
      Medicine Faculty Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology will be included. Patients or&#xD;
      persons who are legally authorized to make decisions on their behalf will be informed about&#xD;
      the research and their written consent will be obtained. Patients who do not give consent&#xD;
      will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated preoperative before surgery, a detailed history will be taken and&#xD;
      physical examination will be carried out. Medical and surgical resume information will be&#xD;
      obtained. Patients' Vas scores will be recorded before the operation. Patients will be taken&#xD;
      to the operating room after premedication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG, pulse oximeter, blood pressure monitoring will be performed in the operating room.&#xD;
      Patients will be given US guided PENG blocks using a 22 gauge 10 mm block needle after&#xD;
      compliance with the rules of asepsia and antisepsis in the supine position according to the&#xD;
      group of patients in which they were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PENG block will be done for postoperative analgesia. After the PENG block, a single dose of&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia will be applied as a regional anesthesia method, in a sitting position,&#xD;
      using the appropriate spinal needle, as is routinely applied in the investigators clinic.&#xD;
      After the block is completed, the pinprick test will be done and the operation will be&#xD;
      started after the successful completion of the block is confirmed. Oxygen will be given to&#xD;
      the patients with a face mask at 4 lt / min throughout the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG, saturation, invasive / noninvasive blood pressure monitoring of the patients will be&#xD;
      done. Measurements made at 5-minute intervals will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigators clinic, the use of PENG block and PCA (patient controlled analgesia)&#xD;
      device with intravenous morphine for postoperative analgesia is routinely performed. In this&#xD;
      study, four randomized groups will be formed together with the control group.&#xD;
      Computer-generated random numbers will be used for simple randomization of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local anesthetic solution given by the supervisor, whose doses of local anesthetic are&#xD;
      predetermined (the investigators and participants do not know the dosage), with a total&#xD;
      volume of 20 cc will be used. Local anesthetic agent will not be applied to the control&#xD;
      group. As mentioned above, spinal anesthesia will be performed after PENG block and the&#xD;
      operation will be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain score and total morphine consumption will be determined by visual pain scoring (VAS) at&#xD;
      the postoperative 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48th hours by providing the use of a PCA device with&#xD;
      intravenous morphine applied in routine practice to all four groups. As in routine practice,&#xD;
      when VAS&gt;4 after each interrogation, morphine 0.05 mg/kg iv will be administered as&#xD;
      additional analgesia and the maximum will be increased to 10 mg. Pain management will&#xD;
      continue when VAS &lt;4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed up in the service for 48 hours postoperatively in routine practice. In&#xD;
      the postoperative period, patients will be evaluated in terms of additional nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, first mobilization time, hospitalization time, amount of morphine consumed and&#xD;
      additional analgesic need, onset time of narcotic analgesic need, preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative in the first month Depression-BECK Score, quadriceps weakness, postop patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and surgical satisfaction. During the procedure, complications such as failed&#xD;
      block, nerve damage, vascular injury, intravenous injection of local anesthetic, local&#xD;
      anesthetic toxicity and allergic reactions will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study, it was determined that at least 84 patients should be collected in the&#xD;
      power analysis performed with the help of similar literature data. After collecting the&#xD;
      demographic data and morphine consumption data of the patients, the data will be transferred&#xD;
      to the statistical program called SPSS and statistical analysis will be made.The&#xD;
      investigators study does not contain any modifications other than the investigators daily&#xD;
      routine practices.&#xD;
