  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platinum-based chemotherapy, alternating at 21-days intervals with cycles of ifosfamide,&#xD;
      cisplatin, and etoposide (ICE) and subsequently received radiotherapy were considered as&#xD;
      standard treatment for intracranial germ cell tumors. However, whether reliable clinical data&#xD;
      can quantify the damage degree of immunologic function caused by chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy is still unknown. This project regards the level of lymphocyte and immunocyte in&#xD;
      peripheral blood as a quantitative index to reflect the dynamic change of the immunologic&#xD;
      function of patients with CNS germ cell tumors before and after chemoradiotherapy treatment.&#xD;
      Meanwhile, the investigators will also investigate the relationship between the level of&#xD;
      lymphocyte and immunocyte in peripheral blood and the response rate of therapy.This study is&#xD;
      designed to prospectively analyze the dynamic changes of immune status, prognosis and society&#xD;
      function after standard treatment in patients with intracranial germ cell tumor.&#xD;

      Immune status influences the reaction of anti-tumor and health condition of intracranial germ&#xD;
      cell tumor patients. Peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytes subsets, cytokines&#xD;
      reflects those and be measured. Therefore, we designed the study to estimate patients health&#xD;
      condition and survival outcomes in order to provides diversified assessment methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood will be collected from patients who will undergo surgery and/or neoadjuvant&#xD;
      or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The setting time is before chemoradiotherapy, finishing&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy, pre-operation, postoperative day 1, day 3, day 5, and day 7. These blood&#xD;
      samples will be used for detection and analysis in lymphocyte and immunocyte by flow&#xD;
      cytometry.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with intracranial germ cell tumors will be followed, prospectively from the time of discharge using review of the electronic medical record and as local guidance permits, phone calls at 3 and 6 months. The investigators will determine the associations between level of immune function after anti-tumor treatment and the objective remission rate and survival outcomes.</description>
