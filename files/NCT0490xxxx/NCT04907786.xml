  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in adults in the United&#xD;
      States.[1] In the latest guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology anatomical&#xD;
      non-invasive imaging by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) plays an important&#xD;
      role in the diagnosis of the presence of CAD in patients without a history of CAD and a low&#xD;
      to intermediate likelihood.[2] CCTA provides high accuracy for the detection of coronary&#xD;
      artery disease by visualizing the coronary artery lumen using an intravenous contrast&#xD;
      agent.[3] However to determine the hemodynamical significance of CCTA-identified stenosis,&#xD;
      invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with or without functional testing is still required. [4]&#xD;
      During the ICA as per protocol the complete coronary artery system is visualized again. In&#xD;
      patients with abnormalities on CCTA in only one coronary artery, i.e. only the left coronary&#xD;
      artery (LCA) or the right coronary artery (RCA), the ICA procedure might be simplified by&#xD;
      'ultraselectively' visualizing only the coronary artery of interest and refraining from&#xD;
      angiographic visualization of the contralateral coronary artery without abnormalities on CCTA&#xD;
      (with an excellent negative predictive value of 95-99%).[5-7] Such an ultraselective strategy&#xD;
      might reduce procedure time, usage of catheters, complication risk and the amount of contrast&#xD;
      agent and radiation exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent retrospective study in three hospitals in the Netherlands showed CCTA to be&#xD;
      extremely accurate in predicting a normal contralateral coronary artery in patients with&#xD;
      coronary artery disease limited to the left or right coronary artery. Therefore, a&#xD;
      CCTA-guided ultraselective ICA approach would have been safe and feasible and would have led&#xD;
      to a considerable decrease in procedure time and radiation exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the analysis was hampered by the retrospective design. The potential benefits in&#xD;
      salvage of procedure time and radiation exposure might be overestimated and it turned out to&#xD;
      be impossible to measure the effects on contrast use, catheter use and procedure costs.&#xD;
      Moreover, in the retrospective study only a small portion of the study population had&#xD;
      abnormalities in the right coronary artery, thereby questioning the results of this study to&#xD;
      safely be extrapolated to this category of patients with abnormalities in the RCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This dual-center prospective registry study is designed to answer these remaining questions&#xD;
      and to further investigate the potential benefit of an ultraselective ICA approach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study design &amp; patient population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a dual-center prospective registry in two hospitals in the Netherlands. All&#xD;
      patients eligible for participation in this registry are aged 18-80 years old and undergoing&#xD;
      invasive coronary angiography because of abnormalities found on CCTA in either the left or&#xD;
      right coronary artery and no or minimal stenosis (CAD-RADS 0-1; 0-24% stenosis) in the&#xD;
      contralateral coronary artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked for written informed consent to register their clinical data in an&#xD;
      anonymized database. The period between CCTA and ICA may not exceed 90 days, in order to&#xD;
      prevent possible aggravation of coronary artery disease between both examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical characteristics (age, gender, risk factors, relevant medical history) and CCTA data&#xD;
      will be included in the database. All procedural characteristics and findings of the invasive&#xD;
      coronary angiography procedure will be logged, including access site, procedural planning&#xD;
      (which coronary artery to be visualized first), procedure duration, amount and type of&#xD;
      catheters used, amount of radiation exposure and contrast volume, procedural findings, type&#xD;
      of coronary intervention (if applicable), and complications. Procedure duration is defined as&#xD;
      the time needed for the diagnostic part of the ICA procedure, possible further functional&#xD;
      invasive testing and/or percutaneous coronary intervention is excluded. ICA data will be&#xD;
      compared to the CCTA data on a per-patient level. No further follow-up is planned after the&#xD;
      invasive coronary angiography with regards to participating in this registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients provide informed consent, the data will be registered in an anonymized database.&#xD;
      Patients can withdraw from this study at any time at their own request, or they may be&#xD;
      withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for behavioral, or administrative reasons.&#xD;
      The reason(s) for discontinuation will be documented and may include: the subject voluntarily&#xD;
      withdraws from registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the patients will not be subjected to any additional procedures, rules or behavior and&#xD;
      the data will be anonymized, we believe this research design does not fall under the scope of&#xD;
      the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Database and data protection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be stored anonymized in an online database and will only be accessible to the&#xD;
      involved researchers. Personal data will comply to the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act.&#xD;
      Site investigators will only be able to add patients from their own site, and will only be&#xD;
      able to see patients from their own site. Data generated will be encoded and a separate&#xD;
      patient identification log will be created for each site, and stored at each site separately.&#xD;
      The key to the code will be available to specific site investigators only. There will be at&#xD;
      least one study coordinator that has access to all records of all sites. In the future data&#xD;
      from other centers could be included into the database using this similar pattern to ensure&#xD;
      data protection.&#xD;

        The prospected study population is 250 patients. This study population allows for enough&#xD;
        statistical power to answer all endpoints as described above. Due to the fact that only a&#xD;
        few patients with abnormalities on the CCTA limited to the RCA were analyzed in the&#xD;
        retrospective study, we defined that at least 15% of the patient population must consist of&#xD;
        patients with an abnormal RCA on CCTA. In order to reach this distribution, inclusion of&#xD;
        patients with abnormalities in the LCA on CCTA may be halted in favor of patients with&#xD;
        abnormalities in the RCA.&#xD;
