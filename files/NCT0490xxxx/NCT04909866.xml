  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, the treatment methods for advanced liver cancer mainly include local&#xD;
      interventional therapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy.This study focused on patients&#xD;
      with primary HCC diagnosed clinically and radiologically, histologically, or cytologically,&#xD;
      in BCLC stage B/C.To study the medium and long-term efficacy of TACE and remvaritinib&#xD;
      combined with carrelizumab in the treatment of BCLCB/C stage liver cancer, and to evaluate&#xD;
      its effectiveness;To evaluate the safety and efficacy of remvatinib combined with&#xD;
      carrelizumab in the treatment of liver cancer, and to clarify the application value of&#xD;
      combined therapy, so as to lay a foundation for the evaluation of clinical efficacy in&#xD;
      patients with middle and advanced liver cancer.Immune checkpoint inhibitors and cell-based&#xD;
      cancer immunotherapies have been widely used in a variety of advanced malignancies by&#xD;
      modulating the tumor immune response.Studies have shown that programmed death receptor 1&#xD;
      (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint molecule that negatively regulates the immune function of T&#xD;
      cells through interaction with its ligand PD-L1.A growing body of evidence suggests that the&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 interaction is one of the major cancer avoidance mechanisms in&#xD;
      humans.Overexpression of PD-L1 or PD-L2 by tumor cells interacts with PD-1 molecules&#xD;
      expressed in activated T cells to inhibit T cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction, and&#xD;
      eventually leads to inactivation of effector T cells and loss of proliferative ability,&#xD;
      leading to tumor immune escape.Based on this mechanism of tumors, new immunotherapies that&#xD;
      block the interaction between PD1/PD-L1 have been produced, changing the treatment strategies&#xD;
      of various malignant tumors.By inhibiting the negative regulatory effect of PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      pathway on T cells, the anti-tumor immune response of the body can be enhanced, the T cell&#xD;
      response activity targeting the patient's tumor can be improved, and the proliferation of&#xD;
      effector T lymphocytes can be promoted, finally providing an important and lasting immune&#xD;
      response against the patient's malignant tumor.Carrelizumab is a human high-affinity IgG4&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody drug independently developed by Suzhou Henrui Pharmaceutical&#xD;
      Co., Ltd., which can selectively block the activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling&#xD;
      pathway, and restore immune function by activating effector T lymphocytes and cell-mediated&#xD;
      immune response.Some studies have shown that the application of carrelizumab in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors shows some clinical value, and predictive biomarkers such as PD-L1&#xD;
      expression level and tumor mutation load can screen out patients with high response to&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies.Even so, PD1/PD-L1 blocking therapy provides clinical&#xD;
      benefit in less than 20% of cancer patientsï¼Œsuggesting that patients using these drugs rely&#xD;
      solely on their insufficient preexisting endogenous anti-tumor specific T&#xD;
      cells.Anti-angiogenic drugs can specifically bind to vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF) and its receptor 2(VEGFR2), achieving the dual effect of enhancing cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy and achieving molecular targeted therapy.Some recent studies have shown that&#xD;
      angiogenesis inhibitors can regulate tumor microenvironment and relieve hypoxia of tumor&#xD;
      cells, which may promote tumor immune recovery .Ramvatinib mesylate is a class of&#xD;
      multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which can block a series of regulatory&#xD;
      factors including VEGFR1-3, KIT and RET in tumor cells, and significantly inhibit&#xD;
      angiogenesis in tumor tissues.It is currently FDA approved as a first-line treatment for&#xD;
      patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.In a phase III clinical study, the&#xD;
      overall survival of remvatinib in the first-line treatment of unresectable hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma was comparable to sorafenib (13.6 vs12.3 months) .Another basic study showed that&#xD;
      rumvatinib modulates cancer immunity in the tumor microenvironment by reducing&#xD;
      tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), and that when combined with PD-1 inhibitors, it can&#xD;
      enhance anti-tumor activity through the IFN signaling pathway.In addition, previous studies&#xD;
      have found that transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with antiangiogenic agents in&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma shows a good response to tumor treatment&#xD;
      compared with TACE alone, but the incidence of treatment-related adverse events is high and&#xD;
      the survival time of patients is not significantly improved.Therefore, in this study, TACE,&#xD;
      the powerful anti-angiogenic drug Ramvatinib and the new PD-1 inhibitor Carrizumab were&#xD;
      combined to treat liver cancer patients, so as to improve the quality of life of patients and&#xD;
      improve their survival benefits.This study aims to explore the clinical outcomes of TACE,&#xD;
      Ramvatinib combined with carririzumab in patients with stage BCLCB/C liver cancer, monitor&#xD;
      the complications and tumor treatment response of patients, study the appropriate population&#xD;
      for combined treatment, and evaluate the hepatorenal and cardiotoxicity of the drugs in&#xD;
      humans.Focusing on exploring the mechanism and application value of antiangiogenic therapy&#xD;
      combined with immunotherapy in the treatment of liver cancer, to provide new treatment&#xD;
      options for patients with middle and advanced liver cancer.&#xD;
