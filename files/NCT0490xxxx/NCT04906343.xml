      The aim of the study is to determine if Serrated Poliposis Syndrome (SPS) patients with SPS&#xD;
      criteria 2, with clearing phase achieved and without any advanced lesion or less than 5&#xD;
      relevant lesions at last colonoscopy have the same advanced neoplasia incidence in the&#xD;
      surveillance colonoscopy at 2 or 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients selected for the study will be randomised in two groups for the surveillance: group&#xD;
      1, surveillance with colonoscopy in two years; group 2, surveillance with colonoscopy in&#xD;
      three years. Randomization will be done at the database program (RedCAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All colonoscopies will be performed with high definition (HD) system and it will be the&#xD;
      choice of the endoscopist whether to use chromoendoscopy with indigo carmine o virtual&#xD;
      chromoendoscopy. Protocol bowel preparation will be recommended by each centre. Sedation will&#xD;
      be prescribed and decided by the endoscopist during the examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from all the resected and visualized lesions during the colonoscopy will be collected on&#xD;
      the database. A pathologist familiarized with serrated lesions will be in charge of the&#xD;
      sample analysis. Serrated lesions will be classified attending de WHO criteria for serrated&#xD;
      lesions. The investigators define &quot;advanced adenoma&quot; as adenomas ≥10 mm with villous&#xD;
      histology and/or with high grade of dysplasia (HGD). The investigators define &quot;advanced SL&quot;&#xD;
      as any SL ≥10mm and any SL with dysplasia. The investigators also define &quot;advanced neoplasia&quot;&#xD;
      as any colorectal cancer (CRC), any advanced adenoma or advanced Serrated Lesions (SL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of bowel cleansing will be graded by each endoscopist following the Boston Bowel&#xD;
      Preparation Scale. This scale evaluates each segment (ascending colon, transverse colon and&#xD;
      descending colon) of the following form: 0 = segment of colon whose mucosa cannot be seen due&#xD;
      to the existence of solid stools that cannot be eliminated; 1 = mucosa portion of a colonic&#xD;
      segment that can be seen, but other areas of the colonic segment are not seen, either due to&#xD;
      the presence of dirt, feces or opaque liquid; 2 = existence of small amount of dirt, small&#xD;
      fragments of stool and / or opaque liquid, but the mucosa of the colonic segment can be seen&#xD;
      well; 3 = all the mucosa of the colonic segment can be seen well without residual dirt, small&#xD;
      traces of stool or opaque liquid. Patients with inadequate preparation (when in any segment&#xD;
      the score is 0 or 1, or the total score is less than 6) will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During colonoscopy all complications as post-polypectomy bleeding, perforation or&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory events will be registered. Those complications will be considered if&#xD;
      surgery or hospital admission is required.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most frequent neoplasm in developed countries considering both&#xD;
      sexes and is the second in terms of cancer mortality. The incidence of the CRC is increasing&#xD;
      in all developed countries. Detection of precancerous lesions (colon polyps) or malignant&#xD;
      lesions (adenocarcinoma) in early stages in screening programs improves the prognosis and&#xD;
      decreases the mortality of these patients. Serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS) is the most&#xD;
      common colorectal polyposis syndrome and is characterized by the combination of large and/or&#xD;
      numerous serrated lesions (SL) throughout the colorectum. There are three different types of&#xD;
      SLs described: hyperplastic polyps (HP), sessile serrated lesions (SSL) and traditional&#xD;
      serrated adenomas (TSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2010 the world health organization (WHO) defined the clinical criteria for the SPS&#xD;
      diagnosis: criteria I, any patient with ≥ 5 serrated lesions proximal to the sigma, two of&#xD;
      them&gt; 1 cm in size; criteria II, any first degree relative of a SPS patient with at least one&#xD;
      serrated lesion; criteria II, any patient with ≥20 serrated lesions throughout the colon.&#xD;
      This criteria were reviewed in 2019 and criteria II was eliminated. The new criteria are:&#xD;
      criteria 1, any patient with ≥ 5 SL proximal to the rectum, all ≥5 mm in size, with at least&#xD;
      2 lesions ≥10 mm in size; criteria 2, any patient with &gt;20 SL of any size distributed&#xD;
      throughout the colon, with ≥5 lesions proximal to the rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, a new pathway in the development of colorectal adenocarcinoma have been&#xD;
      described, the &quot;serrated pathway&quot;. It is associated with mutations in BRAF and KRAS genes,&#xD;
      the existence of hypermethylation in the promoter regions &quot;CpG island&quot; and microsatellite&#xD;
      instability phenotype caused by methylation of the MLH-1 gene. This new pathway has a faster&#xD;
      progression from the serrated polyp to the CRC in comparison with the classic&#xD;
      &quot;adenoma-carcinoma&quot; pathway, hence the importance of detecting and removing these lesions in&#xD;
      patients with SPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRC prevalence in patients diagnosed with SPS is 15-35%, according to different studies, and&#xD;
      the probability at 5 years of developing a CRC is around 1.3-1.9%. During surveillance, the&#xD;
      incidence of advanced neoplasia (advanced adenoma or advanced serrated lesions) at 3 years is&#xD;
      13% for adenomas and 42 for serrated lesions. Risk factors for developing CRC and advanced&#xD;
      neoplasia have been described in several studies. One of these factors is the SPS criteria 2,&#xD;
      which has been demonstrated as a low risk of CRC and advanced neoplasia during surveillance&#xD;
      of SPS patients. Detecting more than two sessile serrated lesions proximal to the spleenic&#xD;
      flexure, one sessile serrated lesion with high grade of dysplasia and the detection of&#xD;
      advanced neoplasia in previous colonoscopies, are all risk factors of developing advanced&#xD;
      neoplasia during surveillance. A recent multicentre prospective study established SPS patient&#xD;
      surveillance according to lesions detected at last colonoscopy. Individuals with at least one&#xD;
      advanced adenoma, an advanced serrated lesion or more than 5 relevant lesions (sessile&#xD;
      serrated lesions, adenomas of any size or hyperplastic polyps more than 5 mm) were followed&#xD;
      at one year. Patients with no lesions mentioned before were followed at 2 years with&#xD;
      colonoscopy. Advanced neoplasia incidence in 2 years recommendation surveillance was 15.6%&#xD;
      compared with 24.4% in the 1 year recommendation surveillance. CRC cumulative 5 years&#xD;
      incidence was 1.3%. Regarding SPS type, the 5 years advanced neoplasia incidence was lower&#xD;
      for patients with SPS criteria III of 2010 (26%) than for patients diagnosed with criteria I&#xD;
      (53%) or criteria I and III (59%). In this study patients starting their surveillance with&#xD;
      clearing phase achieved (clear colon of all polyps ≥5mm and all polyps with the optical&#xD;
      aspect of adenoma, TSA or SSL) were at low risk of advanced neoplasia than patients without&#xD;
      this phase achieve prior to study inclusion (HR: 0.64; p&lt;0.047).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With all the above described, the investigators can define a SPS patient with low risk of&#xD;
      advanced neoplasia during surveillance: those patients with SPS criteria 2, with clearing&#xD;
      phase achieved and without any advanced lesion or less than 5 relevant lesions at last&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Spanish Society of Gastroenterology (AEG) recommends surveillance with colonoscopies in&#xD;
      1-3 years interval for SPS patient, as it does the European Society of Digestive Oncology&#xD;
      (ESDO). The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) recommends surveillance at&#xD;
      1 o 2 years depending on the last colonoscopy findings, annually in case of any advanced&#xD;
      adenoma or serrated lesion or ≥5 relevant lesions (adenomas, SSL or HP≥5mm) were removed, and&#xD;
      two surveillance in all other cases. The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) recommends&#xD;
      annually surveillance for SPS patients until all serrated lesions ≥ are removed, and then 2&#xD;
      year-surveillance. All these Guidelines mention the limited evidence to support their&#xD;
      recommendations and the need for prospective studies to evaluate them. As well many authors&#xD;
      have expressed the possibility of extending the surveillance to 3 or even 5 years in low risk&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine if SPS patients with SPS criteria 2, with clearing phase&#xD;
      achieved and without any advanced lesion or less than 5 relevant lesions at last colonoscopy&#xD;
      have the same advanced neoplasia incidence in the surveillance colonoscopy at 2 or 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients selected for the study will be randomised in two groups for the surveillance: group&#xD;
      1, surveillance with colonoscopy in two years; group 2, surveillance with colonoscopy in&#xD;
      three years. Randomization will be done at the database program (RedCAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All colonoscopies will be performed with high definition (HD) system and it will be the&#xD;
      choice of the endoscopist whether to use chromoendoscopy with indigo carmine o virtual&#xD;
      chromoendoscopy. Protocol bowel preparation will be recommended by each centre. Sedation will&#xD;
      be prescribed and decided by the endoscopist during the examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from all the resected and visualized lesions during the colonoscopy will be collected on&#xD;
      the database. A pathologist familiarized with serrated lesions will be in charge of the&#xD;
      sample analysis. Serrated lesions will be classified attending de WHO criteria for serrated&#xD;
      lesions. The investigators define &quot;advanced adenoma&quot; as adenomas ≥10 mm with villous&#xD;
      histology and/or with high grade of dysplasia (HGD). The investigators also define &quot;advanced&#xD;
      SL&quot; as any SL ≥10mm and any SL with dysplasia. The investigators define &quot;advanced neoplasia&quot;&#xD;
      as any CRC, any advanced adenoma or advanced SL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of bowel cleansing will be graded by each endoscopist following the Boston Bowel&#xD;
      Preparation Scale. This scale evaluates each segment (ascending colon, transverse colon and&#xD;
      descending colon) of the following form: 0 = segment of colon whose mucosa cannot be seen due&#xD;
      to the existence of solid stools that cannot be eliminated; 1 = mucosa portion of a colonic&#xD;
      segment that can be seen, but other areas of the colonic segment are not seen, either due to&#xD;
      the presence of dirt, feces or opaque liquid; 2 = existence of small amount of dirt, small&#xD;
      fragments of stool and / or opaque liquid, but the mucosa of the colonic segment can be seen&#xD;
      well; 3 = all the mucosa of the colonic segment can be seen well without residual dirt, small&#xD;
      traces of stool or opaque liquid. Patients with inadequate preparation (when in any segment&#xD;
      the score is 0 or 1, or the total score is less than 6) will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During colonoscopy all complications as post-polypectomy bleeding, perforation or&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory events will be registered. Those complications will be considered if&#xD;
      surgery or hospital admission is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION This is a randomized controlled study for evaluating a non&#xD;
      inferiority strategy in the surveillance of SPS type 2 patients, between colonoscopy in 2&#xD;
      years and colonoscopy in 3 years, with the incidence of advanced neoplasia as the principal&#xD;
      aim of the study. In the study from the Netherlands, Bleijenberg and col., the incidence of&#xD;
      advanced neoplasia in patients at 2 years surveillance was of 15%. The investigators assume&#xD;
      an acceptable increase of advanced neoplasia at 3 years surveillance of 25%, so the margin&#xD;
      for no inferiority is 10% between the two groups. Accepting the type I error with an&#xD;
      unilateral contrast of 0.025, beta risk of 0.2 (power 80% ) and considering a 10% of lost&#xD;
      patients, 69 patients in each group (136 in total) are needed to detect significance&#xD;
      differences between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY VARIABLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic variables: Hospital, identification number (number assigned to each hospital&#xD;
           and consecutive number of each patient), date of birth, sex, SPS criteria (according to&#xD;
           WHO classification and actualized in2019: 1 or 2), date of the last colonoscopy, number&#xD;
           and type of lesions resected at the last colonoscopy, number of previous colonoscopies,&#xD;
           number of polyps removed so far (low risk, high risk and serrated lesions), colon&#xD;
           surgery (yes/no) and type of surgery (right colectomy, left colectomy, low anterior&#xD;
           resection, segmental colectomy or others), smoker (yes/no/prev).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variables of the procedure: date of the procedure, bowel preparation according to BBPS&#xD;
           scale 14, study arm (Colonoscopy in2 years/Colonoscopy inn3 years), number and&#xD;
           description of lesions resected during the procedure describing its size, shape&#xD;
           according to Paris classification15, location of the lesions, distance to the anal&#xD;
           margin. Inspection time in each exploration (with stopwatch and without counting the&#xD;
           therapeutic moments). Complications during the procedure (bleeding, perforation or&#xD;
           cardio-respiratory events).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NECESSARY RESOURCES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The colonoscopy and polypectomy will be done in the usual clinical care practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol does not require additional funding. The explorations will be carried out by&#xD;
      the researchers who are staff doctors of the Digestive Endoscopy Units. The effort, the&#xD;
      minimum marginal expenses that may lead to the prolongation of the exploration and the&#xD;
      collection of data will be assumed by the researchers and the Digestive Endoscopy Units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol follows the ethical principles of non-malfeasance, beneficence, autonomy and&#xD;
      justice included in the Declaration of Helsinki (last update, Seoul 2008) 17, as well as in&#xD;
      law 41/2002 on patient autonomy18 and research law 14/2007 biomedical19. The personal and&#xD;
      clinical data of the patients will be anonymized.&#xD;
