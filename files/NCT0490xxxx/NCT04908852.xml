  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being conducted to help understand how the symptoms during treatment&#xD;
      for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may be affected by metabolism and how best to study this&#xD;
      association. Symptoms include experiences like fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain, and&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, longitudinal, observational exploratory study. Ten participants will&#xD;
      be enrolled and will complete baseline and week 4 blood sample collections. Symptom&#xD;
      questionnaires will be completed at baseline, 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which means it is the first time that researchers are&#xD;
      studying the associations between symptoms and metabolism in this way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Institute of Nursing Research is supporting this research study by providing&#xD;
      funding for the research study.&#xD;

    <description>Evaluate the feasibility of conducting this type of study on an in-patient oncology unit (i.e., &gt;70% of enrolled participants will complete 30-day outcome assessments). Using descriptive statistics, feasibility will be calculated as the percent of eligible participants who enroll in the study and among those who enroll, the percent who complete the study. Using a 90%-exact binomial confidence interval estimate, 8 out of 10 participants completing the 30-day study will be considered acceptable for feasibility</description>

    <description>Evaluate the feasibility of conducting this type of study on an in-patient oncology unit (i.e., ≥ 50% approach-to enrollment rate of eligible participants). Using descriptive statistics, feasibility will be calculated as the percent of eligible participants who enroll in the study and among those who enroll, the percent who complete the study.

             enrolled in clinical trials or other studies requiring extra blood samples and/or&#xD;
             completion of questionnaires will be discussed with their oncology care team and/or&#xD;
             investigators of the other study teams to ensure avoidance of excess subject burden.&#xD;
             Only subjects deemed appropriate for enrollment without adding excess burden will be&#xD;
             approached about this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
