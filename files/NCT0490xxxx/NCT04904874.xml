    <measure>Tear film break up time (TBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>After instillation of fluorescein in the conjunctival sac with fluorescein sodium strips (Jingming New TechnologicalDevelopment Co Ltd, Tianjin, China), the subject was asked to blink several times. Then, the tear film was observed under the slitlamp, using a cobalt blue filter to increase the visual contrast. For each eye, TBUT was evaluated three consecutive times, and the average of these three measurements was calculated and taken for the analysis.TBUT, a cut-off value of 5 sec was used to distinguish between moderate/severe TBUT (#5 sec) and mild/normal TBUT (.5 sec)</description>

    <measure>schirmmer staining</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>doctor places a piece of filter paper inside the lower eyelid of both eyes and the person closes their eyes.&#xD;
After 5 minutes, the doctor removes the filter paper. The doctor then assesses how far the tears have travelled on the paper. Result under 10 mm is considered to be an abnormally low level of tear production</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED)questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>the self evaluated Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) questionnaire (Tear Science, Morrisville, VC). This validated questionnaire asked the subject to grade the frequency and severity of four symptoms categories: (1) dryness, grittiness or scratchiness; (2) soreness or irritation; (3) burning or watering; and (4) eye fatigue. For each of these symptom categories, the subject subscored the frequency using a 4-point scale (0 never, 1 sometimes, 2 often, 3 constant), and subscored the severity using a 5-point scale (0 none, 1 tolerable, 2 uncomfortable, 3 bothersome, 4 intolerable). The SPEED score was calculated as the sum of these eight subscores. A SPEED score of 10 is widely accepted as indicating severe DED symptoms, and a cut-off value around six is often used to distinguish between asymptomatic/mild and moderate/severe symptoms.</description>
