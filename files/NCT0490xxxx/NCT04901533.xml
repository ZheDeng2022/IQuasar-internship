    <textblock>
      Objetive: to assess the efficacy of the occipito-atlas-axis cervical manipulation technique&#xD;
      to correct ocular divergence in subjects with exophoria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: quantitative, experimental, longitudinal and prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: subjects over 18 years of age, with exophorias, without heterotropies and who do&#xD;
      not present a contraindication to cervical manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:Subjects with this ocular mobility dysfunction are going to be evaluated objectively&#xD;
      with the Alternate Cover Test. The ocular deviation will be measured at 40 cm and at 4&#xD;
      meters. The individuals who were part of the experimental group underwent the OAA&#xD;
      manipulation technique, and to those who were part of the control group a placebo maneuver.&#xD;
      Two measurements were taken from this moment, one immediately after the execution of the&#xD;
      technique and another one week later.&#xD;

    <description>The exophoria will be evaluated in prismatic diothra. Using the cover alternate test, we will measure with a prism ruler the diotrials that the subject requires to balance eye movement and that the eye does not move from the outside to the inside when looking at an object at 40 cm.</description>

    <description>The objective of this technique is to restore joint mobility between the joints of the occipital, first (atlas) and second cervical vertebra (axis). It is a technique performed in rotation on a vertical axis that passes through the odontoid process of the axis, without placing flexion or extension, and with very slight sidebending; it is done bilaterally.</description>

    <description>patient is supine, and the therapist stands on the side to be manipulated. The cranial hand of the therapist globally grasps the patient's skull and turns the patient's neck on that same side. The caudal hand is placed on the patient's face. The technique is performed by an impulse in pure rotation on the side that the cervical region is rotated, with a helical movement.</description>

    <description>The patient is in the supine position, and the therapist sitting at the head of the patient. The therapist places his hands on the head of the patient, the thumbs touch each other, without touching the vault cranial. A perception of the cranial rhythm is carried out passively.</description>
