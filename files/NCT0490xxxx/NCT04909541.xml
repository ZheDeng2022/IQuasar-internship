  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placement of a ureteral stent is a common urological intervention. For decades there was no&#xD;
      valid measures available to assess quality of life issues in patients with ureteral stents,&#xD;
      which has hampered the understanding of such symptoms and their true impact. In order to&#xD;
      improve the outcomes associated with the placement of a stent, a validated tool is needed to&#xD;
      measure its impact and the amount of undesirable effects it produces on patients requiring&#xD;
      the placement of a stent. In 2003, the team of the Bristol Urological Institute developed a&#xD;
      validated questionnaire called the: URETERAL STENT SYMPTOM QUESTIONNAIRE (USSQ). The&#xD;
      questionnaire contains 38 items included in 6 sections. Despite the obvious need of a&#xD;
      validated questionnaire, the latter remains unused by the community of peer urologists. Many&#xD;
      of urologists consider it too long to be used in clinical practice and even for research&#xD;
      purposes. This issue motivated the Canadian Endourology Group (CEG) to work collaboratively&#xD;
      on the development of the CANADIAN ENDOUROLOGY GROUP STENT SYMPTOM SCORE (CEGSSS) in order to&#xD;
      provide clinicians with a more useful and validated tool. To fulfill this objective, the CEG&#xD;
      proceeds in three phases. Phase 1. A systematic, deliberative, and participatory approach&#xD;
      mostly through face to face meetings, including patients, clinicians, and researchers in the&#xD;
      field of Endourology to identify a minimum needs-based set of domains and items that are,&#xD;
      clinically relevant to be included in the CEGSSS in order to ensure optimal uptake in the&#xD;
      clinical setting. Phase 2. A pilot study to assess feasibility/acceptability and further&#xD;
      refine the proposed set of items selected in phase 1 of the study. Phase 3. A multicentric&#xD;
      prospective study to evaluate the validity, reliability and sensitivity to change of the&#xD;
      CEGSSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project is conducted by the Canadian Endourology Group (CEG), a panel of&#xD;
      experts in the field of endourology in Canada. The CEG is a national member-based&#xD;
      organization dedicated to enabling the profession to provide the highest possible standards&#xD;
      of endourological care and to advance the science of endourology by collaboratively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fostering excellence in endourological practice through advocacy, education, research&#xD;
           and practice support tools,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Leading evidence-based clinical practice through the development of practice standards&#xD;
           and guidelines in endourology,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Providing continuous professional development for Canadian endourologists along the&#xD;
           career-path continuum,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Providing leadership in public education for endourological conditions.&#xD;

      This research project is conducted in 3 phases, phase 1 and 2 have been completed and phase 3&#xD;
      is under preparation and will be submitted to the Research Ethics Board soon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Prioritizing Domains/Items to be included in a minimal needs data set&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify the Domains/Items to be included in the minimal needs-based data set for&#xD;
           assessing symptoms related to stent insertion among those used in the USSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify other items to include in the CEGSSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reach a final consensus on the Domains/Items to be included in the minimal data set that&#xD;
           will constitute the new CEGSSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methodology A systematic deliberative and participatory approach is used to meet the&#xD;
           above objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase 1 is composed of two steps&#xD;
&#xD;
           Step I: Procedures and data analysis Provided that the USSS questionnaire is a validated&#xD;
           questionnaire developed to specifically address the outcomes related to the stent&#xD;
           placement, that questionnaire was used as a starting point to identify the Domains/Items&#xD;
           to be included in the minimal needs-based data set for assessing symptoms related to&#xD;
           stent insertion through those used in the USSQ. A committee constituted of 21 patients&#xD;
           and 9 CEG experts worked to address the items of each section of the USSQ in order to&#xD;
           assess the importance of each item in determining the impact of having a stent The&#xD;
           consultations were done through face to face meetings. Each item (question) was rated&#xD;
           using a scale from 1 to 5. Patients and clinicians took into consideration if the item&#xD;
           was absolutely essential and clinically useful. The question was accepted if mean&#xD;
           patient rating was ≥4.0 with Standard Deviation (SD) ≤0.75 OR if mean expert rating was&#xD;
           ≥4.0 with SD ≤0.75. Questions with mean patients or mean experts rating of ≥4.0 with SD&#xD;
           ≥ 0.75 were flagged for discussion with experts during the second phase of&#xD;
           consultations. If the means and SD didn't respect the criteria, the question was&#xD;
           rejected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           the following summarizes the results of phase I consultation by domain:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urinary symptoms domain (11 questions):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  9 questions accepted&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain domain (9 questions):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  8 questions accepted&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1 question to be discussed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  General Health domain (6 questions):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All questions were rejected. They all had means &lt; 4.00 for both experts and&#xD;
                patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Work performance domain (7 questions):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All questions were rejected. They all had means &lt; 4.00 for both experts and&#xD;
                patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sexual matters domains (4 questions):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All questions were rejected. They all had means &lt; 4.00 for both experts and&#xD;
                patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Additional problems domain (6 questions):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  4 questions accepted&#xD;
&#xD;
           Step II: Procedures and data analysis The accepted and flagged questions go through&#xD;
           another evaluation using expert's consensus meetings involving 9 experts. All the&#xD;
           experts involved were members of the CEG. Five rounds of consultations were necessary to&#xD;
           achieve the final CEGSSS. Most of the questions were labeled differently, some of the&#xD;
           questions initially rejected in phase I were reintroduced, and other questions were&#xD;
           abandoned The score benefited from the adding of a domain on quality of life including&#xD;
           two questions. The final CEGSSS contains 15 questions divided in 3 domains: Urination,&#xD;
           Pain and quality of life. Each item included in the questionnaire was agreed by all&#xD;
           experts, which mean 100% in terms of % of agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase 2: Feasibility and acceptability of implementing the CEGSSS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based on the results of the phase 1, an initial draft of the CEGSSS was developed. This&#xD;
           version including 15 questions divided in 3 domains has been tested in a prospective&#xD;
           pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the CEGSSS among patients&#xD;
           before starting the multicentric validation study of the score. The pilot study&#xD;
           recruited patients from 4 centers; the Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal&#xD;
           (CHUM), the University Health Network- Toronto General Hospital (UHN-TGH), the Mc Gill&#xD;
           University Healthcare Center (MUHC) and the Stone Center, Vancouver General Hospital&#xD;
           (VGH)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methodology Based on the experience the investigators have with this kind of studies,&#xD;
           anticipated need of 5 rounds of 5 patients to achieve the final version of the CEGSSS,&#xD;
           therefore a sample size of 25 patients was planned. Participants for whom a ureteral&#xD;
           stent was inserted during their intervention at the urology unit of the participating&#xD;
           centers were approached.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedures Patients for whom a ureter stent was inserted during their intervention at&#xD;
           the urology unit were offered to participate to the study. Patients who agree to&#xD;
           participate had to complete the CEGSSS and a short survey, that asks about their opinion&#xD;
           about problems or ambiguity related to the wording and clarity of the questions as well&#xD;
           as if there are important missing information or other issues to be addressed in the&#xD;
           questionnaire. The study documents were identified using a Patient ID. Patients&#xD;
           completed the documents at some point between the stent placement appointment and the&#xD;
           stent removal appointment If they forgot to do so, they had the chance to complete them&#xD;
           at the urology unit the day of their appointment for stent removal A prospective design&#xD;
           involving iterative cycles have been used. At each cycle, patient's responses have been&#xD;
           reviewed and the CEGSSS revised according to the data and feedback collected in the&#xD;
           Patient Survey. Each cycle involved 5 patients at a time and this procedure have be&#xD;
           repeated until minimal or no negative feedback is obtained and a final version of the&#xD;
           CEGSSS is reached. This study needed 3 iterative cycles of testing to achieve data&#xD;
           saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase 3: ***PHASE 3 OF THE PRESENT RESEARCH PROJECT IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT, THE FOLLOWING&#xD;
           IS A SUMMARY OF IT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A multicentric prospective study to evaluate the validity, reliability and&#xD;
                sensitivity to change of the CEGSSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A multicentric prospective study to evaluate the validity and reliability of the&#xD;
                French version of the CEGSSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Multicentric study : 6 centers in Canada and 2 centers in the US Sample size: The final&#xD;
           sample size will be driven by Factor Analysis which requires the largest sample size as&#xD;
           compared to the other psychometric assessments needed to validate the questionaire.&#xD;
           N=180 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           Questionnaire administration :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CEGSSS (n=180)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At baseline: 7 days after stent insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At follow-up: 14 days after stent insertion and before removal&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  USSQ (n=50)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At follow-up: 14 days after stent insertion and before removal&#xD;
&#xD;
           Psychometric assessments :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Internal consistency&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Test-Retest Reliability&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Validity&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Internal consistency assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Verify the homogeneity of the questions globally and within each domain&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Objective: Assess if all the questions in each domain are moving in the same&#xD;
                direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This will allow us to correct questions that are inversely correlated with other&#xD;
           questions. - Data: internal consistency will be examined on both baseline and follow-up&#xD;
           data (n=180*2)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cronbach's α calculation (varies on a scale of -1 to 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For dichotomous items (yes/no) a Kuder-Richardson-20 coefficient (r) will be&#xD;
                calculated&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A Cronbach's α /Kuder-Richardson coefficient ≥ 0.70 will be considered acceptable&#xD;
                (good internal consistency)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test-Retest Reliability The questionnaire will be administered to the same patient at&#xD;
           different time points with the ureteral stent in place (5-7 days and 10-14 after stent&#xD;
           insertion)&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Objective: Comparison of results of the same individual when it is submitted at&#xD;
           different times to under identical experimental conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Data: Analysis will be done by comparing baseline to follow-up data (n=180 *2)&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Instrument's fidelity will be estimated from the Intra-class Correlation Coefficient&#xD;
           (ICC)&#xD;
&#xD;
           - An ICC &gt; 0,8 would be considered acceptable (good test retest reliability)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) Allows for the extraction of confirmatory factors from&#xD;
           the domains and can be used to narrow down the questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Objective: Ensure that the items contribute to the expected dimensions Make a global&#xD;
           score or sub-score per domain&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Sample size calculation : 10:1 (i.e. 10 participants for each item of the CEGSSS)&#xD;
           Number of items including subitems= 18 n=180 (10*18)&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Data: internal consistency will be assessed on both baseline and follow-up data&#xD;
           (n=180*2)&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Analysis: the following measures will be calculated as part of EFA:&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Factor loadings : correlation between the item and the dimension defined (no item&#xD;
           should to highly correlate with more than one factor)&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Factor loadings &gt; 0.3 will be considered acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Explained variance of the measured construct: 50% of explained variance will be&#xD;
           considered acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Eigenvalues : each dimension should have an eigenvalue &gt; 1 per factor&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Validity test:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Compare the results of the CEGSSS questionnaire to the results of a questionnaire that&#xD;
           measures the same concept (the USSQ) - Objective: Ensure each domain measures the&#xD;
           intended concept for which it was developed. - Data: Analysis will be done on a subset&#xD;
           of follow-up data (n=50) - Analysis: - The correlation between the CEGSSS and the USSQ&#xD;
           will be measured using: - Pearson correlation if data are normally distributed -&#xD;
           Spearman rank correlation if data are not normally distributed&#xD;
&#xD;
      6) French validation of the CEGSSS: The CEGSSS will undergo Forward and backward translation&#xD;
      first and then validation in the setting of a multicentric study&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Forward translation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial questionnaire will be translated into French by two native French speakers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 from the institution who knows the intended use of the CEGSSS well and&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 professional translator&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both translations will be compared and discussed between:&#xD;
&#xD;
      the two translators and a 3rd person who is not involved in the translation process The&#xD;
      version resulting from this review process will undergo the &quot;Backward translation&quot; process&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Backward translation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translation resulting from the Forward translation process will be translated back into&#xD;
      English by two native English speakers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 from the institution who knows the intended use of the instrument but not the CEGSSS itself&#xD;
      and&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 professional translator Both translations will be compared and discussed between the two&#xD;
      translators and a 3rd person who is not involved in the translation process The version&#xD;
      resulting from this review process will be compared to the original English version&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Comparison and agreement process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The English version resulting from the Forward-Backward translation process will be compared&#xD;
      to the original English version&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences will be discussed by a committee of experts composed of :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All CEG experts involved in the development of the questionnaire A methodologist The&#xD;
      translators involved in the forward-backward translation process The differences between the&#xD;
      two translations will be discussed and modifications to the French version and/or to the&#xD;
      English version will be made accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A consensus of all committee members must be reached in order to validate the French version&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) Test-Retest Reliability:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The French version will undergo the Test- Retest reliability analysis in the same way as the&#xD;
      English version Multicentric study (2 centers ) Inclusion exclusion criteria will be the same&#xD;
      except for the language&#xD;
&#xD;
      The French CEGSSS will be administered to 180 patients at two different times:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  7 days after stent insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  14 days after stent insertion and before stent removal Instrument's fidelity will be&#xD;
           estimated from the Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) An ICC &gt; 0,8 would be&#xD;
           considered acceptable (good test-retest reliability)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations Phase1: Participating patients were completely free to take part or&#xD;
      not in Phase I of the present project. Patients were approached and invited to participate&#xD;
      when they came for their appointments. Relevant information about the objectives and&#xD;
      procedures of the consultation was provided during their appointment, they were also informed&#xD;
      of the intention which was to create a new questionnaire. Then, the potential participants&#xD;
      were asked if they accept or not to be part of the patient's staff. If they answered yes,&#xD;
      this constituted their consent and they did not have to sign a formal informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating experts were all members of the CEG. The members of the CEG are involved in all&#xD;
      the projects initiated by CEG, therefore, they consented to participate in the consensus&#xD;
      process when they agreed to join the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: There is no physical or psychological harm associated with this study. Less than 20&#xD;
      minutes are required to complete the CEGSSS and Patient Survey. It is possible that some&#xD;
      patients may feel slightly uncomfortable answering certain questions, but had the option to&#xD;
      refuse to answer. If need be, they can contact the Study (SC) coordinator for support and&#xD;
      discussion. Furthermore, the participants have been given the opportunity to report in the&#xD;
      Patient Survey which question(s) was (were) upsetting/inappropriate to them. In line with the&#xD;
      hospital policy, the Principal Investigators (PI) report to their local Research Ethics Board&#xD;
      any adverse events occur. Participants have been informed that refusal to participate in the&#xD;
      study or withdrawing from it will not affect in any way the quality of care they would&#xD;
      receive, nor will it jeopardize their relationship with their health care professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients' nominal data, contact information, medical record number, and Patient ID are&#xD;
      stored on the secured files of each institution and each center's nominal data will be&#xD;
      accessible only to their research team. Research data will be collected using de-identified&#xD;
      forms. The CHUM's PI and SC will both be able to access all research data. At the end of the&#xD;
      study, data will be send to the CHUM and stored on a secure file protected by a password on&#xD;
      the CHUM network drive of Dr. Naeem Bhojani. Data will be kept for a period of 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding: This project is financed by the funds of Dr. Naeem Bhojani.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conflict of interest: None&#xD;
