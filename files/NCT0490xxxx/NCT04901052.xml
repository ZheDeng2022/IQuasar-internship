  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a chronic disease characterized by the excessive accumulation of adipose tissue&#xD;
      that is harmful to health. Dietary habits modification through a caloric restriction,&#xD;
      macronutrient distribution including linoleic and linolenic (n-6:n-3) polyunsaturated fatty&#xD;
      acids (PUFAs) ratio, has been suggested for obesity management. It has been proposed that the&#xD;
      optimal n-6: n-3 ratio should be between 1:1 and 5:1 to maintain a healthy balance. Purpose:&#xD;
      Compare the effect of a diet n6:n3 ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids with a group&#xD;
      supplemented with n-3 PUFA on lipid profile in erythrocyte membrane, biochemical and&#xD;
      inflammatory markers in subjects with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 58 subjects were randomly divided into two groups: fish oil group and the placebo&#xD;
      group. Anthropometric and biochemical data were evaluated, cytokine levels was performed&#xD;
      using the Bio-PlexPro™ HumanTh17Cytokine Assays (MagPix) panel. The fatty acid profile&#xD;
      quantification in the erythrocyte membrane was carried out by gas chromatography. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis was performed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v.22 software.&#xD;

      A randomized clinical trial was conducted at the Institute of Translational Nutrigenetics and&#xD;
      Nutrigenomics of the University of Guadalajara. All participants were recruited through&#xD;
      flyers and social media invitations. Sample size was determined according to the mean&#xD;
      difference formula for clinical trials. To achieve a statistical power of 80% and an alpha of&#xD;
      5%, a sample size of 19 participants in each study group was required. However, 58 obese&#xD;
      individuals who met the selection criteria were randomized in n-3 group or placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample, height and weight were measured after 8-12 hour fast and wearing light clothes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nutritional intervention consisted in 20% reduction by the total estimated energy through&#xD;
      the Mifflin-St.Jeor formula was calculated, following a 50% to carbohydrates, 20% to proteins&#xD;
      and 30% to lipids distribution. All participants received a balanced nutritional plan of&#xD;
      omega-6/omega-3 close to 5:1 ratio, according to estimated energy. Additionally, a high&#xD;
      omega-3 foods list was proportioned to emphasize their consumption during the study. Fish oil&#xD;
      group besides the diet was supplemented with omega 3, the dosage was 2 capsules per day,&#xD;
      containing 1.5 g of total omega 3, of which 1000 mg were EPA and 500mg DHA. The omega 3&#xD;
      capsules were obtained from the same batch, and a toxicity analysis was performed to verify&#xD;
      the safety or the placebo group (2 capsules per day made from sunflower oil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by the Ethics and Biosafety Committee of the Health Sciences Center,&#xD;
      University of Guadalajara (Registration number CI-01219) and was carried out according to the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki (2013) and all the participants signed a written consent-informed.&#xD;
