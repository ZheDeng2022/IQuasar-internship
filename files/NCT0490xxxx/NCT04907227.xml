  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and docetaxel in the treatment of Chinese men with metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have not received chemotherapy for mCRPC but&#xD;
      have progressed on or are intolerant to Next Generation Hormonal Agent (NHA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two primary study hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: The combination of pembrolizumab plus docetaxel plus prednisone is superior to&#xD;
      placebo plus docetaxel plus prednisone with respect to Overall Survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: The combination of pembrolizumab plus docetaxel plus prednisone is superior to&#xD;
      placebo plus docetaxel plus prednisone with respect to Radiographic Progression-free Survival&#xD;
      (rPFS) per Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by blinded independent central review.&#xD;
