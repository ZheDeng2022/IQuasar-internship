  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy (RT) is a well-known and established therapy or adjuvant therapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of thoracic cancer It uses a high energy radiation from x-rays, gamma rays and&#xD;
      other charged particles that assist in damaging the cancer DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET/MR as imaging biomarkers for cardiopulmonary dysfunction with a focus on Pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension (PH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the measures taken to reduce the total radiation dose and to limit the radiation to&#xD;
      normal tissues, there is evidence of transient or permanent radiotherapy induced myocardial&#xD;
      and pulmonary dysfunction leading to PH in patients who receive radiotherapy above a certain&#xD;
      threshold of received dose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RT is a well-known and established therapy or adjuvant therapy for the treatment of thoracic&#xD;
      malignancies (breast cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma and others). It usually uses high energy&#xD;
      radiation from x-rays, gamma rays or other charged particles to induce DNA damage in&#xD;
      malignant cells. Despite the measures taken to reduce the total radiation dose and to limit&#xD;
      the radiation to normal tissues, the signs and symptoms of radiation induced cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      dysfunction (RICPD) still persist. However, in the majority of cases, it remains unclear&#xD;
      which cardiopulmonary damage is the main /leading cause for the clinical symptoms the&#xD;
      patients are experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hybrid PET/MRI is a promising technique that allows for truly simultaneous molecular,&#xD;
      anatomic and functional imaging of the cardiopulmonary system. The simultaneity is an&#xD;
      important aspect in this proposed study since only parameters measured at the same time in&#xD;
      PET and MR can be used for an integrated, multimodality parameter for possible detection and&#xD;
      prognostication of the different underlying processes of cardiopulmonary dysfunction after&#xD;
      RT. Furthermore, certain PET-uptake of the RV have to be corrected for RV mass which is only&#xD;
      possible with concomitant anatomical imaging. MR imaging and PET at different time point are&#xD;
      not accurately reflective of the underlying pathophysiological pathways and metabolic state&#xD;
      at the specific time points pre- and post radiotherapy. To our knowledge, there are no online&#xD;
      publications of its use in the diagnosis and prognostication of cardiopulmonary dysfunction&#xD;
      after RT and specifically PH.&#xD;
