  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the pilot study, we aim to explore trial design, assess procedures, and collect&#xD;
      exploratory data to inform the design of a future Randomised Controlled Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention involves a Digital Assessment Routing Tool (DART) that provides triage&#xD;
      outcomes with recommended management pathways for participants with musculoskeletal problems.&#xD;
      Participants complete DART either before or after their consultation with usual care&#xD;
      clinicians (Physiotherapy-led remote triage). The triage outcome dispositions between DART&#xD;
      and usual care clinicians will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A panel will be formed to provide consensus on disagreements that may result in adverse&#xD;
      triage outcomes, as well as on a sample of agreements between DART and usual care clinicians.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Digital Assessment Routing Tool (DART) is a first-contact web-based and mobile health&#xD;
      system that uses clinical algorithms to triage patients with musculoskeletal disorders and&#xD;
      recommend management pathways. This is achieved by completing an online web-based&#xD;
      questionnaire that follows a clinical reasoning process commonly observed in face-to-face&#xD;
      physiotherapy consultations. Based on the participant's answers, the clinical algorithm will&#xD;
      generate sets of questions, leading up to a final triage disposition with a recommended&#xD;
      management pathway. The triage outcomes with recommended management pathways are classified&#xD;
      as follows;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical care&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A&amp;E referral&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urgent GP&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Routine GP&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Consultant review&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physiotherapy care&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post-fracture or surgery physiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physiotherapy referral&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physiotherapy referral plus psychosocial support&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Self-management&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Self-management with SOS&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Continue self-management advice&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual care clinician, providing physiotherapy-led remote triage, will follow their&#xD;
      clinical reasoning and proceed with the consultation as usual. The participants will receive&#xD;
      both the DART assessment and usual care remote triage (crossover design). Patient care will&#xD;
      not change (except time taken to reach a decision) as its a crossover design and only the&#xD;
      clinician assessment will count. Note, participants will be randomised in two arms (DART,&#xD;
      PT-remote triage or reversed) to account for order effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be collected at a single time point (Visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post data collection, a panel consisting of researchers, physiotherapists and clinical&#xD;
      leaders with a minimum of 5 years' experience in musculoskeletal health will provide&#xD;
      consensus on all the disagreements between DART and physiotherapy-led remote triage that can&#xD;
      result in adverse triage outcomes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiotherapy care or self-management when it should have been urgent medical care (A&amp;E&#xD;
           referral or urgent GP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-management when it should have been either physiotherapy care or medical care and&#xD;
           harm could result.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine care when it should have been urgent care and harm could result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, random samples of triage outcomes will be assessed to decide whether they were&#xD;
      the most appropriate outcome.&#xD;

This service is either a telephone or video consult and includes any diagnostic procedure (e.g. patient history, remote assessments) and treatment, such as management advise or home-based exercise therapy.
