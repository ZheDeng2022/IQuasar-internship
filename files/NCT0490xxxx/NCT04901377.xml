  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers want to learn more about user satisfaction in women in Russia who take estradiol&#xD;
      valerate/ dienogest as a contraceptive in real conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estradiol valerate/ dienogest is a form of birth control. This is also known as a combined&#xD;
      oral contraceptive (COC). Earlier studies showed that estradiol valerate/ dienogest has high&#xD;
      level of protection from unplanned pregnancy. It is available for doctors to prescribe to&#xD;
      women who want to take an oral contraceptive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estradiol valerate/ dienogest as a combined oral contraceptive (COC), works by stopping a&#xD;
      process called ovulation. This is the process by which the ovaries release an egg. COCs are&#xD;
      commonly used by young women to prevent pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers in this study will collect information from young women (18-35 years of age)&#xD;
      in Russia who will start taking estradiol valerate/ dienogest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to find out about the women's satisfaction with taking&#xD;
      estradiol valerate/ dienogest. To do this, the researchers will ask &quot;how satisfied are you&#xD;
      with the birth control method used during the study?&quot;. They will ask this question after the&#xD;
      women have taken estradiol valerate/ dienogest for 3 and 6 months. The women willanswer this&#xD;
      question using a rating scale ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 meaning &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; and 5&#xD;
      meaning &quot;very satisfied&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include young women (18-35 years of age) who want to use oral contraceptives&#xD;
      and have been prescribed estradiol valerate/ dienogest by their doctor. None of the women in&#xD;
      the study will have taken estradiol valerate/ dienogest within 1 month of joining the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it is expected that each woman will visit her study site 3 times. Each woman&#xD;
      will be in the study for up to 6 months. All of the women will take estradiol valerate/&#xD;
      dienogest as prescribed by their doctors. There will be no other required procedures or&#xD;
      treatments in this study which is not be used in usual practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the women will answer a question about how satisfied they are with&#xD;
      estradiol valerate/ dienogest. They will also respond to some questionnaires. These will&#xD;
      include a questionnaire about their menstrual bleeding patterns, sexual function. The doctors&#xD;
      will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ask the women about any medical conditions they may have and what other contraceptives&#xD;
           they took before they joined the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  check the women's blood pressure and pulse rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ask a question about woman's intention to continue to use estradiol valerate/ dienogest&#xD;
           and the reasons for discontinuation of estradiol valerate/ dienogest if it has happened&#xD;
