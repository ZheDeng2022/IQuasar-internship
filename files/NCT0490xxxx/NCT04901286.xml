  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerobic exercise is a promising treatment modality for cognition in persons with TBI, but&#xD;
      effects are consistently small. This study aims to investigate the effect of difference&#xD;
      environments during moderate intensity cycling sessions on cognition.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research study would be the first to investigate the acute effects of aerobic&#xD;
      exercise with different environments relative to control and comparison conditions on several&#xD;
      domains of cognition in people with TBI. This critical investigation will be a first step&#xD;
      toward systematically identifying an optimal exercise training intervention for managing&#xD;
      common cognitive consequences of TBI.&#xD;

    <description>Behavioral: Seated Rest In the seated rest control condition, participants will sit on the bike for 30 minutes. Interaction with researchers will be kept at a minimum, similar to that in other sessions. Heart rate will be recorded every two minutes and perceived exertion will be reported every four minutes.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Exercise Only</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Behavioral: Exercise Only In the exercise-only condition, participants will complete a total of 30-minutes on the stationary bike. This will include a) 5-min warm-up at low resistance, b) 20 minutes of moderate-vigorous intensity cycling, and c) a 5-min cool-down at low resistance. Interaction with researchers will be kept at a minimum, similar to that in other sessions. Heart rate will be recorded every two minutes and perceived exertion will be reported every four minutes.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Exercise + Non-Immersive Virtual Reality</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Behavioral: Exercise + Non-Immersive Virtual Reality In the exercise with non-immersive Virtual Reality condition, participants will complete a total of 30-minutes on the stationary bike while watching a video on an iPad. The cycling session will be identical to that in the Exercise Only condition (5-min warm-up, 20 minutes of moderate-vigorous intensity cycling, and 5-min cool down). During cycling, a YouTube video called &quot;360° VR Cycling Newport Back Bay Sunset [30 MIN - NO MUSIC])&quot; will play on an iPad placed on the front of the bike. Interaction with researchers will be kept at a minimum, similar to that in other sessions. Heart rate will be recorded every two minutes and perceived exertion will be reported every four minutes.</description>

    <description>Behavioral: Exercise + Immersive Virtual Reality In the exercise with immersive virtual reality condition, participants will complete a total of 30-minutes on the stationary bike while wearing Oculus Quest 2 goggles. The bout of cycling will be identical to the prescription given in the exercise only condition (5-min warm-up, 20 minutes of moderate-vigorous intensity cycling, and 5-min cool down). During cycling, the Oculus YouTubeVR app will play a 360° version of the YouTube video called &quot;360° VR Cycling Newport Back Bay Sunset [30 MIN - NO MUSIC])&quot;. Interaction with researchers will be kept at a minimum, similar to that in other sessions. Heart Rate will be recorded every two minutes and perceived exertion will be reported every four minutes.</description>
