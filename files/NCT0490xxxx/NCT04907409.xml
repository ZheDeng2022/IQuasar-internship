    <textblock>
      This is a single arm study of home monitoring with the NVHO for 5 weeks with office visits at&#xD;
      enrollment, Week 1 and Week 5 (Exit Visit) and, when applicable, Interim Visit(s) triggered&#xD;
      by ongoing review by the Reading Center. The study will enroll subjects diagnosed with NV-AMD&#xD;
      in at least one eye with attention to the proportion of eyes with IRF and/or SRF. The&#xD;
      enrolled eligible subjects will be instructed to self-image the study eye(s) once daily for 5&#xD;
      weeks using a NVHO device at home with scheduled in-office examinations at Week 1, Week 5 and&#xD;
      Interim Visits, when applicable, with additional in-office Cirrus volume scans acquired at&#xD;
      these office visits. The self-imaging data on the NVHO will be automatically uploaded to the&#xD;
      Notal Health Cloud and from there the reconstructed volume scans will sent to the study&#xD;
      database.&#xD;

      The objectives of this study are to (1) evaluate the agreement, via positive percent&#xD;
      agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA), between OCT images captured by the NVHO&#xD;
      and by the Zeiss Cirrus HD-OCT in the visualization of fluid as identified by a RC, in the&#xD;
      central 10 degrees of the macula of NV-AMD patients, and (2) evaluate the ability of subjects&#xD;
      diagnosed with NV-AMD to set up the device and self-image their eyes at home with the NVHO&#xD;
      device (rate of successful imaging attempts).Description of Study Visits and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this visit, the exams will be conducted in the following order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subject will be informed concerning the study and sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF)&#xD;
           prior to the conduct of any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The following data will be collected for each study subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Subject's date of birth (DOB) (if allowed) or age&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Race&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Level of education&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Eye exams, including Snellen BCVA and subjective symptoms (visual distortions, blurry&#xD;
           vision, and scotoma), will be performed on both eyes on the day of the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Both eyes of the subject will be imaged using a commercial Zeiss Cirrus OCT using the&#xD;
           6mm X 6mm, 512 X 128 volume scan program, with a maximum of three attempts for each eye&#xD;
           to reach an acceptable image quality per the Cirrus User's Guide and reviewed by the PI&#xD;
           to determine fluid status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. One or both eye(s) of the subject that meets all screening criteria, including having a&#xD;
           diagnosis of NV-AMD in at least one eye previously or at the enrolment visit, will be&#xD;
           enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects who do not meet all screening criteria will be deemed a screen failure and&#xD;
                will be exited from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study eyes enrolled with fluid in the primary study eye, may receive treatment&#xD;
                during the Week 1 Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If in the investigator's opinion, the treatment cannot be delayed by approximately&#xD;
                7 days until the Week 1 visit, the subject will be exited from the study as a&#xD;
                Screen Failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           NOTE: For the subjects with both eyes with NV-AMD, one eye will be randomly selected as&#xD;
           the primary eye during enrollment and the other will be the secondary eye. For subjects&#xD;
           with only one eye with NV-AMD, the fellow eye with dry AMD may be enrolled. For such&#xD;
           subjects, the NV-AMD eye will be the primary eye and the other eye will be the secondary&#xD;
           eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The following data will be collected for the study eye:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Qualifying diagnosis for the study eye from the subject's medical record&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. From the subject's medical record, the presence of other ophthalmic conditions&#xD;
                including but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Cataract ii. Glaucoma iii. Dry Eye iv. Other macula findings&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The subject will receive a general overview (including a description of the device and a&#xD;
           review of the NVHO set-up guide) of the self-operation of the NVHO device at the&#xD;
           investigational clinic facility by trained study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The subject will be (1) reminded that the NVHO device will be delivered to their home&#xD;
           and (2) instructed to self-image the study eye(s) once daily using a NVHO device at home&#xD;
           for 5 weeks and the Week 1 and Week 5 visits will be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Collect AEs, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Set-up with Remote Assistance (NVHO Setup Period)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following confirmation of subject eligibility at the Enrollment Visit and the subject is&#xD;
      enrolled in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The subject will be contacted by the NVDC to verify their delivery address.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The device will be delivered to the subject's home, with confirmation sent back to the&#xD;
           NVDC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Remote support is available by the Notal Vision Diagnostic Clinic (NVDC) via phone&#xD;
           during normal business hours, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The subject will follow the steps detailed in the Set-up Guide included in the box. This&#xD;
           is considered NVHO Setup Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Note: A care giver, family member or friend is allowed to assist. At most four&#xD;
           additional calibrations can be performed, on the same day or different consecutive days,&#xD;
           for each study eye if the calibration is not successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Note: If an eye cannot calibrate during 5 separate attempts, the subject will be&#xD;
           notified by the NVDC to discontinue self-imaging this eye and NVDC will collect the&#xD;
           corresponding information such as the corresponding eye, self-image discontinuation&#xD;
           reason, and the self-image stopping date. If there is a fellow eye also enrolled in the&#xD;
           study, the fellow eye will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Collect AEs, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-Home Phase (Day 1 to Day 35 post NVHO Setup Period) Following set-up of the NVHO,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Day 1: The subject will perform the first self-imaging session with the NVHO device on&#xD;
           both eyes followed by automated transmission of the scans. This first session will be&#xD;
           considered a practice session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Days 2-35: The subject will perform one self-imaging session each day on the study&#xD;
           eye(s) with the NVHO device followed by automated transmission. Each scan has a&#xD;
           reliability score provided by the NVHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Note: If an eye fails to self-image five consecutive times, the subject will be notified&#xD;
           by the NVDC to discontinue self-imaging this eye and NVDC will collect the corresponding&#xD;
           information such as the corresponding eye, self-image discontinuation reason, and the&#xD;
           self-image stopping date. If there is a fellow eye also enrolled in the study, the&#xD;
           fellow eye will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Collect AEs, if applicable, as reported by telephone call or office visit to the&#xD;
           investigational site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1 (Post NVHO Setup Period)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the clinic for an office visit one week after the NVHO Setup Period&#xD;
      (Home Set-up). The sponsor will provide transportation upon request. At this visit, the exams&#xD;
      will be conducted in the following order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eye exams, including Snellen BCVA and subjective symptoms (visual distortions, blurry&#xD;
           vision, and scotoma) will be performed on both eyes on the day of the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Both eyes of the subject will be imaged using a commercial Zeiss Cirrus OCT using the&#xD;
           6mmX6mm, 512X128 volume scan program, with a maximum of three attempts for each eye to&#xD;
           reach an acceptable image quality per the Cirrus User's Guide and reviewed by the PI to&#xD;
           determine fluid status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Initiate standard of care and treatment, if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Collect AEs, if applicable. Week 5 / Exit (Post NVHO Setup Period)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the clinic for an office visit five weeks after the NVHO Setup Period&#xD;
      (Home Set-up). At this visit, the exams will be conducted in the following order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eye exams, including Snellen BCVA and subjective symptoms (visual distortions, blurry&#xD;
           vision, and scotoma) will be performed on both eyes on the day of the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Both eyes of the subject will be imaged using a commercial Zeiss Cirrus OCT using the&#xD;
           6mmX6mm, 512X128 volume scan program, with a maximum of three attempts for each eye to&#xD;
           reach an acceptable image quality per the Cirrus User's Guide and reviewed by the PI to&#xD;
