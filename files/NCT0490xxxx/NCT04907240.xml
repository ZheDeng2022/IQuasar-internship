      This is an Observational, prospective, single-arm, multicenter, post-market registry to&#xD;
      collect real-world post-market clinical follow-up data on patients treated with the GORE®&#xD;
      VIABAHN® Endoprosthesis with PROPATEN Bioactive Surface (VSX) for one of the following&#xD;
      indications: Iliac, Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA), Superficial Femoral Artery In-stent&#xD;
      restenosis (SFA ISR), Hemodialysis access (AV access), Visceral artery aneurysms (VAA),&#xD;
      Trauma/Injury, Popliteal Artery Aneurysms (PAA), or Other. Approximately 35 sites in Europe&#xD;
      will participate and a minimum of 614 patients will be enrolled in this registry. All&#xD;
      consecutive patients meeting protocol selection criteria, consented, with an intention to be&#xD;
      treated with the GORE® VIABAHN® Endoprosthesis with PROPATEN Bioactive Surface (VSX) will be&#xD;
      included and followed through one year for Trauma/Injury and other; three years for VAA; five&#xD;
      years for Iliac, SFA, SFA ISR and AV access and ten years for PAA per institutional standard&#xD;
      of care.&#xD;

        All consecutive patients presenting with an indication for endovascular repair of one of&#xD;
        the eight indications (iliac, SFA, SFA ISR, VAA, PAA, Trauma/Injury, AV access and others)&#xD;
        are eligible for screening for participation in the registry. Only patients who meet all&#xD;
        inclusion and no exclusion criteria, and who consent to participate will be enrolled.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Signed informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Suitable for endovascular treatment with VSX based on treating physician's best&#xD;
             medical judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willingness of the patient to adhere to institutional standard of care follow-up&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Non-compliant lesions where full expansion of an angioplasty balloon catheter is not&#xD;
             achievable during pre-dilatation, or where lesions cannot be dilated sufficiently to&#xD;
             allow passage of the delivery system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Use of the VSX Device in lesions involving a major side branch that may be covered by&#xD;
             the endoprosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Lesion(s) cannot be treated with available VSX Device sizes per current Instructions&#xD;
             for Use (IFU).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Lesion requires treatment with an altered endoprosthesis or delivery system. (Do not&#xD;
             cut the endoprosthesis. The endoprosthesis should only be placed and deployed using&#xD;
             the supplied catheter system).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Previous or concurrent enrollment into this registry (e.g., previous enrollment into&#xD;
             another treatment cohort or patient requires enrollment into more than one cohort)&#xD;
             (Note: Only the first VSX treatment will be enrolled if concurrent VSX procedures are&#xD;
             performed that would require enrollment into more than one cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participation in concurrent research study or registry which may confound registry&#xD;
             results, unless approved by Gore.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known hypersensitivity to heparin or a previous incident of Heparin-Induced&#xD;
             Thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Unable to tolerate antiplatelet therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient has a non-controllable allergy to contrast or the VSX Device components.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pregnant or breast-feeding female at time of informed consent signature.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Life expectancy &lt; 12 months due to comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient has other medical conditions which, as determined by the investigator, may&#xD;
             confound the data interpretation (e.g., sepsis, thrombophilic diseases, connective&#xD;
             tissue disorders).&#xD;
