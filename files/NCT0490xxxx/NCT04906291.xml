  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this RCT was to verify the caries preventive efficacy of toothpastes containing&#xD;
      biomimetic hydroxyapatite (H.A.) complex in children compared to traditional fluoridated&#xD;
      toothpastes. In total 610 children of two age groups (4-5 years and 6-7 years at baseline)&#xD;
      were enrolled. Four toothpastes, two containing fluoride-substituted hydroxyapatite (H.A.F.)&#xD;
      (1000 and 1450 ppm F-) and magnesium-, strontium-, carbonate-substituted hydroxyapatite, in a&#xD;
      chitosan matrix and two traditional fluoridated toothpastes (1000 and 1450 ppm F-) without&#xD;
      other active components were administered randomly to two groups with younger children&#xD;
      (Gyoung) and to two groups with older children those containing1450 ppm F (GOLD) during 24&#xD;
      months. A standardized questionnaire was administered to parents/caregivers to gain&#xD;
      information regarding caries risk factors. Caries evaluation was performed at school using&#xD;
      ICDAS, scoring lesions as initial (up to score 2), moderate (scores 3-4) and severe (scores&#xD;
      5-6).&#xD;
