      To assess the integration of the DreaMed Advisor Pro tool into a real-world clinical practice&#xD;
      using both in person and virtual visits to assess benefits in glycemia, as measured by the&#xD;
      glucose management indicator and other glucose metrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine acceptability of the DreaMed Advisor Pro tool both from a person with diabetes&#xD;
      as well as a health care provider perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To quantify the potential reimbursement potential that could be generated with use of the&#xD;
      DreaMed Advisor Pro.&#xD;

    <description>Glucose mangement indicator (GMI) will be used to determine glucose control. The GMI indicates the average A1C level that would be expected based on mean glucose measured in a large number of individuals with diabetes. Mean glucose ideally is derived from at least 14 days of CGM data</description>

&#xD;
               1. Insulin pump must not use automated insulin delivery (closed loop, artificial&#xD;
                  pancreas)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Participants / parents are required to have minimum computer skills and access to a&#xD;
             computer in order to upload their personal devices (Pump, BG meter etc) to Tidepool.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participants using Dexcom sensors will allow access to their account for the study&#xD;
             duration&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participants not using CGM must agree to test BG at least 4 times a day at appropriate&#xD;
             intervals&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participants / parents will have to have a smartphone (Apple or Android and Windows)&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Any significant diseases / conditions including psychiatric disorders and substance&#xD;
             abuse that in the opinion of the investigator is likely to affect the subject's&#xD;
             ability to complete the study or compromise patient's safety,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current participation in any other interventional study&#xD;

             glucose such as Pramlintide, Metformin and GLP-1 analogs. Beta blockers,&#xD;
             glucocorticoids and other medications, which in the judgment of the investigator would&#xD;
