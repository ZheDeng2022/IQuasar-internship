  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the clinical benefit as well as the safety, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) (reduction of galactitol levels) of AT-007 in pediatric&#xD;
      subjects with Classic Galactosemia (CG).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in pediatric subjects with CG.&#xD;
      Three age groups (≥2 to ≤6-year olds, ≥7 to ≤12-year olds, and ≥13 to &lt;18- year olds) will be&#xD;
      enrolled. The study is designed to assess the clinical benefit (changes in how pediatric&#xD;
      patients with CG feels and function, changes in ocular disorders, and changes in sexual&#xD;
      maturation, growth and development) as well as the safety, PK, and PD (reduction of&#xD;
      galactitol levels) of AT-007 in pediatric subjects with CG. The study consists of 2 main&#xD;
      parts, Part A and Part B, and an open-label extension (OLE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A is an intra-patient dose escalation evaluating multiple ascending doses (MAD) of&#xD;
      AT-007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A biomarker analysis will be performed at Month 1 - 3 to assess the inhibition of galactitol,&#xD;
      as well as the levels of galactose and its other metabolites, safety and PK parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is designed to assess the clinical benefits of long-term administration of AT-007 (at&#xD;
      the optimum dose identified in Part A) on how patients with CG feel and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label extension (OLE) is an active treatment extension for patients who received placebo&#xD;
      treatment in Part B.&#xD;
