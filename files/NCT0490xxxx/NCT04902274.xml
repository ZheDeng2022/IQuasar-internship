  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reducing pain and recovery of strength and function are major challenges in physical therapy.&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel intervention that has gained&#xD;
      popularity in the rehabilitation of athletic injuries, pain management, and sports&#xD;
      performance. Acute application of tDCS has been shown to modulate the perception of effort&#xD;
      and fatigue, enhance motor learning, improve endurance performance, and improve muscular&#xD;
      power and strength. tDCS has also been shown to reduce pain in patients with chronic pain&#xD;
      conditions. Using a double-blind, randomized clinical trial design, we aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of tDCS plus standard rehabilitation compared to rehabilitation alone on pain,&#xD;
      balance and proprioception, functional performance, and strength following acute ankle&#xD;
      inversion sprain. We hypothesize that the group using tDCS will demonstrate superior outcomes&#xD;
      in all variables of interest.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the experimental group will receive the current standard of care in ankle inversion sprain rehabilitation plus a 20-minute application of tDCS during each treatment session via the Halo Sport (Halo Neuroscience, San Francisco, CA) headset. The rehabilitation program will be standardized among all patients and will consist of therapeutic exercises, manual physical therapy, and other modalities. Rehabilitation sessions will be performed 2x weekly and sessions will last approximately 45 to 60 minutes.</description>

    <description>Participants in the sham control group will receive the current standard of care in ankle inversion sprain rehabilitation plus a 20-minute sham tDCS treatment, where the patient is wearing the tDCS headset, but stimulation is only applied for 30 seconds of the 20-minute period. The rehabilitation program will be standardized among all patients and will consist of therapeutic exercises, manual physical therapy, and other modalities. Rehabilitation sessions will be performed 2x weekly and sessions will last approximately 45 to 60 minutes.</description>

    <description>The Halo Sport (Halo Neuroscience, San Francisco, CA) is a commercial off-the-shelf tDCS device that delivers a 2.2 mA current to the motor cortex through three elastomer foam scalp pads with a 24 sq. cm surface area (see https://www.haloneuro.com/). The tDCS is controlled through the Halo Sport App where the therapist and patient are blind to an actual or sham treatment. Patients in the tDCS group will complete a 20-minute tDCS session while performing the warm-up.</description>

    <description>After the tDCS session is complete, the patient will complete treatment consistent with the standard of care for rehabilitation of acute ankle inversion sprain. The rehabilitation program will be standardized among all patients and will consist of therapeutic exercises, manual physical therapy, and other modalities. Rehabilitation sessions will be performed 2x weekly and sessions will last approximately 45 to 60 minutes. Patients will also perform a standardized home exercise program that reinforces the in-clinic treatment.</description>
