      This Phase III study is a global multicenter, randomized, double-blind,placebo controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of therecombinant&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine (Sf9 cells) in 40,000 participants aged 18 years and older who do not have a&#xD;
      known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection but whose locations or circumstances put them at&#xD;

      This Phase III study is a global multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the recombinant&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine (Sf9 cells) in 40,000 participants aged 18 years and older who do not have a&#xD;
      known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection but whose locations or circumstances put them at&#xD;
      appreciable risk of acquiring COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection. All participants will receive&#xD;
      three doses of either study vaccine or placebo on Day 0, Day 21, Day 42 in a ratio of&#xD;
      1:1.There will be two cohorts in the study: the efficacy-safety cohort and the&#xD;
      efficacy-extended safety-immunogenicity cohort. The efficacy will be evaluated in all&#xD;
      vaccinated participants,including population in the efficacy-safety cohort, the&#xD;
      efficacy-extended safety immunogenicity cohort. All vaccinated participants will also be&#xD;
      followed up to monitor incidence of SAEs, MAAEs and AESIs. The reactogenicity of the vaccine&#xD;
      will be evaluated in the efficacy-extended safety-immunogenicity cohort. Approximately 3000&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled into the efficacy-extended safety-immunogenicity cohort. This&#xD;
      cohort will undergo additional visits to collect immunogenicity data associated with&#xD;
      receiving the recombinant COVID-19 vaccine (Sf9 cells) and to analyze the infection status.&#xD;

             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to allow the investigators to discuss the volunteer's medical history with&#xD;
             their general practitioner/personal doctor and access all medical records which are&#xD;
             relevant to study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy adults, or stable-healthy adults who may have a pre-existing medical condition&#xD;
             that does not meet any exclusion criteria. A stable medical condition is defined as a&#xD;
             disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening&#xD;
             disease during the 3 months before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For females of childbearing potential only, willingness to practice continuous&#xD;
             effective contraception (see glossary) for 90 days after completion of 3 doses&#xD;
             vaccination, and have negative pregnancy tests before each dose vaccination. Note:&#xD;
             Nonchildbearing potential is defined as surgically sterile (history of bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as&#xD;
             amenorrhea for ≥ 12 consecutive months prior to Screening without an alternative&#xD;
             medical cause). A follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level may be measured at the&#xD;
             discretion of the investigator to confirm postmenopausal status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males participating in this study who are involved in heterosexual sexual activity&#xD;
             must agree to practice adequate contraception (see glossary) and refrain from donating&#xD;

             their serostatus during the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Disclosure of serostatus post enrolment may accidentally unblind participants to&#xD;
        group allocation. Participation in this trial can only be allowed if volunteers are kept&#xD;
        blinded to their serology results from local/national serological surveys&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned receipt of any licensed or investigational vaccine, other than the study&#xD;

             receiving study vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current diagnosis or treatment of cancer (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin and&#xD;
             cervical carcinoma in situ)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of serious psychiatric condition likely to affect participation in the study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Continuous use of anticoagulants, such as coumarins and related anticoagulants (i.e.&#xD;
             warfarin) or novel oral anticoagulants (i.e. apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and&#xD;
             edoxaban)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other significant disease, disorder, or finding which may significantly increase&#xD;
             the risk to the volunteer because of participation in the study, affect the ability of&#xD;
             the volunteer to participate in the study, or impair interpretation of the study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for the second/third dose In this trial, the second/third dose&#xD;
        vaccination may be terminated in some cases. These include systemic allergic reactions,&#xD;
        severe hypersensitivity reactions, or intolerable grade 3 or higher adverse reactions after&#xD;
        the previous vaccination/placebo. If these reactions occur, the participants should not&#xD;
