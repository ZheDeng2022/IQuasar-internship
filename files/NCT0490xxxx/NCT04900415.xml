  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A combination of oral vitamin A (VitA) and intense aromatic chemosensory smell training (ST)&#xD;
      by pulse aromatic stimulation will expedite the neurosensory recovery of olfaction in&#xD;
      patients suffering from prolonged COVID-19-related olfactory dysfunction (OD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-labeled randomised-controlled trial (RCT) investigating the safety and&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy of oral VitA in combination with ST for patients suffering from&#xD;
      prolonged COVID-19-related OD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the initiation of treatment, all patients will receive subjective and objective&#xD;
      olfactory assessments. Comprehensive ear, nose, and throat (ENT) examination will be&#xD;
      performed to rule out alternative causes of OD. All participants will receive resting-state&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) of the brain before treatment as baseline&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with prolonged COVID-19-related OD will be assigned to the intervention (group A or&#xD;
      B) or control (group C) arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arm A. 14-day course of daily oral VitA 7500µg RAE (retinol activity&#xD;
      equivalents) in combination with ST three times per day for 4 weeks; or B. ST three times per&#xD;
      day for 4 weeks alone; or&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm C. Observation&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, healthy controls who were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse&#xD;
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) will receive rs-fMRI brain scans for&#xD;
      radiological comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the trial, subjective and objective olfactory assessments will be&#xD;
      repeated to document clinical changes in olfaction. Follow-up rs-fMRI will be performed to&#xD;
      document neuroradiological changes in the brain structures and cerebral network functional&#xD;
      connectivity (FC).&#xD;
