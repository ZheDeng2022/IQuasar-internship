  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The United States is experiencing an opioid epidemic. Sadly, opioid-related fatalities are on&#xD;
      the rise, causing profound emotional, financial, and cultural impacts. One way to reduce&#xD;
      these negative impacts is to prevent people from developing opioid use problems in the first&#xD;
      place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research shows that youth and young adults in the juvenile justice system have higher rates&#xD;
      of opioid use disorder than other young people in the general population. The POST Study&#xD;
      seeks develop, implement and evaluate the effectiveness and cost of 3 opioid use prevention&#xD;
      programs of varying intensities. The prevention programs are designed specifically for youth&#xD;
      and young adults living in justice settings. It is implemented during the time they are&#xD;
      transitioning out of incarceration and back into the community. The research team hopes their&#xD;
      results will help justice settings implement their own effective opioid prevention programs&#xD;
      in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-prescription opioid use in adolescents and young adults is epidemic in our country and&#xD;
      overdose-related fatalities are rising. Adolescents and young adults in justice settings&#xD;
      (AYAJS) have some of the highest rates of opioid use disorder (OUD), with national rates&#xD;
      approaching 20%. The majority of AYAJS engage in problematic non-opioid substance use, which&#xD;
      is a critical risk factor for OUD. Non-opioid substance use disorders (SUDs) and OUD, in&#xD;
      turn, are two of the most important predictors of subsequent re-involvement in juvenile or&#xD;
      criminal justice systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers at Seattle Children's Research Institute, the University of&#xD;
      Washington, Michigan State University, and Washington State Juvenile&#xD;
      Rehabilitation/Department of Children Youth and Families will collaboratively pilot test an&#xD;
      evaluation of OUD prevention interventions of varying intensities based on the Adolescent&#xD;
      Community Reinforcement Approach with Assertive Continuing Care (ACRA+ACC). Multiple studies&#xD;
      have established effectiveness of ACRA+ACC in reducing SUD; however, none has evaluated it as&#xD;
      an OUD prevention strategy. SUD is incredibly common and costly among AYAJS; thus&#xD;
      ACRA+ACC-based approaches are likely to be effective and cost-beneficial OUD prevention&#xD;
      strategies for this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators seek to determine the optimal intensity of an ACRA+ACC-based OUD prevention&#xD;
      intervention for AYAJS with and without non-opioid SUD, as these groups are likely to have&#xD;
      differing prevention needs. To do so, they will use a Sequential Multiple Assignment&#xD;
      Randomized Trial (SMART) study design to construct high-quality adaptive interventions with&#xD;
      ACRA+ACC-based OUD prevention strategies of different intensity levels among SUD and non-SUD&#xD;
      youth. Based on self-reported substance use at 1 month post-release, participants may be&#xD;
      re-randomized into another study arm. This will both address treatment need and provide data&#xD;
      for subsequent effectiveness and cost analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase I of this study, researchers will collaboratively plan for a SMART experiment, i.e.:&#xD;
      finalize infrastructure, recruitment, intervention, and data collection procedures; and&#xD;
      create infrastructure for the possibility of future implementation of effective&#xD;
      interventions. They will conduct a pilot with 50 AYAJS to assess feasibility of protocols and&#xD;
      procedures, recruitment, engagement, and retention strategies in anticipation of a future&#xD;
      larger trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase II of this study, researchers will conduct a SMART trial with 420 AYAJS aged 16-25&#xD;
      without moderate or severe OUD to evaluate ACRA/ACC-based interventions of various intensity&#xD;
      levels for youth without SUD or with SUD but without moderate or severe OUD. They will also&#xD;
      conduct cost, cost-effectiveness, and benefit-cost analyses to understand the relationships&#xD;
      between intervention costs and outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>The Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) is a developmentally-appropriate behavioral treatment for youth and young adults ages 12 to 24 years old with substance use disorders. A-CRA seeks to increase the family, social, and educational/vocational reinforces to support recovery. This intervention has been implemented in outpatient, intensive outpatient, and residential treatment settings. A-CRA includes guidelines for three types of sessions: individuals alone, parents/caregivers alone, and individuals and parents/caregivers together. According to the individual's needs and self-assessment of happiness in multiple life areas, clinicians choose from a variety of A-CRA procedures that address, for example, problem-solving skills to cope with day-to-day stressors, communication skills, and active participation in positive social and recreational activities with the goal of improving life satisfaction and eliminating alcohol and substance use problems.</description>
