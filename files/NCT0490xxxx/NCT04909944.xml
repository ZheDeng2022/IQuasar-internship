    <textblock>
      Establishing a definitive airway is defined as a tube placed in the trachea with cuff&#xD;
      inflated below the vocal cords is the first priority in the airway management of the&#xD;
      pre-hospital trauma Studies revealed that the success rate of tracheal intubation in the&#xD;
      prehospital setting is suboptimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Advance Trauma Life Support suggested the use of the Supraglottic Airway Devices in&#xD;
      managing patients who require an advanced airway adjunct, but in whom intubation has failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Laryngeal Tube Suction Disposable (LTS-D), was introduced as an alternative for managing&#xD;
      the difficult airway, initially intended for routine clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within recent years, laryngeal tubes have also been reported to be successfully used in&#xD;
      emergency airway management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The i-gel disposable airway is proposed as a new supraglottic airway device (SAD) made of a&#xD;
      medical grade thermoplastic elastomer. Its unique design does not need an inflatable cuff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trail will be conducted. Participants will insert the both&#xD;
      supraglottic airway devices to compare performance of ventilation and oxygenation of the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The insertion will be performed on aged 18-75 year patients, scheduled for elective surgery&#xD;
      with general anesthesia. The SAD use in the study will be a single use i-gel size 4, an size&#xD;
      5 and the LTS-D size 4 and the size 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For induction of anesthesia, all patients will receive premedication with oral diazepam (10&#xD;
      mg). After 3 min of preoxygenation with an inspired oxygen fraction of 100%, anesthesia will&#xD;
      be induced with up to 3mcg/kg fentanyl and 2-3 mg/kg propofol and will be maintained with 70%&#xD;
      nitrous oxide/30% oxygen and sevoflurane. Neuromuscular blockade will be obtained with&#xD;
      rocuronium. After complete neuromuscular blockade, the study procedure will be initiated. The&#xD;
      participant will perform one insertion of i-gel or the LTS-D on the patient while manual&#xD;
      in-line stabilization of the neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure - insertion success rate. The primary outcome measure will be success&#xD;
      rate of effective insertion of the Supraglottic Airway Devices in the patients with&#xD;
      registration of the CO2 (carbon di oxide) curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measure - duration in seconds of the insertion. The duration of the&#xD;
      Supraglottic Airway Devices insertion will be defined as the duration time, in seconds, from&#xD;
      insertion of the Supraglottic Airway Devices in the lips of the patient until will be&#xD;
      correctly positioned in the trachea by the participant.&#xD;

      In the combat setting, airway compromise is the second leading cause of preventable death&#xD;
      after hemorrhage. Establishing a definitive airway defined as a tube placed in the trachea&#xD;
      with cuff inflated below the vocal cords is the first priority in the airway management of&#xD;
      the pre-hospital trauma patient, according to the last edition of the Advanced Trauma Life&#xD;
      Support (ATLS) textbook, of the American College of Surgeons. However, studies revealed that&#xD;
      the success rate of tracheal intubation in the prehospital setting using direct laryngoscopy,&#xD;
      the standard intubation technique) is suboptimal. Possible reasons for the failure in&#xD;
      achieving definitive airway in trauma patients are the requirement for in-line stabilization&#xD;
      of the neck, and the inexperience of the care providers. The Tactical Combat Casualty Care&#xD;
      Guidelines recommend using a supra glottic airway device as an option to assist in securing&#xD;
      the airway in tactical evacuation phase of care. The utility of a supraglottic airway device&#xD;
      is also recommended by the American College of Surgeons. In a randomized controlled trail in&#xD;
      patient, the success of blind intubation did not support the use of tracheal intubation via&#xD;
      intubating Laryngeal Tube Suction-Disposable (iLTS-D) by novice intubators. However, this&#xD;
      study revealed a high success rate (84.6%) of intubating Laryngeal Tube Suction-Disposable&#xD;
      placement in the oropharynx, associated with effective ventilation as confirmed by&#xD;
      capnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time to obtain successful iLTS-D placement in the oropharynx was 42 sec, which is 2.5&#xD;
      times shorter than the time to achieve tracheal intubation with Direct Laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings suggest that novice intubators can use a second generation Supraglottic Airway&#xD;
      Device as the first airway intervention in trauma patients who require immediate airway&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ATLS suggested the use of the Supraglottic Airway Devices (SGAD) in managing patients who&#xD;
      require an advanced airway adjunct, but in whom intubation has failed or is unlikely to&#xD;
      succeed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Association of Anesthesiology include the use of Supraglottic Airway Device in&#xD;
      the control of the airway in cases of difficult intubation Difficult Airway Society 2015&#xD;
      guidelines for management of unanticipated difficult intubation in adults included the use of&#xD;
      SGAD in the Guidelines of difficult intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4th National Audit Project of The Royal College of Anaesthetists and The Difficult Airway&#xD;
      Society recommends that all hospitals have second generation Supraglottic Airway Devices&#xD;
      available for both routine use and rescue airway management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These devices play a key role as primary and rescue devices in predicted and unanticipated&#xD;
      difficult airway management, by providing both a patent airway for oxygenation and&#xD;
      ventilation and a conduit for Tracheal Intubation thereby avoiding the disastrous outcomes of&#xD;
      'cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate' situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently study reported the effectiveness of initial Laryngeal Tube (LT) insertion vs initial&#xD;
      Endotracheal Intubation (ETI) in adults out of Hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This study&#xD;
      concludes that a strategy of initial LT insertion was associated with significantly greater&#xD;
      72-hour survival compare with a strategy of initial Endotracheal Intubation (ETI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings suggest that LT insertion may be considered as an initial airway management&#xD;
      strategy in patients with OHCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laryngeal tube and its derivatives, the laryngeal tube suction, were introduced as an&#xD;
      alternative for managing the difficult airway, initially intended for routine clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within recent years, laryngeal tubes have also been reported to be successfully used for&#xD;
      out-of-hospital and emergency airway management.&#xD;

      The i-gel disposable airway (Intersurgical Ltd, Workingham, UK) is proposed as a new&#xD;
      supraglottic airway device made of a medical grade thermoplastic elastomer. Its unique design&#xD;
      does not need an inflatable cuff because the thermoplastic elastomer provides the seal&#xD;
      Initial studies have demonstrated that the i-gel can be placed more quickly than conventional&#xD;
      laryngeal mask airways, which might play a role in prehospital settings other advantages in&#xD;
      ease of training, size and weight, cost, safety, and simplicity of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Tactical Combat Casualty Care ( TCCC) suggested the use of extraglottic airways (EGAs) as&#xD;
      an option for airway management in Tactical Field Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TCCC recommends the second-generation supraglottic airway device i-gel as the preferred&#xD;
      EGA because its gel-filled cuff makes it simpler to use and avoids the need for cuff&#xD;
      inflation and monitoring. If an EGA with an air-filled cuff is used, the cuff pressure must&#xD;
      be monitored to avoid over pressurization, especially during Tactical Evacuation Care&#xD;
      (TACEVAC) on an aircraft with the accompanying pressure changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGA s play a key role as primary and rescue devices in predicted and unanticipated difficult&#xD;
      airway management, by providing both a patent airway for oxygenation and ventilation and a&#xD;
      conduit for TI , thereby avoiding the disastrous outcomes of 'cannot intubate, cannot&#xD;
      oxygenate' situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design A randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Participants will perform&#xD;
      tracheal intubation using The Laryngeal Tube Suction Disposable and their performance will be&#xD;
      compared with the use of i-gel to ventilated and oxygenate the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the operating room of a Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa,&#xD;
      Israel. The study will be approved by the Institutional of Human Ethics Committee , and a&#xD;
      written consent will be obtained from all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be registered in the Clinical Trial.gov&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants Study participants will be medical interns who will be assigned to the&#xD;
      Department of Anesthesiology as part of their one-year internship. Medical interns in Israel&#xD;
      receive non-formal training in cardiac life support and trauma life support as part of the&#xD;
      medical school curriculum. None of the study participants will have a prior clinical&#xD;
      experience with the EGAs. Only subjects who accomplished a Cardiac Advanced Life Support&#xD;
      course in their 6th year of medical school and had some experience with intubation will&#xD;
      requited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients The intubations will be performed on aged 18-75 year patients, scheduled for&#xD;
      elective surgery with general anesthesia, who will have an American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists physical status of I or II, and will agree to undergo the procedure by a&#xD;
      novice intubator, supervised by a senior anesthesiologist. To identify the presence of&#xD;
      difficult airway preoperatively, a combination of predictors will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study instruments The EGA use in the study will be a single use i-gel size 4 for medium adult&#xD;
      weight 50-90 Kg. and size 5 for large adult more than 90 Kg. and the Laryngeal Tube Suction&#xD;
      Disposable size 4 for patients weight 50-90 Kg and size 5 for patients more than 90 Kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure Patients For induction of anesthesia, all patients will receive premedication&#xD;
      with oral diazepam (10 or 20 mg). After 3 min of preoxygenation with an inspired oxygen&#xD;
      fraction of 100%, anesthesia will be induced with up to 3mcg/kg fentanyl and 2-3 mg/kg&#xD;
      propofol and be maintained with 70% nitrous oxide/30% oxygen and sevoflurane. Neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockade will be obtained with rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After confirmation of complete neuromuscular blockade, the study procedure will initiate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgery, the patients will be transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups of the study .&#xD;
      When patient will be ready to be anesthetized, the participant will enter the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will then be asked by the study investigator to independently perform one&#xD;
      insertion attempt using the EGA i-gel or the LTS-D on the patient while manual in-line&#xD;
      stabilization of the neck will be performed by the study investigator. The study&#xD;
      investigators will not intervene with the procedure or provide any consultation or&#xD;
      recommendation, and participants will not be allowed to watch others performing the&#xD;
      procedure. If a failed insertion of the EGA , the study investigator will perform the&#xD;
      intubation using direct laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure -insertion EGA success rate The primary outcome measure will be&#xD;
      success rate verified by inflating the patient's lungs through the EGA using the anesthetic&#xD;
      circuit and by the CO2 capnography monitor tracing curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measure - duration in second of the EGA insertion. The time to achieve&#xD;
      successful ventilation via bag-mask ventilation will be defined as the duration of time&#xD;
      duration from insertion of the laryngoscope or the EGA between the lips of the patient until&#xD;
      identification of capnography curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success of correct placement of i-gel or LTS-D within the oropharynx was verified by the&#xD;
      insufflation of the patient lungs and the appearance of the CO2 capnography curve.&#xD;
