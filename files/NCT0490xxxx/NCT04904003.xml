  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the project is to explore which elements of rehabilitation that influence&#xD;
      mobility in new and experienced unilateral lower-limb amputees.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both new and experienced unilateral lower limb amputees (LLA) describe difficulties when&#xD;
      ambulating intentionally and independently from one place to another using prosthesis. In&#xD;
      LLA, this decreased ability to mobilize affect daily functioning and may result in low&#xD;
      activity-levels, impeded social participation and reduced health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both primary and secondary rehabilitation of LLA have implications for functional mobility.&#xD;
      The consensus among health professionals is that LLA should train to improve their ability to&#xD;
      ambulate. However, knowledge from research regarding which elements that constitute effective&#xD;
      training and how systematic exercise affects body structures, functions, activity and&#xD;
      participation in lower limb amputees, is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There also is a lack of knowledge of how prosthetic users endure and process the challenges&#xD;
      regarding mobility, how they adapt to the use of their prosthesis, how safe they are&#xD;
      ambulating using the prosthesis, and how pain and psychosocial issues affect their perceived&#xD;
      health and mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this Ph.D.-project is to explore how a period of semi-standardized individualized&#xD;
      rehabilitation originating from an evidence-based approach, affect the functional mobility of&#xD;
      both new and experienced LLA, and how LLA process the loss of a limb and challenges during&#xD;
      ambulation.&#xD;
