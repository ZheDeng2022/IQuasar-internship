      December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia with fever, cough, and dyspnea as clinical&#xD;
      manifestations have been found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (Huang C et al., 2020) The&#xD;
      analysis of the whole genome sequence of the respiratory samples suggests that it is a new&#xD;
      type of betacoronavirus (Lu R, Zhao X, Li J et al ., 2020), which resembled severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)] (Zhu N, Zhang D, Wang W et al .,2020). On&#xD;
      February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named it coronavirus&#xD;
      disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 may be asymptomatic or manifest in 3 clinical phases, an initial&#xD;
      upper respiratory tract infection, with a few patients thereafter progressing to a pneumonic&#xD;
      phase, and an even smaller number to the hyperinflammatory phase which may be lethal [&#xD;
      (Siddiqi H.K et al.,2020). The aim of any therapy would be to intervene at an early stage,&#xD;
      either prophylactically or therapeutically, to prevent progression of the disease to a point&#xD;
      where mechanical ventilation (MV) is required, or significant organ dysfunction occurs&#xD;
      (Richards G et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors for a poor outcome include older age, comorbidity (in particular diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension and cardiac disease), non-asthmatic respiratory disease, obesity,&#xD;
      immunosuppression and male sex (Williamson et al., 2020). The independent associations of&#xD;
      advancing age, male sex, chronic respiratory conditions (though not well controlled asthma),&#xD;
      chronic cardiac and chronic neurological disease with in-hospital mortality, are in line with&#xD;
      other international reports - It is difficult however to determine why these conditions&#xD;
      specifically are linked to mortality .(Clohisey S et al., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the general concept of an excessive or uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines is well known, an actual definition of what a hyperinflammatory response or&#xD;
      &quot;Cytokine Storm&quot; In this phase, there is an unbalanced and exacerbated inflammatory response&#xD;
      with the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6&#xD;
      (IL-6), as pro-inflammatory mediators together with interleukin 10 (IL-10) and interferon β&#xD;
      as anti-inflammatory mediators. The complex interactions between TNF-α, the interleukins,&#xD;
      chemokines and interferons in SARS-CoV-2 are currently poorly understood; however, they are&#xD;
      associated with and related to a significant viraemia (Schultz M.B et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      February 13, the journal ofRadiology has published several articles on the imaging features&#xD;
      of COVID-19 (Chung M, Bernheim et al., 2019) but all of them are descriptive analyses. In&#xD;
      February 2020, the Chinese Society of Radiology issued the radiologic diagnosis of pneumonia&#xD;
      with COVID-19. CT plays an important role in the screening and diagnosis of COVID-19. The&#xD;
      first edition of the experts (Lei J, Li J, Li X, Qi X et al., 2020)divided CT manifestations&#xD;
      into three stages: early, progressive, and severe according to the extent and features of the&#xD;
      pulmonary abnormalities. However, it did not clarify the relationship between the extent of&#xD;
      inflammation and the clinical presentation of the patient. cases were divided into four&#xD;
      groups: minimal, common, severe, and critical according to whether there were clinical&#xD;
      symptoms, severity of pneumonia, respiratory failure, shock, other organ failure, etc., based&#xD;
      on the Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of COVID-19 issued by National Health Commission (7th&#xD;
      ed.) (in Chinese) (Fang Y, Zhang H et al., 2019). (1) Mild type: mild clinical symptoms&#xD;
      without pneumonia in imaging; (2) common type: fever, respiratory tract and other symptoms&#xD;
      with pneumonia in imaging; (3) severe type: respiratory distress, respiratory rate ≥ 30&#xD;
      times/min; in resting state, oxygen saturation ≤ 93%; NAD+ is a cofactor found in every cell&#xD;
      of the body, and it is involved in multiple metabolic pathways. It is a fundamental&#xD;
      housekeeping molecule that catalyses electron transfer in metabolic reduction-oxidation&#xD;
      reactions, functioning as an electron shuttle in the production of adenosine triphosphate&#xD;
      (ATP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sirtuins are an ancient family of seven NAD+-dependent deacylase and mono-ADP-ribosyl&#xD;
      transferase signalling proteins that are intrinsically involved in metabolic regulation and&#xD;
      cellular homeostasis. Of particular interest is SIRT1, which downregulates ADAM 17 (A&#xD;
      Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase Domain 17), also called TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE), by&#xD;
      increasing expression of TIMP3 the gene that encodes for tissue metalloproteinase inhibitor 3&#xD;
      [] (Fontani F et al., 2017) . In so doing it decreases levels of TNF-α, IL-1b and IL-6. An&#xD;
      increase in TNF-α causes SIRT1 to down-regulate ADAM 17, thereby controlling TNF-α formation&#xD;
      in a negative feedback loop that secondarily influences IL-1b and IL-6 production, which are&#xD;
      dependent on TNF-α []. ADAM17 is a proteinase encoding gene. TNF-α and the cytokine receptor&#xD;
      for IL-6 must be proteolytically cleaved in order to be systemically active, and ADAM17&#xD;
      provides this function. If ADAM17 expression is not downregulated by SIRT1, TNF-α and IL-6&#xD;
      are released, resulting in an uncontrolled hyperinflammatory response as may occur with&#xD;
      COVID-19 (Cardellini M et al., 2009). SIRT 1, by inhibition of ADAM17 and thereby TNF-α and&#xD;
      IL-6, performs an anti-inflammatory function . Upregulation of SIRT1 (Shin M.R et al., 2015)&#xD;
      directly decreases viral replication and inhibits the activation of ADAM17, thereby&#xD;
      decreasing TNF-α, IL-1b and IL-6. Conversely depletion of SIRT1 allows for increased viral&#xD;
      replication with little or no inhibition of ADAM17 activity, causing uncontrolled increases&#xD;
      in TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1b. Whereas an increase in TNF-α would usually increase SIRT1 activity&#xD;
      to downregulate ADAM17, in the presence of a deficiency of NAD+ or Zn++, this would not occur&#xD;
      due to insufficient activation of SIRT1, causing an unchecked increase in TNF-α.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased age is a strong predictor of SARS-CoV-2-associated in-hospital mortality after&#xD;
      adjusting for comorbidity Older patients have also been identified as having the lowest&#xD;
      levels of NAD+ (Xie J.et al., 2015), while, conversely, those with the lowest risk, infants&#xD;
      and children have the highest levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress also activates the NAD+-dependent enzyme, poly ADP ribose polymerase 1&#xD;
      (PARP1) (Yoo C.-Het al., 2014) hyperactivity of PARP1 results in depletion of cellular NAD+&#xD;
      pools, leading to ATP deficiency, energy loss, and subsequent cell death. These processes&#xD;
      have the potential to enhance the pro-inflammatory cascade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAD+ deficiency impairs SIRT1 function (Guarente L et al., 2014) and its successful&#xD;
      activation. Whereas extreme niacin deficiency is associated with the development of pellagra,&#xD;
      more subtle decreases occur in diabetes, ageing PARP-1 is an abundant nuclear enzyme that&#xD;
      modifies substrates by poly(ADP-ribose)-ylation. PARP-1 has well-described functions in DNA&#xD;
      damage repair and also functions as a context-specific regulator of transcription factor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidized and reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+ and NADH respectively) are&#xD;
      crucial metabolites in metabolic reactions. PARP-1 and PARP-2 use NAD+ as a cofactor in their&#xD;
      catalytic activity. Continuous PARP activation can reduce intracellular levels of NAD+ by 80%&#xD;
      and raises nicotinamide (NAM). SIRT1 is a NAD+-dependent protein deactelyase. (P. Bai et al.,&#xD;
      2011) It has been known that the decrease of NAD+ and the increase of NAM ensured by enhanced&#xD;
      PARP activity correlates with a downregulation of SIRT1 activity (J Biol Chem et al.,&#xD;
      2005)similarly, the activation of SIRT1 reduced PARP activity. These observations raised four&#xD;
      possible crosstalks between SIRT1, PARP-1&#xD;
