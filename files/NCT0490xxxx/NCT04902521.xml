  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the most common cause of childhood physical disability. Early CP&#xD;
      diagnosis and intervention are crucial to improving outcomes in these patients.&#xD;
      Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) has become a standard therapeutic intervention for&#xD;
      children with unilateral CP. CIMT utilizes restraining of the unaffected upper limb to&#xD;
      stimulate the use of the paretic upper limb enhancing neuroplasticity in the affected&#xD;
      cerebral hemisphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a safe non-invasive technique that stimulates the&#xD;
      brain using repetitive magnetic pulses to enhance neuroplasticity. TMS has been shown to&#xD;
      improve symptoms of children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as CP. It is predicted&#xD;
      that a combined therapy that uses CIMT and TMS is could improve mobility in children with&#xD;
      unilateral CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if combined therapy is beneficial to children with CP and if use of this therapy&#xD;
      is feasible for families, the investigators would like to conducted a feasibility trial. In&#xD;
      this trial the investigators will enrol 10 children who have unilateral CP, the participants&#xD;
      will either receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CIMT and TMS or;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CIMT and fake TMS, fake TMS consist of a child sitting near the TMS machine but not&#xD;
           receiving any TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to determine if it is feasible to conduct a large randomized&#xD;
      control trial to compare the effects of combined CIMT and TMS versus CIMT and fake TMS.The&#xD;
      investigators also hope that by conducting this trial they can identify any benefits that the&#xD;
      addition of TMS may have in children with CP.&#xD;

      Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the most common cause of childhood physical disability. Early CP&#xD;
      diagnosis and intervention are crucial in optimizing neuroplasticity and improving outcomes.&#xD;
      One such intervention is constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), a therapeutic approach&#xD;
      used in children with unilateral CP. CIMT utilizes restraining of the unaffected upper limb&#xD;
      to stimulate the use of the paretic upper limb enhancing neuroplasticity in the affected&#xD;
      cerebral hemisphere.CIMT is more effective than other rehabilitation approaches in improving&#xD;
      upper limb function and has become a standard therapeutic intervention for children with&#xD;
      unilateral CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a safe non-invasive technique that&#xD;
      stimulates the brain using repetitive magnetic pulses to enhance neuroplasticity. TMS has&#xD;
      been shown to produce lasting modulation of cortical activity and improve clinical symptoms&#xD;
      of children with neurodevelopmental disorders including CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent Canadian study, the PLASTIC Champs trial, demonstrated that combining TMS and CIMT&#xD;
      for children with unilateral CP secondary to perinatal stroke produced greater improvements&#xD;
      in upper limb function when compared to CIMT or TMS alone. Though promising, there are three&#xD;
      features of the Plastic Champs trial that could limit its generalizability. First, it took&#xD;
      place in a very special, intensive setting of daily CIMT/TMS during a 14-day camp. Second is&#xD;
      the single cause of CP studied. And finally, it included only school-age children. To date,&#xD;
      no research study has evaluated if findings from the PLASTIC Champs trial could be replicated&#xD;
      when utilizing the combination of CIMT and TMS in a regular clinical environment, and among&#xD;
      younger children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A feasibility study is an appropriate first step towards our plan of performing a definitive&#xD;
      RCT on the topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial the investigators will enrol 10 children who have unilateral CP, they will&#xD;
      either receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CIMT and TMS or;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CIMT and fake TMS, fake TMS consist of a child sitting near the TMS machine but not&#xD;
           receiving any TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators seek to evaluate whether, in younger children, the addition of TMS to the&#xD;
      more commonly used, intermittent outpatient regimen of CIMT improves the motor outcomes of&#xD;
      the upper limb.&#xD;
