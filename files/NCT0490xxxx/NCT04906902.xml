  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase 1/2 clinical trial testing the safety, tolerance and efficacy&#xD;
      of the drug Acalabrutinib for people with recurrent or refractory central nervous system&#xD;
      lymphoma (CNSL).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation phase 1/2 study to determine the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of Acalabrutinib in patients with recurrent&#xD;
      or refractory CNS lymphoma (R/R CNSL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acalabrutinib has been studied in lab experiments and in other types of cancer, and&#xD;
      information from these studies suggests that acalabrutinib may be beneficial for people with&#xD;
      recurrent or refractory central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL). Acalabrutinib targets a&#xD;
      vulnerable part of cancer cells which leads to an inhibition of the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved acalabrutinib for recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL) but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for up to 2 years as long as they do not have&#xD;
      serious side effects and their disease does not get worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 15 to 21 participants will be enrolled in phase1 and approximately 28 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing funding&#xD;
      for the research study and the study drug, acalabrutinib.&#xD;
