  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that new imaging agents [203Pb]VMT01 and [68Ga]VMT02 can be safely&#xD;
      used in humans without independent biological effect and can be used to image melanoma tumors&#xD;
      expressing the melanocortin sub-type 1 receptor (MC1R) by SPECT/CT and PET/CT imaging&#xD;
      modalities respectively.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human study evaluating the suitability of [203Pb]VMT01 for SPECT/CT&#xD;
      imaging and [68Ga]VMT02 for PET/CT imaging of MC1R-expressing metastatic melanoma. Study&#xD;
      results will provide foundational data to develop imaging and dosing for future therapeutic&#xD;
      trials of [212Pb]VMT01 for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a cross-over study with the participants serving as their own comparator.&#xD;
      Participants with positive FDG-PET scans for stage IV (or inoperable stage III) metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma will undergo SPECT/CT scans utilizing [203Pb]VMT01 followed a few weeks later by&#xD;
      PET/CT scans utilizing [68Ga]VMT02, or vice versa. The order of the imaging agents will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Archived tumor tissue will be tested for expression of the imaging target, melanocortin receptor sub-type 1 (MC1R). The qualified researcher who tests the sample, and the independent pathologist who reviews the results, will be blinded to a participant's identifying information and imaging results. Evaluators will not have access to the medical record.&#xD;
A pool of three qualified readers will evaluate study images (PET/CT and SPECT/CT). Images and medical information given to the readers will not include a participant's identifying information. The reader pool will not know the sequence of imaging for a participant or have access to the medical record.&#xD;
An independent medical physicist will validate imaging results and measurements of radiation absorbed and excreted by the participant's body. The physicist will be blinded to participant identifiers and demographics, as well as the sequence of imaging for a participant. The physicist will not have access to the medical record.</masking_description>
