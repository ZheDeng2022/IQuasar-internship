      To evaluate the efficacy of Tislelizumab combined with Nab-paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in the&#xD;
      treatment of recurrent pancreatic cancer&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is heterogeneity in desmoplasia between different metastatic sites in pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. The tumor quasi-characteristics of patients with metastatic PDAC at presentation were&#xD;
      more obvious than those of epithelial characteristics, and the quasi-and epithelial subtypes&#xD;
      showed different responses to chemotherapy regimens, and the epithelial phenotype tumor&#xD;
      quasi-phenotype was associated with metastasis-free survival. Therefore, different metastases&#xD;
      of pancreatic cancer may respond differently to medical treatment. There were different&#xD;
      metastases after postoperative recurrence of pancreatic cancer, 25.2% had only liver&#xD;
      metastases, 14.7% had only lung metastases, 14.7% had multiple distant metastases, and about&#xD;
      more than half of the patients had postoperative recurrence with only distant metastases and&#xD;
      no in situ metastasis. Then whether there is a difference in the efficacy of PD1 drug therapy&#xD;
      in patients with different metastases needs to be further verified.&#xD;
