    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1, first in human (FIH), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study of AL01211 in healthy adult participants and adult patients with autosomal dominant&#xD;
      polycystic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      AL01211 in a single ascending dose escalation study in approximately 40 healthy adult&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B will investigate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      of AL01211 in a multiple ascending dose escalation study in approximately 40 healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C will investigate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      AL01211 in a multiple dose study in 18 adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of autosomal&#xD;
      dominant polycystic kidney disease.&#xD;
