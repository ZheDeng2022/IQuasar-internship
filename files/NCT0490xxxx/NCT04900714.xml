  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the level of PEEP is often suboptimally applied in certain&#xD;
      operative conditions, such as in laparoscopy with head down (Trendelenburg) positioning. This&#xD;
      can result in excessive levels of lung stress and postoperative pulmonary complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with steep Trendelenburg and a pneumoperitoneum, the investigators aim to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. measure apical versus basal atelectasis using the lung ultrasound score&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. compare lung ultrasound scores at different PEEP levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. compare respiratory mechanics at the different PEEP levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. contrast the optimal PEEP level to standard practice&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. provide guidance to optimal PEEP titration in this setting for the clinician&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is&#xD;
      often incorrectly applied in certain operative conditions, such as in laparoscopy with head&#xD;
      down (Trendelenburg) positioning. This can result in excessive levels of lung stress and&#xD;
      postoperative pulmonary complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incorrect intra-operative ventilator management can be harmful for the patient, potentially&#xD;
      leading to postoperative pulmonary complications and ventilator-induced lung injury. During&#xD;
      routine anesthesia procedures, most anesthetists will set the ventilator by rule of thumb&#xD;
      with a PEEP of 4-6 cmH2O, a tidal volume of 6-8 ml/kg of ideal body weight and a frequency of&#xD;
      10-15 breaths per minute in order to provide lung protective ventilation. However, due to&#xD;
      recent advances in surgical practice, patients are more frequently placed in non-&#xD;
      physiological states, such as Trendelenburg position up to 30° with concurrent&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum and intra-abdominal pressures of 15mmHg or higher, as in for example&#xD;
      robot-assisted radical prostatectomy or gynecological procedures. This extreme positioning&#xD;
      and increased intra-abdominal pressure can have a significant effect on respiratory mechanics&#xD;
      and can potentially result in excessive lung stress. The changes in applied positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation will result in changes of regional ventilation: both an increased amount of&#xD;
      atelectasis and an increased amount of regional hyperinflation are observed in this setting.&#xD;
      The ideal PEEP level balances the recruitment of atelectasis versus excessive hyperinflation.&#xD;
      These changes in regional ventilation can be assessed by lung ultrasound. The lung ultrasound&#xD;
      score can distinguish atelectasis from normal aeration in the different lung regions of&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is designed as a single center cohort study. Non-obese (BMI &lt; 30kg/m2),&#xD;
      lung-healthy non-pregnant, non-smoking individuals without right sided heart failure,&#xD;
      scheduled for elective laparoscopy of the lower abdomen, will be recruited. Standardized&#xD;
      induction and maintenance with propofol TCI (3-6μg/l plasma concentration as calculated by&#xD;
      the Marsh model), sufentanil (0.2μg/kg) and rocuronium (0.6mg/kg) will be provided.&#xD;
      Neuromuscular blockade will be monitored using a train-of-four (TOF) monitor and kept with a&#xD;
      TOF count &lt; 1 throughout the study using additional doses if indicated. A radial arterial&#xD;
      line will be placed. Mechanical ventilation will be provided in volume control mode with a&#xD;
      tidal volume of 4-6 ml/kg of ideal body weight (IBW) aiming for a driving pressure ≤ 15cmH2O,&#xD;
      a starting PEEP of 5cmH2O, a frequency of 12-18 breaths per minute titrated to the end-tidal&#xD;
      CO2 measurement and an initial FiO2 of 0.4. An esophageal balloon catheter with pressure&#xD;
      sensor will be used to calculate transpulmonary pressures. The balloon and pressure sensor&#xD;
      will be calibrated as per manufacturers guideline. Respiratory parameters will be recorded&#xD;
      and saved for later evaluation using the FluxMed GrT monitor and software (MBMED, Argentina).&#xD;
      After inflation of the pneumoperitoneum, lung ultrasound will be performed bilaterally at the&#xD;
      midclavicular line between the second and third ribs, at the posterior axillary line above&#xD;
      the level of T4 and at the posterior axillary line closely superior to the diaphragm, thus&#xD;
      retaining 6 ultrasound loops which will be saved for post-hoc lung ultrasound scoring. The&#xD;
      lung ultrasound measurements will be repeated at different decremental levels of PEEP: 15,&#xD;
      10, 5 and 0 cmH2O respectively. Arterial blood gas analysis will be performed before&#xD;
      insufflation of the pneumoperitoneum and repeated at each level of PEEP. A minimum of 4&#xD;
      minutes equilibration time will be provided after changing PEEP.&#xD;
