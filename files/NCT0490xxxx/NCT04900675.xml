  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased stress levels are a significant problem for many students and represent a risk&#xD;
      factor for impaired mental and physical health as well as academic performance. Stress levels&#xD;
      are particularly high during the preparation phase for major exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is good evidence that light therapy is an effective treatment option to improve mood in&#xD;
      affective disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims at investigating the psychophysiological effects of a 3-week morning&#xD;
      bright light exposure in reducing stress and stress-related problems in students preparing&#xD;
      for major exams.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increased students' stress represents a significant risk factor for impaired mental and&#xD;
      physical health as well as academic performance. The World Mental Health Survey (WHO) reports&#xD;
      a 12-month prevalence of mental illness of 20.3% among students, with anxiety disorders&#xD;
      (14.7%), affective disorders (9.9%), and substance abuse (6.7%) being particularly prominent.&#xD;
      Moreover, six out of 10 students suffer from impaired sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Offering an effective treatment for stress-related symptoms in students is a challenge. In&#xD;
      situations of intense stress, conventional methods such as relaxation and mindfulness-based&#xD;
      programs often fail because of poor prior practice. Only a few students apply cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral interventions. Although medication might decrease stress symptoms within days, the&#xD;
      side effects of drugs cannot be ignored. Therefore, there is a need for effective and&#xD;
      efficient treatment of acute stress symptoms in students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bright light therapy is an effective treatment for several mental disorders, e.g. affective&#xD;
      disorders and sleep disorders. There is some evidence, that exposure to bright light may even&#xD;
      reduce stress in patients with burnout symptoms. Thus, exposure to bright light may be a&#xD;
      promising new option to reduce academic stress and improve mood and sleep parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, a large-area desk lamp, which emits diffuse light and is controllable&#xD;
      in its luminance and correlated color temperature is used. Study participants are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of two study arms: exposure to polychromatic light of (a) 5,000 lux and 5,300&#xD;
      Kelvin or (b) 50 lux and 2,200 Kelvin. Light exposure takes place in two winter periods.&#xD;

The control light condition comprises dim, reddish light. The reddish color tone in this light intervention should mask allocation to the study arm.&#xD;
