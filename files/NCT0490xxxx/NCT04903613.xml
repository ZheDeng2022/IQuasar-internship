        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adult male and female subjects (≥ 18 years) who are able and willing to provide&#xD;
             written informed consent prior to enrolling in the cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. CSU diagnosis for ≥ 6 months (defined as onset of CSU with supporting documentation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of CSU refractory to H1-AH at locally label approved doses and to&#xD;
             omalizumab, as assessed by the treating physician, using one of the following tools:&#xD;
             UAS7, UCT or DLQI&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Not eligible or able to enroll in a clinical trial or no relevant clinical trials&#xD;
             available&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of hypersensitivity to any drugs or metabolites of similar chemical classes as&#xD;
             ligelizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Contraindications or hypersensitivity to H1-antihistamines (including but not limited&#xD;
             to fexofenadine, loratadine, desloratadine, cetirizine, levocetirizine, rupatadine),&#xD;
             epinephrine or any of their ingredients or excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of anaphylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with evidence of helminthic parasitic infection as evidenced by stools being&#xD;
             positive for a pathogenic organism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Presence of clinically significant cardiovascular (such as but not limited to&#xD;
             myocardial infarction, unstable ischemic heart disease, NYHA Class III/IV left&#xD;
             ventricular failure, arrhythmia and uncontrolled hypertension within 12 months prior&#xD;
             to enrollment in Cohort MAP), neurological, psychiatric, metabolic or other&#xD;
             pathological conditions (such as but not limited to cerebrovascular disease,&#xD;
             neurodegenerative or other neurological diseases, uncontrolled hypo- and&#xD;
             hyperthyroidism and other autoimmune diseases, hypokalemia, hyperadrenergic state or&#xD;
             ophthalmologic disorder) that could interfere with or compromise the safety of the&#xD;
             subjects, as assessed by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Use of prohibited treatment detailed in the treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of malignancy of any organ system within the past 5 years (except for basal&#xD;
             cell carcinoma or actinic keratoses or Bowen disease (carcinoma in situ) that have&#xD;
             been treated, with no evidence of recurrence in the past 12 weeks; carcinoma in situ&#xD;
             of the cervix or non-invasive malignant colon polyps that have been removed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of, or current treatment for, hepatic disease including but not limited to&#xD;
             acute or chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis or hepatic failure prior to initiation of&#xD;
             ligelizumab first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of renal disease or creatinine level above 1.5x ULN prior to initiation of&#xD;
             ligelizumab first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Female patients of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically&#xD;
             capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using basic (acceptable effective)&#xD;
             methods of contraception for the duration of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Basic (acceptable effective) contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
             patient). Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation&#xD;
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable effective methods of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Female sterilization (surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy),&#xD;
             total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before taking investigational&#xD;
             drug. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman&#xD;
             has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to initiation of ligelizumab first dose).&#xD;
             For female patients enrolled in the Cohort MAP, the vasectomized male partner should&#xD;
             be the sole partner for that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault&#xD;
             caps). For UK: with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Use of oral, (estrogen and progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods of&#xD;
             contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy&#xD;
             (failure rate &lt; 1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone&#xD;
             contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system&#xD;
             (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a&#xD;
        minimum of 3 months before taking investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12&#xD;
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (eg, age&#xD;
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
        (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks ago.&#xD;
        In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been&#xD;
        confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing&#xD;
        potential.&#xD;
