      Single-center, randomized, open label, parallel arm, prospective study in patients with sleep&#xD;
      apnea after first-ever stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of screening, baseline assessment, interventional period (consisting&#xD;
      of a treatment period and follow-up visits), and a follow-up phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to ASV (active) or control groups, within 4 days after the&#xD;
      PSG II and will start the respective intervention in the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to the active group will receive ventilatory support with ASV (DreamStation&#xD;
      BiPAP autoSV®) during diurnal and nocturnal sleep, from study randomization until clinically&#xD;
      indicated. Patients assigned to control group will receive best medical treatment for stroke&#xD;
      alone, including rehabilitation.&#xD;
