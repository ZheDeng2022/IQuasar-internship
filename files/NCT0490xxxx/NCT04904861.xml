  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Early childhood development is highly dependent on the sensitive care provided by&#xD;
      their caregivers . Interventions focused on supporting parents to improve their sensitivity&#xD;
      have been shown to be effective . The COVID-19 pandemic has had a great impact on mental&#xD;
      health , with pregnant women and mothers of children under one year of age being an&#xD;
      especially vulnerable group . On the other hand, access to mental health interventions in&#xD;
      person is restricted by confinement measures , especially group interventions, so it is&#xD;
      relevant to have remote interventions that support this group of mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a group videoconferencing&#xD;
      intervention to improve maternal sensitivity aimed at mother / infant dyads attended in&#xD;
      Primary Health Care in Chile Methodology: a randomized pilot feasibility study will be&#xD;
      carried out with a mixed design with quantitative and qualitative evaluations. A face-to-face&#xD;
      group intervention with proven effectiveness will be adapted to videoconferencing format ,&#xD;
      then 50 dyads will be randomized in a 3: 2 ratio to receive the videoconferencing&#xD;
      intervention ( n=30) or the delivery of educational brochures (n=20) . The feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability will be evaluated assessing the participation, adherence and satisfaction in a&#xD;
      quantitative way, in addition the qualitative evaluation will be carried out through&#xD;
      interviews and focus groups. Changes in clinical outcomes will also be evaluated: maternal&#xD;
      sensitivity, depressive symptoms, postnatal maternal attachment and infant socio-emotional&#xD;
      development. This pilot study will allow the identification of the key parameters for the&#xD;
      implementation and evaluation of the intervention, which will allow the design of an&#xD;
      effectiveness study in the future.&#xD;

    <description>A short face-to-face dyadic group workshop focused on increasing maternal sensitivity was adapted to be carried out virtually by videoconference. The intervention considers 4 sessions, with a weekly frequency, with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 dyads per group led by a monitor (psychologist). The activities are protocolized in a manual and are designed to be carried out by the mother with the baby under one year of age. .</description>
