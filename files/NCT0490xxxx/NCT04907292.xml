  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, 29.1% of annual births are via cesarean deliveries (CD). The literature shows that&#xD;
      almost 24% of CDs are unplanned. Existing evidence suggests that unplanned cesarean delivery,&#xD;
      compared to elective cesarean, may be associated with poor maternal recovery, longer&#xD;
      postpartum hospital stays and more opioid requirements after surgery. Since the establishment&#xD;
      of the Enhanced Recovery After Cesarean protocols, specific care pathways have been&#xD;
      implemented with the aim of optimizing recovery after CD and to reduce the costs to the&#xD;
      health care system. However, the majority of unplanned cesarean receive the same&#xD;
      postoperative anesthetic, obstetric and nursing care as the elective CDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Looking at the actual information about maternal recovery after unplanned CD, the&#xD;
      investigators found that there is a paucity of literature examining this topic utilizing&#xD;
      validated, patient-oriented quality of recovery tools. Recently, Obstetric Quality of&#xD;
      Recovery-10 scoring tool (ObsQoR-10), a new patient-focused outcome instrument for postpartum&#xD;
      recovery, it has been validated for all types of deliveries, in the inpatient setting.&#xD;
      ObsQoR-10 tool aims to measure quantitatively functional recovery at 24 hours postpartum. It&#xD;
      includes 10 questions on a 0 to 10 scale, aimed at pain management, the adverse effects of&#xD;
      narcotics and the perception of recovery by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the quality of recovery from unplanned cesarean&#xD;
      deliveries compared to planned ones using a validated tool for recovery after cesarean&#xD;
      delivery (ObsQoR-10 tool).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that quality of recovery as measured by the Obs-QoR10 for&#xD;
      unplanned cesarean deliveries will be lower than the planned CDs.&#xD;
