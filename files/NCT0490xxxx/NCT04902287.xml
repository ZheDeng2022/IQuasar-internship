  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Efficacious child mental health services are only helpful if families engage in services;&#xD;
      however, as many as 75% of families in need never establish contact with a mental health&#xD;
      professional and greater than half of families fail to attend their first appointment.&#xD;
      Fortunately, interventions have been developed to increase the likelihood that families will&#xD;
      participate in treatment. Despite the development of these interventions, no research to date&#xD;
      has evaluated these strategies with a critically important population, youth with problematic&#xD;
      sexual behaviors (PSB). PSBs in children are a substantial public health concern, as greater&#xD;
      than one-third of child sexual abuse cases are committed by other youth. Evidence based&#xD;
      practices (EBP's) that include direct engagement of caregivers in services for youth PSB have&#xD;
      strong efficacy, with recidivism rates of two percent. Thus, a therapeutic response that&#xD;
      successfully engages families is necessary to promote community safety. Research has&#xD;
      indicated that engagement of families in PSB treatment has greater complications due to&#xD;
      managing internal and external experiences of shame, stigma, and misperceptions of youth.&#xD;
      Therefore, the present study seeks to determine the impact of a first contact intervention to&#xD;
      assess if strategies aid in the engagement of families in treatment for youth PSB as compared&#xD;
      to referral as usual. This will be accomplished by conducting a small-scale Randomized&#xD;
      Control Trial. This project is the first step in an innovative line of research that will&#xD;
      provide practical strategies for practitioners to utilize in order to successfully recruit,&#xD;
      retain, and heal families of youth with PSB.&#xD;

      Efficacious child mental health services are only helpful if families engage in services.&#xD;
      However, as many as 75% of families in need never establish contact with a mental health&#xD;
      professional and greater than half of families fail to attend their first scheduled visit.&#xD;
      Fortunately, first contact interventions have reduced barriers and increased the likelihood&#xD;
      that a family begin services following initial referral. Research has demonstrated the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a phone intervention using 'Training Intervention for the Engagement of&#xD;
      Families' (TIES) for engagement of families referred to outpatient behavioral health services&#xD;
      due to childhood trauma and disruptive behavior disorders. However, engagement intervention&#xD;
      strategies have not yet been applied to a critically important population, youth with&#xD;
      problematic sexual behaviors (PSB), who face unique barriers to engagement in treatment. PSBs&#xD;
      in children are a substantial public health concern, as greater than one-third of child&#xD;
      sexual abuse cases have been found to be committed by other youth. Evidence based practices&#xD;
      (EBP's) that include direct engagement of caregivers in services for children with PSB have&#xD;
      strong efficacy, with recidivism rates of two percent. Thus, a therapeutic response is most&#xD;
      logical to promote community safety and prevent future incidence of PSB. Despite the&#xD;
      development of efficacious treatment, EBP's are not provided to most youth with PSB. Our&#xD;
      research has indicated that engagement of families when a child has PSB has greater&#xD;
      complications due to managing internal and external experiences of shame, stigma, and&#xD;
      misperceptions surrounding the youth's behaviors, as well as navigation of a large number of&#xD;
      systems (e.g., child welfare, juvenile justice, law enforcement). Given the potential&#xD;
      negative impact of treatment attrition on overall community safety and child well-being,&#xD;
      research efforts concentrated on identifying strategies that enhance service engagement for&#xD;
      the treatment of youth with PSB are warranted. While TIES strategies have shown great promise&#xD;
      in increasing family engagement, no research to date has examined the impact of purposeful,&#xD;
      evidence-based engagement intervention on decreasing attrition amongst families of youth with&#xD;
      PSB. A critical gap exists in the research literature, as families of youth with PSB face&#xD;
      additional perceptual barriers to engaging in treatment such as a hesitancy to discuss&#xD;
      stigmatizing behaviors due to feelings of responsibility and shame. Therefore, the present&#xD;
      study seeks to determine the impact of this intervention to assess if these strategies&#xD;
      successfully aid in both the successful engagement of families in treatment for youth PSB as&#xD;
      compared to referral as usual. This will be accomplished by conducting a small-scale&#xD;
      Randomized Control Trial (RCT). We will test the hypothesis that TIES engagement strategies&#xD;
      will improve both initial and sustained engagement in EBP as compared to referral as usual&#xD;
      amongst families of school aged children with PSB. The proposed study will accomplish this&#xD;
      through the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To examine the efficacy of an evidence-based engagement intervention strategy for&#xD;
      successfully engaging families of youth with PSB in treatment. Families' who are referred to&#xD;
      the PSB-CBT treatment services will be randomly assigned to TIES strategies or referral as&#xD;
      usual procedures to test the impact of an evidence-based engagement intervention on program&#xD;
      attrition. Factors such as parenting stress, child emotional and behavioral health concerns,&#xD;
      treatment satisfaction and alliance will be examined to understand their unique contribution&#xD;
      to family attrition in treatment for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. In order to accomplish Aim 1, we will first systematically adapt the TIES intervention&#xD;
      to meet the unique needs of families of youth with PSB to improve the ability of TIES to&#xD;
      decrease overall attrition. Adaptations to TIES strategies will include supporting families&#xD;
      to overcome barriers such as navigating community systems and addressing misperceptions such&#xD;
      as shame and stigma of youth with PSB.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment alliance between the therapist and family will be measured using the Working Alliance Inventory - Short Revised (WAI-SR) and Working Alliance Inventory - Children and Adolescents (WAI-CA). The WAI-SR and WAI-CA assesses the therapeutic alliance between a child and their caregiver with the therapeutic provider. This form will be completed by both caregiver and child at 1-month and discharge. Both the WAI-SR and WAI-CA have demonstrated high levels of internal consistency and external validity. Higher scores represent a higher level of treatment alliance.</description>
