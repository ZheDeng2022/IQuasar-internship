    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder is more prevalent among the Sjogren syndrome's population compare to the&#xD;
      general population. Both anti-muscarinic agent and beta-3 agonist are recommended as second&#xD;
      line treatment for overactive bladder syndrome. However, theoretically, undesirable effect of&#xD;
      the anti-muscarinic agent such as dry mouth and constipation would make it less suitable for&#xD;
      Sjogren syndrome patient with overactive bladder. Therefore, this study is a randomised&#xD;
      control study with the aim to evaluate the therapeutic effect of beta-3 agonist and&#xD;
      anti-muscarinic agent on overactive bladder among sjogren's syndrome patient.&#xD;

      Overactive bladder(OAB) is a syndrome characterized by the presence of frequency, urgency,&#xD;
      nocturia, and with or without urgency urinary incontinence. The reported prevalence of&#xD;
      overactive bladder was similar between man and woman. An overactive bladder has been shown to&#xD;
      impair the quality of life of the patient. Muscarinic receptors, particularly M2 and M3&#xD;
      receptors were involved in detrusor contraction. Anti-muscarinic receptor drugs, such as&#xD;
      oxybutynin and tolterodine are drugs that are currently recommended by both European&#xD;
      association of Urology(EAU) and American Urology Association(AUA) guidelines as a second-line&#xD;
      treatment for OAB. Beta-3 agonist such as mirabegron is another medication that is commonly&#xD;
      used for OAB. Beta-3 agonists increased the bladder capacity of OAB patients without&#xD;
      impairing the detrusor contractility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sjogren syndrome(Ss) is an autoimmune disease that frequently affects the lacrimal gland and&#xD;
      salivary gland causing the patient to have dry mouth and dry eyes. Extraglandular&#xD;
      manifestation was also present. Genitourinary manifestation such as frequency, urgency, and&#xD;
      vaginal dryness have been reported but not extensively studied. Currently, there is no&#xD;
      consensus for the management of these extraglandular manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have reported an increasing prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms in Ss.&#xD;
      Detrusor overactivity was the most commonly found based on a small study. A nationwide&#xD;
      population-based study in Taiwan has shown that the risk of developing OAB in the Ss&#xD;
      population is significantly higher than the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholinesterase inhibitors like pilocarpine and muscarinic agonists such as cevimeline are&#xD;
      common drugs used to treat dry eyes and dry mouth of Sjogren syndrome while anti-muscarinic&#xD;
      drugs are extensively used to treat OAB. Pilocarpine works by increasing acetylcholine&#xD;
      concentration in the synaptic junction while cevimeline works as a muscarinic receptor.&#xD;
      Whether the increased prevalence of OAB in Ss population is due to the medication itself or&#xD;
      due to the disease is not clear. Currently, there is no study investigating the optimal&#xD;
      management of lower urinary tract symptoms(LUTS) in Sjogren Syndrome populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of muscarinic agonists&#xD;
      used for Ss on LUTS and the efficacy of beta3 agonists for management OAB in Ss.&#xD;
