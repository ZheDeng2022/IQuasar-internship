      This is an open label, five-arm, parallel-design clinical investigation determining the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of five personal lubricants. This clinical investigation consists of&#xD;
      two phases, a Tolerance Phase and a Treatment Phase, whereby a sub-set of subjects will enter&#xD;
      both the Tolerance Phase followed by the Treatment Phase. The remaining subjects will enter&#xD;
      the Treatment Phase only.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The personal lubricants will be tested in a 5-arm parallel-design, where subjects will be randomised to an arm/lubricant. This follows an initial tolerance phase conducted in a sub-set of the population which will be tested in a 5-arm parrallel design,where subjects will be randomised to an arm/lubricant. Note: subjects participating in the both the tolerability and treatment phases will be enrolled into an arm for each which includes the same IP/lubricant throughout both phases.</intervention_model_description>
