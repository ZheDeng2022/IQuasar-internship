      Rationale: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown to improve the overall survival for&#xD;
      patients with metastasized non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) but the optimal dosing and&#xD;
      patient selection are still a matter of discussion. The pembrolizumab dose, for instance, may&#xD;
      be reduced significantly without decreasing treatment efficacy. Furthermore, as approximately&#xD;
      only half of all patients responds to treatment, there is an urgent need to develop (early)&#xD;
      treatment response prediction markers to select those who benefit from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Primary: to investigate the non-inferiority of pembrolizumab 300 mg Q6W versus&#xD;
      pembrolizumab 400 mg Q6W in terms of overall survival. Secondary: to develop biomarkers that&#xD;
      predict immunotherapy treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: An open label randomized non-inferiority study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 750 patients with NSCLC, eligible for treatment with pembrolizumab, in line&#xD;
      with the current ESMO clinical practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): Patients will be randomized to standard of care (400 mg Q6W or&#xD;
      200 mg Q3W dosing of pembrolizumab) versus reduced dose pembrolizumab (300 mg Q6W).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: One-year overall survival rate&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 General introduction The recent introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has&#xD;
      dramatically changed treatment and prognosis of metastasized non-small cell lung carcinoma&#xD;
      (NSCLC). Depending on the type of treatment, the line of treatment and tumour&#xD;
      characteristics, response rates of 20 to over 60% are shown, and durable responses are seen.&#xD;
      However, the accessibility to novel cancer treatments in The Netherlands is at serious risk&#xD;
      due to the rising incidence of cancer as well as the exponentially increasing costs of these&#xD;
      new and effective drugs. As an example, the yearly costs for treatment of metastasized NSCLC&#xD;
      with Pembrolizumab single agent therapy in the Netherlands was estimated to be 27 million&#xD;
      euro in 2018. With the recent new indications in the first line treatment in lung cancer&#xD;
      alone this sum is surpassed by at least a four-fold. With ever increasing strains on&#xD;
      healthcare budgets, we have a societal responsibility to decrease treatment costs wherever&#xD;
      possible. Furthermore, for the individual patient it is very relevant to offer a treatment&#xD;
      only if it is effective. By investing in a more tailored treatment we intend to personalize&#xD;
      treatment, thereby allowing significant cost-reduction, without reducing the promise that all&#xD;
      these new treatment options hold for the individual patients. For the individual patient we&#xD;
      have the responsibility to expose patients to no more drug than strictly necessary and to&#xD;
      limit the number of hospital visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Immune checkpoint inhibitors ICI have revolutionized systemic treatment of many&#xD;
      malignancies. By targeting the programmed death (ligand)-1 (PD-1/PD-L-1) axis with specific&#xD;
      ICI's, T-cell tolerance can be overcome and cellular immune response to tumour cells is&#xD;
      boosted. In contrast to previous treatment modalities, ICI are able to induce durable&#xD;
      responses thereby improving overall survival in NSCLC. In 2015, nivolumab was the first PD1&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody that showed a clinically relevant efficacy in patients with metastasized&#xD;
      disease. Since then, many phase III trials have shown positive results thereby improving both&#xD;
      progression free and overall survival in patients with advanced and or metastasized disease.&#xD;
      ICI's have been introduced rapidly in The Netherlands and the efficacy results of real-life&#xD;
      data are comparable to those from phase 3 trials. Both PD1 and PDL1 monoclonal antibodies are&#xD;
      currently approved for the treatment of NSCLC and, at present, the vast majority of patients&#xD;
      fit for systemic treatment will receive a form of ICI.Currently, pembrolizumab forms the&#xD;
      mainstay first line therapy for metastasized NSCLC. We expect that in the Netherlands&#xD;
      approximately 2500-3000 NSCLC patients will be treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor on&#xD;
      a yearly basis, with pembrolizumab as the cornerstone in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Dose tapering of immune checkpoint inhibitors There are no known exposure-toxicity&#xD;
      relationships for pembrolizumab and usually dosing regimens are usually developed for&#xD;
      prescriber's convenience, i.e. as a one-dose-fits-all regimen. During clinical phase&#xD;
      development a dose is selected that will result in therapeutic exposure in all patients,&#xD;
      indicating that in the majority of patients pembrolizumab is overdosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Pembrolizumab dose tapering rationale As pembrolizumab will be the main ICI for NSCLC in&#xD;
      the upcoming years, we focus on pembrolizumab in the current study. We postulate that the&#xD;
      approved dose of pembrolizumab (200 mg every three weeks [Q3W] or 400 mg every 6 weeks [Q6W])&#xD;
      can be decreased to a 300 mg dose Q6W without compromising efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4.1 Dose development and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial phase I trial of pembrolizumab demonstrated complete peripheral PD-1 target&#xD;
      engagement at a dose of 1 mg/kg, which was continued for more than 21 days. Furthermore, no&#xD;
      difference in pharmacodynamics were observed at doses of 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg. Also, linear&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics were observed from doses of 0.3 mg/kg and up. This indicated saturation of&#xD;
      target-mediated clearance and, thus, complete peripheral PD-1 blockade at doses of 0.3 mg/kg&#xD;
      and higher. Lastly, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed at the 0.3 to 10 mg/kg dose&#xD;
      levels and no apparent relationship between dose and toxicity was observed at these dose&#xD;
      levels. Mechanism-based translational models of intratumor exposure of this study further&#xD;
      suggested robust clinical activity at doses of 2 mg/kg Q3W. The preclinical dose development&#xD;
      was supported by clinical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling of the ex-vivo IL-2&#xD;
      stimulation ratio response. If the PD-1 blockade is complete, this ratio decreases to a&#xD;
      minimum of 1. It was shown that from doses of 1 mg/kg Q3W and higher, and serum&#xD;
      concentrations of 1 ug/ml and higher, the pharmacodynamic response (measured as target&#xD;
      engagement or IL-2 stimulation ratio) reached a plateau (1). From the dose finding studies,&#xD;
      it was decided that the 2 mg/kg Q3W dose was carried forward for further clinical&#xD;
      development. Although the 2 mg/kg Q3W dosing regimen was eventually authorized by the FDA to&#xD;
      treat advanced NSCLC following first-line therapy, recently a fixed 200 mg Q3W dose was&#xD;
      introduced and used in more recent trials, like the KEYNOTE-024 study. More recently, Merck&#xD;
      has proposed to administer a 400 mg Q6W dosing regimen, based on population pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamic simulations and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)&#xD;
      of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended the approval of this dosing regimen on&#xD;
      March 4th 2019. The change of drug label for the 200 mg Q3W and the 400 mg Q6W dosing&#xD;
      regimens was based on in-silico investigations only, using previously developed population&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models of pembrolizumab in cancer patients. It was&#xD;
      predicted that a weight-based 2 mg/kg dosing regimen did not relevantly reduce&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic variability and that the pharmacokinetic exposure of a 200 mg Q3W dose or 400&#xD;
      mg Q6W flat dose resulted in similar or higher exposure than the approved 2 mg/kg dose for&#xD;
      all indications. Notably, it was shown that a flat dose of approximately 150 mg Q3W resulted&#xD;
      in bioequivalent exposure as the clinically proven effective and safe dose of 2 mg/kg.&#xD;
      Although the 200 mg Q3W and 400 mg Q6W dosing regimens resulted in a higher exposure than&#xD;
      associated with the clinically proven effective and safe dosing regimen of 2 mg/kg Q6W, the&#xD;
      exposure was lower than found for the 10 mg/kg Q2W dose, which was just as safe as the 2&#xD;
      mg/kg Q3W dose. The 200 mg Q3W and 400 mg Q6W regimens were, therefore, considered equivalent&#xD;
      to the previously approved 2 mg/kg Q3W dosing regimen in terms of efficacy and safety. In&#xD;
      short, the above data indicate that pembrolizumab at its current dose (200 mg Q3W or 400 mg&#xD;
      Q6W) is overdosed and can be tapered safely, because:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Linear pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab are observed at doses of 0.3 mg/kg Q3W and&#xD;
           higher. Linear pharmacokinetics indicate that receptor-mediated clearance of the&#xD;
           therapeutic antibody does not take place due to saturation of the receptor at the&#xD;
           concentrations associated with the 0.3 mg/kg dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A plateau in pharmacodynamic response is observed at doses of 1 mg/kg and higher, which&#xD;
           translates to that a flat dose of approximately 75 mg Q3W or 150 mg Q6W is as effective&#xD;
           as the currently approved dosing regimens of 200 mg Q3W and 400 mg Q6W.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The lowest proven clinically effective dose of pembrolizumab for treatment of NSCLC is 2&#xD;
           mg/kg and the currently approved dosing regimens of 200 mg Q3W or 400 mg Q6W result in&#xD;
           higher exposure than associated with the 2 mg/kg Q3W regimen, indicating that the dose&#xD;
           can be safely reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To investigate the non-inferiority of reduced dose pembrolizumab versus standard of care&#xD;
      for treatment of advanced stage NSCLC in terms of overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop immune checkpoint inhibitor response biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study possible effect modification from co-medication on treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. STUDY DESIGN The current study will be an open label non-inferiority trial of reduced&#xD;
           dose pembrolizumab (administered as 300 mg Q6W with or without chemotherapy) versus&#xD;
           standard of care (400 mg Q6W or 200 mg Q3W in combination with chemotherapy), either as&#xD;
           monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy in NSCLC patients who are eligible for&#xD;
           treatment with a pembrolizumab-based regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Dedication-1 can be classified as a low intervention clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many clinical trials pose only a minimal additional risk to subject safety compared to normal&#xD;
      clinical practice. According to the EU clinical trial regulation 536/2014, these&#xD;
      low-intervention clinical trials are of crucial importance for assessing standard treatments&#xD;
      and diagnoses, thereby optimizing the use of medicinal products and thus contributing to a&#xD;
      high level of public health. Trials like these should be subject to less stringent rules,&#xD;
      like monitoring, requirements for the contents of the master file and traceability of&#xD;
      investigational medicinal products. The published scientific evidence supporting the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of an investigational medicinal product not used in accordance with the terms of&#xD;
      the marketing authorization could include high quality data published in scientific journal&#xD;
      articles, as well as national, regional or institutional treatment protocols, health&#xD;
      technology assessment reports or other appropriate evidence.We consider the current study a&#xD;
      low intervention clinical trial in line with the definition from the EU clinical trial&#xD;
      regulation 536/2014 for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the proposed study, the investigational medicinal product is authorized. Also, the&#xD;
           use and dose of pembrolizumab are supported by solid evidence from the EMA approval data&#xD;
           of pembrolizumab with the same level of evidence that was used for registration of the&#xD;
           200 mg Q3W and the 400 mg Q6W dosing regimens. Furthermore, the lower dose is already&#xD;
           used routinely in some institutions in the Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The additional diagnostic and monitoring procedures besides the treatment with the&#xD;
           investigational product do not pose more than minimal risk. This is fully in line with&#xD;
           EU clinical trial regulation 536/2014 definition of a low intervention clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low intervention clinical trials as defined in the regulation according to the &quot;expert&#xD;
           group on clinical trials for the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 536/2014&quot; should&#xD;
           fall within categories A and B as defined by the OECD. We conclude that our study falls&#xD;
           in category B &quot;Modified use&quot; and is, therefore, a low interventional clinical trial. The&#xD;
           OECD framework supports the risk-adapted approach by introducing a stratified approach&#xD;
           that is based on the marketing authorization status of the medicinal product being&#xD;
           investigated, with a trial-specific approach.&#xD;
