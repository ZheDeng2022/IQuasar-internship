    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a home-based exercise program&#xD;
      administered through Meals on wheels (MOW) on gait speed and frailty status and to assess the&#xD;
      association between novel serum biomarkers (70 kilodalton heat shock proteins&#xD;
      (HSP70),Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins(MIP1b), soluble IL-6 receptor alpha-chain (sIL-6R))&#xD;
      and established but non-specific frailty biomarkers (Interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein&#xD;
      (CRP), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α)) in frail and prefrail homebound older adults before and&#xD;
      after the exercise intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive 12 weeks of a MOW delivery service that will include 2 meals per day during the weekdays with 4 shelf-stable meals at the end of the week. The MOW driver will visit the participants in-person to ask a series of 5 questions about change in health status, joint/muscle injuries, new pain, falls, and poor appetite twice a week. Participants will also will receive an exercise kit from the MOW driver with their first meal delivery which will contain 2 tennis balls, 2 1-pound hand weights, and one towel. Every week, the driver will give the participants a handout containing 3 exercises from the NIA Go4Life Workout-to-Go book that are designed to help with strength/endurance, balance, and flexibility20. The participants will be asked to do the 3 exercises every day, if possible, on their own. Every 4 weeks during the 12-week study period and at 6 months follow up patients will have blood drawn for frailty and inflammatory biomarkers.</description>
