      Two common corticosteroids used for trigger finger treatment are betamethasone and&#xD;
      methylprednisolone. Both injections are effective in treating trigger finger and the decision&#xD;
      of which to use in treatment is currently a matter of the current practice and physician&#xD;
      preference. The goal through this randomized trial is to see whether there is a difference&#xD;
      between these two corticosteroids in inducing flare reactions and if there are any&#xD;
      differences in the peak level of pain and their duration. Findings indicating a statistically&#xD;
      significant difference in the incidence and/or intensity of the flare reactions would be&#xD;
      clinically significant and would be evidence supporting the switch of current practice to one&#xD;
      corticosteroid over the other.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Corticosteroid injections are effective non-surgical approach to treating trigger finger&#xD;
      (stenosing tenosynovitis) with success rates reported as high as 92% after just one injection&#xD;
      [1]. Among their side effects is a post-injection flare of increased pain that is attributed&#xD;
      to crystal-induced synovitis. Reports of these flares in the literature have been rare.&#xD;
      Recent evidence their incidence can be as high as 33%. The investigators feel it is a more&#xD;
      common clinical issue than traditionally reported and it would be beneficial to control and&#xD;
      reduce their incidence if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two common corticosteroids used for trigger finger treatment are betamethasone and&#xD;
      methylprednisolone. Both injections are effective in treating trigger finger and the decision&#xD;
      of which to use in treatment is currently a matter of the current practice and physician&#xD;
      preference. There is no literature comparing the side effects, specifically flare reactions&#xD;
      between these two treatments. The goal through this randomized trial is to see whether there&#xD;
      is a difference between these two corticosteroids in inducing flare reactions and if there&#xD;
      are any differences in the peak level of pain and their duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blinded randomized trial enrolling patients into one of the two treatment&#xD;
      groups. The volume of the doses will be standardized to 1 cc of either methylprednisolone (40&#xD;
      mg) or betamethasone (6 mg). Patients, who meet the inclusion criteria, will be instructed to&#xD;
      complete a visual analog scale (VAS) of their pain (1-10) prior to the injection, during the&#xD;
      injection and once a day for the following 7 days after the injection. The investigators&#xD;
      estimate that a minimum of 30 patients in each group will be needed to achieve a minimum of&#xD;
      80% power and 0.05 significance. The incidence, intensity, time to peak and time to&#xD;
      resolution of the flare reactions (defined as a 2-point increase from pre-injection pain)&#xD;
      will be assessed and compared between the two groups. Findings indicating a statistically&#xD;
      significant difference in the incidence and/or intensity of the flare reactions would be&#xD;
      clinically significant and would be evidence supporting the switch of current practice to one&#xD;
      corticosteroid over the other.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a double-blinded randomized trial enrolling patients into one of the two treatment groups. The volume of the doses of steroid to be given will be standardized to 1 cc of either methylprednisolone (40 mg) or betamethasone (6 mg). We will instruct patients who meet the inclusion criteria to complete a visual analog scale (VAS) of their pain (1-10) prior to the injection, immediately after the injection, five minutes after the injection, and once a day for a minimum of 7 days after the injection. The incidence, intensity, time to peak and time to resolution of the flare reactions (defined as a 2-point increase from pre-injection pain) will be assessed and compared between the two groups.</intervention_model_description>
