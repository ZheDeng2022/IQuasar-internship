    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial to compare SSO's in abdominal wall reconstruction patients using&#xD;
      Prevena, Prineo, and traditional incisional dressings.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site occurrences (SSOs) are a common complication of complex abdominal wall&#xD;
      reconstruction (AWR), with rates ranging from 29-63.6%. Contributors to the high rates&#xD;
      include: 1) comorbidities in this patient population such as; obesity, diabetes, smoking, and&#xD;
      poor nutrition; 2) the need for complex surgical techniques including component separation,&#xD;
      the use of mesh, skin resection, and the creation of adjacent skin flaps; 3) the possibility&#xD;
      of contamination as a result of enterotomies or infected mesh from a previous procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any measures that can be taken to reduce the rates of surgical site occurrences are worthy of&#xD;
      investigation, as they would help to decrease the morbidity and mortality of these&#xD;
      procedures, while also potentially decreasing the overall cost associated with them. One&#xD;
      measure of particular interest is what post-operative intervention, or wound dressing, is&#xD;
      used. Many options exist. Those widely used include Prevena™, a vacuum assisted therapy that&#xD;
      goes directly over the closed incision to assist with closure. This system works by placing a&#xD;
      small piece of foam over the closed incision and then applying a vacuum over the foam. This&#xD;
      allows the vacuum to apply uniformed pressure over the incision. It is thought that this&#xD;
      vacuum creates negative pressure that helps to prevent contamination, hold the incision&#xD;
      together, and remove fluid and infectious materials from the incision site. Another commonly&#xD;
      used product is Prineo™, a self-adhering mesh that utilizes Dermabond™ glue technology that&#xD;
      goes directly over the closed incision to assist with closure. The glue dries quickly over&#xD;
      the incision and mesh, creating a barrier that is flexible but also resistant to&#xD;
      contamination. While blocking potential contaminants such as water and bacteria from getting&#xD;
      in, it allows water vapor to escape, while promoting a moist wound healing environment. There&#xD;
      is also the traditional wound dressing which consists of Bacitracin antibiotics on a xeroform&#xD;
      gauze, covered with a standard abdominal pad and tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevena™ has been widely studied in plastic surgery, specifically in AWR for large ventral&#xD;
      hernias and for other complex abdominal reconstructions and is associated with reductions in&#xD;
      SSOs from 22-51%. While there is strong evidence to support the use of Prevena in this&#xD;
      patient population, there remains skepticism due to the lack of randomized, prospective&#xD;
      studies to support its use. Prineo™ has not been studied as in depth, but multiple studies&#xD;
      have shown it to be as efficacious as standard wound dressings in regard to wound healing, if&#xD;
      not better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no published reports comparing the rates of SSOs between these three&#xD;
      therapies. This information is important to collect due to their potential abilities to&#xD;
      reduce the rates of SSOs. Finding which decreases this rate the most can help guide decision&#xD;
      making in our practice and potentially across the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a patient with a ventral hernia or an abdominal wall tumor presents to the senior author&#xD;
      for evaluation for abdominal wall reconstruction, a full history and physical examination&#xD;
      will be performed. Patients who satisfy the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      offered the opportunity to participate in the study. If they agree to participate, informed&#xD;
      consent and HIPAA forms will be filled out and signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be randomized to group A (Prevena™) or group B (Prineo™) or group C&#xD;
      (Standard wound dressing) using a random number generator made in Microsoft Excel. They will&#xD;
      not be told which group they are in, and only the principal investigator, co-investigators&#xD;
      and operating room staff will be aware of which post-operative intervention is being used&#xD;
      until after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked to fill out 1 survey preoperatively: PROMIS Pain Intensity survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will then undergo surgery and will be followed within one week for wound dressing&#xD;
      removal if needed, then at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year and as needed. They will be&#xD;
      evaluated for ventral hernia recurrence, bulge, or other SSOs throughout the follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be asked to fill out the PROMIS Pain Intensity survey and POSAS 2.0 survey at 6&#xD;
      weeks, 3 months, and 1 year.&#xD;
