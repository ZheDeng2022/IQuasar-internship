    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore the effectiveness of a combined intervention using brief cessation&#xD;
      advice and personalized chat-based positive psychological support compared with the control&#xD;
      group on current smokers who join the Quit to Win Contest.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is a leading cause of many diseases and deaths globally. Although Hong Kong has a&#xD;
      relatively low overall smoking rate of 10.2% (in 2019), health and economic burdens due to&#xD;
      smoking are still substantial. The practice of smoking might predispose smokers to COVID-19&#xD;
      infection and poor prognosis. Growing evidence has also suggested that smokers are at higher&#xD;
      risk of developing serious respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms in the COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      than non-smokers. Smoking cessation in the post-COVID-19 era is the key priority to meet the&#xD;
      HKSAR Government's target of reducing smoking prevalence to 7.8% by 2025.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental health problems are commonly comorbid with smoking and related problems. Our&#xD;
      population-based survey amidst the COVID-19 pandemic found current smokers were at higher&#xD;
      risk of suffering from anxious symptoms (adjusted OR 1.84 95% CI 1.27, 2.67), depressive&#xD;
      symptoms (adjusted OR 2.04 95% CI 1.40, 2.96), and stress symptoms (adjusted β 0.54 95% CI&#xD;
      0.26, 0.82) compared with non-smokers. We also observed mental health burden increased during&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic with approximately doubling of the prevalence of anxious symptoms (15.8&#xD;
      vs. 9.3) and depressive symptoms (14.8 vs. 6.3) compared with the pre-COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      (2017). Mental health can be both precursors and consequences of smoking. Previous studies&#xD;
      have suggested that depressive symptoms and low positive affect during and after SC attempts&#xD;
      are associated with poor cessation outcomes. This implies that a combined intervention of&#xD;
      behavioral and psychological SC intervention is needed, particularly under the circumstance&#xD;
      of worsening mental health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, our study aims to test the effectiveness of a combined intervention using brief&#xD;
      cessation advice and personalized chat-based positive psychological support compared with the&#xD;
      control group on current smokers who join the Quit to Win Contest.&#xD;
