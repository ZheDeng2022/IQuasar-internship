  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the major causes of neurological disability in adults globally. Fifteen&#xD;
      million patients suffer from stroke annually throughout the world, from which 5 million had&#xD;
      to continue to live with a major disability. Especially in developing and non-developing&#xD;
      countries, it contributes significantly to the mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The improvements in medical care of acute stroke, especially in a specialized stroke unit&#xD;
      setting, reduced overall mortality of the disease. However, the general prognosis of stroke&#xD;
      survivors did not improve accordingly, so that many survivors have to deal with different&#xD;
      forms of disability. Following a stroke, patients usually suffer from variable degrees of&#xD;
      disability. They require acute treatment at an inpatient setting and extensive assistance&#xD;
      throughout their recovery at home. Most stroke survivors depend on informal caregivers, who&#xD;
      usually is a family member (eg, spouse) providing unpaid care for the patient.Caregivers are&#xD;
      usually unprepared and unfit for such a support after discharge. And as a result, they may&#xD;
      experience a decline in their physical and mental health status, social life and general&#xD;
      well-being&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study sought to examine the musculoskeletal problems of the informal caregivers&#xD;
      in relation with the physical condition and the degree of disability of the patient they are&#xD;
      caring. To our knowledge this study can be considered as the first of its kind by evaluating&#xD;
      the symptoms of the caregiver from their viewpoint and relates the level of their symptoms to&#xD;
      the level of incapacity of the stroke patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our observational study, we evaluated the cross-sectional survey data of the informal&#xD;
      caregivers who had provided care for stroke patients. The convenience sampling method was&#xD;
      used to assemble the study population. Consecutive informal caregivers accompanying stroke&#xD;
      survivors to the outpatient stroke clinic at Kanuni Sultan SÃ¼leyman Training and Research&#xD;
      Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey were included in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were eligible if they (1) had a stroke according to the WHO definition at least 6&#xD;
      months prior, who need assistance with the activities of daily life(ADL) and are older than&#xD;
      18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informal caregivers over the age of 18, who have cared for a stroke victim for at least 6&#xD;
      months, and provided some basic ADL assistance were included in the study. Caregivers, who&#xD;
      are above the age of 65, who have underlying comorbid illnesses, neurological disability, or&#xD;
      psychiatric disabilities that would hinder their capacity to deliver care were removed from&#xD;
      the study. Because of the negative effects of aging on the musculoskeletal system, caregivers&#xD;
      over 65 years of age were also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data forms, designed by the researchers, were used to record information on each caregiver's&#xD;
      age, gender, educational level, employment status, and relationship with stroke survivor.&#xD;
      Respective stroke survivors' data were also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validated scales were used to assess the physical condition and disability levels of stroke&#xD;
      survivors. Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) was used to quantify the spasticity of the upper and&#xD;
      the lower extremity muscles. MAS is a 6-point rating scale. The lowest score is 0 and means&#xD;
      &quot;no increase in muscle tone,&quot; while the highest score 4 shows that the affected limb is rigid&#xD;
      during flexion or extension&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of motor recovery was assessed using the Brunnstrom staging system, which is a&#xD;
      motor and tonus analysis system. It lays down six different grades for the upper and lower&#xD;
      extremity and hand. The flask phase with the lack of the slightest level of movement is stage&#xD;
      1, while the presence of isolated movements is assessed as stage 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of disability was measured using the functional independence measure (FIM), which&#xD;
      has been validated and is reliable in the Turkish population. It includes 18 items measuring&#xD;
      performance in communication, self-care, social cognition, locomotion, transfer, and&#xD;
      sphincter control. The motor function score is also given separately in addition to the total&#xD;
      score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Ambulation Score (FAS) was used to assess the ambulatory status of the patients.&#xD;
      It specifies the patients' functional capacity of walking under 6 headings. A patient with a&#xD;
      score of 0 cannot walk at all, while a patient with 5 can ambulate independently. The FAS&#xD;
      scale appraises the need for human assistance instead of devices and supports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informal caregivers were evaluated by using Extended Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire&#xD;
      (NMQ-E), Caregiver burden inventory (CBI) and Beck Depression Scale(BDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of musculoskeletal symptoms during the last 6 months was evaluated using the&#xD;
      NMQ-E, which is a one-page survey evaluating nine body regions: hand/wrist, elbow, shoulder,&#xD;
      neck, upper back, low back, hip/thigh, knee and foot/ankle. Responses were provided as&#xD;
      'trouble, including ache, pain and discomfort. Only musculoskeletal symptoms (affecting&#xD;
      joints, muscles, and bones) were asked about in order to rule out other symptoms like&#xD;
      neuropathic or abdominal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the perceived burden of care, a validated Turkish version of the Caregiver Burden&#xD;
      Inventory (CBI) was used. CBI is a self-administered 24-item questionnaire with five domains:&#xD;
      time dependency, developmental, physical, social, and emotional pressures. All objects are&#xD;
      scored on a 5-point Likert scale, with 0 being the least disruptive (not at all disruptive)&#xD;
      and 4 being the most disruptive (very disruptive). The global score is calculated by adding&#xD;
      the subscale scores together. Greater caregiver burden is shown by higher ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Beck Depression Scale (BDS), developed by Beck et al.) and adapted to Turkish by Hisli,&#xD;
      was used to assess depression. The scale has 21 items with scores ranging from 0 to 3. The&#xD;
      highest possible score is 63, which indicates extreme depression. The Turkish validity and&#xD;
      authenticity have also been shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nordic extended scores of the caregivers were first compared with the various disability&#xD;
      scores of the patients and then with their own BECK and CBI scores. Correlations between&#xD;
      those scores are recorded.&#xD;
