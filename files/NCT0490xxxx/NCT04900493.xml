  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Rett Global Registry is a fully remote, global, caregiver-reported registry to collect&#xD;
      information about caring for a loved one with Rett syndrome. In addition, caregivers have the&#xD;
      ability to track and graph their loved one's symptoms and care strategies over time, store&#xD;
      information for central access, and opt-in to complete medical record consolidation and&#xD;
      summary. Qualified researchers and therapeutic developers may request access to de-identified&#xD;
      aggregate information to further Rett research, or assist with clinical development planning&#xD;
      to facilitate and expedite more effective clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Rett Syndrome Global Registry is a fully remote, global, caregiver-reported registry&#xD;
      intended to meet the needs of caregivers, clinicians and researchers, and therapeutic&#xD;
      developers with the goal to increase our understanding of this rare disorder, support better&#xD;
      outcomes for those with Rett syndrome, and facilitate improved therapeutic development. The&#xD;
      Rett Global Registry allows families to provide data about their experience with Rett&#xD;
      syndrome to improve their loved one's care while contributing to research. Participants may&#xD;
      opt in to track and graph symptoms and care strategies over time to support day-to-day care.&#xD;
      Participants may also access aggregate data to see similarities and differences in care&#xD;
      strategies and consolidate their personal information in a central location. Participants may&#xD;
      opt-in to complete medical record consolidation and summary that is centrally accessible,&#xD;
      able to be shared with care providers, and utilized for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry database is designed and maintained to clinical trial standards and supports&#xD;
      research and therapeutic development while meeting or exceeding federal privacy and&#xD;
      confidentiality requirements. These datasets including caregiver-reported Rett syndrome&#xD;
      progression, quality of life, at home day-to-day data, and consolidated medical records from&#xD;
      office visits or hospital stays, provides unique and previously unused sources of information&#xD;
      important for improving our understanding of Rett syndrome, allow additional avenues of&#xD;
      research, and support therapeutic development. Specifically, the registry is intended to&#xD;
      assist with clinical development planning, trial design, trial endpoints, and regulatory&#xD;
      filings.&#xD;
