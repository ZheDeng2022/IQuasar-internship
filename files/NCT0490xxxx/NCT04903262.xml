  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accounts for 10% of all ICU admissions and for 23%&#xD;
      of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (MV). Its hospital mortality remains high,&#xD;
      ranging from 34% in mild forms up to 46% in severe cases. Positive pressure MV remains the&#xD;
      cornerstone of management, but at the same time it can contribute to worsening and&#xD;
      maintenance of the lung injury when excessive stress and strain is applied to the lung&#xD;
      parenchima (so-called ventilator-induced lung injury, VILI). VILI significantly contributes&#xD;
      to the morbidity and mortality of ARDS patients, and it has been clearly demonstrated that&#xD;
      protective (low-volume, low-pressure) MV settings are associated with a significant survival&#xD;
      benefit. Unfortunately, in a certain proportion of ARDS cases, it is difficult to preserve&#xD;
      acceptable gas exchange while maintaining protective ventilation settings, due to a high&#xD;
      ventilatory load. In these cases, extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R) can be applied to grant&#xD;
      the application of protective or even ultra-protective mechanical ventilation settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome of this multicenter, prospective, randomized, comparative open trial is to&#xD;
      determine whether early ECCO2R allowing ultraprotective mechanical ventilation improves the&#xD;
      outcomes of patients with moderate ARDS.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents a form of lung injury that occurs in&#xD;
      response to various predisposing events, characterized by inflammation, increased pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular permeability and loss of aerated lung tissue. The diagnosis of ARDS is based on&#xD;
      severe hypoxemia and bilateral radiographic opacities occurring within 7 days of a known&#xD;
      clinical insult or worsening respiratory symptoms. Central to the pathophysiology of ARDS is&#xD;
      the presence of fibrin-rich exudates (hyaline membranes) due to activation of coagulation and&#xD;
      inhibition of fibrinolysis. ARDS accounts for 10 % of all ICU admissions and for 23% of&#xD;
      patients requiring mechanical ventilation (MV). Hospital mortality of ARDS patients remains&#xD;
      high, ranging from 34% with mild ARDS, up to 46% with severe ARDS. Notably, severe and&#xD;
      critical forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are almost invariably associated with&#xD;
      ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Ventilator Induced Lung Injury (VILI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      MV is a lifesaving form of support for patients with ARDS since it decreases the oxygen cost&#xD;
      of breathing, improves gas exchange and provides time for resolution of the underlying&#xD;
      etiology of ARDS. However, it has been consistently shown that MV may contribute to&#xD;
      ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) characterized by progression of pulmonary damage,&#xD;
      worsening of the pulmonary inflammatory process, increased alveolar-capillary permeability&#xD;
      and therefore leading to the translocation of inflammatory mediators from the lungs into the&#xD;
      systemic circulation with consequent failure of distal organs (biotrauma). A randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial showed that ventilating ARDS patients with a tidal volume (VT) of 6 ml/kg&#xD;
      (calculated from predicted body weight, PBW), and with a maximum end-inspiratory plateau&#xD;
      pressure (PPLAT) of 30 cmH2O decreased mortality from 40 % (seen in the conventional arm&#xD;
      treated with a VT of 12 ml/kg PBW) to 31%. Recently, Amato and coworkers showed that the&#xD;
      delta pressure (∆P), i.e. the difference between PPLAT and positive end-expiratory pressure&#xD;
      (PEEP) (∆P = PPLAT -PEEP) ≤ 14 cmH2O was strongly associated with survival, demonstrating&#xD;
      that interventions to obtain protective ventilatory settings (reductions in VT or increases&#xD;
      in PEEP) were beneficial only if associated with decreases in ΔP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Extra-corporeal CO2 Removal (ECCO2-R)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use extracorporeal support to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) to permit the use of low&#xD;
      volume/low pressure ventilation with minimal impact on PaCO2 was proposed in 1977. It was&#xD;
      suggested that applying low VT and low peak inspiratory pressures (&quot;lung rest&quot;) at a low&#xD;
      respiratory rate could minimize damage to the compromised lungs. With this technique,&#xD;
      oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide were dissociated: oxygenation occurred&#xD;
      predominantly through the lungs, and a variable portion of the carbon dioxide was removed&#xD;
      through an artificial lung (extracorporeal CO2removal: ECCO2-R). The key potential advantage&#xD;
      to this approach over extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the use of lower blood&#xD;
      flow through the extracorporeal circuit potentially with fewer side effects. Low VT&#xD;
      ventilation (3-4 ml/kg of PBW) was associated with a significant decrease in inflammatory&#xD;
      markers when compared with standard low volume, low pressure ventilation. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      resulting hypercapnia was easily controlled by ECCO2-R. A randomized clinical trial showed&#xD;
      that VT of 3 ml/kg of PBW was easy and safe to be implemented with extracorporeal&#xD;
      CO2-removal. Clinical outcome, evaluated as days free from mechanical ventilation through day&#xD;
      28, significantly improved in ECCO2R patients compared to control, when analyzing patients&#xD;
      with PaO2/FiO2&lt;150.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter study designed to assess safety and feasibility of ECCO2R in ARDS showed that&#xD;
      more than 80% of patients with moderate ARDS could achieve ultra-protective ventilation goals&#xD;
      by using ECCO2R. The incidence of severe adverse events related to ECCO2R was low (~2%).&#xD;
      Efficacy and safety of ECCO2R A was higher for devices that used blood flow rates in the&#xD;
      range of 1000-1500 ml/min. A post-hoc analysis showed that restricting enrollment to patients&#xD;
      with compliance of the respiratory system ≤ 40 ml/cmH2O and decrease in ∆P ≥ 5 cmH2O would&#xD;
      increase predicted benefit in terms of clinical outcomes in a randomized clinical trial of VT&#xD;
      of 3 ml/kg of PBW with ECCO2R (enrichment strategy). Moreover, recent data show that there is&#xD;
      no safe upper limit for PPLAT or ΔP, consistent with the fact that since the mortality rate&#xD;
      in ARDS patients with ΔP values ≤ 14 cmH2O is still as high as 20%. Patient outcomes may&#xD;
      therefore be improved by aggressively lowering ventilatory variables such as VT, PPLAT, or ΔP&#xD;
      as facilitated by ECCO2R devices that remove CO2. In addition, ECCO2R might further decrease&#xD;
      VILI by allowing lower respiratory rates, which have been shown to be lung protective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this multicenter, prospective, randomized, comparative open trial is to&#xD;
      determine if early ECCO2R allowing ultraprotective mechanical ventilation (VT 4 ml/kg)&#xD;
      improves the outcomes of patients with ARDS.&#xD;
