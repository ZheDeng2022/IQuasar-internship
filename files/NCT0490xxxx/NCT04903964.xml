    <textblock>
      The term Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) includes congenital structural and functional&#xD;
      anomalies of the cardiovascular system that can be identified at birth or later. A structural&#xD;
      defect in the heart can be named as congenital heart defect, congenital heart anomaly or&#xD;
      cardiovascular malformation. CHD is the most common congenital anomaly in newborns. Its&#xD;
      incidence rate is 1% on average, and it is between 8 and 12 per 1000 live births. 10-15% of&#xD;
      children with this anomaly are included in the critical CHD group, and its frequency is&#xD;
      1.2-1.7 per 1000 live births. CHD findings include feeding difficulty, anoxia, heart failure,&#xD;
      tachypnea, pulmonary hypertension, abnormal endocrine functions, and upper respiratory tract&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In children with CHD, besides the characteristic findings of the disease, secondary problems&#xD;
      brought about by the disease are also of great importance. The most important of these&#xD;
      problems are nutritional deficiencies and growth and developmental delay. Children with CHD&#xD;
      have poor neuromotor and language development compared to their normal peers. Although it has&#xD;
      a lower weight, growth difficulties accompanied by short stature are also observed. In&#xD;
      addition, growth retardation and malabsorption seen in these children cause delay in&#xD;
      correction operations and an increase in postoperative morbidity. Malnutrition is observed in&#xD;
      25-55% of children with congenital heart disease, and it is reported that 80% of children&#xD;
      with malnutrition with congenital heart disease are hospitalized. Causes such as tachypnea,&#xD;
      tachycardia, and breathing difficulties in children with heart disease affect their diet&#xD;
      negatively. The importance of nutrition of children with heart disease is emphasized since&#xD;
      growth is directly affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By providing appropriate family-centered care for children with congenital heart disease,&#xD;
      their growth and development can be supported by meeting their nutritional need. Child health&#xD;
      nurses should guide parents with family-centered care by giving information about their&#xD;
      contribution to children's nutrition and growth and development. In this way, deviations from&#xD;
      normal in the growth and development of children with CHD will be detected early and their&#xD;
      nutritional needs will be met. Growth and development will be supported by meeting the need&#xD;
      for proper nutrition for children with CHD.&#xD;

    <description>In order to determine the physical growth status of the babies, kilograms (in kg) will be measured by the researcher. These measurement results will be given as average Z scores ((kg) type and percentile values. Body weight is measured on an Oncomed electronic scale by removing the clothing and subtracting the dry weight of the ultra-prima brand diaper.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Height measurement of growth parameter</measure>
    <time_frame>every weeek up to 1 months</time_frame>
    <description>Height (in cm) will be measured by the researcher to determine the physical growth status of the babies. These measurement results will be given as average Z-scores (cm) type and percentile values. For height measurement, a head-foot board (infantometer) with a measuring tape is used.</description>

    <measure>Head circumference measurement of growth parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>every weeek up to 1 months</time_frame>
    <description>The head circumference (in cm) will be measured by the researcher to determine the physical growth state of the babies. These measurement results will be given as average Z scores (cm) type and percentile values. Head circumference measurement is made with an inelastic tape measure from the most protruding point of the occipital bone over the ear and over the line passing over the eyebrows.</description>

    <description>This group consists of children who are fed orally according to their chronological age. The questionnaire form developed by the researcher and the parameters used in the evaluation of growth (height, head and chest circumference measurement) and Ankara Development Screening Inventory (AGTE) will be applied to the child and his / her family included in the specified group. Nutrition education prepared by the researcher will be given to the mothers of the children included in this group. After the nutrition training given to their mothers, the growth and development monitoring parameters of the child, body weight, height, head and chest circumference, will be repeated at regular intervals. Ankara Development Screening Inventory (AGTE) will be applied. The follow-up frequency of the hospitalized child after the operation will be determined and the measurements will be checked.</description>
