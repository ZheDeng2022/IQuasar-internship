    <textblock>
      This trial is a Phase Ib/II study. All patients are stage IIIB/C or IV non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer(NSCLC), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AK112 in subjects with advanced NSCLC&#xD;
      whose tumors have a programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) Tumor Proportion Score (TPS)&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 1%.&#xD;
