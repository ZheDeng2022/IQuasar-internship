      This experimental non-randomized clinical study is aimed at comparing the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      assessment of the proposed topical therapy algorithms using topical glucocorticosteroids and&#xD;
      topical calcineurin inhibitors in reducing the severity of atopic dermatitis and the degree&#xD;
      of development of transcutaneous sensitization in children of the first year of life. The&#xD;
      study included more than 100 children aged 2 to 4 months, who, depending on the decision of&#xD;
      the researcher, were divided into two groups. During the period of acute manifestations /&#xD;
      exacerbation of atopic dermatitis, patients of both groups received basic therapy, which&#xD;
      included the use of a topical glucocorticosteroid (0.1% methylprednisolone aceponate cream) 2&#xD;
      times a day in combination with emollients 2 times a day for 10 days. After the relief of&#xD;
      acute inflammatory manifestations, the patients were prescribed proactive therapy, including&#xD;
      the use of a topical calcineurin inhibitor or a topical glucocorticosteroid, as a result of&#xD;
      which comparison groups were formed. Group No. 1, after the end of basic therapy, received a&#xD;
      topical calcineurin inhibitor (1% cream pimecrolimus), which was prescribed in the mode 2&#xD;
      times a day for 3 months, and then in the mode of double application (morning / evening) 3&#xD;
      times a week for up to 1 year. life; Group No. 2 after the end of basic therapy received a&#xD;
      topical glucocorticosteroid (methylprednisolone aceponate 0.1%) 2 times a week for 3 months,&#xD;
      and then - with exacerbation of AD. Patients of both groups used emollients for a long time&#xD;
      in the mode 1-2 times a day. The safety and efficacy of the assigned algorithm was assessed&#xD;
      by an investigator at the center. Efficacy was measured using the EASI (Eczema Area and&#xD;
      Severity Index) score at screening and then at 6, 9 and 12 months of age. And also by&#xD;
      tracking the dynamics of the class and level of sIgE to food (cow's milk protein, chicken egg&#xD;
      protein, wheat, soy) and household (hx2 &quot;house dust mixture: Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus,&#xD;
      D. farinae, Blatella germanica&quot;) allergens using an automated immunological analyzer&#xD;
      ImmunoCAP250 (UniCAP System / Phadia AB, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Sweden) at the time of&#xD;
      screening and then at 6 and 12 months of age.&#xD;

    <description>The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) quantifies the severity of a subject's AD based on both severity of lesion clinical signs and the percent of body surface area (BSA) affected. EASI is a composite scoring of the degree of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification (each scored separately) for each of four body regions, with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. Severity is classified as: 0 = clear; 0.1 - 1.0 = almost clear; 1.1-7.0 = mild; 7.1-21.0 = moderate; 21.1-50.0 = severe; 50.1-72.0 = very severe. The lower the scores the better outcome of the treatment.</description>
