  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracanal medicaments have been frequently used in patients with endodontic and&#xD;
      periradicular infection for the elimination of microorganisms. Commonly used includes Double&#xD;
      Antibiotic Paste, Triple Antibiotic Paste, and Calcium Hydroxide. This study aims to compare&#xD;
      the efficacy in alleviating pain between intracanal medicaments Nitrofurantoin and Calcium&#xD;
      Hydroxide Paste. 60 patients were randomly divided into 3 groups, each group having 20&#xD;
      patients as following: Group 1: Nitrofurantoin, Group 2: Calcium Hydroxide and Group 3:&#xD;
      Control. Preoperative pain was recorded using a numerical pain scale. Pre-operative pain&#xD;
      score was initially recorded, followed by Post-operative pain at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours.&#xD;
      Nitrofurantoin has been proven to be an effective intracanal medicament in alleviating&#xD;
      immediate post-operative pain in patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis as compared&#xD;
      to calcium hydroxide.&#xD;

      Intracanal medicaments have been frequently used in patients with endodontic and&#xD;
      periradicular infection for the elimination of microorganisms. Commonly used includes Double&#xD;
      Antibiotic Paste, Triple Antibiotic Paste, and Calcium Hydroxide. This study aims to compare&#xD;
      the efficacy in alleviating pain between intracanal medicaments Nitrofurantoin and Calcium&#xD;
      Hydroxide Paste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients were randomly divided into 3 groups, each group having 20 patients as following:&#xD;
      Group 1: Nitrofurantoin, Group 2: Calcium Hydroxide and Group 3: Control. Preoperative pain&#xD;
      was recorded using a numerical pain scale. After access preparation, chemomechanical&#xD;
      preparation was performed with subsequent placement of intracanal medicaments. Pre-operative&#xD;
      pain score was initially recorded, followed by Post-operative pain at 12, 24, 48, and 72&#xD;
      hours, respectively. Root canal treatment was performed in single root teeth with patients&#xD;
      suffering from symptomatic irreversible pulpitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total of 20 patients were randomized into 3 groups. Majority of the patients in all 3 groups&#xD;
      initially presented with moderate to severe pre-operative pain. After 72 Hours&#xD;
      post-operatively, 50% patients in group 1 reported no pain, while 5% patients in both group 2&#xD;
      and 3 had no pain. Pain significantly subsided in group 1 as compared to group 2 and 3.&#xD;
      Regarding age and gender, both had no significant relationship with the pain scores in all of&#xD;
      the 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitrofurantoin has been proven to be an effective intracanal medicament in alleviating&#xD;
      immediate post-operative pain in patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis as compared&#xD;
      to calcium hydroxide. While the control group with no intracanal medicament showed little&#xD;
      reduction in pain scores. So, nitrofurantoin can be used as a substitute to currently&#xD;
      available standard intracanal medicaments.&#xD;
