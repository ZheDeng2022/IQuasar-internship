  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of age-related chronic diseases (like obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases) is increasing rapidly worldwide, reaching pandemic proportions. These age-related&#xD;
      chronic diseases are associated with metabolic disturbances and mitochondrial dysfunction in&#xD;
      humans. Nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) levels play an important role in energy&#xD;
      metabolism and mitochondrial functioning and indeed it has been shown that high&#xD;
      concentrations of NAD+ as well as a high NAD+/NADH ratio are strongly associated with&#xD;
      metabolic and mitochondrial health. In contrast, decreased NAD+ bioavailability is reported&#xD;
      in both ageing and obese humans as well as in diabetic mice. These findings fueled the idea&#xD;
      of influencing NAD+ bioavailability in order to improve metabolic disturbances and&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction in humans. Supplementation with nicotinamide riboside (NR), a&#xD;
      naturally occurring form of vitamin B3, may provide a way to boost cellular NAD+ levels.&#xD;
      However, in contrast to animal studies, NR supplementation in humans has so far been&#xD;
      unsuccessful in improving skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, exercise capacity or&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity. Recently, it has been suggested that a situation where NAD+ levels&#xD;
      become limited, is needed for NR supplementation to exert beneficial health effects. This&#xD;
      situation could be achieved by combining exercise and NR supplementation. However, studies&#xD;
      combining NR and exercise are lacking, which is why we would like to perform such a study&#xD;
      here.&#xD;

      Rationale: The number of age-related chronic diseases (like obesity, type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases) is increasing rapidly worldwide, reaching pandemic proportions.&#xD;
      These age-related chronic diseases are associated with metabolic disturbances and&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction in humans. Nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) levels play an&#xD;
      important role in energy metabolism and mitochondrial functioning and indeed it has been&#xD;
      shown that high concentrations of NAD+ as well as a high NAD+/NADH ratio are strongly&#xD;
      associated with metabolic and mitochondrial health. In contrast, decreased NAD+&#xD;
      bioavailability is reported in both ageing and obese humans as well as in diabetic mice.&#xD;
      These findings fueled the idea of influencing NAD+ bioavailability in order to improve&#xD;
      metabolic disturbances and mitochondrial dysfunction in humans. Supplementation with&#xD;
      nicotinamide riboside (NR), a naturally occurring form of vitamin B3, may provide a way to&#xD;
      boost cellular NAD+ levels. However, in contrast to animal studies, NR supplementation in&#xD;
      humans has so far been unsuccessful in improving skeletal muscle mitochondrial function,&#xD;
      exercise capacity or insulin sensitivity. Recently, it has been suggested that a situation&#xD;
      where NAD+ levels become limited, is needed for NR supplementation to exert beneficial health&#xD;
      effects. This situation could be achieved by combining exercise and NR supplementation.&#xD;
      However, studies combining NR and exercise are lacking, which is why we would like to perform&#xD;
      such a study here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to determine whether combined treatment of&#xD;
      exercise and NR imposes greater improvements in skeletal muscle mitochondrial metabolism in&#xD;
      older humans compared to exercise treatment alone. The secondary objective is to determine&#xD;
      whether combined treatment of exercise and NR supplementation imposes greater improvements in&#xD;
      sleeping metabolic rate (SMR). As explorative objectives, we will examine whether combined&#xD;
      treatment with exercise and NR imposes greater improvements in muscle (NAD) metabolites,&#xD;
      energy metabolism and physical performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The present study is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled double&#xD;
      arm longitudinal intervention study in a pre and post design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 30 older male and (postmenopausal) female participants, aged 65 - 80 years&#xD;
      with a BMI between 25-35 kg/m2 will perform this study (15 participants in the&#xD;
      exercise+placebo group, 15 participants in the exercise+NR group). From experience with&#xD;
      similar studies, we estimate a drop-out rate of 20% and a screening failure of 50% (due to&#xD;
      the strict inclusion criteria), resulting in maximally 36 subjects that have to be included&#xD;
      and 72 subjects that have to be screened (maximally).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): Participants will be asked to take two pills of NR&#xD;
      (250mg/pill), or placebo, twice daily (two with breakfast and two with diner, a total of 4&#xD;
      pills/day; 1000mg/day), for 40 days. During days 17-38 of the NR intervention, participants&#xD;
      will perform a 3-weeks supervised exercise training program with four ~30 min exercise&#xD;
      sessions per week (two endurance session on a bike at 70%Wmax and two high intensity interval&#xD;
      (HIIT) sessions. Participants will be randomly assigned to the placebo + exercise or NR +&#xD;
      exercise arm. To assess the outcomes, participants will undergo three test days before the&#xD;
      start of the NR supplementation and repeat these three test days at the end (day 38-40) of NR&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary study endpoints is ex vivo skeletal muscle&#xD;
      mitochondrial function measured via high-resolution respirometry. Explorative objectives are&#xD;
      muscle (NAD) metabolites, energy metabolism and physical performance.&#xD;
