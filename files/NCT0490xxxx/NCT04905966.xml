  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is a major global public health problem. Several strategies have been&#xD;
      implemented to reduce the high prevalence, the most cost-effective of which were those that&#xD;
      focused on the school environment. Although there is vast research that focus on&#xD;
      interventions that address obesity through interventions to improve schoolchildren diets and&#xD;
      physical activity level in many countries of the Latin American region, there is lack of&#xD;
      evidence of the effectiveness of multicomponent interventions that aim to reduce the&#xD;
      prevalence of obesity among schoolchildren in the Paraguayan context.&#xD;

      Nutritional education and physical activity. Interventions that promote healthy eating and&#xD;
      lifelong physical activity in schoolchildren through school programs aim to equip children&#xD;
      with knowledge, attitudes and behavioral skills to help them establish and maintain a healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor diet quality has been identified as one of the main factors contributing to the obesity&#xD;
      epidemic. Research has shown that a diet that includes the recommended servings of fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables (VF) reduces morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and has&#xD;
      also been linked to a lower risk of adiposity. Therefore, the need to promote the consumption&#xD;
      of VF from an early age through effective programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions in Physical Activity have shown effective results in the decrease of BMI,&#xD;
      the thickness of the skin folds and the percentage of fat mass in school-age children. Taking&#xD;
      into account that currently the schoolchildren have decreased the amount of time dedicated to&#xD;
      games, sports or other types of movement and the hours of sedentary life and in front of the&#xD;
      screens (computers, tablets, television, mobile phones, others) have increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is necessary to promote the performance of physical activity in the school environment&#xD;
      through permanent programs that contribute to improving the physical condition of children,&#xD;
      complying with daily recommendations.&#xD;

Each of the lists contained the type of institution (public / private), the area where it is located (urban / rural), the name of the school and the district to which it belongs. The schools were masked with an identifier number in order to avoid bias during the assignment to the groups (intervened / control). Schools were selected using a computer based list (...)</masking_description>

    <description>Physical Activity and Nutrition Education: An additional 45 minute weekly physical education class and 5 weekly active break sessions of 10 minutes each will be added to the provisions of the children's curriculum. In addition, schools will receive high intensity nutrition education, that is, 3 weekly nutrition education classes of one hour in each session over a period of 6 months.</description>

    <description>Schools receiving a lower intensity nutrition education served as control. This group received 3 sessions of 1 hour with a total of 3 educational sessions over the 6 month period. The educational material was the same as the intervention group but the development of lessons was not as specific and deep as the intervention group.</description>
