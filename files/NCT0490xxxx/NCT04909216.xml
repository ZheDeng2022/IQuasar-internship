  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy, feasibility, and&#xD;
      acceptability of Mindful Attention Training (MAT), a novel mindfulness-based intervention&#xD;
      that is specifically developed for firefighters. This project is designed to improve the&#xD;
      health of firefighters, an integral, essential component of our national and international&#xD;
      communities. Moreover, the study aims to promote health service psychologists by enhancing&#xD;
      our contributions to the mental healthcare of firefighters, an understudied and underserved&#xD;
      segment of the population by virtue of their service to our communities. This study therefore&#xD;
      has significant potential to identify, develop, and promote an effective model of quality,&#xD;
      evidence-based mental health promotion and illness prevention by integrating health service&#xD;
      psychology into the fire service.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Firefighters are repeatedly exposed to traumatic and stressful situations, increasing their&#xD;
      vulnerability for the development of various psychological symptoms and disorders. As many as&#xD;
      32.4% of firefighters meet criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with&#xD;
      significantly more experiencing significant subclinical PTSD symptoms. Approximately 22% of&#xD;
      firefighters are also at risk for depression, 46.8% reported serious suicidal ideation, and&#xD;
      15.5% reported having made a suicide attempt during heir firefighter tenure6. Alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder (AUD) among firefighters is estimated at approximately 50%, nearly twice that of the&#xD;
      general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the chronically stressful and potentially traumatic nature of the firefighting&#xD;
      profession and the high rates of psychological disturbances among firefighters, the&#xD;
      development of specialized mental health promotion and illness prevention programs for this&#xD;
      vulnerable population is a priority. Mindfulness, generally defined as bringing one's full&#xD;
      attention to the present moment and taking a stance of nonjudgmental acceptance to the&#xD;
      ongoing flow of sensations, thoughts, and/or emotional states, has significant clinical&#xD;
      relevance to the prevention and treatment of various psychological conditions.&#xD;
      Mindfulness-based interventions have demonstrated efficacy with regard to various&#xD;
      psychological symptoms, including PTSD, depression, and alcohol use. In a military context,&#xD;
      mindful attention training has shown promise in terms of reducing the impact of combat on&#xD;
      psychological health. However, no specialized mindfulness-based interventions exist for&#xD;
      firefighters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy, feasibility, and&#xD;
      acceptability of Mindful Attention Training (MAT), a novel mindfulness-based intervention&#xD;
      that is specifically developed for firefighters. This project is designed to improve the&#xD;
      health of firefighters, an integral, essential component of our national and international&#xD;
      communities. Moreover, the study aims to promote health service psychologists by enhancing&#xD;
      our contributions to the mental healthcare of firefighters, an understudied and underserved&#xD;
      segment of the population by virtue of their service to our communities. This study therefore&#xD;
      has significant potential to identify, develop, and promote an effective model of quality,&#xD;
      evidence-based mental health promotion and illness prevention by integrating health service&#xD;
      psychology into the fire service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of the Mindful Attention Training (MAT) workshop, as compared&#xD;
      to waitlist comparison (&quot;as usual&quot; condition), on mental health promotion among firefighters,&#xD;
      as defined by: self-reported levels of (1a) mindful attention and awareness, (1b)&#xD;
      nonjudgmental acceptance, (1c) nonreactivity as well as (2) psychological resilience and (3)&#xD;
      self-compassion at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate the efficacy of the MAT workshop, as compared to waitlist, on&#xD;
      psychological 'illness' prevention among firefighters, as defined by: self-reported symptom&#xD;
      severity of PTSD, depression, suicidal ideation, and alcohol use at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the MAT workshop, as compared to&#xD;
      waitlist, as defined by: (1) firefighters' self-reported helpfulness of the workshop and (2)&#xD;
      firefighters' self-reported efficacy ratings of the workshop at each time point.&#xD;
