      objective of the project is to implement the LENA Start Program at the Alief Independent&#xD;
      School District in Houston, Texas. The purpose of the study is to learn how maternal&#xD;
      expectations about language development influence the child's language development. Also, the&#xD;
      study will evaluate how much the mothers believe can affect their child's language&#xD;
      development. More specifically, the program implementation will serve as a model that other&#xD;
      school districts can readily replicate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early language environment influences early language development. The relation between family&#xD;
      Socioeconomic status and the child's early language skills is partly due to the quantity and&#xD;
      quality of parent speech directed towards the child during day-to-day interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parental beliefs and knowledge influence the early language environment to which children are&#xD;
      exposed. Differences in parental knowledge play an important role in determining how parents&#xD;
      communicate with their children. A particularly relevant dimension of beliefs that affect the&#xD;
      language interactions between parents and children relate to whether parents believe that&#xD;
      children's skills are fixed or are malleable by the environment. The Socioeconomic status&#xD;
      gaps in the child-directed speech were mediated by parental knowledge about the importance of&#xD;
      the language environment for the promotion of the child's language development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the implementation of LENA Start program, which is a scalable and&#xD;
      low-cost intervention to improve the child's language environment. The intervention provides&#xD;
      parents with information about the importance of a child's early language environment for the&#xD;
      child's language development. It transfers practical knowledge about how to improve the&#xD;
      language environment without requiring major changes in parents' or children's routines.&#xD;
      Finally, it presents objective feedback about the quality of the language environment by&#xD;
      using the LENA system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who enroll in this study will meet with the research team up to twelve times,&#xD;
      either in person or virtually. There will be two visits as part of the LENA Start evaluation&#xD;
      study during which the Rice study team will collect data through parent survey, Cognitive&#xD;
      Home Environment (StimQ) instrument, and Language Development Snapshot. The other ten&#xD;
      meetings will be weekly meetings in which the parents will complete the LENA Start program.&#xD;
      Only the parents who are selected by the random lottery will participate in the ten weekly&#xD;
      LENA start program meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each of the 10 LENA program sessions, a member of the Rice research team will attend&#xD;
      (either virtually or in person) and collect data about Fidelity of Implementation of the LENA&#xD;
      program, including liaison adherence to the material in the session, parental behavior at the&#xD;
      session, liaison workload and preparation, as well as other measures of fidelity. This data&#xD;
      will be collected in both the in-person implementation plan or the virtual implementation&#xD;
      plan. If sessions are conducted virtually, a member of the Rice research team will join the&#xD;
      weekly Zoom meeting. If sessions are conducted in person, the research team member will&#xD;
      attend the weekly meetings in Alief schools.&#xD;

    <description>The quality of the language environment at home will be measured by using the LENA System. LENA is an integrated processing and cloud-based software package that enables researchers to collect, manage, and analyze multiple recordings of children ages 2 months to 48 months.LENA device estimates adult words spoken to and around the key child, adult-child conversational interactions, child vocalizations, and language from Television and/or electronics</description>
