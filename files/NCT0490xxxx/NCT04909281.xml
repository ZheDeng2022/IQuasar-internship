    <textblock>
      All women in one Swedish county who had not participated in the organized screening program&#xD;
      for at least 10 years were sent an HPV self-sampling kit. Women who were positive for HPV&#xD;
      were referred to a gynecological examination including colposcopy and further testing&#xD;
      according to national guidelines.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this cohort study nested in the organized cervical screening program, all women who had&#xD;
      not participated in the organized screening program for at least 10 years in one Swedish&#xD;
      county were eligible. Women were identified through the screening hub register that&#xD;
      administrates for all invitations, referrals, and monitoring of the cervical screening&#xD;
      program. The county screening hub invites approximately 30 000 women yearly to routine&#xD;
      screening. Those who had opted out of the screening program, undergone hysterectomy, or&#xD;
      changed their personal identification number (PNR) were excluded. HPV self-sampling kits with&#xD;
      instructions and invitation letters were sent from the Department of Laboratory Medicine,&#xD;
      Falun Hospital, in batches over 4 weeks. Lists of invitees were checked against changes in&#xD;
      the screening hub register for individuals who moved, emigrated, died, or had taken a routine&#xD;
      screening sample before sending a kit. Samples were received and HPV-analysis was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the self-sample HPV test was negative, the woman was returned to the screening program&#xD;
      according to routine practice. HPV-positive women were referred without triage for further&#xD;
      investigation to a gynecologist responsible for the clinical follow-up of high-risk women.&#xD;
      The gynecological examination included colposcopy as well as biopsies and a liquid based&#xD;
      cytology (LBC) sample (analyzed for cytology and HPV), which are routine examinations in&#xD;
      clinical practice according to national and international guidelines. Colposcopies were&#xD;
      performed within 3 months of a positive self-sample. If the colposcopic examination or the&#xD;
      cytological/histopathological results indicated high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions&#xD;
      (HSIL) or invasive cervical cancer, women underwent treatment by conization and/or&#xD;
      hysterectomy according to national guidelines The Cobas® PCR Female Swab Sample Packet was&#xD;
      used for self-sampling, as previous studies had determined that the sensitivity for HPV was&#xD;
      high and comparable with cervical samples used in the organized screening program. The HPV&#xD;
      analysis was performed at the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Falun Hospital using the&#xD;
      Cobas 4800 HPV Test (Roche Molecular Systems, South Branchburg, New Jersey, USA).&#xD;
