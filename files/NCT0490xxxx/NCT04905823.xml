  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the high risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients with T1D and T2D should&#xD;
      represent a priority group to receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. There are currently no studies&#xD;
      on diabetic population response to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, in this observational&#xD;
      cohort study, investigators will retrospectively analyze the safety and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      mRNA vaccines in eliciting both the humoral and cellular immune response in a subset of&#xD;
      patients with T1D who already underwent blood sampling for measuring humoral response against&#xD;
      SARSCoV2 for healthcare purposes and based on the clinical practice guidelines. Results will&#xD;
      be compared with those obtained in non-diabetic individuals or in patients with&#xD;
      non-autoimmune diabetes (T2D).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, more than 160 million people have&#xD;
      suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and&#xD;
      more than 3 million deaths occurred. Currently, two vaccines using messenger RNA (mRNA)&#xD;
      technology and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery systems have been approved for emergency use&#xD;
      by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA): mRNA-1273,&#xD;
      Moderna, and BNT162b2, Pfizer. In phase-3 clinical trials, two injections of these vaccines,&#xD;
      spaced 21 and 28 days apart, showed efficacy higher than 90% in preventing symptomatic&#xD;
      infections. The reported humoral immunity response with the mRNA vaccines was similar to that&#xD;
      elicited by convalescent serum obtained from patients who recovered from Covid-19 infection.&#xD;
      However, the T-cell mediated reaction to these vaccines remains to be fully elucidated.&#xD;
      Diabetic patients are at higher risk of developing severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a large&#xD;
      observational cohort study, the overall risks of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19&#xD;
      were significantly elevated for patients with diabetes compared with the general population.&#xD;
      While patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) are usually older and with a higher comorbidity&#xD;
      index, the altered immune functions seem to play a major role in patients with Type 1&#xD;
      Diabetes (T1D). Altough an impaired immune response to vaccination was hypothesized in&#xD;
      diabetic patients, no evidence has been provided. Given the high risk of severe SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection, patients with T1D and T2D should represent a priority group to receive the&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine. There are currently no studies on diabetic population response to mRNA&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, in this observational cohort study, investigators will&#xD;
      retrospectively analyze the safety and immunogenicity of the mRNA vaccines in eliciting both&#xD;
      the humoral and cellular immune response in a subset of patients with T1D, T2D and in&#xD;
      non-diabetic individuals who already underwent blood sampling for measuring humoral response&#xD;
      against SARSCoV2 for healthcare purposes and based on the clinical practice guidelines.&#xD;
