    <textblock>
      Small scale data indicate that cervical cancer screening participation may increase when&#xD;
      self-sampling (SS) devices are offered directly by health care workers to non-screened woman,&#xD;
      when those woman contact health services for whatever reason. The purpose of the current&#xD;
      research is to reproduce the early findings of a MSc project conducted in a general&#xD;
      practitioners (GP) group practice in Brussels, where women not screened since &gt;3 years&#xD;
      randomized to direct reception of a SS kit yielded a response of 78% vs 51% in the control&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BELGSSAR will also investigate whether GP's have the information on the most important risk&#xD;
      factors for cervical cancer available in their patient files.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening with clinically validated high-risk (hr) HPV tests is more effective in reducing&#xD;
      cervical cancer incidence than cytology. Another advantage of hrHPV testing is that it can be&#xD;
      performed on self-samples whereas cytology on self-samples shows poor clinical accuracy.&#xD;
      hrHPV DNA testing on vaginal self-samples is as accurate on self- as on clinician-taken&#xD;
      samples under the condition to use clinically validated PCR-based assays that target DNA&#xD;
      sequences of the viral genome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Offering kits for vaginal self-sampling is more effective than conventional invitations /&#xD;
      reminders sent to under-screened women to have a cervical specimen taken by a clinician.&#xD;
      Small scale data indicate that screening participation may increase when self-sampling (SS)&#xD;
      devices are offered directly by health care workers to non-screened woman, when those woman&#xD;
      contact health services for whatever reason. The purpose of the current research is to&#xD;
      reproduce the early findings of a MSc project conducted in a general practitioners (GP) group&#xD;
      practice in Brussels, where women not screened since &gt;3 years randomized to direct reception&#xD;
      of SS kit yielded a response of 78% vs 51% in the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk based cervical cancer screening takes risk factors into account to differentiate&#xD;
      screening policies. GPs have knowledge of these risk factors. Demonstration of the knowledge&#xD;
      of these risk factors from GP's patient files will be demonstrated through the BELGSSAR&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two self-sampling methods will be used in BELGSSAR:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. vaginal self-sampling using the Evalyn® Brush (Roovers, Oss, NL) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. first-void urine collection with the Colli-PeeTM (Novosanis, Wijnegem, BE). Depending on&#xD;
           the GP practice, collection will take place at home or at the GP office (predefined by&#xD;
           the respective GP). The inclusion of urine collection is motivated by the possible lower&#xD;
           threshold for women who dislike genital examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypotheses will be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participation in cervical cancer screening is substantially higher when a GP offers a&#xD;
           self-sampling kit compared to control interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Risk factors for cervical cancer can be identified accurately from GP's patient files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test these hypotheses, a two-arm participation trial will be conducted in eight GP&#xD;
      practices in Belgium, spread over four locations (Ghent, Leuven, Brussels and Liège). In each&#xD;
      GP practice the enrolled patients will be randomized to one of the two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the experimental arms (Arm 1), the woman will be asked to collect a vaginal sample with&#xD;
      the Evalyn® Brush or a urine sample with the Colli-PeeTM. Women shall receive this&#xD;
      self-sampling device directly from the GP or shall pick it up at a close by pharmacist with a&#xD;
      prescription of the GP. In four GP practices (1, 2, 5, 6) the patient has to collect the SS&#xD;
      preferentially in the GP practice (at home if the GP practice is not well equipped) whereas&#xD;
      in the other four GP practices (3, 4, 7, 8), the patient has to collect the SS at home and&#xD;
      send it to the laboratory by using a prepaid envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the control group (Arm 2) will receive an oral recommendation given by the GP with a&#xD;
      reminder of the current screening policy to have a cervical sample taken by a physician&#xD;
      chosen by the woman. This clinician-taken cervical sample will be sent to a laboratory for&#xD;
      processing with the usual screening test. Today the usual screening test still is cytology,&#xD;
      but this will change in the future (date to be defined) to an HPV test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double blinding of patient and investigator is not possible, because the participants will be&#xD;
      aware to which study arm they belong when they receive or offer the self-sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples collected under the experimental arms will be handled and tested for presence of&#xD;
      hrHPV types at the AML laboratory in Antwerp. AML is the national reference laboratory for&#xD;
      HPV for Belgium. The used HPV assay will be the RIATOL qPCR, that detects E6/E7 HPV genes,&#xD;
      with measurement of type-specific viral load of all high-risk HPV types. This test is&#xD;
      clinically validated for HPV-based cervical cancer screening. The tests performed in the&#xD;
      control arm will be processed in the laboratories connected with the respective GP practices.&#xD;
