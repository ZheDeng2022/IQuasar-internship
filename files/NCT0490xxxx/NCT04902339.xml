  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this pilot trial is to enhance the efficacy of the Mindfulness-Oriented&#xD;
      Recovery Enhancement (MORE) intervention by adding neurofeedback (NF) of the Orbitofrontal&#xD;
      Cortex (OFC) as an adjunct to the savoring component of MORE. We hypothesize that the use of&#xD;
      NF to train OFC responses during savoring will amplify patients' ability to savor and thereby&#xD;
      increase brain responsivity to natural rewards; such enhanced reward responding will in turn&#xD;
      be associated with improvements in clinical outcomes (e.g., pain, analgesic use).&#xD;
