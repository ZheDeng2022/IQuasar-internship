    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Limb volume measurement is performed by using a calibrated tape measure to measure circumference from the wrist and the ulnar styloid process and at 4cm increments to the axilla. Measurements to be taken for both upper extremities. Volume is calculated based on cylindrical segment analysis. The outcome measure is assessed as a difference or change from baseline to month 1</description>

    <description>The Lymphedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (LYMQOL), a validated disease-specific QoL tool, is also administered at baseline and month 1. Overall QoL is scored on a single item by the patient on a scale of 1-10. The outcome measure is assessed as a difference or change from baseline LYMQOL at day zero and month 1</description>
