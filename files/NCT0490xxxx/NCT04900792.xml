      This clinical trial evaluates adding ferumoxytol and pharamcologic ascorbate (vitamin C) to&#xD;
      standard of care treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (a type of brain tumor) in adults. All&#xD;
      subjects will receive ferumoxytol and pharmacologic ascorbate in addition to the standard&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initial, standard treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) involves maximum safe&#xD;
      surgical resection followed by radiation combined with temozolomide (a chemotherapy pill you&#xD;
      take by mouth).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this trial will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  receive intravenous (IV) ferumoxytol the day before starting radiation, then around&#xD;
           radiation treatments 6, 25, and 31.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  receive high doses of intravenous (IV) ascorbate three times a week during the combined&#xD;
           radiation and chemotherapy phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  provide feedback about how they feel and their quality of life. This is done through&#xD;
           short surveys as well as discussing with the study team.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability to provide informed consent consistent with Good Clinical&#xD;
             Practice (i.e., legally authorized representative will not be used / allowed for this&#xD;
             study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures for the duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Newly diagnosed (i.e., within 6 weeks), histologically or molecularly confirmed&#xD;
             glioblastoma or diffuse midline glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Therapy to begin within 6 weeks of last surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to take oral medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 (KPS of &gt;50)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recommended to receive temozolomide and radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically fit, as determined by the prescribing oncologists, to undergo temozolomide&#xD;
             and radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to use of highly effective contraception from screening until at least 90 days&#xD;
             after the last study treatment (study participant should not discontinue contraception&#xD;
             until discussing with their treating oncologist(s)).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not have significant co-morbid central nervous system disease, such as multiple&#xD;
             sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to Lifestyle Considerations throughout study duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of the following drugs and cannot have a drug substitution or decline the&#xD;
             drug substitution: warfarin, flecainide, methadone, amphetamines, quinidine, and&#xD;
             chlorpropamide. Pharmacologic ascorbic acid may affect urine acidification and, as a&#xD;
             result, may affect clearance rates of these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of antiretroviral drugs (e.g., nelfinavir, abacavir, emtricitabine,&#xD;
             lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, zidovudine). Pharmacologic&#xD;
             ascorbate acid is a known CYP450 3A4 inducer, which results in lower serum levels of&#xD;
             antiretroviral drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Insulin requirement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Requires blood glucose monitoring using finger-stick glucose checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to undergo MR imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation (note: potential participants should not engage in 'pump &amp;&#xD;
             dump' strategy; lactation must be discontinued).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergic reactions to ferumoxytol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hemochromatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation treatment that would result in field overlap. For potential&#xD;
             participants who have undergone nuclear medicine therapy, including PRRT, the study's&#xD;
             radiation oncologist must approve study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ferritin &gt; 1,000 ng/mL within 21 days of first treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &lt; 100,000 /mm3 within 21 days of first treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine ≥ 1.5x the institutional upper limit of normal within 21 days of the first&#xD;
             treatment or if creatinine is elevated a creatinine clearance of &lt; 60 mL/(min 1.73 m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection (requiring inpatient admission or a delay to start of therapy), symptomatic&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with another investigational drug within 30 days prior to study treatment&#xD;
             day 1. Imaging trials (including investigational PET or NM tracers) as well as&#xD;
             observational trials are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical trials with an endpoint of treating the patient's cancer.&#xD;
