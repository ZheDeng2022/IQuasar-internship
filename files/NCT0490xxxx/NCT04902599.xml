  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Renuvion/J-plasma cold atmospheric plasma device has been in clinical use in aesthetics&#xD;
      since its approval by the FDA in 2012, but no rigorous clinical trials have been published to&#xD;
      quantify the effect of the skin tightening in any body area. In current clinical practice,&#xD;
      the device is frequently used in conjunction with liposuction and both blunt and ultrasound&#xD;
      assisted dissection cannulas are utilized. There is some thought that ultrasound assisted&#xD;
      dissection may impart some tissue warming and skin tightening effects, but these effects are&#xD;
      anecdotal at this time and not rigorously scientifically tested. Our study is designed to&#xD;
      address these practice gaps by quantifying the improvement in skin laxity by objective&#xD;
      measurements and comparing results obtained between blunt and ultrasound assisted dissection&#xD;
      techniques without concurrent liposuction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a single-blind, prospective, right-left sided comparator design to assess&#xD;
      the effect of the Renuvion/J-Plasma CAP device on skin tightening of upper extremity skin&#xD;
      laxity and compare the effect of blunt dissection versus ultrasound assisted site preparation&#xD;
      on the procedure results in a non-inferiority design. This study will be a prospective,&#xD;
      single-blind (assessor), randomized right-left sided, non-inferiority clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, right-left arm, single blinded, prospective noninferiority clinical&#xD;
      trial comparing ultrasound assisted to traditional blunt dissection in site preparation prior&#xD;
      to subdermal application of the Renuvion/J-plasma cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) device while&#xD;
      quantitatively evaluating the efficacy of the Renuvion device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 15 patients will be enrolled. Dropout is anticipated to be low as the study visits&#xD;
      will concur with routine clinical follow up appointments. The number needed to treat to show&#xD;
      noninferiority between blunt dissection and ultrasound assisted dissection is 13 and the&#xD;
      number needed to treat to show statistically significant difference between baseline and&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Renuvion/J-plasma cold atmospheric plasma device has been in clinical use in aesthetics&#xD;
      since its approval by the FDA in 2012, but no rigorous clinical trials have been published to&#xD;
      quantify the effect of the skin tightening in any body area. In current clinical practice,&#xD;
      the device is frequently used in conjunction with liposuction and both blunt and ultrasound&#xD;
      assisted dissection cannulas are utilized. There is some thought that ultrasound assisted&#xD;
      dissection may impart some tissue warming and skin tightening effects, but these effects are&#xD;
      anecdotal at this time and not rigorously scientifically tested. Our study is designed to&#xD;
      address these practice gaps by quantifying the improvement in skin laxity by objective&#xD;
      measurements and comparing results obtained between blunt and ultrasound assisted dissection&#xD;
      techniques without concurrent liposuction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a single-blind, prospective, right-left sided comparator design to assess&#xD;
      the effect of the Renuvion/J-Plasma CAP device on skin tightening of upper extremity skin&#xD;
      laxity and compare the effect of blunt dissection versus ultrasound assisted site preparation&#xD;
      on the procedure results in a non-inferiority design. This study will be a prospective,&#xD;
      single-blind (assessor), randomized right-left sided, non-inferiority clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bliniding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To blind the study, the sub-investigator/operator will use an internet-based random number&#xD;
      generator to assign the right arm to blunt dissection (odd numbers) or ultrasound-assisted&#xD;
      dissection (zero and even numbers). Due to the nature of the procedure, it will be impossible&#xD;
      to blind the operator and the patient to site preparation technique. The assessors and&#xD;
      coordinators will remain blinded to the treatment assignment throughout the study.&#xD;
      Measurements and photographs will not be labeled regarding which site preparation method was&#xD;
      used. A patient specific paper chart will have treatment assignments, which will minimize the&#xD;
      potential for inadvertent unblinding and allow for unblinding in the event unblinding becomes&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Purposes and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantify the clinical improvement from baseline to 1, 3 and 9 months after treatment of&#xD;
           underarm laxity using the Renuvion/J-Plasma cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) device with&#xD;
           both Vaser ultrasound-assisted dissection and blunt dissection methods for site&#xD;
           preparation in a randomized, right-left arm single blinded, prospective clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Compare ultrasound-assisted site prepared side baseline photographs to 1-month,&#xD;
                3-month, and 9-month post-treatment photos to assess change in area between&#xD;
                overlaid photographs taken in both sagittal and coronal planes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Compare ultrasound-assisted site prepared side baseline photographs to 1-month,&#xD;
                3-month, and 9 month post-treatment photos to assess change in distance of lowest&#xD;
                hanging point between overlaid photographs taken in both sagittal and coronal&#xD;
                planes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Compare ultrasound-assisted site prepared side linear circumference at baseline to&#xD;
                1-month, 3-month, and 9-month post-treatment measurements to assess change in&#xD;
                linear circumference of treated area.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Compare blunt dissection site prepared side baseline photographs to 1-month,&#xD;
                3-month, and 9-month post-treatment photos to assess change in area between&#xD;
                overlaid photographs taken in both sagittal and coronal planes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Compare blunt dissection site prepared side baseline photographs to 1-month,&#xD;
                3-month, and 9-month post-treatment photos to assess change in distance of lowest&#xD;
                hanging point between overlaid photographs taken in both sagittal and coronal&#xD;
                planes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Compare blunt dissection site prepared side linear circumference at baseline to&#xD;
                1-month, 3-month, and 9-month post-treatment measurements to assess change in&#xD;
                linear circumference of treated area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare non-inferiority of clinical endpoints between blunt dissection cannula and Vaser&#xD;
           ultrasound-assisted cannula for site preparation of Renuvion/J-Plasma treatment at 1, 3,&#xD;
           and 9 months post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Compare ultrasound-assisted site prepared side to blunt dissection prepared side by&#xD;
                calculating the difference in area change in sagittal and coronal planes as&#xD;
                determined in objective 1 between the two treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Compare ultrasound-assisted site prepared side to blunt dissection prepared side by&#xD;
                calculating the difference in lowest hanging point change in sagittal and coronal&#xD;
                planes as determined in objective 1 between the two treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Compare ultrasound-assisted site prepared side to blunt dissection prepared side by&#xD;
                calculating the difference in linear circumference of treated area change as&#xD;
                determined in objective 1 between the two treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess patient reported outcomes of the treatment using the BODY-Q and Skindex-16&#xD;
           instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, right-left arm, single blinded, prospective noninferiority clinical&#xD;
      trial comparing ultrasound assisted to traditional blunt dissection in site preparation prior&#xD;
      to subdermal application of the Renuvion/J-plasma cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) device while&#xD;
      quantitatively evaluating the efficacy of the Renuvion device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 15 patients will be enrolled. Dropout is anticipated to be low as the study visits&#xD;
      will concur with routine clinical follow up appointments. The number needed to treat to show&#xD;
      noninferiority between blunt dissection and ultrasound assisted dissection is 13 and the&#xD;
      number needed to treat to show statistically significant difference between baseline and&#xD;
      follow up is 3 for the Renuvion/J-Plasma procedure. The study timeline is summarized in table&#xD;
      1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For screening, subjects with qualifying underarm skin laxity without excess fat will be asked&#xD;
      to read and sign the informed consent document. They will be reminded that they are to take&#xD;
      their time, and if necessary, take it home for further consideration. Questions will be&#xD;
      answered. Those meeting inclusion / exclusion criteria who have signed informed consent will&#xD;
      be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After answering questions and prior to the treatment, the Principal Investigator (PI) will&#xD;
      examine the upper body of the patient and assess the type of upper arm skin laxity, amount of&#xD;
      underlying fat, and perform measurements to include weight, mid-biceps arm circumference and&#xD;
      skin ptosis from brachial sulcus to the lowermost border of pendulous skin. Standardized&#xD;
      photographs of the treatment area will be obtained in sagittal and coronal planes of the arms&#xD;
      abducted to 90o with elbows flexed to 90o. The patient will complete the Body-Q and&#xD;
      Skindex-16 patient reported outcomes measurement tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a random number generator, the patient will be randomized to undergo blunt dissection&#xD;
      vs ultrasound-assisted dissection of the right arm. The left arm will receive the site&#xD;
      preparation modality not selected for the right arm. The sub-investigator will perform the&#xD;
      randomization on the day of the procedure and the PI will be blinded to the treatment&#xD;
      assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At follow up visits, the blinded PI will perform an upper body exam and repeat mid-biceps arm&#xD;
      circumference and skin ptosis measurements. Standardized photographs will be repeated in&#xD;
      sagittal and coronal planes as at baseline. The patient will complete the Body-Q and&#xD;
      Skindex-16 patient reported outcomes measurement tools. Treatment related adverse event&#xD;
      information will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations for adverse events will be carried out by the PI or sub-I at scheduled follow up&#xD;
      visits or if the clinic is notified of problems by the patient. If adverse events have not&#xD;
      resolved at the time of the final visit, the patient will be followed for resolution of these&#xD;
      events by phone or office visits. Specific adverse events to be tracked will include pain,&#xD;
      bleeding, hematoma formation, infection, nerve damage, scarring, and skin discoloration in&#xD;
      the treatment sites. Major cardiac and neurologic events will also be noted, but are not&#xD;
      anticipated based on existing data on these and similar procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will arrive on the day of the procedure and sites will be prepped in a standard&#xD;
      sterile fashion. Patients will receive diazepam and midazolam orally as appropriate for&#xD;
      anxiolysis or mild sedation. Local anesthesia will be administered using tumescent lidocaine&#xD;
      (1 g lidocaine and 1 mg epinephrine in 100 ml plus 10 mEq sodium bicarbonate in 10 ml added&#xD;
      to 1000 ml of 0.9% physiologic saline) at a maximum dose of 28 mg/kg to prevent toxicity. 4&#xD;
      mm incisions will be made at the distal portion of the posterior upper arm, approximately&#xD;
      2.5-4 cm from the olecranon process when the arm is at 90 degrees of flexion, and at the most&#xD;
      proximal portion of the posterior upper arm in the axillary crease. A standard 3 mm blunt&#xD;
      liposuction cannula not attached to suction will be used to dissect the subcutaneous tissue&#xD;
      of the posterior upper arm on the side randomized to blunt dissection. Several passes will be&#xD;
      made using the blunt dissection cannula with (increasing/decreasing sizes) until the&#xD;
      dissection plane has been completed. The Renuvion/J-Plasma CAP device will be inserted into&#xD;
      the openings created for the dissection and 4 passes of the device applied to the underside&#xD;
      of the dermis will be made at a setting of 80mJ and 2.0 L of flow. This process will be&#xD;
      repeated on the contralateral side using the ultrasound assisted device (Vaser) in place of&#xD;
      the blunt dissection cannula at the setting of 60% energy (10W) for no greater than 2.5 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-procedure, the cannula wounds will be closed with one 4-0 nylon suture, and otherwise&#xD;
      left open to allow for drainage and venting. The upper arms will be wrapped with absorbent&#xD;
      pads and an industry standard upper arm compression garment which we will provide. The&#xD;
      compression garment is to be worn for 2 weeks following the procedure. Post-operative pain&#xD;
      will be managed with acetaminophen and 5mg/325mg hydrocodone/acetaminophen as needed. The&#xD;
      patient will shower normally the following day and expect some mild serosanginous drainage&#xD;
      from the incision sites over 48 hours following the procedure. After 48 hours the patient&#xD;
      will then begin daily placement of a thin layer of white petrolatum over the incision sites&#xD;
      followed by a small bandage or Band-aid&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluations will be performed at baseline, 1-month post-procedure, 3-months&#xD;
      post-procedure, and 9-months post-procedure. For each evaluation, a coordinator who is&#xD;
      blinded to the treatment assignment will measure upper arm circumference of each arm at the&#xD;
      point of maximum diameter and vertical distance from the brachial sulcus to the lowermost&#xD;
      border of pendulous skin when the arms are positioned at 90o abducted at the shoulder and 90o&#xD;
      flexed at the elbow. Circumference will be measured with a flexible measuring tape and&#xD;
      vertical distance will be measured using a rigid ruler. These measurements will be entered&#xD;
      into a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) and analyzed using R&#xD;
      statistical software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) to determine&#xD;
      the mean change from baseline and standard deviation at 1, 3, and 9-months post-procedure and&#xD;
      between 1- and 3-months post-procedure, 1- and 9- months post-procedure, and 3- and 9-months&#xD;
      post-procedure. T-testing will be performed using the R statistical software package to&#xD;
      compare before and after measurements at each time point from baseline and between each&#xD;
      follow up interval. P-values will be calculated with a significance level of P &lt; 0.05 being&#xD;
      considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized photographs of the treatment area will be obtained by trained staff&#xD;
      photographers in sagittal and coronal planes of the arms abducted to 90o with elbows flexed&#xD;
      to 90o. Digital photographs will be obtained at baseline, 1-month post-procedure, 3-months&#xD;
      post-procedure, and 9-months post-procedure. Photographs will be obtained using a Canon&#xD;
      camera for sagittal, coronal, and oblique views and Visia system (Canfield Scientific, Inc.,&#xD;
      Parsippany, NJ) for sagittal and oblique views.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will complete the clinically validated Body-Q patient reported outcomes&#xD;
      measurement tool for upper arms at baseline, 1, 3, and 9-months post-procedure. A copy of&#xD;
      this assessment tool is included in the supporting documents section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Efficacy Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The efficacy will be measured using the change in area and vertical distance calculated&#xD;
           from standardized digital photographic overlays using the sagittal view between baseline&#xD;
           and 9-months post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Efficacy Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Unless otherwise stated, secondary efficacy measures will be calculated between baseline&#xD;
           and 1-month post-procedure, baseline and 3-months post-procedure, baseline and 9-months&#xD;
           post-procedure, between 1- and 3-months post-procedure, between 1- and 9-months&#xD;
           post-procedure, and between 3- and 9-months post-procedure. These measures will include&#xD;
           the change in area and vertical distance calculated from standardized digital&#xD;
           photographic overlays using the sagittal view for non-primary endpoint time intervals,&#xD;
           the change in area and vertical distance calculated from standardized digital&#xD;
           photographic overlays using the coronal view, the difference in arm circumference, the&#xD;
           difference in measured vertical pendulous skin, and differences in Body-Q and Skindex-16&#xD;
           patient recorded outcomes measurements, and subjective blinded assessor assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be catalogued, detailed, and presented in table format.&#xD;
