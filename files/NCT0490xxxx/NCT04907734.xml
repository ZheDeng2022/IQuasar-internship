    <textblock>
      The present study aims to compare the results obtained from the assessment of skinfolds using&#xD;
      four anthropometric calipers (Harpenden, Holtain, Slime Guide and Lipowise). The objectives&#xD;
      are to check if there are differences depending on the caliper used to assess skinfolds, and&#xD;
      to study the variation in skinfold compressibility as a function of the time elapsed from the&#xD;
      application of the caliper to the measurement reading, as well as the validation of the&#xD;
      Lipowise caliper. A cross-sectional study will be carried out with a sample of 100 university&#xD;
      students aged between 18 and 25 years. Physical activity will be assessed by means of an&#xD;
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and hydration status by urine samples.&#xD;
      Anthropometric assessments, including weight, height, and eight skinfolds, will be performed&#xD;
      according to the International Society for the Advancement in Kinanthropometry protocol,&#xD;
      using the four previously mentioned calipers. Finally, a data analysis will be carried out to&#xD;
      compare the results of the samples taken by the calipersand to draw conclusions.&#xD;

      The objectives adressed in this study are: 1- To verify whether the model of adipometer used&#xD;
      to measure skinfolds influences the results obtained. 2- To study the variation in skinfold&#xD;
      compressibility as a function of the time elapsed between the application of the adipometer&#xD;
      and the measurement reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the above objectives, it is proposed to carry out a ten-month cross-sectional&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will consist of 80 university students (40 males and 40 females), caucasian, aged&#xD;
      between 18 and 25 years. This is a convenience sample recruited in Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated based on previous criteria defined for validation studies,&#xD;
      i.e. the number of subjects should be 7 times the number of items to be analysed and greater&#xD;
      than or equal to 100. Taking into account that we will assess the 8 skinfolds defined by the&#xD;
      International Society for the Advancement in Kinanthropometry (ISAK), and taking into account&#xD;
      possible sample losses, should be recruited 50 participants of each sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent All participants will be required to complete and sign the informed consent&#xD;
      form, prior to the day of data collection, which we will designate as day 1, in a location&#xD;
      that ensures their privacy, but in the presence of the investigator for clarification of any&#xD;
      doubts that may arise. Participants will be reminded that: 1) their participation is&#xD;
      voluntary and that they may leave the study if they wish; and 2) that all data collected are&#xD;
      confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      All assessments will be conducted on the same day, between 8:00 am and 2:00 pm, in a&#xD;
      laboratory with a temperature of 24ºC and ambient humidity between 65-70%, and where&#xD;
      participant privacy is guaranteed. Data collection from each participant will last an&#xD;
      estimated 1 hour. On the day of data collection, participants must respect the following&#xD;
      conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No physical exercise in the 12 hours prior to the evaluation, in the case of moderate&#xD;
           exercise, or in the last 24 hours, in the case of vigorous exercise;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not to have consumed products with diuretic properties in the 24 hours prior to the&#xD;
           assessment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not having used a sauna in the 24 hours prior to the assessment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not having a large meal the day before or on the day of the assessment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the case of female participants, be between days 8 and 21 of the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Demographic data The following demographic data: date of birth, place/country of&#xD;
      birth, sex, ethnicity, sporting practice (modality, level, years of practice, duration and&#xD;
      weekly frequency of training) and day of the half cycle, will be obtained through a&#xD;
      questionnaire. This questionnaire will be completed on the day the participant signs the&#xD;
      informed consent form (day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity The assessment of physical activity will be carried out indirectly through&#xD;
      the application of the IPAQ questionnaire - reduced version. This questionnaire shall be&#xD;
      completed on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydration status Hydration status shall be assessed indirectly, using a urine colour scale.&#xD;
      Immediately prior to the anthropometric assessment, the participant collects a portion of&#xD;
      urine in a suitable container provided by the research team. In the presence of the&#xD;
      participant, the urine will be graded according to its colour, after which it is discarded by&#xD;
      the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements All anthropometric measurements will be obtained by&#xD;
      anthropometrists with current ISAK certification, respecting the procedures described by&#xD;
      ISAK, always using the same measuring instruments. The assessments will begin with the&#xD;
      measurement of height and body mass, using a Seca 217 portable stadiometer and a Seca 878&#xD;
      scale, respectively.&#xD;
