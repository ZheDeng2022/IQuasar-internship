  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronically dialyzed patients and kidney transplant recipients have been identified as&#xD;
      particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to unavoidable exposure. They have also&#xD;
      high rates of comorbid conditions and have varying degrees of immunosuppression, which puts&#xD;
      them at risk of developing very severe forms of COVID-19 disease with fatality rates varying&#xD;
      from 16% to 32%. In such circumstances vaccination is the only chance to improve their&#xD;
      extremely poor prognosis. There is very little published data on the response to vaccination&#xD;
      in dialyzed patients and kidney transplant recipients so far. No data are available on the&#xD;
      efficacy of vaccines against COVID-19 in patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD).&#xD;
      Furthermore, given the fact that disturbances of acquired immunity in dialyzed patients are&#xD;
      many and diverse it is uncertain whether vaccinating against SARS CoV-2 in these population&#xD;
      will result in sufficient immune response and, by consequence, protection against infection.&#xD;
      Registration studies on the basis of which population vaccinations are actually conducted&#xD;
      were performed only in the general population. There were no dialyzed patients and kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients in the study groups, so these patients are vaccinated with doses and&#xD;
      schedules for people without chronic kidney disease. It is not known whether vaccination&#xD;
      under such standard schedule produces a sufficient immune response in them and how long it&#xD;
      lasts. That's why the aim of this study is to evaluate the humoral and cellular immune&#xD;
      response after mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 with which patients treated with renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy are vaccinated in Poland. It will be a prospective, observational&#xD;
      controlled study conducted in patients treated with renal replacement therapy (hemodialyzed&#xD;
      subjects, patients treated with peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplant recipients)&#xD;
      vaccinated with mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 according to common rules and manufactures&#xD;
      recommendations.The control group will be made up of sex and age matched people without&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease.The first goal of the study is to analyze seroconversion rate and&#xD;
      titer magnitude of neutralizing IgG and IgA antibodies directed against spike (s) SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      antigen after the first and the second dose of mRNA vaccine as well as after 3, 6, 9, 12&#xD;
      months after vaccination. The second goal is to evaluate the cellular immune response tested&#xD;
      using the ELISPOT method at the same time points as above.The immune response will be&#xD;
      compared to patients without chronic kidney disease as well as between hemodialysis,&#xD;
      peritoneal dialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients.&#xD;

      1. Venous blood samples will be collected at seven-time points: before dose 1 of vaccine,&#xD;
           21 days after dose 1, within 14-21 days after dose 2 and 3,6,9,12 months after&#xD;
           vaccination. From the volume of about 8 ml of the patient's peripheral blood, a fraction&#xD;
           of PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) will be isolated, which in the first stage&#xD;
           of the study will be frozen in nitrogen. To generate serum, blood samples were&#xD;
           centrifuged at room temperature at 2500 RPM for 10 minutes, aliquoted, frozen in -70˚C,&#xD;
           and stored until use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The level of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) antigen will be detected&#xD;
           in serum using the Abbot Architect™SARS-CoV-2 IgG test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The level of neutralizing IgG and IgA antibodies against the SARS-CoV (S1 and S2&#xD;
           subunits) (S) will be detected in serum using the DiaSorin LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG&#xD;
           serology COVID-19 S-Protein (S1RBD) Human IgA ELISA Kit respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The cellular component of the immune response will be tested using the ELISPOT method,&#xD;
           which involves testing the amount of INF-γ and IL-2 released from leukocyte cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The grading scales for side effects (the same as in the pivotal trial) used in this&#xD;
           study were derived from the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)&#xD;
           guidelines on toxicity grading scales for healthy adult volunteers enrolled in&#xD;
           preventive vaccine clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. All medical data of patients from all groups will be extracted from their medical&#xD;
           records.&#xD;
