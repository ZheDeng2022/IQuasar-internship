  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a condition characterised by age-related loss of muscle mass and function.&#xD;
      Factors affecting the strength of muscle contraction independent of mass, such as&#xD;
      neuromuscular junction (NMJ) transmission, are increasingly suspected as important&#xD;
      contributors to the development of age-related physical disability. The group of&#xD;
      investigators leading the current study, have recently demonstrated NMJ transmission deficits&#xD;
      in aged mice, but whether this translates in older human individuals is not known&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to assess whether clinically meaningfull muscle weakness is associated&#xD;
      with NMJ transmission deficits in older human individuals with clinically meaningfull muscle&#xD;
      weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to assess whether NMJ transmission deficits correlate with different&#xD;
      measures of functional capacity to inform future trials of the most appropriate choice of&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;

      The study is a cross-sectional pilot study and will be led by investigators:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Professor Brian Clark, PhD, Ohio University&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Professor William David Arnold, MD, Ohio State University&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 16 older (&gt;70 yrs.) individuals and 8 healthy younger (18-50 yrs.) individuals will be&#xD;
      included in this cross-sectional pilot study. To assess whether clinically meaningfull muscle&#xD;
      weakness is associated with NMJ transmission failure, results from single fiber EMG analyses&#xD;
      and repetitive nerve stimulation in older individuals with clinically meaningfull muscle&#xD;
      weakness will be compared to those obtained in older adults without muscle weakness and with&#xD;
      healthy young individuals. To assess whether NMJ transmission deficits correlates with&#xD;
      different measures of functional capacity, a series of different functional tests will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
