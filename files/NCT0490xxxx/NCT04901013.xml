  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical study compares Affinity® plus&#xD;
      SOC to SOC alone in subjects with VLUs. Affinity® will be used along with standard of care on&#xD;
      venous leg ulcers (VLUs) of greater than 4 weeks which have not adequately responded to&#xD;
      conventional ulcer therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two hundred (200) subjects with a chronic VLU ranging in size from 2cm2 and 80 cm2 will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to either Affinity® and SOC or SOC alone following the 28 day screening&#xD;
      period. Following screening and randomization, subjects shall be seen weekly for up to 24&#xD;
      weeks. For subjects that heal prior to week 24, a healing confirmation visit shall occur two&#xD;
      weeks later to confirm maintenance of complete wound closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that are randomized into the SOC group whose VLU has not healed by week 12 may be&#xD;
      crossed over to receive Affinity® and followed for an additional 12-14 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Affinity is an aseptically processed, hypothermically stored fresh allograft with viable cells, growth factors/cytokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM). Affinity is human allograft tissue that is regulated as a Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Product (HCT/P) as defined by FDA 21 CFR Part 1271. Affinity may be applied as a wound covering to partial- and full-thickness acute and chronic wounds</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ulcers of venous origin, as clinically determined by clinical signs and symptoms (e.g.&#xD;
             hyperpigmentation of the surrounding skin, history of swelling, varicosities,&#xD;
             lipodermatosclerosis and/or dermatitis) or other assessments (e.g. venous reflux&#xD;
             test).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Venous insufficiency ulcers, of at least 1-month duration, which have not adequately&#xD;
             responded to conventional ulcer therapy&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Partial- or full-thickness VLU, including ulcers with tissue damage that extends&#xD;
             through the epidermis and into the upper epidermis (papillary dermis), or into the&#xD;
             deep dermis (reticular dermis) but not through muscle, tendon, capsule, or into bone.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Vasculitis, severe rheumatoid arthritis, and other collagen vascular diseases&#xD;

             immune disease&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Necrotic or avascular ulcer beds&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Subjects who are currently receiving or have received at any time within one month&#xD;
             prior to entry into the study, corticosteroids (&gt;15 mg/day), immunosuppressive agents,&#xD;
             radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. Anticipated use of the above agents will exclude&#xD;
             subjects from entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects enrolled in other wound drug investigational studies within the past three&#xD;
