  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine reward processing and cognitive control both with and without the influence of&#xD;
      vaporized nicotine in young adults with no history of cigarette use using EEG and fMRI. The&#xD;
      goal is to determine whether acute nicotine administration using a Juul device would impact&#xD;
      functional correlates of reward and inhibitory control in people who commonly use juul&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;

      Aim 1: To examine reward processing both with and without the influence of vaporized nicotine&#xD;
      in young adults with no history of cigarette use using EEG and fMRI. The goal is to determine&#xD;
      whether acute nicotine administration using a Juul device would impact functional correlates&#xD;
      of distinguishable reward processes (anticipatory and consummatory reward) in young adults&#xD;
      who commonly use juul devices. Predictions are that juul use will have an impact on activity&#xD;
      in the striatum, resulting in reduced activation in fMRI and smaller amplitudes in&#xD;
      event-related potentials (ERP) in response to reward cues and reward feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine cognitive control both with and without the influence of vaporized nicotine&#xD;
      in young adults with no history of cigarette use using EEG and fMRI. The goal is to determine&#xD;
      whether acute nicotine administration using a Juul device would impact functional correlates&#xD;
      of behavioral inhibition in young adults who commonly use juul devices. Predictions are that&#xD;
      juul use will affect the inhibitory circuit, including the anterior cingulate and the&#xD;
      dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, resulting in decreased activation in these regions during&#xD;
      fMRI and reductions in the FRN and P300 ERP responses in response to inhibitions and to&#xD;
      commission errors. Predictions also include that inhibitory control behavior will be impaired&#xD;
      after juul use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To establish feasibility of naturalistic use of vaping devices for nicotine&#xD;
      administration and observing the effects in the laboratory.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and to comply with all study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For Juul users, Healthy adults between 18-3025 years of age who are users of Juul (defined&#xD;
        as reporting Juul use of 5% nicotine pods 3x per week or more and not active or previous&#xD;
        users of cigarettes. If the first testing day reveals no cotinine in a self-reported Juul&#xD;
        user, participants will not be permitted to continue in the study. Vaping naïve will also&#xD;
        be defined as vaping for less than 3 months or less than 12 times. This is to prevent&#xD;
        nicotine-naïve individuals from trying to participate for study compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Juul users will be required to already own a Juul device at screening (ie: not naive), to&#xD;
        preclude any individuals from potentially purchasing a Juul device to join in the study.&#xD;
        However, individuals who are 18-20 will not bring their device to the laboratory, and will&#xD;
        instead be provided a Juul device to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Controls will be healthy adults between 18-3025 years of age with no history of any&#xD;
        nicotine use. Controls will not vape during the study at any time or have any exposure to&#xD;
        e-cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. A serious neurological or endocrine disorder or any medical condition or treatment&#xD;
             known to affect the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. A medical condition that requires treatment with a medication with psychotropic&#xD;
             effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Occurrence of a stroke, as reported by the participant during screening. 4. Any&#xD;
             contraindications to MRI scanning (i.e., metal implants, pacemakers, etc.) 5. History&#xD;
             of loss of consciousness (LOC) for longer than 30 minutes or LOC with any neurological&#xD;
             sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. DSM-5 criteria for intellectual disability. 7. Current or a history of active&#xD;
             neurological or psychiatric disorders, such as psychosis, bipolar illness, major&#xD;
             depression, organic brain disease, dementia or DSM-V Axis I Psychiatric Disorder,&#xD;
             including current alcohol or substance disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Pregnancy, as indicated by initial screening or verbal confirmation of pregnancy at&#xD;
             one of the four testing sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. (Controls only) any reports or indications (via cotinine testing) of nicotine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
             10. Use of cannabis products use of CBD/THC or marijuana related products. THC testing&#xD;
             is required at baseline and before each exposure to e-cigarettes and will exclude&#xD;
             administration of e-cigarettes if positive. In addition, subjects who have vaped&#xD;
             tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabis (oil, dabs), or modified products with substances&#xD;
             added that were not intended by the manufacturer, or any vaped consumables acquired&#xD;
             from a street vendor, friend/acquaintance, or other informal source in the 90 days&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             11. Any significant current medical condition such as neurological, cardiovascular,&#xD;
             endocrine, renal, or hepatic pathology that would increase risk or would interfere&#xD;
             with/mimic tobacco abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
             b. Medical conditions increasing risk of respiratory problems in nonpatient&#xD;
             populations: Chronic Pulmonary Conditions; c. Untreated, unresolved, acute pulmonary&#xD;
             conditions (recurring bronchitis and Reactive airway disorder, as examples) 12. Known&#xD;
             hypersensitivity to propylene glycol. 13. Planning to quit smoking with a set goal or&#xD;
             time for quit attempt&#xD;
