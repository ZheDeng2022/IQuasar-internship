  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repeat testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in disadvantaged communities will help identify&#xD;
      active and recovered infections over time, and as more is understood about antibody&#xD;
      protection, it may help identify persons who have immunity. Many questions about social&#xD;
      barriers and behavioral facilitators remain unanswered. This project aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of risk-based messaging and incentives that promote repeated testing for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as well as to understand social and behavioral determinants of&#xD;
      COVID-19 testing and variations within sub-groups of this population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has greatly impacted underserved populations. This&#xD;
      project aims to understand social and behavioral determinants of COVID-19 testing and&#xD;
      variations within sub-groups of this population. In partnership with the largest federally&#xD;
      qualified health center in the United States, investigators will collect survey data and&#xD;
      conduct a randomized experiment on 2,160 individuals (540 families) to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of risk-based messaging and incentives that promote repeated testing for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In a 2 x 2 (Messaging x Incentive) factorial experiment, participants&#xD;
      complete a comprehensive set of social and behavioral surveys to identify determinants of&#xD;
      commitment to testing. Participants are then randomized to receive customized messaging&#xD;
      promoting repeated testing. Messaging will focus upon either (1a) household risk or (1b)&#xD;
      personal risk of COVID-19. Participants are also randomly assigned to an incentive condition&#xD;
      that either (2a) insures against losing baseline rewards for initial testing, or (2b) entry&#xD;
      into a lottery with a small chance to win $150 if both tests are completed. Both the loss&#xD;
      protection and lottery conditions carry the same incentive costs. Previous work in similar&#xD;
      populations demonstrates that adherence to planned health behaviors is higher with&#xD;
      insurance-based incentives than cash payments of equal value. This experiment compares&#xD;
      insurance-based incentives to lottery incentives that have been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      multiple contexts. Finally, the investigators evaluate if social and behavioral determinants&#xD;
      of health result in heterogeneous treatment effects that can inform customization of&#xD;
      incentive offerings in future programs devoted to increasing uptake of testing or&#xD;
      vaccinations among underserved populations.&#xD;

    <description>Family risk framing may engender concern for loved ones. It may also make it easier to mentally simulate family burdens with COVID-19 such as knowing how several people in the family becoming sick could adversely affect the lives of everyone in the family. Households randomized to family risk messaging will receive the following message: &quot;Antibody testing will help you understand your family's risk of getting COVID-19.&quot;</description>
