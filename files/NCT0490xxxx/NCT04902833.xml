      This cross-sectional prevalence assessment study involves a single blood draw in specific&#xD;
      patient populations to assess for enzymatic and genomic evidence for acquired pyruvate kinase&#xD;
      deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Red cell pyruvate kinase enzyme activity and next-generation sequencing (NGS) hereditary&#xD;
           hemolytic anemia panels will be performed on samples from all recruited participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will recruit patients to two separate cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 1 will recruit approximately 75 anemic (Hgb &lt;11.0 g/dL) MDS participants&#xD;
                without overt clinical evidence of hemolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 2 will recruit approximately 25 participants with clonal myeloid disorders&#xD;
                of any type with evidence of non-immune, otherwise unexplained hemolytic anemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in the study involves a single blood draw. Basic information about the&#xD;
           participant's blood disorder will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 100 people will take part in this research study&#xD;

               -  A diagnosis of an otherwise unexplained Coombs-negative non-immune hemolytic&#xD;
                  anemia, according to the clinical judgement of the investigator. Some form of&#xD;
                  objective laboratory evidence must be present, including one or more of the&#xD;
                  following: negative direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test, reduced haptoglobin,&#xD;
                  elevated indirect bilirubin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated aspartate&#xD;
                  aminotransferase, or compatible findings on peripheral blood film. Results of all&#xD;
                  of these tests are not required to satisfy this criterion.&#xD;

                  development and diagnosis of MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 2&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have a known hereditary anemic disorder, such as thalassemia, sickle cell&#xD;
                  disease, or hereditary enzyme deficiency, with the exception of hereditary&#xD;
                  X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency known not to cause chronic&#xD;
