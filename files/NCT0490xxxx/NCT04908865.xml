    <description>Participants with adverse events of special interest (AESIs) including all infections of serious infections of special interest and opportunistic infections, infusion related systemic reactions and anaphylactic reactions, depression, suicidality and malignancies will be evaluated.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The SELENA SLEDAI score is a cumulative and weighted index for assessing SLE disease activity across 24 different disease descriptors in participants with SLE. This assessment can be completed to objectively assess the participant's current state of disease. A total score of SELENA SLEDAI can fall between 0 and 105 with a higher score indicating a more significant degree of disease activity.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>PGA will be used to assess participant's current disease activity by investigator. It is collected on a 10 centimeter (cm) Visual analogue scale, scoring ranges from 0 (no activity) to 3 (severe activity). Lower means no disease activity, higher score means severe disease activity.</description>
