      The investigators are interested in studying the effects of varying lengths of musical&#xD;
      exposure on patient anxiety and stress levels.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that musical intervention has had an effect on hemodynamic variability,&#xD;
      postoperative pain and the amount of sedative and analgesic medication needed during&#xD;
      post-operative periods. These effects extend to beyond post-operative care as musical&#xD;
      intervention has played a role in pain management for cancer and for the side-effects of&#xD;
      cancer treatment. However, little information is known whether or not the duration of musical&#xD;
      exposure plays a direct role in the efficacy of reducing pain, sedative use and other&#xD;
      unwanted side effects during post-operative recovery. Similarly, it is not known if&#xD;
      &quot;under-exposure&quot; and &quot;over-exposure&quot; states exist in musical intervention when it comes&#xD;
      specifically to patient anxiety before and after operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe there to be an optimal duration of music exposure (ED50) that will&#xD;
      have the highest probability of achieving the desired effects of reduced anxiety. In&#xD;
      understanding the ED50 of musical exposure, there could be various applications that work in&#xD;
      tandem with other therapies to reduce patient pain and anxiety in medical settings. While the&#xD;
      investigators do not expect music to be as effective as medical intervention, it holds a&#xD;
      promising position as a form of supportive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will utilize a sequential allocation approach where subsequent parameters of the&#xD;
      study are adjusted based on the accrued data. The sequential allocation method minimizes the&#xD;
      necessary sample size while still providing accurate effective dose (ED50) measurements. Our&#xD;
      allocation methods will follow an up-and-down sequential allocation model. Our targeted&#xD;
      population will be patients awaiting scheduled cesarean sections. This patient population was&#xD;
      chosen based on a previous study done on patient satisfaction in response to musical&#xD;
      exposure. Patient accessibility was also a considered factor. Scheduled cesarean section&#xD;
      patients will usually have access to their own room during pre-operative preparation, lending&#xD;
      an ideal environment to conduct the musical exposure in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the study team will start at a musical exposure of 15 minutes for the first&#xD;
      study subject. The second study subject will have their exposure time &quot;stepped up&quot; by 5&#xD;
      minutes if the first study subject results in a success, defined as a greater than one point&#xD;
      reduction in anxiety before and after musical exposure. If there was no change or worsening&#xD;
      of anxiety in the first study subject, then the second subject will have their exposure time&#xD;
      reduced by 5 minutes. This will continue until the first 5 minute exposure is achieved. At&#xD;
      that point, success and failures will increase and decrease the exposure time by increments&#xD;
      of 1 minute. The minimal musical exposure time will be set at 1 minute and if the effective&#xD;
      dose is achieved at 1 minute, the study team will start each subsequent patient at 1 minute&#xD;
      of musical exposure. The patients will all listen to Mozart music played for them from some&#xD;
      type of music player. The study will terminate once the data shows 6 &quot;cross overs&quot; between up&#xD;
      and down steps or if 30 participants have been recruited-whichever comes first. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis and final ED50 determination will be done using methods described by Dixon and&#xD;
      Massey.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will ask questions inquiring about the general musical experience for the patient in both the research context and their lives. The questions will include:&#xD;
Overall, how would you rate your experience listening to music pre-operation on a scale of 0-10, with 1 being the worst experience and 10 being the best experience?&#xD;
If you were to have another C-section, would you want to listen to music before hand? Definitely Not Maybe Not Maybe Yes Definitely Yes&#xD;
Would you recommend listening to music before a C-section to friends and family? Definitely Not Maybe Not Maybe Yes Definitely Yes&#xD;
Would you consider yourself as someone who listens to music regularly for enjoyment? Yes No&#xD;
What musical experience, if any, do you have?&#xD;
What level of education do you have in music?&#xD;
Are you currently active in music?</description>
