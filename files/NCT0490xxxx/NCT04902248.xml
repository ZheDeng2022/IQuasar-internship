  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the management of patients with acute upper non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding,&#xD;
      further bleeding is the most important adverse factor predictive of mortality. In the United&#xD;
      Kingdom Audit on acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, clinical evidence of further bleeding&#xD;
      was reported in 13% of patients following the first endoscopy and 27% of them died. The use&#xD;
      of OTSC has emerged as an alternative before angiographic embolization(TAE) which is often&#xD;
      considered most definitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to define the algorithm in the management of patients with refractory bleeding&#xD;
      from their peptic ulcers or other non variceal causes. We hypothesize that endoscopic use of&#xD;
      OTSC compares favourably with TAE and both lead to similar outcomes. An equivalence of the&#xD;
      two modalities may mean that endoscopic application of OTSC should be attempted before TAE as&#xD;
      often we need to document further bleeds with endoscopy and a second treatment should be&#xD;
      instituted at the same time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care in patients with refractory bleeding from their peptic ulcers&#xD;
      and other non-variceal causes has not been defined. An International Consensus Group&#xD;
      recommends a surgical consult when endoscopic treatment has failed and TAE should be&#xD;
      considered as an alternative. The European guidelines recommend the use of either surgery or&#xD;
      angiographic embolization. There has not been a fully published RCT that compares&#xD;
      angiographic treatment to surgery in those with refractory bleeding. Several comparative&#xD;
      series mostly retrospective and their meta-analyses suggest that outcomes following TAE would&#xD;
      not be dissimilar to those after surgery. Common to these reports, TAE is associated with a&#xD;
      higher rate of further bleeds. In our meta-analysis , the pooled rate of further bleeds after&#xD;
      TAE was 51/178(32%) compared to that of 26/241 (14.9%) after surgery. A high rate of further&#xD;
      bleeding can be understood because of a rich vascular supply to peptic ulcers especially&#xD;
      those in the bulbar duodenum. A bulbar ulcer receives dual arterial supply from celiac and&#xD;
      superior mesenteric arteries. Embolization to these arteries can therefore be challenging. In&#xD;
      a population-based study from northern Europe that included 282 patients (97 TAE and 185&#xD;
      surgery), the overall hazard of deaths after TAE decreased by 1/3 when compared to surgery.&#xD;
      Many argue that TAE is preferred over surgery in the algorithm of management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of OTSC has emerged as an alternative before TAE which is often considered most&#xD;
      definitive. A multicenter randomized controlled trial that compared OTSC and standard&#xD;
      endoscopic treatment mostly through-the-scope clips in patients with refractory bleeding&#xD;
      peptic ulcers; 66 patients were randomized and control of bleeding over 30 days was better&#xD;
      with the use of OTSC (15.2% vs. 57.6%). A Mayo Clinic group reported OTSC treatment in 67&#xD;
      high risk lesions defined by those near an arterial complex (bulbar or angular/lesser curve&#xD;
      ulceration) with an artery larger than 2 mm, deep excavated fibrotic ulcer with major&#xD;
      stigmata and those that failed standard endoscopic therapy (through-the-scope clips and/or&#xD;
      thermal device); 47 (70.1%) remained free of further bleeds at day 30 10.&#xD;

    <description>Further bleeding is a composite of persistent or recurrent bleeding. Persistent bleeding is defined by active bleeding that cannot be stopped despite study intervention. For assessment of treatment efficacy, a repeat endoscopy can be performed to document further bleeding (fresh blood in the stomach and active bleeding or major stigmata of bleeding to the previously treated lesion).</description>

    <description>The procedure was performed in the angiographic suite and under local anaesthetics to the patient's groin. The celiac and then gastroduodenal artery or the left gastric artery was selectively cannulated depending on ulcer location.&#xD;
Coils were deposited distal to the bleeding point. Gel foam particles were then packed into the artery and its collaterals. This was followed by further coils deposited in its proximal portion until complete cessation of arterial flow. Our protocol requested empiric embolisation of the artery even in the absence of active contrast extravasation or a pseudoaneurysm.</description>
