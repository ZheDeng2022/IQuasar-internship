  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The termination of abortion is an important issue that has many controversies. The most&#xD;
      common time of serious abortion-related complications is the second trimester. Missed&#xD;
      abortion is one of the most common indications of termination of pregnancy in the second&#xD;
      trimester. Misoprostol and mifepristone are effective drugs for induction of abortion but&#xD;
      these drugs are now expensive, and non-available in many developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of Foley's catheter balloon on cervical ripping for mid-trimester pregnancy&#xD;
      termination has been proved before. It can effectually shorten the time of the expulsion of&#xD;
      the fetus. Amniotomy defines as an artificial rupture of the membranes; it is an ordinary&#xD;
      obstetric practice used mainly in the induction of labor, with good results and less&#xD;
      morbidity. The obstetricians used to combine amniotomy with other methods such as&#xD;
      prostaglandins or oxytocin to induce labor in a woman with an unfavorable cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite plenty of studies that investigated the role of amniotomy for induction of labor but&#xD;
      the studies which addressed the role of amniotomy in the induction of second-trimester&#xD;
      abortion are very scarce in the literature.&#xD;

    <description>Amniotomy will be performed by toothed forceps. The handle of the device will be held with one hand outside the vagina while 2 fingers of the opposite hand will be placed in the vagina to guide the tip. Care should be taken to protect maternal vaginal tissues from the forceps. Once the forceps reach the amniotic sac, the tip is pushed up against the sac with the index or middle finger of the internal hand to pierce the membranes. The nature of amniotic fluid will be checked.</description>
