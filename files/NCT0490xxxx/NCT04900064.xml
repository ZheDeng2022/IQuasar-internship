  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this multicenter study, the investigators want to find out if an addition of an diagnostic&#xD;
      assessment and possibility of treatment with guided self-help CBT can increase the treatment&#xD;
      effects of PCBH on patient functioning and symptoms, compared to standard PCBH which uses&#xD;
      contextual assessment and brief interventions. In addition to this, the study will&#xD;
      investigate the overall effect of PCBH on both patient and organisation level outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of primary care is to offer all patients individualised and&#xD;
      context-sensitive healthcare with high access and continuity. One of the reasons primary care&#xD;
      struggles with this goal is that a large proportion of patients suffer from mental and&#xD;
      behavioural health problems, alone or in combination with one or several chronic illnesses.&#xD;
      Despite many patients needing psychosocial interventions, there is a lack of mental health&#xD;
      professionals as well as clear pathways for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Care Behavioural Health (PCBH) is an innovative way of organising primary care, where&#xD;
      mental health professionals have more yet shorter visits, strive for same-day access, and&#xD;
      have an active consulting role in the primary care team. To help patients achieve relevant&#xD;
      behavioural changes, so called brief interventions are used, which are based on isolated&#xD;
      components from psychological treatments such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Brief interventions usually stretch over 1-4&#xD;
      treatment sessions. Assessments within the model are generally contextual and largely avoid&#xD;
      psychiatric diagnostics, instead focussing on the patient's situation and their associated&#xD;
      coping strategies - whether they be positive or negative. However, these interventions have&#xD;
      not been systematically evaluated in the same way that structured CBT has, and there is a&#xD;
      risk that patients that would have benefitted from structured CBT and a diagnostic assessment&#xD;
      are undertreated due to lack of diagnostics and the reduced visit duration and amount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at primary care centres (PCCs) that already have a high fidelity to a&#xD;
      PCBH framework. Fidelity will be measured by an expert group as well as using four&#xD;
      questionnaires, one for each of mental health professionals, medical doctors, registered&#xD;
      nurses and leadership. These fidelity scales will be validated in a separate study. In&#xD;
      addition to fidelity, work environment and satisfaction with the PCBH implementation will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients at the centres will be randomised between receiving contextual assessments followed&#xD;
      by brief interventions, or a diagnostic assessment, which can lead to treatment with either&#xD;
      self-help CBT (if a treatable diagnosis is confirmed and the patient is suitable for&#xD;
      self-help CBT) or brief interventions (if self-help CBT is not deemed to be a suitable&#xD;
      intervention). The primary comparison is the outcome for patients who either received&#xD;
      self-help CBT or are deemed suitable for the intervention based on screening data, while&#xD;
      secondary analyses will look at treatment outcomes for all patients, including those with&#xD;
      non-psychiatric problems such as crises, loss or work- or family-related problems. The study&#xD;
      will also look at implementation outcomes for self-help CBT and diagnostic assessments to see&#xD;
      if self-help CBT is a feasible addition to the PCBH model. Our main research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does an extended version of PCBH, including an additional assessment and the option of&#xD;
           guided self-help CBT when indicated by a patient's problem profile, lead to superior&#xD;
           patient outcomes compared to standard PCBH where a brief, contextual assessment followed&#xD;
           by Brief Interventions is the only option? If not, can standard PCBH be shown to be&#xD;
           non-inferior?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does the addition of guided self-help CBT have a negative effect on availability, reach,&#xD;
           and cost-effectiveness compared to standard PCBH? If not, can guided self-help CBT be&#xD;
           shown to be non-inferior to standard PCBH concerning these outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCBH has the potential to increase the quality and access of care for many patients with&#xD;
      mental and behavioural health problems. This study is the first to step towards answering&#xD;
      whether or not the effects of brief intervention are large enough to merit large-scale&#xD;
      implementation, and if an add-on of other brief and easily implementable treatments can&#xD;
      increase the treatment effects.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients are randomised between a diagnostic assessment and a contextual assessment. Patients in the contextual assessment arm can only be treated with brief interventions whereas patients in the diagnostic assessment arm are offered guided self-help if deemed appropriate and otherwise gets brief interventions.&#xD;
As such, patients are randomised between two arms. We have however included four arms below in order to be able to describe the primary and secondary analysis. The primary analysis is performed on all patients treated with self-help CBT in the arm where a diagnostic assessment is made, compared to patients in the contextual assessment arm that are found suitable for self-help CBT (based on screening data), but treated with brief interventions.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The original British instrument the Normalization Process Theory Measure (NoMAD) is based on the four core constructs of the Normalization Process Theory: Coherence, Cognitive Participation, Collective Action, and Reflexive Monitoring. They represent ways of thinking about implementation and are focused on how interventions can become part of everyday practice. The s-NoMAD is the validated Swedish version of the NoMAD.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The diagnostic assessment includes screening instruments, a structured interpretation of the screening instruments, a structured interview (MINI - International Neuropsychiatric Interview) and a medical anamnesis. If deemed appropriate, the patient can be offered treatment with guided self help. If the patient's problem is not deemed appropriate for this type of care or if the patient is not interested in guided self-help, they are offered brief interventions (BI).&#xD;
In the primary analysis, only patients receiving treatment with self-help CBT are included.</description>

    <description>The contextual assessment includes screening instruments and a contextual interview. Patients in this arm will always be treated with brief interventions.&#xD;
In the primary analysis, only patients suitable for self-help CBT are included. This is decided by an algorithm based on data from their screening, which takes into account symptom severity and type, patient preference and known variables that make self-help CBT a worse fit.</description>

    <description>'Brief Interventions' (BI) is a generic term for a multitude of tools and interventions used in patient visits within PCBH. BI start immediately at the initial consultation, which ends with a personally tailored and evidence-informed plan adjusted to the patient's context. As such, there is no separation between assessment and intervention. The interventions within BI often have their foundation in CBT, ACT or Motivational Interviewing (MI). The common theme is that they are principle-based rather than manual-based and focus on behavioural change in relation to a problem, rather than focusing on a specific diagnosis. Follow-up appointments are scheduled flexibly depending on the patient's perceived need. A BI treatment usually consists of 1-4 appointments with several weeks apart and has an open ending, where the patient easily can schedule a new appointment. Clinicians delivering brief interventions will have had 3 days of training as well as regular supervision.</description>

    <description>The patient receives a previously scientifically evaluated CBT-based self-help book for one of the following conditions: depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety, health anxiety, insomnia, or stress/burnout. The therapist support consists of 3-6 contacts throughout the 6-12 weeks long intervention period as decided by the clinician and patient together, as long as at least one and not more than three are physical visits at the center and the rest via phone, video conferencing, or secure internet messages. Clinicians delivering self-help CBT will need four days of reading and two days of training as well as regular supervision to be able to make initial assessments and problem profiling and use the self-help books.</description>

             Behavioural Health interventions and booked to the mental health professionals at the&#xD;
             PCC, according to screening methods and/or clinical assessments made by health care&#xD;
             personnel at the PCC, will be included. This broad criteria reflects the naturalistic&#xD;
             setting where decisions of clinicians, rather than highly standardized criteria, are&#xD;
             the basis for inclusion.&#xD;
