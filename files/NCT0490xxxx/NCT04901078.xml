  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KNX100&#xD;
      administered orally as a single ascending dose and as multiple ascending doses in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive, Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), single treatment, two-part, double blind,&#xD;
      placebo controlled, randomized, single ascending dose/multiple ascending dose study of KNX100&#xD;
      administered to healthy volunteers (Parts A and B). Approximately 64 male and female healthy&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled into Parts A and B of this study. Healthy subjects who meet all the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to Cohorts 1-5 in Parts A and Cohorts 1-3 in&#xD;
      Part B of the study. Each cohort will evaluate 8 subjects; 6 subjects will receive KNX100&#xD;
      (study drug) and 2 subjects will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cohort will be enrolled sequentially, and dose escalation decisions will be made&#xD;
      according to protocol by the Cohort Review Committee (CRC) consisting of the investigators&#xD;
      and medical monitor. Subjects and clinical staff will be blinded to therapy assignment.&#xD;
      KNX100 will be provided in capsule form as both 25 and 100 mg capsules for oral&#xD;
      administration and the dose range will be 25 to 225mg.&#xD;

Part A will evaluate doses of KNX100 starting with 25 mg and increasing up to a maximum of 225 mg per day. Part B will evaluate a low-, mid-, and high-dose MTD administered for 7 consecutive days. Individual doses will be dispensed by unblinded site pharmacy staff. Dose escalation will progress upon Cohort Review Committee (CRC) approval.</intervention_model_description>
