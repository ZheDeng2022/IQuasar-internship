  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In most countries, after the measures taken to reduce the effects of the epidemic and&#xD;
      quarantine practices, a remote screening tool has emerged in order to screen the needs&#xD;
      developing after COVID-19 and to make the necessary rehabilitation applications in time.&#xD;
      Sivan et al. A comprehensive multi-system phone scan of the COVID-19 Yorkshire Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Screening Tool (C19-YRS) has been developed by a multidisciplinary rehabilitation team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, which will be carried out using the C19-YRS tool and the 30-second sit-and-go&#xD;
      test that evaluates functional capacity and mobility conditions, is expected to contribute to&#xD;
      the clinical and literature since most of the studies on COVID-19 focused only on the acute&#xD;
      and subacute periods. In addition, considering the pandemic conditions all over the world, it&#xD;
      will be possible to benefit from the advantages of the tele-assessment application and by&#xD;
      reaching more people, possible clinical problems/needs and whether there is a change&#xD;
      functional capacities in individuals after COVID-19 will be identified.&#xD;
