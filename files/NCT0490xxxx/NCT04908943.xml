  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers seek to understand if the Resilience-based, Energy Management to Enhance&#xD;
      Wellbeing and Fatigue (RENEW) program helps with scleroderma symptom management and disease&#xD;
      burden. The researchers think that those participants who receive the intervention will have&#xD;
      clinically meaningful changes of symptom management and disease burden.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue is measured by The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) -Fatigue 13a. FACIT is a questionnaire with 13 questions and a score ranging from 13-65. Higher scores indicate greater fatigue.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain interference is measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pain interference 4a scale Pain Interference 4a will assess self-reported consequences of pain with 4 questions ranked on a 5-point scale, from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot;. The minimum score is 4 and the maximum score is 20. Lower scores suggest less pain interference.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Resilience</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Resilience is measured by Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 10 (CD-RISC-10). It is a 10 item self-report rating scale 0 (not true at all) to 4 (true nearly all the time). The overall score range from 0 (no resilience) to 40 (High Resilience).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms are measured by PROMIS depression 4a assesses self-reported negative mood (e.g., sadness), views of self (e.g., worthlessness), social cognition (e.g., loneliness), and decreased positive affect and engagement. Items are all answered on a 5-point scale from 1=Never to 5=Always. Scores can range from 0 meaning no anxiety/depression to 40 meaning high</description>
