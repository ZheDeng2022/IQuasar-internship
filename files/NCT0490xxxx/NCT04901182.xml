    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to compare the effect of consuming high protein (23-34% energy ratio)&#xD;
      and low carbohydrate (25-38% energy ratio) smoothie formulas vs. consuming Ensure (a&#xD;
      conventional well-known commercial formula) on the swallowing capacity by using Flexible&#xD;
      Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) in the elderly people with dysphagia risk.&#xD;

      The investigators aimed to determine the effect of 3 high protein (23-34% energy ratio) and&#xD;
      low carbohydrate (25-38% energy ratio) smoothie formulas ((1) white sesame soy milk smoothie&#xD;
      (WS), (2) black sesame soy milk smoothie (low carbohydrate, BSLC), and (3) Chicken shitake&#xD;
      smoothie (CS); 1 kcal/ml) from natural ingredients as compared with Ensure. The double blind&#xD;
      randomized placebo controlled cross-over design study involved 63 subjects aged above 65&#xD;
      years old. They were also divided into asymptomatic (n=32) or symptomatic swallowing&#xD;
      difficulty (n=31) group based on self-reported swallowing difficulty symptoms. All subjects&#xD;
      assessed five drinks (WS, BSLC, CS vs. Ensure) for sensory testing, product acceptance and&#xD;
      marketing survey using questionnaires. Swallowing capacity was determined by using Flexible&#xD;
      Endoscopic Examination of Swallowing (FEES) only for each of the three drinks (SW, CS vs.&#xD;
      Ensure) in a blinded random sequence.&#xD;
