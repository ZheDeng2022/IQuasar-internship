      The purpose of this study is to evaluate reliability of Point-of-Care ultrasound (POCUS)&#xD;
      evaluation performed by general practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General practitioners who underwent predefined training in POCUS will perform ultrasound&#xD;
      examination in outpatients meeting inclusion criteria. While this is observational study,&#xD;
      result will not have an impact on the management of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of the POCUS examination, patients undergo a routine diagnostic process which is&#xD;
      appropriate for the initial symptom. Imaging examinations will always be a part of this. This&#xD;
      will serve as an expert control to evaluate the reliability of POCUS Each POCUS examination&#xD;
      will also be recorded as a video loop, subsequently assessed by an expert in the POCUS and&#xD;
      also used as an expert control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed by standard reliability testing.&#xD;

    <measure>Reliability of Point-of-Care ultrasound investigation of the lungs, gall bladder or proximal deep veins of lower extremities performed by general practitioner compared with the expert diagnostic method</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>General practitioners will perform the type of Point-of-Care ultrasound investigation which will relate to the type of symptoms. Then, the result of this investigation will be compared with the expert diagnostic method. This will be chest X ray scan or pulmonary CT for group 1 patients, expert abdominal ultrasound for group 2 patients and expert complete compression ultrasound for group 3 patients. These examinations are not study interventions, while they are a routine procedures, which would be indicated irrespective of the study.</description>
