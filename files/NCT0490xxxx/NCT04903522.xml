      Major depressive disorder, or characterized depressive episode, is a common illness that&#xD;
      limits psychosocial functioning and impairs quality of life. The initial goal of treatment&#xD;
      for a major depressive episode is complete remission of depressive symptoms. The most&#xD;
      commonly used treatments are antidepressants, psychotherapy or a combination of medication&#xD;
      and psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music therapy can be considered as one of the complementary therapies in the treatment of the&#xD;
      characterized depressive episode and many studies have shown a beneficial effect of musical&#xD;
      interventions, even of short duration, on depression and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In depressive disorders, therapies such as hypnosis or phenomenological psychotherapies lead&#xD;
      to modifications of consciousness during which the subject finds the means, notably&#xD;
      non-reflexive and in the realm of the imaginary, to overcome anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally speaking, in the field of musical cognition, it is considered that music affects&#xD;
      the emotions. Unfortunately this approach is often insufficiently refined in cognitive&#xD;
      psychology since it is most generally interested in the 6 fundamental emotions: joy, anger,&#xD;
      fear, sadness, surprise, disgust. However, during the Baroque period (end of the 16th and&#xD;
      17th centuries), various philosophers and musicians analyzed with great finesse not these&#xD;
      fundamental emotions, but more precisely the passions, or &quot;shocks of the soul&quot;, that is to&#xD;
      say the affects in their great diversity. These affects or passions are thus at the center of&#xD;
      Baroque musical composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Barhepsy project, it is suggested that listening to Baroque music, thanks to the&#xD;
      rhetoric of the passions included in it, would allow the mobilization of the patients'&#xD;
      affects and thus reduce their state of anxiety. During a follow-up consultation, the effects&#xD;
      of a 30-minute &quot;musical path&quot; of baroque pieces will be evaluated, exemplifying the reduction&#xD;
      of anxiety and the subsequent appeasement, on the conscious experience of subjects suffering&#xD;
      from a characterized depressive state associated with anxious symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder or characterized depressive episode is a common illness that limits&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning and impairs quality of life. In 2008, the WHO ranked major&#xD;
      depression as the third leading cause of disease burden worldwide and predicts that the&#xD;
      disease will become the leading cause by 2030.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) defines&#xD;
      a depressive episode as the presence of a sad mood and/or anhedonia (loss of interest or&#xD;
      pleasure) lasting at least 15 days, variably associated with other symptoms (appetite&#xD;
      disturbance, sleep disturbance, feelings of guilt and worthlessness...). It also defines as&#xD;
      an additional characteristic of this illness, anxiety and more precisely anxiety distress,&#xD;
      i.e. the presence of the feeling of being tense, the feeling of unusual agitation and the&#xD;
      difficulty to concentrate due to worry or fear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When treating a major depressive episode, the initial goal is complete remission of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms. The most commonly used treatments are antidepressants, psychotherapy or&#xD;
      a combination of medication and psychotherapy. Although these treatments are effective, some&#xD;
      studies show a high rate of discontinuation and poor remission and the use of complementary&#xD;
      and alternative medicine is increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music therapy can be considered as one of the complementary therapies in the treatment of the&#xD;
      characterized depressive episode and many studies have shown a beneficial effect of musical&#xD;
      interventions, even of short duration, on depression and anxiety. However, the nature of the&#xD;
      effects of music remains mysterious, and even if psychometric scales are used, the body of&#xD;
      research lacks explanations of what happens in these improvement processes. To seek an&#xD;
      explanation, there are two strategies: either one focuses on using a psychophysiological&#xD;
      approach (with physiological or biological measures), or one tries to approach the problem&#xD;
      through the changes in mental processes (i.e., the content and structure of consciousness)&#xD;
      associated with this enhancement. This is the choice made in the Barhepsy protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Barhepsy project is part of the research program &quot;Sounds, Music, Therapies: SoMuThé&quot;&#xD;
      developed at the CNRS (UMR 7061 PRISM, Marseille). It is part of the current trend of&#xD;
      non-medicinal therapies by focusing on the beneficial effects of music and sound therapy.&#xD;
      SoMuThé is a project inspired by a philosophical current called phenomenology. It is&#xD;
      interested in the general problematic of the therapeutic effects of sound and music, not from&#xD;
      the point of view of neurophysiological or cognitive processes evaluated by means of brain&#xD;
      imaging or cognitive psychology experiments, but in what happens in the structure and&#xD;
      contents of the consciousness of the subjects who benefit from such therapies. It is&#xD;
      therefore more of a comprehension approach than an explanatory one, aiming at describing the&#xD;
      conscious experience of these subjects in its reflexive and pre-reflexive component, and thus&#xD;
      at understanding how their flow of consciousness is reconfigured. In depressive pathologies,&#xD;
      therapies such as hypnosis or phenomenological psychotherapies lead to modifications of&#xD;
      consciousness during which the subject finds means, notably non-reflexive and in the domain&#xD;
      of the imaginary, to overcome anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally speaking, in the field of musical cognition, it is considered that music affects&#xD;
      the emotions. Unfortunately this approach is often insufficiently refined in cognitive&#xD;
      psychology since it is most generally interested in the 6 fundamental emotions: joy, anger,&#xD;
      fear, sadness, surprise, disgust. However, during the Baroque period (end of the 16th and&#xD;
      17th centuries), various philosophers and musicians analyzed with great finesse not these&#xD;

&#xD;

      30-minute &quot;musical path&quot; of baroque pieces will be evaluated, exemplifying the reduction of&#xD;
      anxiety and the subsequent appeasement, on the conscious experience of subjects suffering&#xD;
      from a characterized depressive state associated with anxious symptoms. To study the&#xD;
      structure and metamorphoses of consciousness during the experience of listening to music,&#xD;
      will be assessed in these patients :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anxiety by means of the STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) scale of Spielberger et&#xD;
           al., 1983 , and depression by the BDI (Beck Depression Inventory-II) scale of Beck et&#xD;
           al., 1996. These two questionnaires will make it possible to qualify (and quantify)&#xD;
           these two clinical signs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the fluidity of consciousness by means of the EQFC scale. Indeed, consciousness is made&#xD;
           more &quot;fluid&quot;, less rigid after certain psychotherapies such as hypnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the reflexive and pre-reflexive contents of consciousness that can be obtained through&#xD;
           experiential phenomenological interviews (EPE), which are based on guided introspection&#xD;
           and allow the description of background experiences of consciousness.&#xD;
