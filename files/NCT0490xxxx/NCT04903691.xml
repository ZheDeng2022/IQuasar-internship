  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine the biological, physiological and psychological effects of&#xD;
      supervised exercise programs in patients surviving open heart surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have survived open heart surgery and cleared for exercise by their clinical team&#xD;
      will be approached to enter a 12-week exercise program. Patient will consent to train with a&#xD;
      personalized program either in strength, functional or aerobic exercise in a supervised&#xD;
      setting for 3 sessions per week for a minimum of 12-week period. The aim is to enroll males&#xD;
      and females in this arm in 1:1 ratio if possible. A separate cohort of patients entering&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation (CR) will also be included for comparison. The CR program includes&#xD;
      three sessions per week for a maximum of 36 sessions. The enrollment and retention rates in&#xD;
      CR will be monitored. In this study, five patients who have undergone cardiac surgery and&#xD;
      chosen not to participate in organized exercise program will be included. Participants&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness will be measured either using a questionnaire or in person. Through&#xD;
      each phase of the study, the change in fitness, strength, biomarkers, body composition,&#xD;
      cognition and psychosocial recovery will be monitored. All subjects will undergo detailed&#xD;
      assessments in the research lab 2 weeks before and after finishing or exiting exercise&#xD;
      program. A short (3-month) and long term (12-month) outcomes including rates of survival,&#xD;
      major adverse cardiac events, cognition and cardiac-related hospitalizations will be&#xD;
      collected as well during the study.&#xD;
