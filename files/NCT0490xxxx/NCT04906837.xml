    <textblock>
      Conduction disturbances are a major complication of TAVI. There is no predictor of post-TAVI&#xD;
      conduction disorder. The study of the membranous septum on the pre-TAVI scanner and the valve&#xD;
      implantation height are promising and little studied data on the occurrence of post-TAVI&#xD;
      conduction disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being developed for the treatment of aortic stenosis in inoperable patients, trans&#xD;
      aortic valve implantation (TAVI) techniques and devices have gradually improved, and its use&#xD;
      can now be considered in low-risk populations. . However, the need for pacemaker implantation&#xD;
      after TAVI remains one of the most common complications, and this issue needs to be addressed&#xD;
      before further expanding the TAVI indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implantation of PM after TAVI is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and there&#xD;
      are no formal predictors of these conduction disturbances. Some studies suggest that the&#xD;
      existence of preoperative conduction disturbances (eg, right bundle branch block or 1st&#xD;
      degree AVB) are associated with greater PM implantation or greater reliance on ventricular&#xD;
      pacing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other studies have focused on anatomical measurements such as the height of the membranous&#xD;
      septum obtained on the pre TAVI scanner, calcifications of the aortic ring and the depth of&#xD;
      the valve implantation obtained on the angiography of the TAVI procedure. . The depth of&#xD;
      valve implantation in relation to the height of the membranous septum would be a predictor of&#xD;
      conduction disorders and PM implantation post TAVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anatomically, the left branch of the bundle of HIS originates approximately 6 mm below the&#xD;
      aortic annulus. Implantation of TAVI can affect the conduction tissues and lead to conduction&#xD;
      abnormalities where the penetrating portion of the HIS emerges on the surface of the LV&#xD;
      flushing chamber. The farther away the emerging part of the HIS is from the ring, the less&#xD;
      likely it is that an implant will encroach on it, and impair conduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the emerging part of the bundle of His is &quot;sandwiched&quot; between the membranous septum&#xD;
      and the posterior crest of the muscular septum, the lower end of the membranous septum&#xD;
      provides an anatomical landmark for the left ventricular exit point of the bundle of His,&#xD;
      with the length of the membranous septum equivalent to the distance aortic ring - bundle of&#xD;
      HIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The STIM TAVI study showed that 30% of patients implanted with a post-TAVI pacemaker did not&#xD;
      have high-grade AVB beyond 7 days post-implantation. Patients with early AVB (D1-D7) were at&#xD;
      high risk of developing late AVB. The study did not identify a population at low risk of&#xD;
      late-onset AVB, nor any pre-TAVI clinical or paraclinical criteria predictive of post-TAVI&#xD;
      AVB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of the anatomy of the membranous septum and the height of implantation of the&#xD;
      aortic prosthesis in the STIM TAVI population would make it possible to analyze new&#xD;
      predictive criteria for late AVB (after D7).&#xD;
