    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the central hypothesis that adding to the diet daily yogurt provides&#xD;
      beneficial effects on digestive health and subjective mood in healthy adults.&#xD;

      This clinical trial will include a 4-week lead-in period and a 2-week treatment period. The&#xD;
      lead-in period will be devoid of all supplemental and dietary probiotics, fermented dairy&#xD;
      products, and fermented foods. Participants will be asked to refrain from consuming all&#xD;
      supplemental and dietary probiotics, fermented dairy products, and fermented foods throughout&#xD;
      the entire study. During the treatment period, participants will be given yogurt with sugar.&#xD;
      This trial will serve as a continuation of the NECTAR Study (NCT04187950).&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the impact of consumption of daily yogurt with sugar on other measures of digestive health using the Gastrointestinal Tolerability questionnaire. This questionnaire assesses gastrointestinal health through 6 questions related to gastrointestinal health including nausea, bloating, rumblings, gas/flatulence, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Each of the questions pertains to experience of symptoms in the past 7 days.</description>
