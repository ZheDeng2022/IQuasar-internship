    <textblock>
      9-ING-41 in combination with gemcitabine and docetaxel will lead to sustained disease control&#xD;
      and/or increase the rates of objective response in patients with unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
      soft tissue and bone sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, two-stratum, phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of&#xD;
      9-ING-41 in combination with gemcitabine/docetaxel in patients ≥10 years of age with advanced&#xD;
      sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum A: Patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma previously treated with 0-3 prior lines&#xD;
      of systemic therapy will receive 9-ING-41 twice weekly with gemcitabine on days 1 and 8 and&#xD;
      docetaxel on day 8 of a 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum B: Patients with relapsed or refractory bone sarcoma previously treated with at least&#xD;
      one line of systemic therapy will receive 9-ING-41 twice weekly with gemcitabine on days 1&#xD;
      and 8 and docetaxel on day 8 of a 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease response assessment will be performed every 2 cycles (6 weeks) for the first 8 cycles&#xD;
      (24 weeks), then every 12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral&#xD;
             therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral&#xD;
             load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated&#xD;

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at&#xD;
             registration and within 7 days of first study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of 9-ING-41 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
             because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal&#xD;
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately. Women may not be breastfeeding during study&#xD;
             participation. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation,&#xD;
             and 90 days after completion of 9-ING-41 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must agree to provide tumor tissue, either fresh or archival specimen of&#xD;
             primary tumor and/or metastatic lesion. If tumor tissue is not available, then discuss&#xD;
             with principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with sarcoma histologies other than those listed above will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with 9-ING-41, gemcitabine, or docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; Grade 1) with the exception of alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents for treatment of their&#xD;
             sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with untreated brain or meningeal metastases. Subjects with history of&#xD;
             metastases are eligible provided they do not require ongoing steroid treatment and&#xD;
             have shown clinical and radiographic stability for at least 14 days after definitive&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to 9-ING-41, gemcitabine, docetaxel, or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had a previous (within 2 years) or has a current malignancy other than the target&#xD;
             cancer with the exception of curatively treated local tumors including carcinoma in&#xD;
             situ of the breast or cervix, basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or&#xD;
             prostate cancer with Gleason Grade &lt; 6 and prostate-specific antigen within normal&#xD;
             range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has any medical and/or social condition that, in the opinion of the investigator would&#xD;
             preclude study participation.&#xD;
