  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a serious illness with a high fatality rate. Currently only one&#xD;
      vaccine is available, VSV-ZEBOV/Ervebo; this vaccine is clinically effective and has been&#xD;
      deployed as a preventive measure during recent Ebola outbreaks. The durability of protection&#xD;
      afforded by this vaccine is unknown, however, and it is thought that a booster vaccination&#xD;
      may be required to maintain immune responses. Recently, a synthetic DNA vaccine, INO-4201,&#xD;
      was tested in humans and showed good immunogenicity and an enhanced safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to test whether the DNA-based candidate INO-4201 can be used as a booster in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers previously vaccinated with VSV-ZEBOV.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized placebo-controlled phase 1b trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the DNA-based vaccine candidate INO-4201 in healthy adult volunteers who&#xD;
      previously received a single injection of VSV-ZEBOV. These participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      either INO-4201 or placebo, injected once intradermally (ID) followed by electroporation (EP)&#xD;
      with the CELLECTRA2000 device. Volunteers will be observed for 1 hour after vaccination and&#xD;
      will attend follow-up visits at the Clinical Trials Unit in the 24 weeks after injection (8&#xD;
      visits in all).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome parameters are (i) the incidence of adverse events in relationship with&#xD;
      INO-4201 from day 0 to 14, and (ii) geometric mean titers (GMT) of EBOV-GP-binding IgG&#xD;
      antibodies at 4 weeks post-injection.&#xD;
