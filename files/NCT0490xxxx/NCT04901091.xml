    <textblock>
      A prospective non-interventional study aimed to evaluate the immediate and long-term outcomes&#xD;
      in patients with left ventricular aneurysm after transmural myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A registry of patients with transmural myocardial infarction admitted to the Emergency&#xD;
      Department of Cardiology will be created. The registry will include all consecutive&#xD;
      hospitalized patients from from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 who meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria Based on this registry, patients will be divided into groups : patients with left&#xD;
      ventricular aneurysm and patients without aneurysm, patients with left ventricular thrombosis&#xD;
      and patients without thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted in 3 and 12 months. Surviving patients will be invited to&#xD;
      appointment for an ECG, echocardiography and survey. The cardiovascular events during this&#xD;
      period will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The factors determining the prognosis of patients and their concomitant diseases, immediate&#xD;
      and long-term prognoses, therapeutic measures and drug therapy at the hospital and outpatient&#xD;
      stages, and patients ' adherence to therapy will be analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>To assess adherence to the recommended therapy at enrollment and during the first and second visits, the original questionnaire &quot;The Scale of Adherence of the National Society for Evidence-based Pharmacotherapy&quot; will be used. The commitment scale has two modifications to assess potential and initial actual commitment. The questionnaire can be used both to assess overall adherence to drug therapy and to diagnose adherence to a specific drug.&#xD;
The maximum number of points on the scale is 4 points. The minimum number of points on the scale is 0 points. 4 points means complete non-adherence. 0 points means full commitment.</description>
