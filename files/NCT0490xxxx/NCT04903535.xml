  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we aim to explore the feasibility of a novel, noninvasive SNO assay to acquire&#xD;
      physiological SNO quantification from the human ear and test this new method of analysis.&#xD;
      This study aims to help with the currently cumbersome and invasive procedures used to measure&#xD;
      SNOs in the body. The proposed activities do not unnecessarily duplicate previous&#xD;
      experiments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      S-nitrosylation is the covalent attachment of a nitric oxide group to cystine thiol within a&#xD;
      protein to form an S-nitrosothiol (SNO); it has diverse regulatory roles in all mammalian&#xD;
      cells and thus operates as a fundamental mechanism for cellular signaling and accounts for a&#xD;
      large part of nitric oxide activity. Though SNOs are relevant to many biological disciplines&#xD;
      like neuronal, muscular, respiratory, and cardiovascular biology, currently there is no way&#xD;
      to measure SNOs that is both easy to use in a clinical setting and accurate in detecting low&#xD;
      concentrations; detection is challenging due to the labile nature of the molecules. Low or&#xD;
      high concentrations of these molecules could be vital indicators of incoming dangerous issues&#xD;
      in the body. A system to easily and accurately measure SNOs could prove useful in&#xD;
      preventative treatments. Ultra Violet (UV) light can break SNOs and can be used to measure&#xD;
      nitric oxide release, but this method is not fully developed and further research is needed&#xD;
      on the potential effect for UV to measure nitric oxide release.&#xD;

    <description>Investigator will use a Nitric Oxide Analyzer while attached to a small suction port on the subject's ear lobe to be tested for Nitric Oxide. After getting the baseline assay, the investigator will shine a low-intensity UV Flashlight (Alonefire SV003 10W 365nm UV Flashlight) at the ear lobe for 10 seconds, repeated three times at 20 second intervals, to determine if there is photobleaching. Then the assay will then be performed on the opposite ear lobe. Fifteen minutes after the third UV flashlight exposure, the investigator will collect air from the subject's ear during photolysis into a 20mL glass syringe (once from each ear). Fifteen minutes after the third UV flashlight exposure, the investigator will collect air from the subject's ear during photolysis into a 20mL glass syringe (once from each ear). The subject and the investigator will wear UV goggles during the experiment.</description>
