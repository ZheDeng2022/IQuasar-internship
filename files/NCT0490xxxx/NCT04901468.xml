  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a data collection study involving the gathering of clinical data and OCT (optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography) scans from 350 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to gather data to help develop an AI algorithm to detect eye&#xD;
      abnormalities specifically those related to certain cancer treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study interviews will be held with expert ophthalmologists to assess the&#xD;
      acceptability of implementing AI into clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many cancer patients will access new treatments through clinical trials. These treatments&#xD;
      have often never been tested in humans and therefore, are likely to have unknown side&#xD;
      effects. Some of these side effects include changes to the eye, such as blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ahead of patients taking part in these trials there is often little planning done to manage&#xD;
      potential side effects on the eye. Additionally, accessing the expertise of eye specialists&#xD;
      is not always available and often referral to a specialist is only given when eye symptoms&#xD;
      have become advanced. These delays in identifying side effects on the eye also delays&#xD;
      treatment and follow-up management. Providing patients access to this expertise would help in&#xD;
      the detection and management of treatment side effects, however, due to demands on resources&#xD;
      this access is not always readily available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to create an artificial intelligence (AI) program that can detect&#xD;
      changes to the eye related to disease, which, in the future, can be specifically used in&#xD;
      cancer patient care. Additionally, developing an AI program to detect cancer related side&#xD;
      effects to the eye will go a significant way in easing the burden on the health care system&#xD;
      and improve side effects from new cancer treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve the collection of eye scans and medical data from participants at the&#xD;
      Manchester Royal Eye Hospital. These will then be used to develop AI methods to detect&#xD;
      changes in the eye related to those seen by patients on cancer treatment. The AI will then be&#xD;
      compared with the assessments of eye specialists to assess if they give similar results.&#xD;
