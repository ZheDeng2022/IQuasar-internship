  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, non-randomized, open-label, 2-part study to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of a single oral dose&#xD;
      of PF-07321332 in combination with the PK boosting agent ritonavir. Participants will be&#xD;
      selected and categorized into normal renal function or renal impairment groups based on their&#xD;
      estimated glomerular filtration rate. Part 1: will be conducted in approximately 24&#xD;
      participants (approximately 8 per group) with stable mild or moderate renal impairment and a&#xD;
      control group of participants with normal renal function. Part 2 will be conducted in&#xD;
      approximately 8 participants with stable severe renal impairment.&#xD;
