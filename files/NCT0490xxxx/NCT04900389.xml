      Study Protocol, Methods and Procedures to be Applied The universe of this case-control study,&#xD;
      which will determine the level of stigma, anxiety and wise awareness of those who work as&#xD;
      nurses in the clinic according to their COVID-19 passing status, is the universe of T.C.&#xD;
      Nurses working at Ministry of Health Health Sciences University Bursa Yüksek İhtisas Training&#xD;
      and Research Hospital Internal and Surgical Clinics (N: 756). The sample calculation of the&#xD;
      research was calculated using the sampling method with known universe. The minimum number of&#xD;
      people in the sample was calculated as (n) 354 when 1% error and 99% confidence interval were&#xD;
      taken with the Raosoft sampling method. It was planned to reach the total number of nurses&#xD;
      selected from internal and surgical clinics by using simple random sampling method and to&#xD;
      collect data from these clinics between 15.05.2021 - 15.06.2021. In this study,&#xD;

      used in this study. The part containing sociodemographic information is 11 questions. The&#xD;
      section on COVID-19 is composed of 11 questions by literature review. The part of the effect&#xD;
      of the COVID-19 Pandemic process on professional life is composed of 11 items (Participants&#xD;
      will give points between 0 and 10 for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 9th items, 0: none, 10: quite&#xD;
      often), (4th, 5th, Participants will score between 0 and 10 for the 6th, 7th, 8th, 10th and&#xD;
      11th items, 0: not at all, 10: quite a lot). Each item of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS)&#xD;
      is rated on a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (almost daily) based on experience over&#xD;
      the past two weeks. A CAS total score of 9 indicates dysfunctional anxiety associated with&#xD;
      coronavirus. High scores on a particular item or a high total scale score (9) may indicate&#xD;
      problematic symptoms of the participant that may require further evaluation and / or&#xD;
      treatment. Toronto Wisdom Awareness Scale (DPSS) consists of 13 items and a 5-Likert-type&#xD;
      interval is used for each item (1: strongly disagree, 5: strongly agree). Scoring of the&#xD;
      scale will be made according to the name of the factor. Scoring will be done in two separate&#xD;
      groups as monitoring without being affected (Items 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11) and Curiosity (Items&#xD;
      3, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13). Permission was obtained from the responsible authors who made the&#xD;
      validity and reliability of the scales to be used in our study. The survey was conducted by&#xD;

      continuation of the questionnaire. Participants will score 5 items in CAS from 0 (not at all)&#xD;
      to 4 (almost every day). Participants will give points to the items in the TBFÖ as 1:&#xD;
      absolutely disagree, 2: disagree, 3: undecided, 4: agree, 5: absolutely agree. The total time&#xD;
