  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of plinabulin in combination&#xD;
      with radiation therapy and immunotherapy in patients with select cancers that have spread to&#xD;
      other places in the body (advanced) after progression on PD-1 or PD-L1 targeted antibodies.&#xD;
      Plinabulin blocks tumor growth by targeting both new and existing blood vessels going to the&#xD;
      tumor as well as killing tumor cells. Immunotherapy may induce changes in body's immune&#xD;
      system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation&#xD;
      therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving plinabulin in&#xD;
      combination with radiation therapy and immunotherapy may work better in treating advanced&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of plinabulin when administered in combination with&#xD;
      radiation/immunotherapy regimen in subjects with select advanced solid malignancies after&#xD;
      progression on anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the objective tumor response rate (complete response + partial response).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess disease control rate (complete response, partial response + stable disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine progression-free survival (PFS). III. To assess overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To analyze the gene mutation density within each sample. II. To assess T-cell receptor&#xD;
      (TCR) sequencing in tumor tissue and peripheral blood, pre- and post- treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To perform imaging mass flow cytometry (CyTOF) and/or single cell ribonucleic acid&#xD;
      sequencing (RNAseq) analysis on tumor tissue: Immune phenotyping, including dendritic cell&#xD;
      (DC), T cells, tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)s, pre and post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To conduct phenotyping analysis of immune cells from peripheral blood using multicolor&#xD;
      flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate dendritic cell activation from whole blood upon the treatment. VI. To explore&#xD;
      general predictive and response biomarker measurements from the collected biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of plinabulin followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients undergo radiation therapy on days 1-3, 1-4, or 1-5 of cycle 1. Patients may&#xD;
      undergo additional radiation in cycle 2 at the discretion of treating physician. Patients&#xD;
      receive plinabulin intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 4 of cycle 1, days 1&#xD;
      and 4 of cycle 2 (if receiving radiation therapy in cycle 2), and day 1 and or 15 (any day&#xD;
      receiving immunotherapy) of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive immunotherapy consisting&#xD;
      of either: avelumab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15; atezolizumab over 30-60 minutes on day&#xD;
      1; durvalumab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15; nivolumab IV over 30-60 min on days 1 and 15;&#xD;
      or pembrolizumab IV over 30 min on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 or 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients undergo radiation therapy on days 1-3, 1-4, or 1-5 of cycle 1. Patients may&#xD;
      undergo additional radiation in cycle 2 at the discretion of treating physician. Patients&#xD;
      also receive immunotherapy consisting of either: avelumab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15;&#xD;
      atezolizumab over 30-60 minutes on day 1; durvalumab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15;&#xD;
      nivolumab IV over 30-60 min on days 1 and 15; or pembrolizumab IV over 30 min on day 1.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 21 or 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 months.&#xD;
