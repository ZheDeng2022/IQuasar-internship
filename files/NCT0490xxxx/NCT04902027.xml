      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase Ib study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome in subjects with recurrent/metastatic head&#xD;
      and neck cancers. At least 30 subjects will be recruited in this study. The subjects will&#xD;
      receive Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome 20 mg/m2 by an intravenous infusion (IV), every&#xD;
      21 days (q3w, 1 cycle). All patients will receive the treatment until disease progression,&#xD;
      intolerable toxic reaction, death, or withdrawa by investigator or patient decision (a&#xD;
      maximum of 8 cycles). Delays in drug administration is allowed from the cycle 2, however, the&#xD;
      delays should be no more than 3 weeks. Dose adjustments after the cycle 2 is permitted, and&#xD;
      the minimum dose is 12mg/m2.&#xD;
