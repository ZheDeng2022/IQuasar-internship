      *** LithoVue 2.0 is now under evaluation at Health Canada. This study will not begin until&#xD;
      approval is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flexible ureteroscopy has become the main surgical treatment for kidney stone disease. The&#xD;
      procedure uses many types of ureteroscopes (disposable and non-disposable). Currently we are&#xD;
      using the LithoVue Single-Use Digital Flexible Ureteroscope. The Health Canada approved&#xD;
      LithoVue 2.0 disposable flexible ureteroscope will now offer novel pressure sensory capacity.&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the new ureteroscopy we will be conducting a prospective&#xD;
      multi-institution study in order to determine the main features, capacity and abilities of&#xD;
      the new scope. We will evaluate the impact of intra renal pressure on pain, quality of life&#xD;
      and possible infectious complications.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm multicenter study looking at real world results of ureteroscopy with the&#xD;
      new digital flexible ureteroscope LithoVue 2.0. The study will involve 6 participating&#xD;
      institutions. Each sites will be in charge of recruiting 25 participants for a total of 150&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The single-use flexible ureteroscope (Lithovue 2.0) will provide equivalent overall&#xD;
           performance to a standard-of-care reusable or disposable ureteroscope as determined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stone-free rate following ureteroscopy at 4-8 weeks post-procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Equivalent adjunctive procedures in the postoperative period&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intraoperative assessment parameters will show no difference between the Lithovue&#xD;
                2.0 scope and other standard-of-care ureteroscopes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Elevated intrarenal pressures during ureteroscopes will result in:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Higher post-operative pain intensity as documented in the Brief Pain Inventory-BPI&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lower quality of life as reflected via Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life&#xD;
                Questionnaire scores&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Higher rates of infections complications&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Changes in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) from baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who will undergo ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy will be screened for&#xD;
           eligibility (see inclusion exclusion criteria). The stone burden needs to be less than&#xD;
           20 mm in total to be eligible. Patients with a nephrostomy tube are ineligible as the&#xD;
           nephrostomy tube may affect the intraoperative renal pressure. Patients undergoing&#xD;
           bilateral ureteroscopy are eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Eligible patients will be approached to participate in the study, their consent will be&#xD;
           obtained and each participant will be assigned an identification number to code his/her&#xD;
           data. Patients will undergo standard-of-care ureteroscopy under anesthesia specific to&#xD;
           the investigator's site.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Preoperatively, patients who have an indication to undergo ureteroscopy will have&#xD;
           imaging and fill out a WISQOL and BPI questionnaire at baseline. Baseline urine analysis&#xD;
           is required and culture if indicated as per standard of care. Bloodwork is performed as&#xD;
           per institutional standard of care. In addition, a urine sample will be obtained and&#xD;
           stored (-20C) for NGAL measurement. The standard-of-care at each site will be used for&#xD;
           antibiotics and whether the procedure is performed as an outpatient procedure or if the&#xD;
           patient is admitted to the hospital post-operatively The day of surgery, the&#xD;
           ureteroscopy will be performed using the new digital flexible ureteroscope LithoVue 2.0&#xD;
           (LV 2.0). It will be carried out as per the surgeon's preference as to the use of a&#xD;
           safety guidewire, use of ureteral access sheath (UAS), basketing stones or dusting, type&#xD;
           of laser used, and laser settings. The irrigation used will be recorded and used as per&#xD;
           the surgeon's preference. The pressure readings from LV 2.0 will be recorded and the&#xD;
           surgeon will be blinded to these readings until the end of the study. A decision on&#xD;
           whether to leave a stent and its indwelling time is left up to the surgeon. Stone (s)&#xD;
           will be sent for laboratory analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the recovery room after the procedure, the patient will have their Quick Sequential&#xD;
           Organ Failure Assessment Score (QSOFA) score measured (systolic blood pressure,&#xD;
           mentation status (GCS), and respiratory rate) as well as complete the BPI. In addition,&#xD;
           a urine sample will be obtained and stored (-20C) for NGAL measurement as well as any&#xD;
           other laboratory tests requested by the investigator. Postoperative antibiotics,&#xD;
           analgesics (e.g. Tylenol, NSAID, +/- opioid) and discharge medication (e.g. NSAIDS,&#xD;
           Opioids, Anticholinergics, Alpha blockers) prescriptions are left to the discretion of&#xD;
           surgeon and will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Within 1-2 weeks, participants who have a stent will come to the hospital for stent&#xD;
           removal. Stents can be removed in any fashion (tether string or cystoscopy), this&#xD;
           decision is left up to the surgeon. Participants who have no stent in place might have&#xD;
           an in-person or remote follow-up depending on COVID 19 restrictions. Participants will&#xD;
           have to also complete the BPI and WISQOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Within 4-8 weeks postoperatively, patients will undergo standard of care imaging with&#xD;
           either a combination of KUB x-ray and renal-bladder ultrasound or a low-dose CT scan.&#xD;
           The choice of modality will be left to the surgeon discretion depending on institutional&#xD;
           standards, surgeon preference and stone type. The stone free rate will be recorded based&#xD;
           on imaging results. Participants will complete the BPI and WISQOL. The patient will have&#xD;
           completed the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

                complete the BPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Postoperative visit (V2): Within 1-2 weeks we will remove the stent and record;&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Postoperative data: Date of stent removal and stent indwelling time when applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Patient reported outcomes: Participants will complete the WisQOL and BPI&#xD;
&#xD;
           Postoperative visit (V3): Within 4-8 weeks postoperatively, patients will undergo&#xD;
           standard of care imaging. During this visit we will record:&#xD;

                (SFR), type of stone (s) based on stone's laboratory analysis and 30&#xD;
                days-postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Patient reported outcomes: Participants will complete the WisQOL and BPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Additional variables collected allowing ancillary studies. Medical charts of&#xD;
           participants and surgical protocol will be reviewed to collect the information needed&#xD;
           for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size calculation is based on quality of life change as we think that it would be&#xD;
           most affected by intra renal pressure. Quality of life in stone patients is measured&#xD;
           with the WISQOL questionnaire that has been developed specifically for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Standard WISQOL score mean=108/140 (validation study)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We hypothesized that WISQOL will lower by 10 points with high intra renal&#xD;
                pressures= 98/140&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SD = 29&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Alpha (Type 1 error rate) = 0.05&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Power= 0.80&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Calculated samples size = 133&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Taking into account follow-up withdrawals and losses, the final sample size will be&#xD;
                rounded to 150.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical Analysis will be conducted using:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  One-way ANOVA, multivariate analysis and Student's t-test for comparisons&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Linear regression to look at the correlation between pressure measurements and the&#xD;
                other outcomes of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will be using commercially available software package. The final data and analysis&#xD;
           will be reviewed with a statistician for any additional analyses.&#xD;

&#xD;
           Data collection, management, storage and conservation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection and management:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A urine sample will be drawn for NGAL measurement at V0 and V1. The sample will be&#xD;
           stored in a freezer at -20C at each participating center. Analysis of urine samples will&#xD;
           done at the University of British Columbia's laboratory in Vancouver, shipment of&#xD;
           samples for analysis will be done once, at the end of the study. Samples will be&#xD;
           destroyed after analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Redcap database will be used for data collection. Each participating center will be&#xD;
           provided an access to CHUM's REDCap to enter all data requested during the study&#xD;
           (demographic data as well as patient reported outcomes, clinical data, imaging and&#xD;
           laboratory results). Patient reported outcomes-related questionnaires can be sent via&#xD;
           REDCap powered emails to be completed online or given to participants in paper form&#xD;
           depending on the site's preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data storage and conservation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nominal data as well as the file that links identification information with the code&#xD;
           assigned to each participant will be stored and kept at each participating institution&#xD;
           as required by each institution's Research Ethics Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
           No identification data will be stored on REDCap, except the e-mail address of&#xD;
           participants for the sites that will use REDCap powered emails to send the&#xD;
           questionnaires to participants. Data collected and stored on REDCap will be coded and&#xD;
           the e-mail address of participants will be removed at the time of data extraction for&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Only the members of the Central Coordinating Research Team at the CHUM who are involved&#xD;
           in the study, the local coordinators at participating sites and the REDCap data manager&#xD;
           at the CHUM will have access to data stored on REDCap. The data collected using REDCap&#xD;
           will be hosted on secure CHUM servers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is no blinding during this study and it is not an interventional trial so&#xD;
           emergency access to the database is not necessary for patient care. It is an&#xD;
           observational trial and measuring patient reported outcomes. At the end of the study,&#xD;
           data collected via REDCap will be downloaded for analysis, stored on the network drive&#xD;
           of Dr. Naeem Bhojani at the CHUM and kept for 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The procedures of this study fall within standard-of-care, and as such all prospective&#xD;
           patients to be enrolled in this study will receive the same care whether they are&#xD;
           included in the study or not. These patients may withdraw from the study at any time&#xD;
           without any negative consequences to the medical care, education, or other services to&#xD;
           which they are entitled or are presently receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intrarenal pressure measurements during the study ureteroscopy procedure is not part of&#xD;
           the standard of care and is done for research purposes only. There is no additional risk&#xD;
           to the patient when monitoring this pressure and patients will be informed of this&#xD;
           during the informed consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
           NGAL measurement is a measurement that is not part of standard of care, at the&#xD;
           preoperative visit urine analysis are done as part of usual care, the medical staff will&#xD;
           ask patients for an additional urine sample to be stored (-20C) for NGAL measurement.&#xD;
           Right after their ureteroscopy (V1) while in the recovery room, no urine sample is drawn&#xD;
           as part of standard care, we will ask participants to provide a urine sample exclusively&#xD;
           for NGAL measurement but participants will be informed of this. No more NGAL&#xD;
           measurements are required as part of study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Approached participants will be asked to provide their consent. Paper or electronic&#xD;
           consent might be used depending on participating site preferences and Research Ethics&#xD;
           Board requirements. Electronic consent might be obtained via REDCap or other&#xD;
           means/platforms as authorized by each participating site Research Ethics Boards.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collected during this study will be kept for 10 years. The results will be&#xD;
           presented at conferences and published in journals; however, precautions will be taken&#xD;
           to ensure that at the time of dissemination, the study participants will not be&#xD;
           identifiable.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Funding:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is an investigator-initiated trial and there is no funding for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Conflict of interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although this is an investigator-initiated study, it should be noted that the principal&#xD;
           investigator (Dr Naeem Bhojani) and the Co-Principal investigator (Dr. Ben Chew) are&#xD;
           consultants for Boston Scientific, the manufacturer of the LithoVue 2.0 disposable&#xD;
           flexible ureteroscope under evaluation.&#xD;
