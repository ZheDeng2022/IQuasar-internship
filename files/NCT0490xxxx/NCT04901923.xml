    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), food-effect,&#xD;
      and drug-drug interaction study of ACP-196 in healthy participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided into 3 parts. Part 1 will include 5 cohorts (Cohorts [C] 1 to 5) and&#xD;
      participants will receive oral ACP-196 2.5 to 50 mg twice daily (BID) and 100 mg once daily&#xD;
      (QD) on Day 1. In Part 2 (Cohort 6), participants will receive a single oral dose of 75.0 mg&#xD;
      QD in a fasting and a fed state, with a 7-day washout period between the 2 doses. In Part 3&#xD;
      (Cohort 7), participants will receive a single oral dose of 50.0 mg QD alone on Day 1 and in&#xD;
      combination with itraconazole on Day 9. Itraconazole 200 mg will be given twice daily (12&#xD;
      hours apart) with meals on Days 4 to 8 and once on Day 9 with ACP-196 under a fasting state&#xD;
      in the morning.&#xD;
