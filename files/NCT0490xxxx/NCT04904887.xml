    <time_frame>6 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The curve was obtained while the patient wearing his distance correction to provide the best distance visual acuity in both eyes. The test was performed under photopic conditions (85 candelas/m2) using ETDRS charts at a distance of 4m with the introduction of defocusing lenses from +1.00 D to -4.00 D in 0.50 D steps.</description>

he binocular defocus curve: The binocular defocus curve was done to evaluate the functional range of vision. The curve was obtained while the patient wearing his distance correction to provide the best distance visual acuity in both eyes. The test was performed under photopic conditions (85 candelas/m2) using ETDRS charts at a distance of 4m with the introduction of defocusing lenses from +1.00 D to -4.00 D in 0.50 D steps.</description>
