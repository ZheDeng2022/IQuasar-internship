  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial examining and compare the effects of open and closed&#xD;
      kinetic chain exercises on pain, function, and cartilage synthesis and degradation biomarkers&#xD;
      after an eight-week rehabilitation program for knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients.&#xD;

      Design and Subjects: A prospective, active control, three-parallel-group, assessor-blinded,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. A sample of 120 subjects will be recruited and randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of three study groups at a 1:1:1 allocation ratio (40 participants per group): a)&#xD;
      Standard care only, b) Closed kinetic chain exercises plus standard care, and c) Open kinetic&#xD;
      chain plus standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: participants will receive 24 treatment sessions (3 sessions/week) over 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will be allocated to the experimental groups will receive the standard care&#xD;
      protocol in addition to either closed or open-chain exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcomes are physical function and pain assessed using the&#xD;
      Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) scores. Secondary outcomes include the&#xD;
      Numeric Pain Rating Scale, quadriceps and hamstring strength, joint range of motion (ROM),&#xD;
      joint proprioception error, and serum and urine OA biomarkers including the Serum cartilage&#xD;
      oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), Serum propeptide Type-II N-terminal (PIIANP), Serum C-&#xD;
      reactive protein (CRP), and Urine type -II Collagen telopeptide (CTX-II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Data will be analyzed using the intension-to-treat (ITT) analysis with&#xD;
      multiple imputations. The primary analysis of the primary outcomes at a two-month follow-up&#xD;
      time point (after completing the intervention protocol for 8 weeks) will be carried out using&#xD;
      a mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with adjustment for a set of pre-specified&#xD;
      baseline factors. Secondary analysis using the ANOVA test for the primary outcomes at a&#xD;
      six-month follow-up time point, and secondary outcomes at all follow-up time points will also&#xD;
      be carried out.&#xD;
