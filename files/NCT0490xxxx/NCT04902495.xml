  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the success rate of pulpotomies in temporary molars&#xD;
      using different types of hemostats and pulp coating materials based on tricalcium silicates,&#xD;
      in patients who have attended the Dental Clinic of the International University of Catalonia&#xD;
      (UIC).&#xD;

      This prospective randomized clinical trial study has been approved by the&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Committee in January of 2017 and by Ethics Committee (END-ECL- 2017-01) . It will&#xD;
      be conducted in patients needing a vital pulp&#xD;
&#xD;
      therapy treatment at the Pediatric Dentistry Department of Universitat Internacional de&#xD;
      Catalunya (Sant Cugat del Vall√©s, Barcelona, Spain). The necessary statistical sample size&#xD;
      assuming an alpha risk of 0.05, a beta risk of 0.05 and a power of 95% sample, the required&#xD;
      sample obtained by group resulted in 52. Given an estimate upwards of 20% of drop-outs in&#xD;
      controls, the final size results in 62.4 (63 cases per group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will be recollected using Excel program. Statgraphics Centurion XV&#xD;
      software (StatPoint Technologies, Inc., Warrenton, VA, USA) will be used for statistical&#xD;
      analysis. The chi-square test will be used and logistic regression analysis of the results&#xD;
      will be performed to assess differences between groups with a significance level of P &lt;0.05.&#xD;
