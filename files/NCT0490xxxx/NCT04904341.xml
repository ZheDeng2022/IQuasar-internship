    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the efficacy and safety of Cerebrolysin treatment as an&#xD;
      add- on therapy to mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in reducing global disability in subjects&#xD;
      with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The investigators have planned a single centre,&#xD;
      prospective, open-label, single-arm study with 12 months follow-up of 50 patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe AIS, with a small established infarct core and with good collateral&#xD;
      circulation who achieve significant reperfusion following MT and who receive additional&#xD;
      Cerebrolysin within 8 hours of stroke onset compared to 50 historical controls treated with&#xD;
      MT alone - matched for age, clinical severity, occlusion location, baseline perfusion lesion&#xD;
      volume, onset to reperfusion time and use of iv thrombolytic therapy (rt-PA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be overall proportion of subjects receiving Cerebrolysin&#xD;
      comparing to control group experiencing a favorable functional outcome (by modified Rankin&#xD;
      Scale [mRS] 0-2) at 7 day, 30 days, 90 days and 12 months following stroke onset. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to determine the efficacy of Cerebrolysin as compared to control&#xD;
      group in reducing risk of symptomatic secondary hemorrhagic transformation, improving&#xD;
      neurological outcome (NIHSS 0-2 at day 7, day 30 and 90); reducing mortality rates (over the&#xD;
      90-day and 12 months study period); and improving: activities of daily living (by Barthel&#xD;
      Index; BI), health-related quality of life (as measured by the EQ-5D-5L) assessed at day 30,&#xD;
      90 and at 12 months. The other measures of efficacy in Cerebrolysin group will include:&#xD;
      assessment of final stroke volume and penumbral salvage (measured by CT/CTP at 30 days) and&#xD;
      its change compared to baseline volume, changes over time in language function (by the&#xD;
      15-item Boston Naming Test), hemispatial neglect (by line bisection test), global cognitive&#xD;
      function (by The Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and depression (by Hamilton Depression Rating&#xD;
      Scale) between day 30 and day 90 assessments). The patients will receive 30 ml of&#xD;
      Cerebrolysin within 8h of AIS stroke onset and continue treatment once daily until day 21&#xD;
      (first cycle) and they will receive a second cycle of treatment (30 ml/d for 21 days given in&#xD;
      the Outpatient Department or Neurorehabilitation Clinic) from day 69 to 90 (± 3 days). All&#xD;
      the patients (including those from the control group) receive the same standardized&#xD;
      rehabilitation program (including speech therapy, occupational and physical therapy) during&#xD;
      hospitalization at Stroke Unit and at Neurorehabilitation Clinic until day 90 according to&#xD;
      local procedures. Historical data will be obtained by retrospective clinical chart reviews of&#xD;
      patients hospitalized in the study center between Jan.2018 and Dec.2020 and fulfilling the&#xD;
      same clinical and radiological inclusion criteria in whom 12-month follow-up (including mRS,&#xD;
      NIHSS, BI, EQ-5D-5L) could be obtained.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent endovascular stroke trials have established a new paradigm for acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke (AIS) treatment showing that mechanical thrombectomy (MT) within 6 hours of stroke&#xD;
      significantly reduces the mortality rate and improves clinical outcomes. These positive&#xD;
      results were not only driven by improved endovascular devices, but also by a refinement of&#xD;
      patient selection criteria, including the use of perfusion and collaterals status. Despite&#xD;
      these advances, the rates of functional independence (14%-58%) following MT are poor compared&#xD;
      with the efficient rates of recanalization (60%-90%). The mechanisms underlying this&#xD;
      &quot;no-reflow phenomenon&quot; are thought to result from altered microvascular circulation,&#xD;
      proinflammatory state and thrombosis that can persist despite proximal recanalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical revascularization presents a proven procedure with no potential drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions, that can be administered in series or parallel with neuroprotective agents.&#xD;
      Cerebrolysin is a neuropeptide preparation produced by standardized enzymatic breakdown of&#xD;
      porcine brain proteins. In experimental AIS studies Cerebrolysin has been shown to reduce the&#xD;
      infarction volume, proinflammatory cytokines, improve brain-blood-barrier dysfunction induced&#xD;
      by rt-PA and enhance functional recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have hypothesized that adding Cerebrolysin in selected patients based on&#xD;
      the clinical and radiological criteria (baseline small ischemic core, good collateral status,&#xD;
      significant reperfusion following MT, symptoms of cortical damage) may increase the&#xD;
      effectiveness of MT by initiating cytoprotective effects and preventing reperfusion injury&#xD;
      and delayed cell death. The multimodal treatment concept (Cerebrolysin combined with MT in&#xD;
      acute stroke and combined with rehabilitation in post-acute period) might also promote the&#xD;
      most effective recovery from moderate-to-severe stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cerebrolysin treatment as an&#xD;
      add-on therapy to MT in patients with AIS in the early recovery phase in acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke (90 days) and in long-term follow-up (12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single centre, prospective, open-label, single-arm study of consecutive 50 patients who&#xD;
      will be treated with MT in the reference centre according to local standards and additional&#xD;
      Cerebrolysin compared to 50 historical controls treated with MT alone - matched for age,&#xD;
      clinical severity, occlusion location, baseline perfusion lesion volume, onset to reperfusion&#xD;
      and use of iv rt-PA prior to MT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first Cerebrolysin infusion (30 ml mixed with 250 mL of saline) is intended to be&#xD;
      initiated as soon as possible after successful recanalization is achieved and within 8h of&#xD;
      AIS stroke onset. Cerebrolysin treatment will be continued (30 ml/d) once daily until day 21&#xD;
      (first cycle) and followed by a second cycle of treatment (30 ml/d for 21 days given in the&#xD;
      Outpatient Department or Neurorehabilitation Clinic) from day 69 to 90 (± 3 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients (including those from the control group) will receive the same standardized&#xD;
      rehabilitation program (including speech therapy, occupational and physical therapy) during&#xD;
      hospitalization at Stroke Unit and at Neurorehabilitation Clinic until day 90 according to&#xD;
      local procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo imaging at baseline, prior to mechanical thrombectomy. This will&#xD;
      include non-contrast CT (NCCT), CT angiography (CTA) and CT perfusion (CTP) acute stroke&#xD;
      imaging for prospectively enrolled patients. Follow up NCCT will be acquired at 24 hours and&#xD;
      30 days. Automated processing of NCCT, CTA and CTP will be performed using the latest&#xD;
      CE-marked version of e-Stroke software (Brainomix, Oxford, UK) at baseline, and follow up&#xD;
      imaging will be processed using algorithms in development by Brainomix. This will provide&#xD;
      objective and consistent quantification of imaging biomarkers to ensure robust matching to&#xD;
      historical controls as outlined in the study protocol, as well as evaluation of imaging&#xD;
      endpoints. NCCT, CTA and CTP will be processed using e-ASPECTS,e-CTA, and e-CTP modules&#xD;
      within e-Stroke respectively. Historical control patients will have had NCCT and CTA as a&#xD;
      minimum, and CTP will be included wherever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historical data will be obtained by retrospective clinical chart reviews of patients&#xD;
      hospitalized in the study center between 2017 and Dec.2020 and fulfilling the same clinical&#xD;
      and radiological inclusion criteria in whom 12-month follow-up (including mRS, NIHSS, BI,&#xD;
      EQ-5D-5L) could be obtained.&#xD;
