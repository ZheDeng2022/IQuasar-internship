  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MENOPUR is a human menotrophin product, with a combination of human follicle-stimulating&#xD;
      hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) activity. Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is&#xD;
      the major contributor to the LH activity in the product. MENOPUR is approved in more than 130&#xD;
      countries for a variety of strengths and indications. In China, MENOPUR, 75 IU is approved&#xD;
      for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in relation to assisted reproductive technology&#xD;
      (ART). The current trial is intended for supporting marketing authorization approval of a new&#xD;
      formulation of MENOPUR in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MENOPUR is currently available in China as a powder and solvent for solution for injection,&#xD;
      containing 75 IU of FSH and 75 IU of LH activity. A new liquid formulation is developed by&#xD;
      Ferring Pharmaceuticals for administration with a disposable pre-filled injection pen,&#xD;
      containing 600 IU of FSH and 600 IU of LH activity. MENOPUR solution for injection in&#xD;
      pre-filled pen, 600 IU/0.96 mL is the test product and MENOPUR powder and solvent for&#xD;
      solution for injection, 75 IU is the reference product in this trial.&#xD;
