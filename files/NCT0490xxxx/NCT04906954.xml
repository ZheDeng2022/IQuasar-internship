  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dig' Electrostim-01 is phase II, single center (step 1) and multicentre (step 2), single-arm&#xD;
      study to evaluate an 8-week NMES intervention combined with nutritional support in addition&#xD;
      to usual patient care&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia and cachexia are observed in more than 50% of patients with gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both negatively affect patient survival and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) due to&#xD;
      decreased tolerance to anticancer treatments and increased susceptibility to infections and&#xD;
      other complications. Therefore, sarcopenia and cachexia represent a major clinical issue in&#xD;
      this setting. A multimodal therapeutic approach to the sarcopenia and cachexia management is&#xD;
      recommended, including nutritional support and exercise with personalized oncology care and&#xD;
      family-centered education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) generates muscle contractions using portable&#xD;
      devices connected to surface electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NMES is safe, does not require the active cooperation of the patient and can be&#xD;
      self-administered at home, thereby providing an acceptable physical therapy for patients with&#xD;
      advanced cancer and an altered Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG&#xD;
      PS) and/or a high-symptom burden, for whom attendance to hospital-based exercise training is&#xD;
      difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we hypothesize that NMES is a safe and effective physical-therapy strategy to&#xD;
      improve HRQoL and to reduce cancer-induced sarcopenia in patients with metastatic GI cancer&#xD;
      and altered ECOG PS (ECOG PS of 2).&#xD;
