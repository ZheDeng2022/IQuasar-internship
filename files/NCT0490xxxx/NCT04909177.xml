  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specific phobias: fear of flying, heights, spiders, dogs and needles are the extremely common&#xD;
      and exposure therapy (ET) is the first line of treatment. Using Virtual Reality (VR),&#xD;
      participants will have control in gradual exposure to their fears. oVRcome&#xD;
      (https://www.ovrcome.io/ Virtual reality app), is a self-help VRET for specific phobias, that&#xD;
      is delivered through a smartphone application (app) in combination with a low cost headset&#xD;
      that holds the smartphone and uses 360ยบ video. The investigators hypothesize that oVRcome is&#xD;
      effective in reducing specific phobia symptoms.&#xD;
