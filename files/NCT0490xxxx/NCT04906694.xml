  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind study designed to investigate the efficacy, safety and PK of a single&#xD;
      dose of COVI-DROPS or matched placebo in outpatient adults who have tested positive for&#xD;
      COVID-19 and are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive a single dose of COVI-DROPS 10 mg, COVI-DROPS&#xD;
      20 mg, COVI-DROPS 40 mg, or placebo in a double-blind manner. Investigational product&#xD;
      (COVI-DROPS or placebo) will be administered once on Study Day 1. Subjects will be followed&#xD;
      to Day 60.&#xD;
