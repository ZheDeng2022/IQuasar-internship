    <textblock>
      In recent years, immunotherapy has been postulated as one of the most effective strategy in&#xD;
      the fight against cancer. The greatest success in this field has been achieved through the&#xD;
      inhibition of molecules involved in the brake of the adaptive immune response. The compounds&#xD;
      capable of blocking the action of these molecules constitute the &quot;immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors&quot; (ICI). Despite its efficacy, the treatment with ICI causes adverse effects, and&#xD;
      in the case of kidney damage, the prognosis has been shown to worsen in cancer patients who&#xD;
      develop renal dysfunction. Currently, the diagnosis based on laboratory tests is insufficient&#xD;
      to predict the underlying kidney injury and identify the type of damage. The hypothesis&#xD;
      proposed that the renal lesion could be subclinical, and therefore the possibility of using&#xD;
      new urinary biomarkers could be a useful diagnostic tool that would allow these patients to&#xD;
      be managed in a preventive (risk markers) and early way (early markers), and even to&#xD;
      elucidate if renal damage is due to this therapy or to other factors (differential diagnostic&#xD;
      markers). To develop this hypothesis it is proposed to validate biomarkers in patients&#xD;
      treated with ICI by developing a prospective study. The diagnostic products derived from this&#xD;
      study will improve the clinical practice of cancer treatment with ICI, and therefore the&#xD;
      expectancy and quality of life of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last decade, advances in the knowledge of both the immune response to tumors, as&#xD;
      well as the understanding of their evasion mechanisms, has made it possible to design&#xD;
      treatments aimed at improving said response and increasing patient survival in figures up to&#xD;
      now unthinkable. The greatest success in this field has been achieved through the inhibition&#xD;
      of molecules involved in the braking of the adaptive immune response: the so-called CTLA-4&#xD;
      (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4) and PD-1 (programmed cell death protein-1), with their&#xD;
      respective ligands. The compounds capable of blocking the action of these molecules&#xD;
      constitute the so-called &quot;immune checkpoint inhibitors&quot; (ICI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with conventional therapies, the adverse effects that these drugs develop in many cases&#xD;
      limit their use. Although nephrotoxicity is less common than other complications (liver,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal, skin, and lung toxicity), kidney effects have been shown to worsen&#xD;
      prognosis in cancer patients who develop kidney dysfunction. In addition, therapies based on&#xD;
      ICI combinations have recently been promoted to avoid the resistance acquired by the tumor to&#xD;
      treatment, and have even been associated with chemotherapy, which has improved the response,&#xD;
      but has increased the risk of nephrotoxic adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney injury due to immunotherapy treatment is characterized by acute kidney damage,&#xD;
      proteinuria, electrolyte disturbances, tubular injuries, glomerular injuries, and more&#xD;
      frequently acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, the toxic mechanisms underlying these events&#xD;
      are largely unknown. The usual clinical procedure when kidney damage appears is to suspend&#xD;
      immunotherapy treatment and administer systemic corticosteroids. However, discontinuation of&#xD;
      treatment may not be appropriate without diagnostic confirmation of the progression of kidney&#xD;
      damage, but continuation of treatment if the diagnosis is subsequently confirmed may lead to&#xD;
      definitive and irreversible kidney damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the diagnosis of kidney injury based on clinical findings and laboratory tests is&#xD;
      insufficient to predict the underlying kidney injury and identify the type of damage, since&#xD;
      serum markers such as creatinine or urea only provide information when the damage is already&#xD;
      established. In addition, it must be taken into account that kidney injuries, such as&#xD;
      ischemic and / or nephrotoxic tubular injury, paraneoplastic kidney injury, glomerular&#xD;
      injuries, and tubular obstruction can occur in cancer patients as a consequence of their&#xD;
      pathology and associated therapy. . Therefore, a careful evaluation of the possible causes&#xD;
      should be made to make the correct diagnosis in patients undergoing treatment with ICI (for&#xD;
      example, interstitial nephritis due to ICI versus other types of damage by other drugs) and&#xD;
      based on that, proceed to the management of the patient optimally. In this scenario, renal&#xD;
      biopsy is presented as the only alternative to definitively diagnose the lesion and&#xD;
      potentially guide therapy. Although it is the definitive diagnostic method, it is an invasive&#xD;
      technique, not without complications, therefore the possibility of using biomarkers capable&#xD;
      of identifying the type of damage (differential diagnosis biomarkers) would represent a&#xD;
      highly relevant diagnostic advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another important approach in diagnosis is the identification of damage early, since&#xD;
      creatinine levels (a commonly used marker) do not show a significant increase until kidney&#xD;
      function has already decreased by 50%. Currently, the usefulness of biomarkers of early&#xD;
      kidney damage associated with drug treatment has been described. These markers are components&#xD;
      or metabolic derivatives, degradation compounds or remains of them that appear in the urine&#xD;
      as a consequence of damage to kidney structures, showing subclinical damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant advance in the management of kidney injury would be to find markers capable of&#xD;
      identifying subjects at risk, that is, in a stage prior to damage (risk biomarkers). It has&#xD;
      been defined that different drugs and kidney toxins, in completely subtoxic doses, are&#xD;
      capable of predisposing, or making experimental animals more sensitive to acute kidney&#xD;
      damage. The relevance of this situation is that individuals apparently unaffected by the&#xD;
      adverse effects of a treatment, or by exposure to a substance, could be, without knowing it&#xD;
      and therefore unable to do anything to prevent it, exposed to developing kidney damage acute&#xD;
      in situations, or under certain circumstances (other treatments, radiological contrasts,&#xD;
      environmental toxins, etc.) that do not produce any harm in non-predisposed individuals.&#xD;
      Associated with this condition, it have been identified and patented, and are clinically and&#xD;
      technologically developing urinary markers related to this acquired hypersensitivity. Their&#xD;
      clinical application would allow, not only to detect this predisposition, but also to&#xD;
      stratify patients in a preventive and personalized way, according to the individual risk they&#xD;
      acquire as a consequence of apparently innocuous pharmacological treatments or other&#xD;
      circumstances inherent to their pathology. On this basis, it is proposed in this project to&#xD;
      explore possible biomarkers that can be detected by patients at risk before starting&#xD;
      treatment with ICI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all the above, this project will be carried out through preclinical and clinical studies.&#xD;
      The main objective proposed in clinical setting is to validate biomarkers as diagnostic tools&#xD;
      for kidney damage in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1. Before starting treatment to detect patients at risk (risk markers) 1.2. During&#xD;
      treatment, in a first phase to detect early lesions (early biomarkers)&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this objective, it is intended to study whether these biomarkers can be a valid tool in&#xD;
      the management of kidney damage in patients treated with ICI, responding to an unresolved&#xD;
      diagnostic need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT DATA COLLECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      A database will be prepared that collects the following variables for each patient: age, sex,&#xD;
      family history, personal history, tumor type, antitumor treatment regimen, clinical&#xD;
      characteristics of the case, comorbidity factors, allergies, usual medication, occasional&#xD;
      drugs and follow-up data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine Sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study times, in which urine samples will be taken, will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before each antineoplastic cycle (Pre ICI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One week after each antineoplastic cycle (Post ICI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Processing and storage of urine samples In the case of samples from the Salamanca University&#xD;
      Hospital, the samples will be handled and kept in the Sample Bank of the Salamanca University&#xD;
      Clinical Hospital. The samples from the Valladolid University Clinical Hospital will be&#xD;
      handled and kept in the Oncology Service itself. After collection, the samples will be&#xD;
      centrifuged to remove possible sediments and later frozen in several aliquots at -80 degrees&#xD;
      Celsius.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study of kidney function using clinical parameters At all times of the study, the plasma&#xD;
      concentration of creatinine, urea and electrolytes will be extracted from the analytics&#xD;
      issued by the Biochemistry Service of the respective hospitals. These tests are prescribed by&#xD;
      doctors as part of the patient care process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study of early markers and risk markers of acute kidney damage The rest of the analytical&#xD;
      determinations necessary for the study will be carried out in the laboratory of the&#xD;
      &quot;Theranostic Unit of Renal and Cardiovascular Diseases&quot; of IBSAL. They are the following:&#xD;
      urinary creatinine concentration (commercial kit), creatinine clearance (using conventional&#xD;
      mathematical formulas), proteinuria, (Bradford technique), urinary NAG excretion (using&#xD;
      colorimetric kit), KIM-1, NGAL, albumin, transferrin and GM2AP (by ELISA or Western blot).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Data analysis will be done with &quot;SPSS 25.0&quot;. A significance level of&#xD;
      0.05 will be used. Different contrasts will be applied depending on the association to be&#xD;
      studied in each case, and the type of variables, such as: normality test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov,&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk), frequency comparison (χ2), correlation test (Pearson, Spearman), comparison of&#xD;
      means for independent data (ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis) and ANOVA for repeated measures and&#xD;
      Wilcoxon test for paired data. Finally, to simultaneously study data sets with several&#xD;
      variables measured for each individual or parameter collected, techniques with Multivariate&#xD;
      Analysis will be used, such as: regression analysis, general linear models, binary logistic&#xD;
      regression and correspondence analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY LIMITATIONS The variables included are biomarkers of early kidney damage and of&#xD;
      predisposition to acute kidney damage induced by certain kidney toxins. It is possible that&#xD;
      there are other (unknown) markers, not analyzed, and which can predict, diagnose earlier or&#xD;
      allow a differential etiological diagnosis of kidney damage associated with treatment with&#xD;
      immunotherapy or immunotherapy / chemotherapy.&#xD;
