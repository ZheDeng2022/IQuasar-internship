      This clinical study is designed to test the efficacy of the Novir 2019-nCoV Immunoglobulin&#xD;
      M/Immunoglobulin G Antibody Test in a point-of-care setting to support the increasing need&#xD;
      for rapid screening in the detection of antibodies. The study is performed on individuals who&#xD;
      have no history of COVID-19 and no history of COVID immunization as well as individuals with&#xD;
      history of COVID-19 that was diagnosed greater than 15 days. This is performed both through&#xD;
      3mL venous whole blood which is ran through an assay as well a point-of-care rapid test which&#xD;
      is resulted in 10 minutes. Aiding in the rapid detection of COVID-19 antibodies.&#xD;

      This clinical study is designed to test the efficacy and robustness of the Novir 2019-nCoV&#xD;
      IgM/IgG Antibody Test (Colloidal Gold) in a point-of-care (POC) setting to support the&#xD;
      growing need for rapid screening of patients to detect antibodies. The COVID-19 SARS-CoV&#xD;
      IgM/IgG antibody rapid test is an immunochromatographic lateral flow assay intended for&#xD;
      qualitative detection of IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human venipuncture and&#xD;
      finger stick whole blood. The COVID-19 SARS-CoV IgM/IgG antibody rapid test is intended for&#xD;
      use as an aid in identifying individuals with an adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2,&#xD;
      indicating recent or prior infection. At this time, it is unknown for how long antibodies&#xD;
      persist following infection and if the presence of antibodies confers protective immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results are for the detection of SARS CoV-2 antibodies. IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      are generally detectable in blood several days after initial infection, although the duration&#xD;
      of time antibodies are present post-infection is not well characterized. Individuals may have&#xD;
      detectable virus present for several weeks following seroconversion. All the results will be&#xD;
      compared to an FDA EUA authorized PCR test results and may also be compared to an FDA EUA&#xD;
      authorized ELISA, CMIA, or other antibody test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study results will be used for an EUA application to the FDA.&#xD;

    <description>To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Novir 2019-nCoV IgM/IgG Antibody Test (Colloidal Gold) when testing intended use populations who meet the criteria of having COVID-19 infection by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The test is to be performed by healthcare professionals (non-CLIA laboratory technicians) at POC settings.vStandard calculations will be used to derive sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values as well as 95% confidence intervals compared to reference method.</description>
