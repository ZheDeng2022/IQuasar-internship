      To evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of mouthwash containing Curcuma longa&#xD;
      (Turmeric extract) versus mouthwash containing essential oils and Placebo mouthwash on&#xD;
      controlling Halitosis among a group of Egyptian children.&#xD;

      For both interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eligibility screen and patient selection according to the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
           criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Readings for halitosis will be recorded using Tanita HC-312F Fitscan Portable Breath&#xD;
           Checker (Tanita Corporation, Japan) that shows red, yellow and green colors indicating&#xD;
           halitosis degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Green color=no odour&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Yellow color=moderate odour&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Red color=intense odour Children with yellow or red colored results will be&#xD;
                included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants will be provided with information regarding the risks and benefit of the&#xD;
           study and written informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intra and extra-oral examinations and Baseline records photographs, caries assessment by&#xD;
           using DMF, gingival condition assessment using Simplified oral hygiene index and&#xD;
           personal data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participating children will be offered a full mouth restorative treatment, if needed,&#xD;
           before starting the trial to exclude that halitosis comes from food impaction in carious&#xD;
           teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. In another visit, after the full mouth rehabilitation, readings for halitosis will be&#xD;
           re-recorded using color coded Tanita HC-312F Fitscan Portable Breath Checker (Tanita&#xD;
           corporate, Japan). Patients who will get green colored result will be excluded from the&#xD;
           study as the cause of halitosis in those patients would be food impaction in carious&#xD;
           teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Allocation of the participants who will score more than 2 into either one of three&#xD;
           groups; A, B or C. i. A for Experimental group (Turmeric mouthwash) ii. B for first&#xD;
           comparator (Essential oil mouthwash) iii. C for second comparator (Placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Allocation will be concealed by withdrawing a sealed opaque envelope containing four&#xD;
           times folded paper containing the type of mouth wash that will be used. This will&#xD;
           decrease performance bias as the operator will not know the group of the participant&#xD;
           until taking the score of the patients and finishing the restorative treatment. Blinding&#xD;
           of the operator will not be needed as the readings will be objective and recorded using&#xD;
           the device (Tanita device) not by the operator (organoleptic method).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. All mouth rinse samples (experimental and comparators 1&amp;2) will be put into identical&#xD;
           white opaque plastic bottles labelled with the codes A, B or C for the blinding of the&#xD;
           participant. Group A: The experimental sample is a Turmeric mouthwash which will be&#xD;
           prepared by dissolving 10 mg of Turmeric extract in 100 mL of distilled water and 0.005%&#xD;
           of flavouring agent peppermint oil (Sharma, 2016). Group B: The first comparator will be&#xD;
           the commercial Miswak Listerine mouthwash. Group C: The second comparator will be a&#xD;
           placebo mouthwash and will be prepared with peppermint oil and distilled water;&#xD;
           essentially the same contents as those in the experimental mouthwash except for the&#xD;
           turmeric powder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Every participant will use 2 mouthwash bottles of the same group label that they were&#xD;
           allocated to. The first bottle according to their allocation. Patients will be given&#xD;
           standard written oral hygiene instructions and mouth washing instructions to rinse twice&#xD;
           daily with 10 ml for 1 minute under their parents&quot; supervision for two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. The first follow up visit after two weeks, the halitosis score will be recorded by using&#xD;
           the Tanita device for numerical record and by asking the parent if there is a bad odour&#xD;
           or not. Patients then will be instructed to stop rinsing for the next two weeks while&#xD;
           maintaining other oral hygiene instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. The second follow-up visit after 4 weeks, patients will be given the second bottle and&#xD;
           instructed to rinse twice daily with 10 ml for another two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. The last follow up visit will be after 6 weeks and the final Halitosis score will be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
