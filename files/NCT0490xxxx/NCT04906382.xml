  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial evaluates the effect of tislelizumab in treating patients with mismatch&#xD;
      repair deficient endometrial cancer that has come back (recurrent). Deoxyribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (DNA) mismatch repair (MMR) is a system for recognizing and repairing DNA errors and damage.&#xD;
      Mismatch repair deficient tumors (dMMR) may have difficulty repairing DNA mutations during&#xD;
      replication that may affect tumor's response to therapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as tislelizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving tislelizumab may&#xD;
      help treat patients with mismatch repair deficient endometrial cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of tislelizumab (BGB-A317) on the diversity and dynamics of the T&#xD;
      cell receptor repertoire in responders versus non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of tislelizumab on tumor mutational profiles between responders and&#xD;
      non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the effect of tislelizumab +/- carboplatin/paclitaxel on PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      expression and other immune markers in tumor biopsies between responders and non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of tislelizumab +/- carboplatin/paclitaxel in&#xD;
      patients with MMR deficient recurrent endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the effect of adding carboplatin/paclitaxel to tislelizumab on tumor mutational&#xD;
      profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the effect of adding carboplatin/paclitaxel to tislelizumab (BGB-A317) on the&#xD;
      diversity and dynamics of the T cell receptor repertoire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the objective antitumor activity (complete and partial response) of&#xD;
      tislelizumab as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version&#xD;
      (v)1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore the objective antitumor activity (complete and partial response) of&#xD;
      tislelizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel after single agent tislelizumab as measured by RECIST&#xD;
      v1.1 criteria V. To explore the progression free survival in patients with mismatch repair&#xD;
      deficiency (dMMR) recurrent endometrial cancer treated with tislelizumab +/-&#xD;
      carboplatin/paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tislelizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Beginning cycle 4, patients who are chemotherapy naive with progressive disease,&#xD;
      stable disease, or partial response, also receive carboplatin IV and paclitaxel IV every 21&#xD;
      days per standard of care for 6-9 cycles at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days, and&#xD;
      then periodically thereafter.&#xD;
