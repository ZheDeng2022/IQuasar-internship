  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a descriptive, prospective, non-controlled clinical investigation to be conducted on&#xD;
      approximately 10 enrolled subjects at one site at Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen,&#xD;
      Norway. The target subjects are male or female, 18-70 years, diagnosed with MS according to&#xD;
      revised McDonald criteria (9) with spasticity and pain associated with the spasticity.&#xD;
      Spasticity is evaluated based on self-reported spasticity using the numerical rating scale&#xD;
      (NRS) which describes the average score of spasticity over the last 24 hours at &gt;4 (where the&#xD;
      scale scores spasticity from 0-10, where 0 is no spasticity, and 10 is worst possible&#xD;
      spasticity), - combined with pain in the lower extremities last 24 hours. The pilot&#xD;
      investigation is done to evaluate if FlowOx2.0™ can be used to treat spasticity with&#xD;
      concomitant pain in patients with multiple sclerosis, using intermittent negative pressure&#xD;
      affecting arteriovenous reflex.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The unabbreviated scale title: Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC) The FSMC is an assessment of MS-related cognitive and motor fatigue. A Likert-type 5-point scale (ranging from 'does not apply at all' to 'applies completely') produces a score between 1 and 5 for each scored question. Thus minimum value is 20 (no fatigue at all) and maximum value is 100 (severest grade of fatigue). Two subscales (mental and physical fatigue) can be made. Items included in the subscale mental are 1-4-7-8-11-13-15-17-18-20 and items included in the subscale physical are 2-3-5-6-9-10-12-14-16-19. Changes in the scores will be compared to baseline.</description>

The task sequence consists of a series of symbols, each with a blank space underneath. Within a 90-second time limit the subject is required, consulting the key as necessary, to insert the numbers associated with the symbols. Changes in the performance will be compared to baseline.</description>
