      This study evaluates the effects of peripheral nerve stimulation on anxiety levels in&#xD;
      participants with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). This is a pilot investigation in which&#xD;
      participants will randomized (1:1) to the active or sham treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic, recurring condition that affects&#xD;
      approximately 6.4 million American adults each year. GAD is one of the most common anxiety&#xD;
      disorders and is costly to treat. First-line treatments for GAD include medication (e.g.&#xD;
      SSRIs, SNRIs), cognitive behavioral therapy, or both in combination. Peripheral nerve&#xD;
      stimulation via acupuncture has been shown to directly decrease clinical anxiety scores. The&#xD;
      investigators have developed the Empower Neuromodulation System, a non-invasive, portable&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device intended to stimulate peripheral&#xD;
      nerves for the treatment of anxiety. In this study, a randomized, controlled study will be&#xD;
      conducted in participants with GAD. Participants will self-administer twice daily treatments&#xD;
      with the Empower device. In this pilot study, the primary endpoints will be feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability, with safety and effectiveness evaluated as exploratory endpoints.&#xD;

    <description>Participant blinding to treatment group will be assessed per the method proposed by Bang et al. All participants will be asked if they believe that they have received the real treatment, with possible responses of Yes, No, or Don't Know. Then, for the active and sham treatment groups, the blinding index will be calculated, where the blinding index can range from -1 to 1. A score of 1 means that all participants have guessed correctly about group assignment, a score of -1 means that all participants have guessed incorrectly about group assignment.</description>
