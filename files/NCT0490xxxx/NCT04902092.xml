  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heavy cannabis use is associated with substantive learning and memory impairments and&#xD;
      elevated risk of psychopathology. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that the hippocampus,&#xD;
      centrally implicated in these processes, is particularly vulnerable to the deleterious&#xD;
      effects of prolonged exposure to cannabis. This deterioration of hippocampal structure,&#xD;
      function, and biochemistry can be reversed, but this requires two or more years of abstinence&#xD;
      from cannabis. However, most heavy cannabis users find it extremely difficult to maintain&#xD;
      abstinence over extended periods and current treatments for cannabis use disorders are&#xD;
      inadequate. There is a pressing clinical need for an intervention that rapidly accelerates&#xD;
      hippocampal recovery, ameliorates the associated cognitive impairments and mental health&#xD;
      symptoms, and leads to improved treatment outcomes. One promising candidate is physical&#xD;
      exercise. In addition to the well-known physical health benefits, regular exercise also has a&#xD;
      potent positive effect on brain health. The current study will investitive the capacity of&#xD;
      two different neuroscientifically-informed 12-week exercise programs can restore brain health&#xD;
      for heavy long term cannabis users.&#xD;

      Heavy cannabis use is associated with substantive learning and memory impairments and&#xD;

      hippocampal recovery, ameliorates the associated cognitive impairments and mental health&#xD;
      symptoms, and leads to improved treatment outcomes. One promising candidate is physical&#xD;
      exercise. In addition to the well-known physical health benefits, regular exercise also has a&#xD;
      potent positive effect on brain health and can increase the size of the hippocampus. It's not&#xD;
      yet known how much or what kind of exercise produces the best results. This study has been&#xD;
      designed to compare the effects of two different exercise programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 12 weeks of regular HIIT exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 12 weeks of regular strength training&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team are investigating whether the programs have a positive impact on brain&#xD;
      health and, if they do, whether one is more effective than the other. The research team will&#xD;
      also measure whether engaging in either program leads to a reduction in cannabis consumption,&#xD;
      and improvements in thinking skills, mental health, and general wellbeing.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>High Intensity Interval Training</intervention_name>
    <description>Exercise sessions will commence with an initial 3-week accustomization period whereby training load will increase incrementally from 2 x 45min sessions with effort peaking at 60% VO2 max (week 1) increasing to 3 x 45minute with effort peaking at 80% VO2max (week 3). Participants will transition to the full HIIT protocol for the remaining weeks. The HIIT component will comprise a work-rest ratio of ≥1:1minutes, with alternating exertion epochs at &gt;80% VO2max and &lt;60% VO2max. As VO2max is likely to increase as fitness improves toward the end of the 3-month program, adjustments to HIIT will be made by the exercise physiologist based on real-time heart rate monitoring, ensuring greater accuracy in participants achieving their heart rate targets.</description>

    <description>Exercise sessions will comprise a combination of strength, coordination and mobility exercises. The strength component will consist of 2-3 sets of resistance exercises at ≤70% of a predicted 1 repetition maximum, targeting all body segments. Heart rate tracking will occur to ensure participants do not exceed 70% v02 (or exceed Lactate Threshold).</description>
