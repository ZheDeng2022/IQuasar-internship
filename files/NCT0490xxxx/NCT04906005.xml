  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single center, single ascending dose, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase&#xD;
      I trial will include male and female Japanese healthy volunteers. Within a 4-week run-in&#xD;
      period before inclusion in the trial, healthy volunteers will be checked for&#xD;
      inclusion/non-inclusion criteria and will then be randomized and administered with&#xD;
      gadopiclenol or placebo. For each healthy volunteer, there will be a confinement period of&#xD;
      one night before the inclusion visit and 2 days post administration at the clinical unit. The&#xD;
      healthy volunteers will return to the clinical unit for safety visit 7 days after study&#xD;
      product administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each dose group, 6 healthy volunteers (3 male and 3 female) will receive gadopiclenol and&#xD;
      3 healthy volunteers (2M/1F or 1M/2F) will receive placebo (physiological saline solution,&#xD;
      0.9% sodium chloride) in one single intravenous administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation from one group to the next group will be sequential and will be allowed only&#xD;
      if the clinical and biological safety of all healthy volunteers from the previous tested dose&#xD;
      is acceptable. The decision will be made by a Trial Safety Review Board (TSRB), consisting in&#xD;
      members of Guerbet team and the principal investigator.&#xD;
