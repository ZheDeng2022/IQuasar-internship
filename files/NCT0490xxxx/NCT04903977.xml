    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to confirm the clinical performance and safety of impedance&#xD;
      spectroscopy using the ONIRY device for the detection of anal sphincter injuries arising from&#xD;
      vaginal deliveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group comprises 150 primiparous or multiparous women up to 8 weeks after the&#xD;
      vaginal (spontaneous or assisted) delivery of singleton, live foetus, in any presentation, in&#xD;
      gestational week 34 or more. The timeline for each subject in the study will be up to 5 weeks&#xD;
      and will include 3 visits (V1-V3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be divided into 3 groups: A, B, C. Group A - subjects with no perineal&#xD;
      tear signs, Group B - subjects with grade 1 or 2 per OASIS classification, and Group C -&#xD;
      subjects with grade 3 or 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic performance will be evaluated in comparison to 3-D EUS (endoanal ultrasound)&#xD;
      as a primary performance measure (primary endpoint).&#xD;

      The main purpose of the study is to confirm the clinical performance and safety of impedance&#xD;
      spectroscopy using the ONIRY device for the detection of anal sphincter injuries arising from&#xD;
      vaginal deliveries. The whole study is divided into 2 parts. Part I is a clinical trial;&#xD;
      after completion of Part I, an analytical classification model will be established (during&#xD;
      Part II) based on data from pilot studies and Part I of the study. It will be then built into&#xD;
      the ONIRY Meter as a machine-learning-based interpretation module; proposed for ultimate&#xD;
      marketing authorisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I of the study will be prospective, multicentre, international. The study group&#xD;
      comprises 150 primiparous or multiparous women up to 8 weeks after the vaginal (spontaneous&#xD;
      or assisted) delivery of singleton, live foetus, in any presentation, in gestational week 34&#xD;
      or more. The timeline for each subject in the study will be up to 5 weeks and will include 3&#xD;
      visits (V1-V3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining written consent, at the first study visit (V1) each patient will undergo a&#xD;
      general physical examination, proctological and gynaecological examination, ECG recording,&#xD;
      3-D EUS (endoanal ultrasound, used as a reference and for the study group allocation) and&#xD;
      once V1 visit is conducted 3 or more days after delivery Wexner score will be used to assess&#xD;
      the clinical symptoms of faecal incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the physical proctological examination and EUS at the V1 visit, all participants&#xD;
      will be divided into 3 groups: A, B, C. Group A - subjects with no perineal tear signs, Group&#xD;
      B - subjects with the presence of perineal skin injury or perineum injury involving crotch&#xD;
      muscles but not involving anal sphincters (grade 1 or 2 per OASIS classification) and Group C&#xD;
      - subjects with the presence of perineal injury involving anal sphincters (damage of the&#xD;
      external anal sphincter thickness, damage to both the external and internal anal sphincters,&#xD;
      or damage to the perineum, anal sphincteric complex and anal epithelium; grade 3-4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the visit V2 performed on the same day as V1 or scheduled up to 7 days after the V1, after&#xD;
      the final verification of inclusion/exclusion criteria, blood samples for laboratory tests&#xD;
      and stool samples for calprotectin concentration assessment will be collected, ONIRY&#xD;
      recording will be made, 10 minutes after the end of the impedance measurement 12-lead ECG&#xD;
      recording will also be performed in each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the third visit (V3) 1-28 days after visit V2, high-resolution Anorectal Manometry will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No control group is planned. However, study participants will be controls for themselves&#xD;
      (test and reference diagnostic methods will be applied and evaluated in each subject).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part I of the study, the ONIRY system will provide only preliminary interpretations of the&#xD;
      impedance measurements based on models established from the data collected during Pilot&#xD;
      Studies No. 1/1/2018 (NCT03769792) and No. 2/1/2019 (NCT04181840). The web-based app will be&#xD;
      used to provide the interpretations.&#xD;
