  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary study objective is to generate evidence as to the feasibility, usability,&#xD;
      perceived value, and potential benefits of implementing the AMAZE™ platform into clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AstraZeneca has developed the AMAZE™ disease management platform to be used across multiple&#xD;
      disease indications to provide a unified experience for the management of patients throughout&#xD;
      their patient care journey. AMAZE™ integrates multiple systems, including a patient mobile&#xD;
      application where patients can enter daily symptoms and impact to communicate this&#xD;
      information to their healthcare provider, as well as access disease educational materials.&#xD;
      Implementation of AMAZE™ within clinical practice has not yet been evaluated. The results&#xD;
      from this study will be used to inform any changes or modifications that need to be made to&#xD;
      the technology platform, its implementation process, and explore impact on clinical outcomes.&#xD;
