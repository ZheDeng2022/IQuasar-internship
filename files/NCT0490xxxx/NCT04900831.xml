    <textblock>
      To validate omnipolar mapping in a well-described circuit within the heart (Atrial Flutter)&#xD;
      and compare it with the gold standard of Local Activation Time (LAT) mapping during routine,&#xD;
      clinically indicated procedures of Atrial Flutter ablation. A conventional, LAT map will be&#xD;
      created during the procedure, prior to treatment, to guide the procedure. A repeat map will&#xD;
      be performed after ablation during the procedure. We will export the map files for off-line&#xD;
      analysis with the omnipolar software.&#xD;

      Electroanatomical mapping of the chambers of the heart has revolutionised the way we treat&#xD;
      heart rhythm disorders. However, there still are technical limitations that prevent us from&#xD;
      gathering information that could be used to understand and treat these abnormal circuits in&#xD;
      more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard technique in creating electrical maps of the heart in stable circuits is&#xD;
      the Local Activation Time (LAT) map. This map is formed by using a stable electrical point&#xD;
      (one of the electrode catheters within the heart - plastic tubes with metallic sensors at the&#xD;
      end) as a zero point and then collecting electrical data from around the heart based on&#xD;
      timings off of that point. This data is then loaded on a licenced software that creates the&#xD;
      map. These maps are very useful in creating electrical maps of the heart in relatively stable&#xD;
      electrical circuits and can give us information on how the electrical current travels through&#xD;
      the heart tissue. These are widely used in guiding ablation by helping us locate areas to&#xD;
      ablate (apply local radiofrequency and burn part of the circuit, deactivating it).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In more unstable circuits, such as in Atrial Fibrillation (chaotic electrical activity at the&#xD;
      top left chamber of the heart), there are a lot of limitations of this technology as the&#xD;
      electrical current changes from heart beat to heart beat and there is no stable zero point In&#xD;
      the circuit to &quot;anchor&quot; the map in time. In these situations real-time map creation with&#xD;
      local electrical currents would be ideal as it would help us see the direction the electrical&#xD;
      wave front travels in real time. Our current electrical catheters have certain limitations&#xD;
      which mainly have to do with difficulty in local electrical discrimination and detection of&#xD;
      the orientation of the electrical current in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Advisor HD Grid catheter by Abbott UK can overcome this hurdle. It has a special&#xD;
      electrode configuration (4 by 4) that creates 9 distinct anatomical spaces within the&#xD;
      catheter grid that can &quot;triangulate&quot; micro current direction in real time (omnipolar&#xD;
      mapping). This will greatly enhance our ability to quickly detect electrical wave fronts in&#xD;
      unstable circuits such as Atrial Fibrillation which will lead to better understanding of the&#xD;
      arrhythmia and identify targets for treatment quickly and efficiently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to first validate the robustness of omnipolar mapping in a well-described, stable&#xD;
      circuit such as Atrial Flutter, and compare it to the gold standard of LAT mapping. This will&#xD;
      then help pave the way for use of this technology in more complex circuits, such as Atrial&#xD;
      Fibrillation.&#xD;
