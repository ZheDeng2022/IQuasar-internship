  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll subjects with stage 2 or 3 neurotrophic keratitis. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the CSB-001 investigational treatment arm or vehicle control&#xD;
      arm. All subjects will dose with the randomized treatment four times daily for 8 weeks&#xD;
      (controlled treatment phase). During the controlled treatment phase, subjects will return to&#xD;
      the clinic weekly from Day 0 to Week 8, and again at Week 10. Subjects randomized to the&#xD;
      vehicle arm who are not healed will have the opportunity to participate in an open-label&#xD;
      uncontrolled treatment phase.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with stage 2 (PED) or stage 3 (corneal ulcer) NK. Subjects with bilateral NK&#xD;
             may enroll in the study but only one eye will be selected as the study eye (worse eye)&#xD;
             and be treated with test article. The non-study eye may not be treated with Oxervate&#xD;
             concurrently.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with no clinical evidence of improvement in the PED or corneal ulcer within&#xD;
             the 2 weeks prior to study enrollment despite the use of conventional non-surgical&#xD;
             treatments for neurotrophic keratitis (e.g., preservative-free artificial tears, gels&#xD;
             or ointments; discontinuation of preserved topical drops and medications that can&#xD;
             decrease corneal sensitivity; therapeutic contact lenses [either silicone hydrogel or&#xD;
             rigid gas permeable]) as determined by the investigator or referring physician's&#xD;
             medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with clinical evidence of decreased corneal sensitivity within the area of&#xD;
             the PED or corneal ulcer and outside of the area of the defect in at least one corneal&#xD;
             quadrant in the study eye in the opinion of the investigator (assessed with a cotton&#xD;
             wisp, or the Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer if available at the site).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) score ≤ 75 ETDRS letters measured with a&#xD;
             LogMAR chart (≥ 0.2 LogMAR, ≤ 20/32 Snellen or ≤ 0.625 decimal fraction) in the&#xD;
             affected eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have the ability and willingness to comply with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any active ocular infection (bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoal) or active ocular&#xD;
             inflammation not related to NK in either eye in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
             Infectious epithelial keratitis including herpetic keratitis (i.e., dendritic lesions&#xD;
             or geographic ulcers) in either eye is excluded. Subjects on oral antibiotic at the&#xD;
             time of screening are eligible but should continue the medication for the duration of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous use of Oxervate in the study eye within the past 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other ocular disease that will require topical ocular treatment in the study eye&#xD;
             over the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Monocular subject (subjects with one functioning eye defined as having any ocular&#xD;
             pathology that results in a pinhole distance visual acuity 20/100 or worse [Snellen]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any other topical treatments other than the study medications provided by the&#xD;
             Sponsor and allowed by the study protocol can be administered to the study eye over&#xD;
             the course of the study. Subjects will be required to instill once-daily prophylactic&#xD;
             preservative-free antibiotic eye drops starting on Day 0 until the defect is healed.&#xD;
&#xD;
