  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a sensation of discomfort, annoyance or distress, described as an unpleasant&#xD;
      subjective sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential injury, and&#xD;
      may associate vegetative, psychological, emotional, and behavioral responses. It is the main&#xD;
      reason for medical consultation and in many cases it is assumed as inevitable. It is also a&#xD;
      clinical symptom and generates negative consequences. As a result, people who suffer from&#xD;
      &quot;pain&quot; may see their quality of life diminished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On many occasions, either due to the high healthcare burden, because pain is not the reason&#xD;
      for consultation or because the main pathology suffered by the patient is not the cause of&#xD;
      the pain, not attention is given to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of pain in the inpatient&#xD;
      population, analyzing its presence and intensity in patients admitted to the Doctor Negrín&#xD;
      University Hospital of Gran Canaria. Likewise, it is interesting to know what percentage of&#xD;
      patients with pain have analgesics and the degree of relief with the treatment received. As a&#xD;
      secondary objective, it is intended to establish whether there is a relationship between&#xD;
      factors dependent on the patient and the presence of pain.&#xD;

      Pain is a sensation of discomfort, annoyance or distress, described as an unpleasant&#xD;
      subjective sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential injury, and&#xD;
      may associate vegetative, psychological, emotional, and behavioral responses. It is the main&#xD;
      reason for medical consultation and in many cases it is assumed as inevitable. It is also a&#xD;
      clinical symptom and generates negative consequences. As a result, people who suffer from&#xD;
      &quot;pain&quot; may see their quality of life diminished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its appearance requires a multidisciplinary treatment, from different perspectives and&#xD;
      through different mechanisms, taking into account the individual characteristics of each&#xD;
      patient; since this symptom can be modified which today are not strictly described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On many occasions, either due to the high healthcare burden, because pain is not the reason&#xD;
      for consultation or because the main pathology suffered by the patient is not the cause of&#xD;
      the pain, not attention is given to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is necessary to carry out a good questionnaire to the patient and take into account the&#xD;
      presence or absence of pain, regardless of the primary pathology that concerns us, in order&#xD;
      to be able to provide correct attention. Pain control may greatly vary the patient's vision&#xD;
      of his ailment and with it, his psycho-emotional state, his attitude and his collaboration,&#xD;
      reducing the impact on his quality of life and the duration of hospital admission.&#xD;
