  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in the severity of disease as measured by the Investigator's Global Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator's Global Assessment will be performed at study visits 2-6. The IGA is an instrument to rate the severity of the subject's global disease. This IGA is comprised of a 5-point scale of disease activity ranging from 0 to 4 as follows: 0: &quot;clear,&quot; no erythema or scale&#xD;
&quot;almost clear,&quot; pink erythema without scale&#xD;
&quot;mild,&quot; pink erythema with scale&#xD;
&quot;moderate,&quot; red erythema with scale&#xD;
&quot;severe,&quot; purple/violaceous or hemorrhagic/crusted erythema OR hypertrophic/ verrucous scale&#xD;
Range of scores are 0-4 with higher scores indicating worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean percentage change in disease activity as measured by the Cutaneous Lupus Area and Severity Index-A (CLASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Cutaneous Lupus Area and Severity Index (CLASI) will be performed at study visits 2-6. This is a validated measurement instrument designed for use in clinical trials to assess disease activity and damage in subjects with cutaneous lupus. The CLASI is comprised of two parts, CLASI-A that measures disease activity (erythema and scale), and CLASI-D that measures disease damage (pigmentation and scarring).&#xD;
CLASI-A scores range from 0 to 70 with higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in itch symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will maintain a symptom diary every day for 12 weeks. Specifically, subjects will rate pain and itch separately using a numeric rating scale (NRS) and the questions below. Symptom diaries will be reviewed at study visits 2-6. &quot;On a scale of &quot;no itch&quot; (0) to &quot;worst imaginable itch&quot; (10), how was your worst itch in the 24 hours?&quot;&#xD;
Scores will range from 0-10 with higher scores indicating worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Mean change in pain symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will maintain a symptom diary every day for 12 weeks. Specifically, subjects will rate pain and itch separately using a numeric rating scale (NRS) and the questions below. Symptom diaries will be reviewed at study visits 2-6.&#xD;
&quot;On a scale of &quot;no skin pain&quot; (0) to &quot;worst imaginable skin pain&quot; (10), how was your worst skin pain in the 24 hours?&quot;&#xD;
Scores will range from 0-10 with higher scores indicating worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in melanin index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Photographs of all discoid lesions will be taken at study visits 2-6. The Haiku app will be used to directly load photos into the secure Epic medical record system. Images will be extracted from Epic, and analyzed. In brief, a melanin index (MI) will be generated for each lesion using Image J software analysis. The measurement will be a ratio comparing the pigmentation of the lesion to non-lesion skin. The analysis uses perilesional skin to normalize the photograph.&#xD;
Measurements will range from 0 to 10. Scores further from a score of 1 will indicate more severe outcomes.</description>
