  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the outcomes of coverage of soft tissue defects of leg&#xD;
      and foot by modified sural flap versus anterolateral thigh flap&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The leg and foot contain a thin subcutaneous layer and few muscles, thus the tibia and&#xD;
      tendons can easily become exposed due to trauma. Therefore leg and foot injuries are often&#xD;
      associated with a loss of soft tissues and exposed fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      one of the following reconstructive options are chosen:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The defect is allowed to heal by secondary intention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The wound is closed primarily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A split or full thickness skin graft and or neodermis is applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A local random flap or propeller flap is transposed or advanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A pedicled or island flap is transferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A microvascular free flap is transferred. The method of soft tissue reconstruction&#xD;
           chosen hinges on the patient's medical condition, the surgeon's experience, the size of&#xD;
           the wound, the vascular status of the foot and the exposed structures the skin in this&#xD;
           region has low flexibility and the subcutaneous circulation does not allow the use of&#xD;
           long randomized flaps, the task of finding flaps to cover bones or tendons in wounds&#xD;
           with cutaneous loss in the legs and feet is difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sural flap acts as an axial flap and has 3 sources of nutrition,the vascular plexus of&#xD;
      the deep fascia, the medial superficial sural artery which follows the medial sural nerve and&#xD;
      the arteries that follow the minor saphenous vein. Venous return is ensured by the minor&#xD;
      saphenous vein which may be used as a distal pedicle to provide reverse flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sural flap has the advantages of easy and quick harvesting without sacrificing major arteries&#xD;
      and can be done in one stage operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the other hand,Since introduction of the anterolateral thigh flap in 1984 by Song et al it&#xD;
      has gained widespread popularity, especially in Asian countries, where it has replaced the&#xD;
      radial forearm flap as being the workhorse in head and neck surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterolateral thigh flaps have been introduced also in lower extremity reconstruction.&#xD;
