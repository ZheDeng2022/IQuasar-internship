      Aim: to collect further information on issues related to tobacco control which should be&#xD;
      addressed and advocated in further tobacco control measures in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this policy-related survey by online panel are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to update information on prevalence of conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes, heated&#xD;
           tobacco products and waterpipe tobaccos;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to investigate the effects of new pictorial health warning policy in the public;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to investigate the level of public support on current and future tobacco control&#xD;
           measures and taxation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to address the timely impacts of smoke-free policies, public support for further tobacco&#xD;
           control measures and assist COSH in shaping policy direction for government;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current study is a repeated cross-sectional online survey based on questionnaires. A total of&#xD;
      2 waves of survey will be conducted 4 months apart starting from early 2021. The target&#xD;
      sample size in each wave of survey is planned to be 900 Hong Kong residents. The online&#xD;
      survey will be conducted by a survey agent under the monitor of applicants. All eligible&#xD;
      registered members of the survey agent panel will be invited to respond to the questionnaire.&#xD;
      Once a member responded to the first wave of this study, he/she would no longer receive&#xD;
      invitation for the subsequent wave. All responses will be kept anonymously. Analysis of&#xD;
      survey data will aim to identify current opinion on tobacco control policies and implications&#xD;
      for future policies. All eligible subjects who complete the online survey will be included in&#xD;
      the analysis. Comparison with past trends conducted by landline and mobile phone surveys and,&#xD;
      where possible, extrapolation of future trends will be explored. Weightings will be applied&#xD;
      to adjust for the sex and age of Hong Kong population, and to handle the over-sampling issues&#xD;
      of ex- and current smokers. The data analysis will be conducted by experienced statisticians&#xD;
      in the applicants' team.&#xD;
