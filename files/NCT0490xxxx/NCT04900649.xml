  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a life-threatening condition with long-term&#xD;
      complications including respiratory tract infections, respiratory muscle weakness, and&#xD;
      abnormal lung functions. This study, therefore, has been designed to ascertain the effect of&#xD;
      chest resistance exercise and chest expansion exercise on respiratory muscle strength, lung&#xD;
      function, and chest mobility in children with post-operative CDH.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the advances in surgical and neonatal treatment, the survival rates in children with CDH&#xD;
      have been improved in the last decades. The surviving children may suffer from long-term&#xD;
      complications such as impairments in lung growth (lung hypoplasia), cardiovascular disorders,&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension, gastrointestinal problems, and recurrent occurrence of lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract infection. One of the physical therapy techniques used to treat chest&#xD;
      disorders via encouraging the normal alignment of respiratory muscles with respiratory rhythm&#xD;
      is chest resistance exercise through applying resistance to the sternal and coastal areas .&#xD;

    <description>the study group has conducted chest resisted exercise combined with chest expansion exercise in addition to a usual chest physiotherapy. For chest resistance exercise, the children in the study group underwent sequential 12-week chest resistance exercise and chest expansion exercise, three sessions a week. Chest resistance exercises have been consisted of manual resistance exercise and resistance exercise via POWER breath KH2.</description>
