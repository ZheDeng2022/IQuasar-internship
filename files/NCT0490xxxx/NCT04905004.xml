  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Canine retraction after 1st premolar extracion into the extraction space is a routine&#xD;
      treatment in orthodontics. Orthodontic patients requiring first premolar extraction, canine&#xD;
      retraction and maximum anchorage were recruited for this randomized controlled trial. A&#xD;
      search of the literature did not indicate the ideal frequency of elastomeric chain&#xD;
      reactivation for optimum canine retraction. The study was approved by the ethical committee.&#xD;
      The first premolars were extracted. Elastomeric chains were used to retract the canine&#xD;
      distally into the 1st premolar space. The optimum reactivation interval was evaluated&#xD;
      regarding the efficiency of treatment in terms of rate of canine retraction, canine tipping&#xD;
      and rotation, root resorption and pain at the intervals of 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks. Three&#xD;
      dimensional imaging, as well as digital scanning were the methods for data collection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The canines, 2nd premolars, 1st molars and 2nd molars were bonded and banded. Leveling and&#xD;
      alignment was achieved. After the first premolar extraction, temporary anchorage devices were&#xD;
      inserted interradicular between 2nd premolar and 1st molar. Canine retraction was performed&#xD;
      on a 0.016&quot; X 0.022&quot; stainless steel arch wire. A power arm was extended to apply the force&#xD;
      closer to the center of resistance and achieve bodily movement. Elastomeric chains were&#xD;
      calibrated to deliver a force of 150g and extended from the power arm to the mini screws&#xD;
      directly. Recruited patients were randomly allocated to four groups according to the duration&#xD;
      between the elastomeric chain reactivation. Canine reactivation intervals were 2, 4, 6, or 8&#xD;
      weeks. Cone beam computed tomography was performed before canine retraction and after 6&#xD;
      months of retraction. Digital dental casts were taken before canine retraction and monthly&#xD;
      for 6 months.&#xD;
