    <description>The entire duration of the study, including the screening period, will be approximately 16 weeks. Mindera Kit will be applied with applicator and left on the skin for 5 minutes, and once removed, the investigational product (IP) will be placed in a buffer solution, sealed, labeled and sent to Mindera for processing.</description>
