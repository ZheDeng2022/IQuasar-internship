    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study with Amorphous Calcium Carbonate (ACC) administered sublingual and&#xD;
      in Inhalation concomitantly with BAT (Best Available Care) as Compared to Placebo and BAT for&#xD;
      the treatment of Moderate to Severe COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this study is to assess&#xD;
      the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Amorphous Calcium Carbonate (ACC).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study includes two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 - A training period of a single arm active treatment open label, to assess the optimal&#xD;
      method of study drug administration, as well as the safety of the combined administration, on&#xD;
      5 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following DSMB review of the data collected in part 1 and the DSMB approval to proceed to&#xD;
      next part, part 2 will be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 - A randomized (1:1) placebo controlled 2 arms study. Additional 95 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited to this arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are hospitalized due to moderate or severe COVID-19 will be recruited to this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following elements are the main elements that will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Confirmation SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Respiratory Function (breathing rate, SpO2 Oxygen Saturation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vital Signs (BP, HR), Temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood Tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Disease Severity Scale (8 points ordinal scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole study period per patient will be 22 days (21 treatment days) or until the patient&#xD;
      has recovered and/or is discharged from the hospital, whichever comes first.&#xD;
