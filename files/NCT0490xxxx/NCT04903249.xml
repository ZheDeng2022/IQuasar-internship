    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants receive instructions to adjust their pace of exercise so that they feel &quot;fairly good&quot; or better (i.e., a rating of +1 or higher on the Feeling Scale) while exercising and to avoid any increases in intensity that promote feeling &quot;fairly bad&quot; or worse. If no intensity of exercise feels at least &quot;fairly good&quot; participants will be told to exercise at an intensity that feels &quot;as positive as possible.&quot;</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Core Exercise Promotion Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants are instructed to increase weekly time spent exercising to &gt;90 minutes over 12 weeks. Exercise will be defined as &quot;activities that use large muscle groups, increase heart rate and breathing rate, and are performed intentionally for the purpose of exercise (as opposed to physical activities of daily living, e.g., housework). Participants complete a videoconferencing visit with the study team and are given task and safety related information pertaining to exercise for survivors of cancer. Participants engage in exercise-related goal-setting and action planning and are provided activity trackers to monitor their activity levels over the 12-week study period.</description>
