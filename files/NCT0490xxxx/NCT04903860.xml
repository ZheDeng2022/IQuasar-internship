  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to compare the use of single-use ancillary reaming&#xD;
      material during total hip replacement and conventional reusable ancillary reaming material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment will focus on the medico-economic differences found in this prospective&#xD;
      randomized study&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In orthopaedics, the ancillary equipment is a generic term that includes all the instruments&#xD;
      necessary for hip replacement surgery. The surgeon remains very dependent on these boxes of&#xD;
      instruments, including rasps, reamers and trial implants (stems and trial heads), which are&#xD;
      required in THR. Each instrument set is generally packaged in 2 or 3 boxes and each surgeon&#xD;
      has a limited number of instrument sets at his disposal per operating day. Each ancillary&#xD;
      device has a purchase cost, a maintenance cost (paid by the laboratories or distributors) and&#xD;
      a sterilization cost, (paid by the health care institutions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-use reamers are instruments that are used on a single patient and then discarded.&#xD;
      Performance and safety of use are optimized by providing a sterile and new product for each&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it seems judicious to compare the medico-economic differences between the use of&#xD;
      single-use reamers versus reusable reamers within a classic ancillary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the costs incurred, the waste produced, the operating time, the&#xD;
      satisfaction of the surgeon after the use of single-use reamers during total hip replacement,&#xD;
      versus conventional re-sterilizable ancillary and verify the equivalence, three months after&#xD;
      surgery, of clinical and radiological results.&#xD;

    <description>The patients were evaluated by the Modified Merle d'Aubigné and Postel Method, which evaluates pain, gait and mobility, on a scale of 1 to 6 for each item, where 1 indicates the worst and 6, the best state of the patient. The total minimum score reached is 3, and the maximum is 18.</description>

    <measure>Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pré-opérative examination / At 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument has 10 items in 3 sections describing pain, function, range of motion, and deformity. The first section is questionnaire-based, answered by the patient, and includes impairments and activities. The second and third sections are administered by the therapist or physician, and include leg length measurement and range of motion (ROM) measures of the hip (flexion, abduction, external rotation and adduction). Each item has a unique numerical scale that corresponds to descriptive response options. The highest possible score is 100, with a higher score indicating less dysfunction.</description>

    <description>Devane score: The purpose of this score is to specify the patient's activity level preoperatively. Initially established by Devane, it allows a classification of each patient in 5 categories from sedentary to athletic Charnley score: This is a commonly used score designed to assess the patient's overall disability in relation to gait function. It was published by Charnley and distinguishes patients into 3 categories</description>

    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) is a widely used, proprietary set of standardized questionnaires used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of hip, including five items for pain (score range 0-20), two for stiffness (score range 0-8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0-68).</description>

    <measure>HOOS score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pré-opérative examination / At 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS) is a questionnaire intended to be used to assess the patient's opinion about their hip and associated problems and to evaluate symptoms and functional limitations related to the hip during a therapeutic process. To interpret the score, the outcome measure is transformed in a worst to best scale from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms.</description>
