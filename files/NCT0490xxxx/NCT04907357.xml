  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine feasibility of repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) for individuals with moderate to severe cocaine or methamphetamine use&#xD;
      disorder (CUD/MUD). Potential participants will be age 18-65, and interested in cutting down&#xD;
      or stopping use. Participants will be randomized to one of two groups; groups will receive&#xD;
      rTMS or sham rTMS (placebo) over the course of an 8-week treatment period, and complete&#xD;
      follow-up assessments at the end of treatment, 12, and 16 weeks post-randomization.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial comparing rTMS vs.&#xD;
      placebo delivered over an 8-week treatment period. After assessment and inclusion into the&#xD;
      study, participants will be randomized to receive up to 30 sessions of either rTMS or placebo&#xD;
      treatments. The target minimum number of rTMS/placebo treatments is 20 treatments over 8&#xD;
      weeks. The secondary objective is to gather preliminary data on the efficacy of rTMS for&#xD;
      individuals with moderate to severe CUD or MUD. Follow-up visits occur at end of treatment&#xD;
      and at 12- and 16-weeks following randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actigraphy: To assess daily sleep quality during weeks 1-8, the ActiGraph wristband device&#xD;
      will record, sleep latency, sleep duration, and intervals of waking during the sleep period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalography (EEG): EEG will be obtained after randomization and again at week 4,&#xD;
      to explore the potential for EEG to be used as a biomarker of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive-Behavioral Educational Intervention: Participants in both conditions (rTMS and&#xD;
      placebo) will be encouraged to participate in a mobile app-based educational intervention&#xD;
      based on principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Substance Use Disorder (SUD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily Assessments: Brief, electronic remote surveys will be administered to participants&#xD;
      daily until week 16 follow-up time point and will assess use of primary substance of abuse,&#xD;
      craving, ability to resist use, overall mood, and self-rated sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine Drug Screens (UDS): UDS will be collected at screening, randomization, every treatment&#xD;
      session, and at follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine pregnancy tests: Pregnancy testing for all female participants will be performed at&#xD;
      screening, randomization, and monthly during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam: A physical exam will be performed at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: A battery of study assessments will be completed to further inform findings&#xD;
      regarding feasibility and effects of rTMS on individuals with stimulant use disorders.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The lead investigator will submit coded individual level data on Clinical Trials Network (CTN) study participants to the Data Management Center contracted by National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Center for CTN. These data may include but are not limited to: demographic information, date of birth, medical history, substance use history, psychiatric history, objective measures of substance use and psychiatric status, HIV status and genetic information. Data will be submitted without information that could readily identify the study participant (i.e. We will not share medical record numbers, social security numbers or participant names or phone numbers with the Data Management Center).
