  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial will be performed to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of a probiotic containing Lactobacillus reuteri in improving post-surgical wound&#xD;
      healing after impacted tooth extractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of L. reuteri in improving post-extractive&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of L. reuteri in association with an antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy (amoxicillin) in reducing the incidence and severity of antibiotic-associated&#xD;
      gastro-intestinal symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics are defined by the World Health Organization as &quot;live microorganisms which, when&#xD;
      administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.&quot; Human microbiome is a&#xD;
      complex system that contributes to maintaining a good health status in humans. Broad-spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotic therapies act against pathogen bacteria but also affect the intestinal microbiome,&#xD;
      leading to different side effects such as abdominal pain, gastric pain, nausea, vomit and&#xD;
      diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of probiotics has been advocated as a possible means in reducing intensity and&#xD;
      incidence of the symptoms related to antibiotic therapies. Some probiotics like Lactobacillus&#xD;
      reuteri (L. reuteri) showed good anti-inflammatory properties and also antimicrobic action,&#xD;
      assuming a possible role in wound healing processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have been conducted on the use of L. reuteri in dentistry. Twetman et al. (2018)&#xD;
      conducted a trial to assess the efficacy of L. reuteri in improving post-surgical healing in&#xD;
      the oral cavity after a punch biopsy, showing promising results. The authors concluded that&#xD;
      larger trials may be useful to better clarify the role of probiotics in oral wounds healing.&#xD;
      The only data regarding the possible role of L. reuteri in post- extractive healing comes&#xD;
      from a pilot study (Walivara at al. 2019) that showed a reduction of the perceived swelling&#xD;
      and of the number of disturbed-sleep nights in patients who underwent impacted-tooth&#xD;
      extraction and assumed L. reuteri. Authors concluded that larger trials with closer follow-up&#xD;
      visits are required to fully understand the clinical correlation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the present research is to evaluate the efficacy of a probiotic containing&#xD;
      L. reuteri in improving post-surgical healing following impacted tooth extractions and the&#xD;
      secondary aim is to investigate its possible role in preventing or reducing gastro-intestinal&#xD;
      side effects related to post-operative antibiotic therapy.A Randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trial will be performed to evaluate the efficacy of L. reuteri in&#xD;
      improving post-extractive healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who need impacted tooth extractions at University Hospital of Pisa (Operative&#xD;
      Unit of Odontostomatology and Oral Surgery) will be considered eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients to include is set to 160, divided in two experimental groups (80&#xD;
      patients per group). Patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
