      In this project, after systematically developing electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS)&#xD;
      pictorial health warning labels (HWLs), a proven clinical lab model will be used to examine&#xD;
      and test their effect when these are placed on the ENDS device on a variety of subjective&#xD;
      (e.g. satisfaction, harm perception, nicotine dependence, intention to quit) and objective&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g. plasma nicotine, puff topography) in young adults.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS or e-cigarettes) has reached epidemic&#xD;
      levels among young people in the United States (US). ENDS emit toxic substances, including&#xD;
      nicotine that irreversibly affects youth's developing brain leading to dependence and&#xD;
      increased risk of cigarette smoking initiation, yet misperceptions about their safety are&#xD;
      widespread. Therefore, health communication of ENDS-related risks through Health Warning&#xD;
      Labels (HWLs) has been considered as a priority by leading health and regulatory bodies in&#xD;
      the US to reduce ENDS use among young people. The FIU Epidemiology Clinical Tobacco Research&#xD;
      Lab has developed and pilot-tested a clinical lab model to examine the potential effects of&#xD;
      pictorial HWLs on young (21-29 yrs) ENDS users' experiences. In this proposal, this model,&#xD;
      coupled with a systematic development of ENDS pictorial HWLs, will be used to test their&#xD;
      effect when they are placed on the device on a variety of subjective (e.g. satisfaction, harm&#xD;
      perception, nicotine dependence, intention to quit) and objective outcomes (e.g. plasma&#xD;
      nicotine, puff topography). This will be done in three stages. First, the literature will be&#xD;
      reviewed to develop candidate messages and their associated pictures for the HWLs. This&#xD;
      initial set of HWLs will then be revised and ranked through a Delphi study among tobacco&#xD;
      control, regulation, and health communication experts. Second, focus groups with young ENDS&#xD;
      (21-29 yrs) users will be conducted to adapt the candidate HWLs to our target population and&#xD;
      device itself. Third, HWLs on the ENDS device will be tested in a clinical lab cross-over&#xD;
      study, where each subject uses ENDS in 2 sessions; 1) their preferred product without HWL&#xD;
      (control), and 2) their preferred product with pictorial HWL on the ENDS device. This design&#xD;
      will test our main hypothesis; compared to control, using ENDS with the HWLs is associated&#xD;
      with decreased satisfaction, dependence suppression, and puffing behavior, but increased&#xD;
      knowledge about harm and intention to quit. This project will guide policymakers into the&#xD;
      application of effective HWLs for ENDS and will develop warning messages and pictorials that&#xD;
      national and state stakeholders can use through different modalities in counter-marketing&#xD;
      campaigns to protect young people and discourage harmful ENDS use.&#xD;
