  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded clinical feasibility study of&#xD;
      subjects that are being treated for Type II or IIIA or IIIB Tibial Fractures&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, controlled, double-arm, double-blinded, randomized clinical study of&#xD;
      30 subjects that are undergoing single stage surgical repair of Type II or IIIA or IIIB&#xD;
      tibial fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval is required before the site can begin enrolling&#xD;
      patients. Additionally, protocol amendments need to be approved by the IRB prior to starting&#xD;
      any changes or procedures stemming from the amended protocol. Potentially eligible patients&#xD;
      will be offered study enrollment and all subjects are required to participate in the informed&#xD;
      consent process and sign the most recent IRB-approved written informed consent document prior&#xD;
      to being enrolled in the study. If all the study inclusion/exclusion criteria are met,&#xD;
      patients will be presented with the option to participate in the study and informed consent&#xD;
      procedures will be carried out, in compliance with currently applicable subjects' rights and&#xD;
      safety regulations. Reconsenting procedures for cases of protocol amendments will be&#xD;
      performed in compliance with the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who present for open tibial fracture repair surgery will have a pre-op medical&#xD;
      evaluation prior to being screened against the protocol's inclusion/exclusion criteria. If&#xD;
      criteria are met, patients will be presented with the option to participate in the study, and&#xD;
      informed consent procedures will be carried out, in compliance with currently applicable&#xD;
      participants' rights and safety regulations. At the time of surgery, participants determined&#xD;
      to require surgical repair of a Type IIIC tibial fracture will be excluded. Patients who&#xD;
      continue to be eligible meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria at the time of surgery will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of the two treatment arms: SOC with Saline or SOC plus Next Science&#xD;
      treatment. The treatment assignment will be predetermined by a randomization plan within&#xD;
      Castor Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. Although, paper source documents will be used to&#xD;
      obtain subject data, randomization will be primarily through the EDC system. As a back-up,&#xD;
      should the EDC system be unavailable at that time, randomization will occur using a sealed&#xD;
      envelope system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following must have occurred prior to determining treatment assignment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant must meet all eligibility requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed Consent must be signed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continued Eligibility screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization must occur*&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Randomization occurs prior to surgery based on Exclusion #8. If the index fractures&#xD;
                are bilateral, right leg will be randomized while the other leg will be assigned to&#xD;
                the opposite treatment arm to prevent dosing of identical products on one subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once surgical evaluation occurs if the index fracture is determined to be Type II, IIIA or&#xD;
      IIIB (that does not require referral to another surgical service [vascular, plastic surgery]&#xD;
      ) then the subject will continue to dosing. If the index fracture(s) must receive additional&#xD;
      surgical referrals they will not be dosed, considered a screen failure, and exited from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient fails to meet continued eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screen Failure and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Exit forms must be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate recording of the information per section 9.3 is critical for the traceability of&#xD;
      treatment and product to a participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of each subjects' participation once eligible and approved to start treatment,&#xD;
      will start from Day 1 (first index surgery) and end at the Day 90 Visit. On-site visits will&#xD;
      be carried out at Screening/Enrollment; Day of Surgery; Day of Discharge; and Days 14, 30,&#xD;
      and 90; consisting of safety, bone healing (via X-ray findings), bioburden assessment, and&#xD;
      surgical site infection assessment questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key parameters of the study include bioburden and surgical site infection assessment,&#xD;
      re-admission assessment, serious adverse events, and healthcare cost impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial identification and quantification will be evaluated via two methods: PCR/NGS&#xD;
      (according to this protocol) and microbiology/pathology (according to site SOC). PCR/NGS&#xD;
      swabs will be taken after fracture fixation inside the wound and then around the closed&#xD;
      surgical incision:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After fracture fixation (deep tissue): Swabs will be performed right after fracture&#xD;
           fixation, before blinded rinse, and then immediately after blinded irrigation. The swabs&#xD;
           will be performed on the entire wound base and around the fixation device. The time of&#xD;
           collection for each swab must be specific (hour and minute) and recorded on the specimen&#xD;
           label and requisition form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After closed surgical incision (superficial): After final closure, swabs will be taken&#xD;
           within the 1-2cm perimeter surrounding the entire incision. This will be repeated on the&#xD;
           day of discharge. The time of collection for each swab must be specific (hour and&#xD;
           minute) and recorded on the specimen label and requisition form.&#xD;
