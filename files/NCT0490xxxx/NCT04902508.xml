    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial that uses a Sequential Multiple Assignment&#xD;
      Randomized Trial (SMART) study design. The study will directly compare the efficacy of an&#xD;
      innovative intervention that combines explicit and implicit approaches to a traditional&#xD;
      implicit treatment approach to teach true grammatical forms to children with developmental&#xD;
      language disorder (DLD). The study will also compare interventions that include sequences of&#xD;
      Explicit-added and Implicit-only treatments. Participants will include 5- through 8-year-old&#xD;
      children with DLD who present with significant grammatical weaknesses. In Phase 1, 155&#xD;
      participants will be randomized 1:1 to an Explicit-added treatment group or an Implicit-only&#xD;
      treatment group. Each participant will complete 32 sessions targeting four unique grammatical&#xD;
      forms (8 sessions/form). In Phase 2, &quot;Masters&quot; will be re-randomized to receive no treatment&#xD;
      32 sessions of the same treatment, or 32 sessions of the alternative treatment. &quot;Non-Masters&quot;&#xD;
      will be re-randomized to receive 32 additional sessions of the same treatment or 32 sessions&#xD;
      of the alternative treatment. Performance will be measured on acquisition, maintenance, and&#xD;
      generalization probes obtained immediately,1-, 6-, and 12- months post-intervention. The&#xD;
      SMART study design will be used to determine if child factors, including expressive and&#xD;
      receptive language abilities, nonverbal IQ, and executive function skills can reliably&#xD;
      predict the treatment sequence that optimizes language learning. Study results will help to&#xD;
      determine the best sequence approach to ameliorate grammatical weaknesses, one of the core&#xD;
      deficits of young children with language impairment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized trial with two phases. Phase 1 is a traditional randomized trial&#xD;
      during which eligible and consenting participants will be randomized equally to one of two&#xD;
      interventions: Explicit-added or Implicit-only. Randomization is blocked by age (5- &amp;&#xD;
      6-year-olds; and 7- &amp; 8-year-olds) and receptive language ability to ensure that ages are&#xD;
      matched across groups and that half of the participants in each treatment group have&#xD;
      receptive language skills below average. A standard score of 80 is used to categorize&#xD;
      participants (below average: &lt; 80; average: â‰¥ 80) based on the Receptive Language Index of&#xD;
      the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF). Participants are also stratified&#xD;
      based on child gender. All participants will complete 32 sessions (8 sessions per target in&#xD;
      blocks of 4). In Phase 2, participants in both the Explicit-added and Implicit-only groups&#xD;
      will be re-randomized based on level of mastery on treatment goals. Participants who are&#xD;
      considered treatment &quot;Masters&quot; and have achieved the criterion of 80% accuracy on all target&#xD;
      forms will be re-randomized to receive no further treatment or a round of the alternative&#xD;
      treatment. Participants who have not yet mastered each of the four target forms (&lt; 80%&#xD;
      accuracy) will be re-randomized to receive another round of either the same treatment or the&#xD;
      alternative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will include 155 children with language impairment, aged 5 through 8&#xD;
      years, accounting for a 10% attrition rate resulting in 140 participants. This age includes&#xD;
      children who likely experience difficulties with the grammatical forms targeted in&#xD;
      intervention and who are receiving intervention for weaknesses in grammatical language.&#xD;
      Researchers will recruit participants with an effort to maximize participant diversity based&#xD;
      on ethnicity and parental education. We aim to recruit a representative sample of children&#xD;
      with DLD, which will include more boys than girls. Participants will not have any indication&#xD;
      of other significant conditions to which their impairment may be attributed, such as autism&#xD;
      spectrum disorder, Down syndrome, seizure disorder, or hearing impairment. Participants with&#xD;
      a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder will be included due to high rate of&#xD;
      co-morbidity.&#xD;

    <time_frame>After 32 sessions or approximately 4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the change in percentage correct on the Grammatical Language Probe from pre- to post-intervention. The researcher-developed 64-item probe contains 8 contrastive pairs of each of the four target forms. Half of the verbs used in the sentence pairs will comprise verbs intentionally included in session models and recasts; half will include verbs not intentionally included in models and recasts. Participants will be shown a picture and prompted to describe the picture using the target form. Scores will range from 0-64, with higher indicating better performance. Percent correct will be used in analyses.</description>

    <description>The SPELT-3 includes 54 full color photographs of everyday situations and objects paired with simple verbal questions and statements to elicit 22 morphological and syntactic structures. Standard scores (mean = 100; SD = 15) will be used in analyses.</description>

    <description>The MLU-m will be derived from a 20-min language sample with a researcher. MLU-m may range from 0 and on. Higher MLU-m typically reflects greater sentence complexity. MLU-m will be used in study analyses.</description>
