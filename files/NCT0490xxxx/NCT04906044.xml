  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been many high-quality research publications, including the TNT model of&#xD;
      short-term radiotherapy combined with consolidation chemotherapy, and the TNT model of&#xD;
      three-drug combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with higher treatment intensity combined&#xD;
      with CRT. All have achieved better tumor regression and tumor regression than the standard&#xD;
      CRT model. The higher pCR rate reduces the recurrence and metastasis events, improves the&#xD;
      prognosis, and strives for more opportunities for organ function preservation. Can the TNT&#xD;
      model combined with immunotherapy further increase the cCR rate? Whether immunotherapy can&#xD;
      bring further survival benefits to patients who develop CR after neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
      (especially W&amp;W after cCR), it is also necessary to carry out corresponding clinical&#xD;
      research. We designed this study for patients with mid-to-low and locally advanced rectal&#xD;
      cancer who want to be able to preserve the anus. TNT mode combined with PD-1 immunotherapy is&#xD;
      given before surgery, and TME surgery is performed on patients who have not reached cCR or&#xD;
      who still require surgery. It provides sufficient evidence for the safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of preoperative neoadjuvant therapy for PD-1 in low- and middle-level locally advanced rectal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
