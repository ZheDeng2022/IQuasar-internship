  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial plaque-induced gingivitis is considered the most common oral disease in dentate&#xD;
      individuals and the most frequent type of periodontal disease. Manual brushing is the most&#xD;
      widely used method for mechanical plaque self-control and, consequently, prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of gingivitis. The effectiveness of brushing, however, is questionable in&#xD;
      interproximal areas. Thus, interdental cleaning is recognized as an essential part of&#xD;
      maintaining gingival health and the most recommended interdental device is dental floss.&#xD;
      However, there is weak scientific evidence available about the recommendation for daily&#xD;
      flossing. The objective of this randomized blinded trial is to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      effectiveness of oral hygiene using soft toothbrush associated with dental floss versus soft&#xD;
      toothbrush in maintaining the gingival condition in adults without loss of insertion.&#xD;
      Seventy-six subjects with generalized gingivitis at proximal sites will be randomized into&#xD;
      two experimental groups according to the use of dental floss: Manual toothbrushing group&#xD;
      without the use of dental floss (without dental floss) and Group dental toothbrushing and&#xD;
      dental flossing (dental floss). During a period of 8 weeks, the efficacy of the use of the&#xD;
      toothbrush associated with the use of the dental floss will be evaluated. After this period,&#xD;
      the baseline of the effectiveness study begins. After this period, the baseline of the&#xD;
      effectiveness study begins. Participants will be followed up for another 12 months to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of flossing. The parameters Index of Gingival Bleeding (GB) and&#xD;
      Plaque Index (PI) will be evaluated at the baseline, 60, 120, 240 and 360 days. Descriptive&#xD;
      analysis of GB and PI data will be performed using means, standard deviations and mean&#xD;
      percentage of sites with different GB and PI scores. The differences in the means of GB and&#xD;
      PI over time between groups and within the same group will be analyzed using the Poisson&#xD;
      Multilevel Regression model. The main outcome will be the maintenance of the gingival&#xD;
      condition. The difference in interventions will be compared using the chi-square test with&#xD;
      significance level of 5%. Adults with less than 15% of sites with gingival bleeding will be&#xD;
      considered healthy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plaque-induced gingivitis is an inflammation caused by the accumulation of microorganisms&#xD;
      around the gingival margins (MARIOTTI, 1999). The bacterial etiology of gingivitis was&#xD;
      established by Löe et al. (1965). In this study, the accumulation of plaque on healthy&#xD;
      gingiva produced gingivitis between 10 and 21 days and the restitution of oral hygiene&#xD;
      procedures for 7 to 10 days reestablished gingival health. Epidemiological data show a high&#xD;
      prevalence of gingivitis in the adult population of developed and developing countries (LI et&#xD;
      al., 2010; MINISTÉRIO DA SAÚDE, 2011), besides being the most frequent type of periodontal&#xD;
      disease (PAGE; BAAB, 1985).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main clinical outcomes of gingivitis are edema, color change, probing bleeding, increased&#xD;
      gingival exudate and sensitivity (PAGE, SCHROEDER, 1976; MARIOTTI, 1999). The clinical signs&#xD;
      are restricted to the gingiva and are reversible with the removal of the etiological factor&#xD;
      without any damage to the support periodontium (MARIOTTI, 1999). In adition to the local&#xD;
      repercussions, the gingival condition has an impact on the quality of life. Self-perception&#xD;
      of swollen gums and gingival pain were associated with reduced quality of life (NEEDLEMAN et&#xD;
      al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingivitis is a risk factor in the clinical course of chronic periodontitis. Lang et al.&#xD;
      (2009) found that teeth associated with inflamed gingiva had a significantly greater risk of&#xD;
      tooth loss than teeth with healthy or slightly inflamed gingiva. Hugoson et al. (2008) showed&#xD;
      that improvements in plaque control reduced the prevalence of gingivitis and moderate&#xD;
      periodontitis in four cross-sectional studies conducted over 30 years in Sweden. Thus,&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of gingivitis can indirectly reduce tooth loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanical control of the supragingival plaque is the main mechanism of prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of gingivitis (PINTO et al., 2013; SAMBUNJAK et al., 2011). The benefits of&#xD;
      adequate plaque control include maintaining a functional dentition, optimizing aesthetic&#xD;
      values such as appearance and good breath, reducing the risk of loss of periodontal&#xD;
      attachment, and the need for complex, uncomfortable, and costly periodontal treatment&#xD;
      (CLAYDON, 2008). In addition, the improvement in periodontal clinical indicators is&#xD;
      correlated with an increase in quality of life related to oral health in adults (SHANBHAG;&#xD;
      DAHIYA; CROUCHER, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manual brushing is the most commonly used method for plaque control. (VAN DER WEIJDEIN; SLOT,&#xD;
      2015). The effectiveness of this procedure depends on the individual ability to remove plaque&#xD;
      and the frequency at which this removal is performed (JEPSEN, 1998). The XI European Workshop&#xD;
      of Periodontology recommended the daily brushing twice daily with the use of fluoride&#xD;
      dentifrice (CHAPPLE et al., 2015). However, Pinto et al. (2013) demonstrated that mechanical&#xD;
      self-control with 24-hour frequency is able to prevent gingivitis in subjects with no history&#xD;
      of periodontitis. A systematic review showed that a single brushing exercise reduces plaque&#xD;
      levels by approximately 42% (SLOT et al., 2012). Randomized clinical trials (ROSEMA et al.,&#xD;
      2008; SCHIFF et al., 2006; SHARMA et al., 2002) have shown that manual brushing without the&#xD;
      aid of interdental plaque removal devices reduces plaque and gingivitis levels and maintains&#xD;
      gingival health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of brushing, however, is questionable in interproximal areas. In these&#xD;
      areas, due to the presence of apical fibers at the point of contact between two adjacent&#xD;
      teeth, there is a difficulty of access of dental brushes, which may allow the establishment&#xD;
      and maturation of plaque. (SALZER et al., 2015). Thus, removal of interdental plaques is&#xD;
      recognized as an essential part of maintaining gingival health (AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION,&#xD;
      2016; CHAPPLE et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The daily use of dental floss is the recommended procedure for the removal of interdental&#xD;
      plaque from areas with papilla filling all interproximal space (AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION,&#xD;
      2016). However, there is no scientific support for this recommendation. Systematic reviews&#xD;
      evaluated the effect of dental floss combined with brushing (BERCHIER et al., 2008; SAMBUNJAK&#xD;
      et al., 2011). Berchier et al. (2008) showed that the use of dental floss does not have an&#xD;
      additional effect on toothbrushing indices and gingival bleeding. Sambunjak et al. (2011)&#xD;
      reported a statistically significant benefit of combined dental floss with tooth brushing&#xD;
      only on the reduction of gingivitis in up to 6 months of follow-up. A meta-analysis of these&#xD;
      studies concluded that there is poor evidence to support the use of dental floss (SÄLZER et&#xD;
      al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the effectiveness of interdental cleaning methods should consider the&#xD;
      efficacy, acceptability and adherence of the individual to the method (ASADOORIAN; LOCKER,&#xD;
      2006; WARREN; CHATER, 1996). Regular dental use among adults is low (ASADOORIAN &amp; LOCKER,&#xD;
      2006; RIMONDINI et al., 2001; SCHUZ et al., 2006) due to lack of individual ability and&#xD;
      motivation (ASADOORIAN; LOCKER, 2006; TEDESCO, KEFFER; FLECK-KANDATH, 1991). Schüz et al.&#xD;
      (2009) tested the effect of a behavioral intervention on flossing. The authors concluded that&#xD;
      the individual incentive to form a detailed plan on when, where and how to use dental floss,&#xD;
      significantly improved their frequency of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is weak scientific evidence available regarding the recommendation of dental&#xD;
      floss. Studies available on the adjunct effect of flossing to adult brushing have short&#xD;
      follow-up periods, only one older than 6 months (ROSEMA et al., 2008), and do not evaluate&#xD;
      caries outcomes, dental calculus, loss of clinical insertion and quality of life. In&#xD;
      addition, McGuire et al. (2014) recommend the incorporation of outcomes reported by the&#xD;
      individual into clinical trials. Thus, randomized clinical trials that address these&#xD;
      limitations are fundamental to evaluate the effectiveness of dental floss in the treatment of&#xD;
      adult gingivitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY This study will be a blinded randomized clinical trial. The sample will be&#xD;
      composed of students from the Federal University of Santa Maria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible individuals who agree to participate in the study will sign the informed consent&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the Federal University of&#xD;
      Santa Maria (CAAE 53831716.5.0000.5346).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculated sample size was 76 individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION Block randomization (10 units per block) will be performed. The randomization&#xD;
      sequence will be generated by computer program (Random Allocation Software, version 1.0, May&#xD;
      2004). Concealment of randomization will be ensured by the use of opaque envelopes numbered&#xD;
      from 1 to 76, which will correspond to the sequence from the first to the last participant to&#xD;
      be randomized. Within each envelope will be the name of the experimental group that the&#xD;
      individual will be allocated. A researcher (A.B.L.) not involved with outcome evaluations&#xD;
      will be responsible for generating the sequence and maintaining concealment of randomization,&#xD;
      and applying the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be randomized into 2 groups according to whether or not they use dental&#xD;
      floss:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group toothbrush (WITHOUT DENTAL FLOSS): Individuals will receive oral hygiene&#xD;
           instructions with toothbrush only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group toothbrush plus dental floss (DENTAL FLOSS): Individuals will receive oral hygiene&#xD;
           instructions with toothbrush plusdental floss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION The intervention consists of oral hygiene instructions with a toothbrush&#xD;
      (WITHOUT DENTAL FLOSS) and toothbrush plus dental floss (DENTAL FLOSS), performed by a&#xD;
      researcher (A.B.L.) not involved in the assessment of outcomes. The intervention will be&#xD;
      performed within 8 weeks immediately after the baseline, corresponding to the efficacy study.&#xD;
      Soon after this period, which will correspond to the effectiveness study, the interventions&#xD;
      will not be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERIODONTAL CLINICAL PARAMETERS Clinical parameters evaluated will be: Plaque Index (PL)&#xD;
      (SILNESS; LÖE, 1964), Gingival Index (GB) (LÖE, 1967), plaque retentive factor (PRF), probing&#xD;
      depth (PD), attachment level AL), bleeding probing (BOP), gingival recession (GR) and&#xD;
      gingival crevicular fluid volume (GCFV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using STATA 12.0 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX,&#xD;
      USA). Descriptive analysis of PI, GB, GCFV and AL data will be performed using means,&#xD;
      standard deviations and average percentage of sites with different IPI and GI scores. The&#xD;
      differences in the mean PI, GB and GCFV over time between the groups and within the same&#xD;
      group will be analyzed using the Poisson Multilevel Regression model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome will be considered a reduction in gingival bleeding. The difference in the&#xD;
      proportion of subjects who reached gingival health level after the interventions will be&#xD;
      compared through the chi-square test with significance level of 5%. Adults with less than 15%&#xD;
      of sites with gingival bleeding will be considered healthy (AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION,&#xD;
      2012). The unit of analysis will be the individual.&#xD;
