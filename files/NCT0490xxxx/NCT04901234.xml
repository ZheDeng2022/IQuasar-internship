    <textblock>
      This is a phase II randomized trial, where patients with histologically proven squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of oropharynx that have primary tumor (T3 - T4) in place, treated with curative&#xD;
      intent chemoradiation, will be randomized to systematic mid-treatment MRI-based radiotherapy&#xD;
      adaptation vs. standard of care. The primary objective is to compare patient-rated dysphagia&#xD;
      (as assessed by the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory composite score at 6 months&#xD;
      post-treatment in patients undergoing routine mid-treatment MR-guided radiotherapy adaptation&#xD;
      vs. in patients receiving the current standard of care.&#xD;

      Background: Dysphagia was shown to be the main driver of adverse quality of life after head&#xD;
      and neck radiotherapy. Over the 7-week radiotherapy course, patients with head and neck&#xD;
      cancers undergo significant anatomical changes, including weight loss and tumor shrinkage&#xD;
      (with complete response at mid-treatment in as high as 50% of patients). The current standard&#xD;
      of care is to maintain the same radiotherapy plan for the entire treatment duration, unless&#xD;
      major dosimetric deviations are detected. The use of MRI for treatment adaptation has the&#xD;
      advantage of increased soft tissue contrast and is being integrated into several clinical&#xD;
      practises with the recent development of MR-Linac technology. However, there is currently no&#xD;
      demonstrated clinical advantage from the use of MRI for treatment adaptation in head and neck&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To compare patient-rated dysphagia (as assessed by the MD Anderson&#xD;
      Dysphagia Inventory composite score at 6 months post-treatment in patients undergoing routine&#xD;
      mid-treatment MR-guided radiotherapy adaptation vs. in patients receiving the current&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a phase II randomized trial, where patients with histologically proven&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of oropharynx that have primary tumor (T3 - T4) in place, treated&#xD;
      with curative intent chemoradiation, will be randomized to systematic mid-treatment MRI-based&#xD;
      radiotherapy adaptation vs. standard of care. Patients with contra-indications to MRI will be&#xD;
      excluded. The study will use a 2-sided, independent-sample t-test with an alpha level of 0.05&#xD;
      and power of 80%, with a 1:1 randomization between the 2 arms. In order to detect a 10-point&#xD;
      improvement in the MD Anderson Dysphagia Index (MDADI) and assuming that the quality of life&#xD;
      scores would be normally distributed with a standard deviation of 18, a total of 104 patients&#xD;
      will be required (52 in each arm), which has been increased to 120 patients overall (60&#xD;
      patients in each arm) to account for a 10% dropout rate in completion of the quality of life&#xD;
      scoring at 6 months post-treatment. An independent DSMB will review the pooled standard&#xD;
      deviation of the interim data collected for this trial after 40 patients overall have been&#xD;
      recruited (20 in each arm) the value of the standard deviation used to calculate the sample&#xD;
      size required. The DSMB will inform the study team if there is potential to reduce the sample&#xD;
      size if the standard deviation was much lower than 18 (i.e. &lt;=15 would result in a reduction&#xD;
      of 25% in patients required), which will potential reduce the length of the trial. Patients&#xD;
      will be stratified by institution and recruited in blocks of 4 to ensure a balance between&#xD;
      arms at the interim assessment.&#xD;
