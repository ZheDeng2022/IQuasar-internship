  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many stroke survivors experience aphasia, a loss or impairment of language affecting the&#xD;
      production or understanding of speech. One common type of aphasia is known as non-fluent&#xD;
      aphasia. Patients with non-fluent aphasia have difficulty formulating grammatical sentences,&#xD;
      often producing short word fragments despite having a good understanding of what others are&#xD;
      trying to communicate to them. Speech language pathologists (SLPs) play a central role&#xD;
      rehabilitating persons with aphasia and administer therapy in an attempt to improve&#xD;
      communication skills. Despite standard therapy, approximately 50% of individuals who&#xD;
      experience aphasia acutely continue to have language deficits more than 6 months post-stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most people, Broca's area is dominant in the left side of the brain. Following a&#xD;
      left-sided stroke, the right-sided homologue of Broca's area (the pars triangularis), may&#xD;
      adopt language function. Unfortunately, reorganizing language to the right side of the brain&#xD;
      seems to be less effective than restoring function to the left hemisphere. Repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, can be&#xD;
      used to suppress activity of specific regions in the right side of the brain to promote&#xD;
      recovery of function in the perilesional area. Despite preliminary success in existing&#xD;
      studies using rTMS in post-stroke aphasia, there is much work to be done to better understand&#xD;
      the mechanisms underlying recovery. Responses to rTMS have been positive, yet heterogenous,&#xD;
      which may be related to timing of treatments following stroke.&#xD;

    <description>Assesses mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The answers given can be converted into EQ-5D index with scores anchored at 0 for death and 1 for perfect health. The EQ-5D also records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating higher self-perceived quality of life. This can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement.</description>

    <description>Participants receive 3.5 hours of intensive speech therapy in small groups delivered by a blinded speech language pathologist and therapy assistant. The objective of M-MAT is to improve word production through shaping of responses (ie. Gradually increasing complexity of spoken targets towards eventual mastery) and social-mediated repetitive practice. Therapists use game-based interactive tasks and rich multi-modal cueing (gestures, written words, drawing, reading words) to improve spoken production and oral communication.</description>
