    <textblock>
      To investigate whether a prefabricated Orthotic inserted into running shoes will increase&#xD;
      comfort, decrease injury and improve speed during recreational running as compared to running&#xD;
      shoes without the prefabricated Orthotic.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Running is the most accessible sport in the world. Data from the UK House of Commons has&#xD;
      indicated that running has become the favourite exercise among adults 16 or older. However,&#xD;
      as the sport grows, so too does the number of running-related injuries (RRIs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Orthotic is a device that is placed inside the shoe and functions as a cushion to absorb&#xD;
      the shock transmitted on contact with the ground; in addition, they also affect muscle&#xD;
      activation that can benefit the user. However, in contemporaneous medical literature, there&#xD;
      are mixed views and opinions on whether the use of Orthotics reduces running-related&#xD;
      injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised control trial that will be conducted over an 8-week period, during which&#xD;
      participants will be asked to complete runs and provide data in the form of completed&#xD;
      surveys. The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether a prefabricated&#xD;
      Orthotic inserted into running shoes will increase comfort, decrease injury and improve speed&#xD;
      during recreational running as compared to running shoes without the prefabricated Orthotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include 106 participants who will be randomised into the study and&#xD;
      control group. Participants in the study group will be provided with an Orthotic and will run&#xD;
      with this in the participants normal running shoes. Participants in the control group will&#xD;
      not be provided with the Orthotic and will run in the participants regular running shoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants (in both groups) will be asked to provide data following each run and also&#xD;
      once a week regarding any injury sustained in the preceding 7 days. The minimum required data&#xD;
      set will comprise of the personal details and consent on initial enrolment, ongoing consent&#xD;
      and data from at least 10 runs (there are 5 individual pieces of information from each run -&#xD;
      the date of the run, the distance, the time taken, whether an Orthotic was used or not and&#xD;
      the comfort during the run), and injury data every week during the 8 week study period.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will report any running related injuries via a self-report questionnaire. A human model will be used to identify the area of pain. Further choices and information will be provided to the participant on common injuries to allow the identification of the injury. This is a binary measure to observe whether an injury was sustained or not.</description>

    <description>Group A will receive an L700 Speed Orthotic (https://www.aetrex.com/running-orthotic/?lang=en_US) according to participants shoe size and will run with this Orthotic in the participants normal running shoes. The investigators will send an instruction sheet along with the Orthotic in the post, explaining how to use it. Alternatively, an online video tutorial on how to use the Orthotic will also be available throughout the study. The group will be asked to run as normal over the 8-week trial period</description>
