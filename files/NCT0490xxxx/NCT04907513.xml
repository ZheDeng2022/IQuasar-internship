  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a major public concern associated with profound distress, intense suffering,&#xD;
      and impairment in social, professional and familial functioning. Among the numerous symptoms&#xD;
      defining depression, fatigue and motivation are not only frequent but also highly associated&#xD;
      with poor quality of life and resistance to conventional antidepressant. Recent data, mainly&#xD;
      obtained in animals, suggest that these symptoms may be linked to inflammatory processes&#xD;
      within the central nervous system. Yet access to the brain is too invasive for exploring this&#xD;
      link in patients with psychiatric conditions. However, certain conditions in neurosurgery,&#xD;
      such as aneurysm rupture, require external evacuation, over several days or weeks, of the&#xD;
      fluid bathing the brain through a catheter directly inserted into it. Critically, these&#xD;
      patients also exhibit extreme exhaustion and fluctuating motivation, allowing to investigate&#xD;
      the involvement of neuroinflammation in lack of motivation and fatigue by carrying out&#xD;
      repeated motivation assessments with short behavioral tests (around ten minutes), while&#xD;
      performing an analysis of inflammation markers in the fluid evacuated from the brain. The&#xD;
      identification of inflammatory mechanisms underlying lack of motivation and fatigue could&#xD;
      lead to the development of treatments for both resistant depression and motivation deficits&#xD;
      that largely hamper rehabilitation in neurosurgery.&#xD;
