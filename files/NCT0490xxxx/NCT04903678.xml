  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy in infancy and childhood. The&#xD;
      overall survival rate of retinoblastoma was reported to exceed 95% when children were early&#xD;
      diagnosed with localized intraocular phase. The advanced retinoblastoma cases with central&#xD;
      nervous system metastasis (CNS)is associated with exceedingly poor prognosis. CNS metastasis&#xD;
      is the main cause of death in retinoblastoma. Meningeal involvement combined with spinal cord&#xD;
      membrane involvement might be due to the meninges invasion and/or the spreading of CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the most sensitive drug to retinoblastoma tumor cells in vitro, melphalan is the most&#xD;
      important drug in the local treatment of retinoblastoma, and it is also an irreplaceable drug&#xD;
      in the current eye preservation treatment, which greatly improves the success rate of eye&#xD;
      preservation for advanced retinoblastoma. According to the research and the practice of&#xD;
      vitreous injection (melphalan), the drug concentration in vitreous can effectively kill&#xD;
      retinoblastoma tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is reasonable to speculate that the tumor cells in CSF can be effectively killed by&#xD;
      melphalan. Therefore, based on the above background, this study will explore the&#xD;
      effectiveness and feasibility of intrathecal injection of melphalan in patients with CNS&#xD;
      metastasis of retinoblastoma through a multicenter prospective study.&#xD;

This 30-item questionnaire includes five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. The multi-item scales include a different set of items. Each item includes four subscales, namely &quot;Not at all&quot; (1 point), &quot;A little&quot; (2 points), &quot;Quite a bit&quot; (3 points) and &quot;Very much&quot; (4 points)</description>

    <description>Systemic chemotherapy and intrathecal chemotherapy are performed every 3 weeks. After three treatment cycles, the treatment response is comprehensively evaluated including cerebrospinal fluid, intracranial and orbital tumors. If necessary, local radiotherapy and arterial interventional chemotherapy are performed for local solid tumors. Cerebrospinal fluid is detected in each treatment cycle. If RB tumor cells still exist in cerebrospinal fluid, chemotherapy and intrathecal chemotherapy are continued until the end event. If cerebrospinal fluid was negative, intrathecal chemotherapy is supplemented for another 2 cycles with a total of 6 cycles of systemic chemotherapy. The patients are followed up after treatment.</description>
