  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have worsening of chronic heart&#xD;
      failure, a long-term condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers wanted to learn more about a new substance called finerenone&#xD;
      (BAY94-8862).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finerenone is a substance that blocks the activation of a protein in the body called&#xD;
      mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). An increased activation of MR is involved in the development&#xD;
      of hypertension, organ damage and worsening of heart failure. Many patients with worsening&#xD;
      chronic heart failure also suffer from chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease is a&#xD;
      long-term decrease in the kidneys' ability to work properly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers studied how finerenone moves into, through and out of the body. The&#xD;
      researchers also looked at how safe finerenone is and how it affects the body. The main&#xD;
      purpose of this study was to help researchers develop recommendations for the amount of the&#xD;
      substance (the dosing) to be given to patients with reduced kidney function.&#xD;
