      This prospective observational multi-centre UK study will evaluate Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra for&#xD;
      the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples for&#xD;
      pulmonary TB and endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA)&#xD;
      samples for mediastinal TB and compare the diagnostic performance against conventional&#xD;
      modalities (smear, culture, cytology) as well as to a clinical composite diagnosis. This will&#xD;
      be using a clinical expert panel reviewing data blindly. The Investigators will assess the&#xD;
      performance of Xpert Ultra by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive&#xD;
      and negative predictive value in UK centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The turn-around time of these modality and its effect on treatment decisions will be&#xD;
      assessed. Finally the Investigators will correlate different clinical characteristics and to&#xD;
      define the sensitivities in the various clinical presentations and to evaluate the phenotypes&#xD;
      of patients with 'trace' results within these cohorts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multi-centre study across the UK including London, Birmingham,&#xD;
      Leicester and Manchester which account for the highest proportion of TB cases in the UK.&#xD;
      These are centres routinely investigate patients with suspected TB and routinely use Xpert&#xD;
      Ultra in their practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient who is suspected of having pulmonary or mediastinal TB who is routinely&#xD;
      undergoing a bronchoscopy or EBUS-TBNA for clinical purposes will be recruited. These&#xD;
      patients will be identified mainly by the TB services but also via Accident and Emergency,&#xD;
      wards and clinics. Inclusion criteria include any consenting adult ≥18 years of age suspected&#xD;
      of having pulmonary or mediastinal TB who is undergoing a routine clinical bronchoscopy for&#xD;
      BAL or EBUS-TBNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient identified who need a bronchoscopy or EBUS-TBNA for suspected TB will have this&#xD;
      done in the local hospital. Patients will follow the routine follow up arrangements in line&#xD;
      with the local trust guidelines but the researchers will review any routine follow up data up&#xD;
      to 3 month post-procedure if available. There will be no additional procedures or visits as&#xD;
      the researchers will merely use routinely available clinical data and follow up data if&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to recruit a minimum of 323 participants undergoing a BAL, and 323&#xD;
      participants undergoing an EBUS-TBNA for a minimum of 6 months or until the recruitment&#xD;
      targets are reached. The researchers will review any routine follow up data for a minimum of&#xD;
      3 months post-procedure. There will be no additional study follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study outcome is the diagnostic performance of Xpert Ultra in BAL and EBUS-TBNA samples&#xD;
      in patients with suspected TB against conventional modalities available (smear microscopy,&#xD;
      culture, cytology) using a subgroup analysis of the different clinical categories attributing&#xD;
      to the likely TB diagnosis incorporating follow-up data and the clinician's decision to&#xD;
      treat. A clinical expert panel will review the culture-negative cases blindly to categorise&#xD;
      each case into a clinical diagnosis category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Category Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Culture confirmed TB: Microbiological culture of MTB, and clinical and radiological&#xD;
           findings suggestive of TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Highly probable TB: Clinical and radiological features highly suggestive of TB and&#xD;
           unlikely to be caused by other diseases, a decision to treat made by a clinician,&#xD;
           appropriate response to therapy, and histological evidence if available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinically indeterminate diagnosis: Final diagnosis of TB neither highly probable nor&#xD;
           reliably excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Highly unlikely or TB excluded: Other diagnosis made other than TB (e.g. sarcoidosis,&#xD;
           cancer or lymphoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective data will be collected from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London North&#xD;
      West University Health Care NHS Trust, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust,&#xD;
      Royal Free London NHS Trust, The Hillingdon Hospitals NHS Trust, Barts Health NHS Trust,&#xD;
      University Hospitals of Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, University Hospitals of Leicester&#xD;
      NHS Trust, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust which together serve a diverse cultural&#xD;
      population with a high prevalence of TB in the UK and offer EBUS-TBNA services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical (patient demographics, medical history, TB symptoms, previous TB, history of&#xD;
      exposure to TB, medications, HIV status and immunosuppression), microbiological, cytological&#xD;
      data, radiology and biomarkers of infection will be collected throughout the study and&#xD;
      documented on the following case report forms (CRFs). A paper or electronic CRF will be used&#xD;
      as a clinical data collection tool which will comply with GCP, FDA CFR-21 Part-11, and HIPAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This data will be collected by the local clinical team, a clinical research fellow or&#xD;
      research nurses using participant hospital records or from the participant directly. Personal&#xD;
      data will be kept in pseudo-anonymised form with a link code which can be used to refer to&#xD;
      the participant's information. This link code will only be available to the clinical or&#xD;
      clinical research team. There will be an audit trail of the staff entering the data.&#xD;
