      The purpose of this preliminary study is to implement an automated and standardized&#xD;
      computer-based method that accurately measures placental volume, blood flow, and vascularity.&#xD;
      This will be accomplished by using the digital data obtained at the time of a first-trimester&#xD;
      3D image volume. This information will then be used to further investigate whether placental&#xD;
      volume, blood flow, and vascularity can be used to predict the risk of preeclampsia in&#xD;
      conjunction with maternal history and serum blood markers obtained at the time of their&#xD;
      ultrasound.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is defined as a multi-system disorder typically characterized by hypertension,&#xD;
      proteinuria, and/or end organ damage. Preeclampsia can develop rapidly at any time after 20&#xD;
      weeks gestation and into the postpartum period and can at times lead to systemic&#xD;
      complications and even death. Preeclampsia continues to be a leading cause of maternal&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality secondary to the development of hypertensive disorders, systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory changes affecting the endothelium, and hemorrhagic complications. It also&#xD;
      contributes indirectly to neonatal morbidity and mortality by leading to premature delivery.&#xD;
      Our current ability to screen patients for the risk of developing preeclampsia relies on&#xD;
      clinical factors as recommended by ACOG and the USPHS. At this time, if a patient is deemed&#xD;
      high risk, our only intervention for prevention of preeclampsia is to prescribe low-dose&#xD;
      aspirin. Being able to identify the population at higher risk for preeclampsia would allow&#xD;
      for implementation of new management options among these persons. The purpose of this&#xD;
      preliminary study is to implement an automated and standardized computer-based method that&#xD;
      accurately measures placental volume, blood flow, and vascularity. This will be accomplished&#xD;
      by using the digital data obtained at the time of a first-trimester 3D image volume. This&#xD;
      information will then be used to further investigate whether placental volume, blood flow,&#xD;
      and vascularity can be used to predict the risk of preeclampsia in conjunction with maternal&#xD;
      history and serum blood markers obtained at the time of their ultrasound.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be enrolled in the study at the time of their first-trimester screen (10w3d-13w6d weeks of gestation) to the time of their delivery. Collection of first-trimester 3D-volume ultrasound imaging to measure the placental volume, blood flow, and vascularity and maternal serum markers will occur over a 6-12 months period. Collection of descriptive and pregnancy outcome information will be obtained from the electronic medical records will continue through their pregnancy episode (typical 9 months).</description>
