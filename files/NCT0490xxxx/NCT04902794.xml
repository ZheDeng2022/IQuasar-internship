      Introduction: The genitourinary menopause syndrome (MMS) affects 50% of postmenopausal women&#xD;
      and, due to a decrease in hormone levels, triggers functional changes in the vagina and&#xD;
      vagina, and impairment of quality of life and sexual function. Objective: To test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the 405 nm light emitting diode in the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy is&#xD;
      safe and effective, by reducing the symptomatology of the disease and histological alteration&#xD;
      of the tissue. Methods: This is a pilot study in 10 volunteers with SGM, followed by a&#xD;
      randomized, blinded trial in a sample of 58 individuals that will be performed at the Pelvic&#xD;
      Floor Care Center (CAAP). Menopausal women up to 65 years of age and with clinical signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy syndrome (vaginal dryness and irritation, pruritus, pain or&#xD;
      discomfort in intercourse, bleeding after sexual intercourse) and who voluntarily participate&#xD;
      in the study will be included. Will be excluded from the study the patients in hormonal&#xD;
      replacement for less than 6 months, diagnosis of vaginal infection, use of pacemaker,&#xD;
      pregnant women, those who have performed Oophorectomy or presented ovarian cancer, difficulty&#xD;
      understanding the proposed instruments and patients with chronic neurological degenerative&#xD;
      diseases. Three 405 nm light emitting diode (LED) sessions will be performed, with a seven&#xD;
      days interval between them. In the clinical trial, the study group will perform&#xD;
      kinesiotherapy and LED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will perform kinesiotherapy and the LED will be turned off. Data collection&#xD;
      will be performed initially and after the sessions through self-administered questionnaires&#xD;
      containing socio-demographic and clinical information, Medical Outcomes Study 36, Short-Form&#xD;
      Health Survey (SF-36), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) - Female Version (QS-F), Female&#xD;
      Genital Self-Image Scale - 7 (FGSIS-7). At the end of treatment, the visual analog scale and&#xD;
      Likert scale will be used to measure the individual's satisfaction. Expected results: The&#xD;
      405nm LED in the vaginal canal is expected to be safe and effective for SGM.&#xD;
