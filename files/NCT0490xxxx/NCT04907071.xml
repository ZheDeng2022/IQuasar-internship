  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition caused by a tear in the internal layer of&#xD;
      the wall of the major artery (aorta) carrying blood out of the heart to all body organs or&#xD;
      bleeding within the aortic wall, resulting in separation of the aortic wall layers&#xD;
      (dissection). As the tear can extend along the whole aorta and between its layers, blood can&#xD;
      flow between the aortic layers and lead to aortic rupture. Furthermore, when a tear occurs&#xD;
      and blood flows through it, it creates two dynamic lumens, one is the true lumen where blood&#xD;
      normally flows, and another is the false lumen where blood stays still. When the false lumen&#xD;
      gets larger, it can compromise blood flow through the true lumen as well as through branches&#xD;
      of the aorta that supply blood to different body organs (malperfusion). Malperfusion syndrome&#xD;
      is a diagnosis that requires clinical (eg belly pain or distention, or making low or no&#xD;
      urine) laboratory (increase a blood marker related to the malperfused organ), and&#xD;
      radiological (imaging) evidence of inadequate blood supply to the involved organ such as the&#xD;
      brain, bowels, kidneys, or legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Giving the dynamic nature of the true and false lumens of the aortic dissection, It is&#xD;
      challenging to have a proper assessment of any organ malperfusion with the current&#xD;
      traditional imaging study (computerized tomography ,CT scan), as it only reflects blood flow&#xD;
      status at that specific time when the test was done, which can change by the time we plan and&#xD;
      manage the aortic dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, even after repairing the aortic wall tear that caused the aortic dissection,&#xD;
      and restoring adequate blood flow through the true lumen, the presence of residual&#xD;
      malperfusion syndrome is considered a major risk factor that increases related death rate&#xD;
      (mortality) as well as long and short term damage (morbidity) to the involved organs such as&#xD;
      stroke, dead bowels, dialysis, or legs amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal in this project is to use Intravascular Ultrasound to have real time assessment and&#xD;
      confirm any evidence of malperfusion syndrome in the sitting of aortic dissection before and&#xD;
      after repairing the original aortic tear. Intravascular Ultrasound is a small ultrasound&#xD;
      (using sound waves) wand that is attached to the top of a thin tube. Then, this tube is&#xD;
      inserted to an artery (a major branch of the aorta) in the groin area, and moved up to reach&#xD;
      the whole aorta from inside. This device measures how the sound waves reflect of the aorta&#xD;
      and its major branches, and changes the sound waves into pictures that reflect blood flow&#xD;
      status in the aorta and its branches. Having this proper assessment will help in addressing&#xD;
      malperfusion syndrome as early as possible and decrease the related mortality and morbidity.&#xD;

      Acute Type A Aortic Dissection A Debakey acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) represents a&#xD;
      lethal condition with a risk of mortality of 1% per hour and up to nearly 50% in first 48&#xD;
      hours if left untreated.1, 2 Traditional surgical teaching has always involved emergent&#xD;
      repair of the proximal aortic with resection and replacement of the intima entry tear and&#xD;
      aneurysmal tissue within the ascending aorta. This approach addresses obviates the risk of&#xD;
      aortic rupture, proximal extension into the coronary arteries, cardiac tamponade and aortic&#xD;
      valve insufficiency, all of which lead to mortality. However, as expertise in the field&#xD;
      progress evidence is emerging that dealing with only the proximal extent of the dissection&#xD;
      may still leave a significant portion of patients at risk for complications from an inability&#xD;
      to identify and treat end-organ malperfusion.3 At Western University and London Health&#xD;
      Sciences center our mortality rate for patients presenting the ATAAD has been reporter at&#xD;
      20.0%4, and is similar to that reported by the International Registry of Acute aortic&#xD;
      Dissection (IRAD) database, with mortality rates between 16.2 and 27.4%.5,6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malperfusion Syndrome and Aortic Rupture In the 2018 Circulation paper published by Yang et&#xD;
      al. the University of Michigan group outline the treatment strategy for ATAAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, all patients with an ATAAD presenting with malperfusion, but without signs of&#xD;
      aortic rupture or cardiac tamponade, were treated first with endovascular revascularization&#xD;
      followed by delayed open aortic repair.3 The authors report that in the second decade of&#xD;
      their experience with this treatment model, the overall mortality dropped to 10.7%.3 When&#xD;
      compared to our local data and that published by the IRAD group, it would appear that there&#xD;
      are significant improvements that can be made for the treatment of these individuals. The&#xD;
      authors report that roughly 1/3 of all patients presented with some form of malperfusion&#xD;
      syndrome and that in this group, 87% of the deaths were attributed to organ failure from&#xD;
      malperfusion even after fenestration and stenting. Conversely there was only a 4% risk of&#xD;
      aortic rupture following fenestration and stenting prior to open surgical repair in this&#xD;
      group.3 This would indicate that malperfusion is a significant cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in these patients maybe even more so than the risk of aortic rupture in selective&#xD;
      patients but in order to improve our outcomes, we need a better way to assess static and&#xD;
      dynamic changes that cause malperfusion as early as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Static and Dynamic Arterial Malperfusion The concept of static and dynamic obstructions in&#xD;
      regards to aortic blood flow, indicates the phenomenon where disruption of laminar flow due&#xD;
      to interruption of the intimal layer in and aortic dissection, results in gradients between&#xD;
      the true and false lumen which can shear a dissection flap over a branching vessel causing&#xD;
      collapse of the true lumen (dynamic), or the development of thrombus within the false lumen&#xD;
      resulting in obstruction of a branch vessel (static). Most emergent AAD repairs will involve&#xD;
      a baseline CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, which may identify malperfusion of&#xD;
      distal arteries shown by a lack of contrast opacification. However, this is done prior to&#xD;
      surgical repair and not an accurate representation of perfusion after proximal surgical&#xD;
      repair is completed. Frist of all, at the time of the initial CT scan the intimal tear is&#xD;
      still present and flow may not be directed into the true lumen, patients blood pressures may&#xD;
      not be controlled which can cause dynamic shifts in the intimal flap favouring either true or&#xD;
      false lumen flow, and lastly multiple distal re-entry tears can form throughout the remaining&#xD;
      aorta after surgical repair which also have the capability of altering arterial flow.&#xD;
      Transesophageal echocardiogram is usually present at the time of open surgical repair, but it&#xD;
      is limited to the ascending, arch and descending thoracic aorta and provides little&#xD;
      information regarding flow to the visceral segments, kidneys and legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) has been used over the past&#xD;
      several decades for the real-time assessment of vascular anatomy in a variety of clinical&#xD;
      settings.7 Standard IVUS catheters typically use a 9-French delivery sheath and are run over&#xD;
      a 0.035-inch guidewire. The device transducer emits and receives signals at varying&#xD;
      frequencies to produce a 360ÌŠ axial image. As surgeons are becoming more familiar with this&#xD;
      technology and developing the skill set necessary to use the equipment, including the&#xD;
      real-time acquisition and interpretation of images, it permits the full evaluation of the&#xD;
      thoracoabdominal aorta including size, tortuosity, and calcification. In the setting of an&#xD;
      AAD, IVUS can provide real-time data under physiologic conditions following open proximal&#xD;
      repair to indicate the presence of distal re-entry tears, compression of the true lumen and&#xD;
      malperfusion to aortic branches. It also, can be used intraoperatively to confirm resolution&#xD;
      of malperfusion to the visceral segments and legs after proximal flow is reinsituted into the&#xD;
      true lumen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale As noted above, AAD is a lethal condition that every cardiovascular surgeon&#xD;
      is faced with at some point in their career. Although the outcomes at LHSC have been&#xD;
      historically very good and are on par with or better than the existing IRAD data, looking at&#xD;
      other institutions who have more advanced approaches, there appears to be some room to&#xD;
      improve our outcomes even further. We believe that emergent repair of the proximal extent of&#xD;
      the AAD, which is the current standard at LHSC, results in stabilization of the aortic valve,&#xD;
      protects coronary flow, relieves cardiac tamponade and reduces the risk of aortic rupture.&#xD;
      However, this approach leaves patients at risk for distal malperfusion due to distal re-entry&#xD;
      tears, patent false lumens and thrombus formation, creating both dynamic and static&#xD;
      obstruction. Intraoperative IVUS evaluation would therefore allow for the assessment of&#xD;
      distal perfusion immediately following proximal repair in order to identify malperfusion and&#xD;
      adjust treatment accordingly to prevent damage from prolonged end-organ ischemia. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of intraoperative IVUS immediately following&#xD;
      open surgical repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device Description The study devices are intended to improve outcomes for patients presenting&#xD;
      with malperfusion syndrome in the setting of ATAAD. Every subject in the cohort must be&#xD;
      deemed treatable with an 8Fr IVUS from an anatomy and clinical safety perspective.&#xD;
