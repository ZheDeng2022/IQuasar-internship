  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PERCEIVE (PrEdiction of Risk and Communication of outcomE followIng major lower limb&#xD;
      amputation - a collaboratiVE study) study aims to explore how decisions about major lower&#xD;
      limb amputations are made by patients and healthcare professionals.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will look in detail at major lower limb amputation risk perception, communication&#xD;
      and decision-making, both from a patient/family and a surgeon/clinician point of view. The&#xD;
      investigators will audio-record 10-15 consultations between surgeons and patients, examining&#xD;
      the communication and decision-making process, and conduct individual interviews with 10-15&#xD;
      patients and 10-15 healthcare professionals. Patients will be interviewed at two time points:&#xD;
      firstly as soon as possible after they discuss the possibility of leg amputation with a&#xD;
      surgeon, and secondly around six months later. The investigators will identify what is&#xD;
      important to patients, what information they need to make an informed decision and how best&#xD;
      to communicate that information. Interviews with surgeons, anaesthetists and specialist&#xD;
      physiotherapists will explore how they estimate risks and outcomes of amputation surgery, and&#xD;
      how they communicate this to patients. Finally, the investigators will combine all this&#xD;
      information together and discuss our findings with groups of patients and healthcare&#xD;
      professionals, to identify key areas around amputation decision-making that can be improved&#xD;
      and how best to further examine those areas.&#xD;

        Participants are eligible for the study if they meet all of the following inclusion&#xD;
        criteria and none of the exclusion criteria apply. All queries about participant&#xD;
        eligibility should be directed to the Qualitative Researcher. We will purposively sample&#xD;
        participants from up to four participating NHS Health Boards / Trusts in Wales and England.&#xD;
        We will aim to include 8-10 surgeons, 1-3 anaesthetists and 1-3 specialist physiotherapists&#xD;
        from several Health Boards / Trusts. We will purposively sample patients for inclusion in&#xD;
        the audio-recorded consultations and interviews to ensure our sample has variation in terms&#xD;
        of gender, age, MLLA type (above knee/below knee/no amputation) and Health Board / Trust.&#xD;
