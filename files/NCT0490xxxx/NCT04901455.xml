  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the functional status of the nasal immune environment with LAIV&#xD;
      exposure in COPD persons with frequent exacerbations (defined as individuals with two or more&#xD;
      episodes of worsening in COPD symptoms requiring treatment with antibiotics and/or steroids&#xD;
      in the prior 12 months) and COPD persons without frequent exacerbations to determine acute&#xD;
      exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD)-associated dysfunction in a) cytokines and immune effector&#xD;
      cells of the nasal mucosa and b) viral replication. The investigators hypothesize that: 1)&#xD;
      COPD frequent exacerbators, compared to COPD infrequent exacerbators, will demonstrate&#xD;
      altered mucosal immune responses to LAIV exposure, and 2) COPD frequent exacerbators,&#xD;
      compared to COPD infrequent exacerbators, will demonstrate increased markers of influenza&#xD;
      viral replication after LAIV exposure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an early Phase 1, single-center, single-group unmasked exposure study of nasal&#xD;
      immune responses after controlled exposure to LAIV. This trial will test the differences in&#xD;
      the nasal immune responses to the nasal flu vaccine in two diseased groups of individuals&#xD;
      along with healthy controls: COPD persons with frequent exacerbations (defined as individuals&#xD;
      with two or more episodes of worsening in COPD symptoms requiring treatment with antibiotics&#xD;
      and/or steroids in the prior 12 months) and COPD persons without frequent exacerbations&#xD;
      (defined as individuals with less than two episodes of worsening in COPD symptoms requiring&#xD;
      treatment with antibiotics and/or steroids in the prior 12 months). A healthy control cohort&#xD;
      will also be recruited, defined as individuals with spirometry-confirmed normal lung function&#xD;
      and no asthma history. A total of 15 COPD frequent exacerbators, 15 infrequent exacerbators&#xD;
      and 10 healthy controls will be enrolled for this trial. Investigators will balance the sex&#xD;
      of participant as closely as possible to 50% male and 50% female.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening visit, after obtaining informed consent and authorization to obtain medical&#xD;
      records, all potential individuals will be screened for specific inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria to ensure suitability and safety to receive the influenza nasal vaccine. A baseline&#xD;
      assessment will be done including reviewing medical history and verifying eligibility, a&#xD;
      physical exam by a study investigator, spirometry testing before and after bronchodilator,&#xD;
      laboratory testing to screen for immunocompromised state [Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)&#xD;
      antibody testing, compete blood count (CBC) with differential], an assessment of symptoms,&#xD;
      and pregnancy testing if pre-menopausal. Women who are pregnant, nursing, or women who are&#xD;
      currently trying to become pregnant are not eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet eligibility after screening will be brought back for an enrollment&#xD;
      visit where they will undergo a baseline assessment of their nasal inflammatory state. This&#xD;
      includes sampling of the nose in three different ways. First, investigators will gently place&#xD;
      a small strip of absorbent paper inside the lower part of the nose, and a nose clip will be&#xD;
      applied for two minutes (ELF collection). Next, investigators will wash the inside of the&#xD;
      nose with a small amount of sterile salt water to collect samples (NLF collection). Finally,&#xD;
      investigators will take a small plastic device and gently scrape the inside of the nose to&#xD;
      collect nasal cells (scraping collection). Investigators will also collect blood samples for&#xD;
      inflammatory phenotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within two weeks of enrollment visit, all enrolled individuals will receive the nasal&#xD;
      influenza vaccine (there is no placebo component to the study). On days one, two, three, and&#xD;
      seven after vaccine administration, participants will return to the study site to undergo&#xD;
      nasal sampling including the nasal paper strip and washing, as well as blood collection. On&#xD;
      Day 3, a nasal scraping will also be obtained. On Day 21, investigators will obtain nasal&#xD;
      washing and blood collection. Investigators will collect patient reported outcomes using a&#xD;
      validated influenza severity score to assess for unbiased correlations with biological&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
