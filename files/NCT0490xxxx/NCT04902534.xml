      A single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetic phase I clinical study of Naoqingzhiming Tablets in Chinese&#xD;
      healthy subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The single-dose trial plan enrolls 52 Chinese healthy subjects. Qualified subjects will enter&#xD;
      6 dose groups in order from low to high: 180mg, 360mg, 720mg, 1080mg, 1620mg and 2160mg, with&#xD;
      increasing dose design The first group (180mg) is a pre-test. Two subjects were selected and&#xD;
      all received the test drug. They were observed for 24 hours after a single dose for safety&#xD;
      assessment, and followed up 7-10 days after leaving the group or early withdrawal. If more&#xD;
      than one subject has an adverse event that meets CTCAE V5.0 Grade II or above and is judged&#xD;
      to be related to the test drug, then consider reducing the dose, otherwise proceed to the&#xD;
      next dose group trial. Groups 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 follow the &quot;8+2 principle&quot;, with 10 subjects&#xD;
      in each group, 8 receive the test drug, and 2 receive the placebo. Observe for 24 hours after&#xD;
      a single dose for safety assessment , And follow up 7-10 days after leaving the group or&#xD;
      early withdrawal. Each subject received only one dose group of the trial, only one study drug&#xD;
      (experimental drug or placebo), and no longer participated in the other dose group trials or&#xD;
      took two study drugs. During the dose escalation process, after completing the safety&#xD;
      assessment of the previous dose group, if the dose escalation suspension standard is not met,&#xD;
      continue the test of the lower-dose group. It is not allowed to conduct the test of 2 or more&#xD;
      dose groups at the same time. In the above six groups of trials, it is not only necessary to&#xD;
      observe the safety and tolerability of the subjects taking the study drug, but also to&#xD;
      evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a single dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the results of animal pharmacokinetic studies, the dose grouping for the&#xD;
      multiple-dose study is tentatively set to 2 groups: 360mg group and 720mg group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multiple-dose study plan recruited 24 Chinese healthy subjects, following the &quot;10+2&#xD;
      principle&quot;, each group of 12 subjects, 10 cases received the test drug, 2 cases received&#xD;
      placebo, 3 times a day, continuous medication On 14 days, continue to observe for 24 hours&#xD;
      after the last administration for safety assessment, and follow up 7-10 days after leaving&#xD;
      the group or early withdrawal. In the process of continuous medication, if 3/10 and more than&#xD;
      3/10 of the subjects in a dose group who received the test drug withdraw from the trial due&#xD;
      to adverse events related to the test drug, the trial should be aborted; after completing the&#xD;
      first group, it is safe After the sexual assessment, if the suspension criteria are not met,&#xD;
      the second group of trials will continue. Each subject only participates in one group of&#xD;
      trials and only receives one study drug (experimental drug or placebo), and no longer&#xD;
      participates in other group trials or takes two study drugs. In the above two groups of&#xD;
      trials, it is not only necessary to observe the safety and tolerability of multiple&#xD;
      administrations, but also to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of multiple&#xD;
      administrations.&#xD;
