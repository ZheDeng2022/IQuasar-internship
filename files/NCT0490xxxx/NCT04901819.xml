      This is a cross-sectional observational study with the aim to assess longterm outcomes in a&#xD;
      large cohort of individuals with anorectal malformations. Patients managed for anorectal&#xD;
      malformations at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, Stockholm 1994-2017 will&#xD;
      be reviewed and they will be invited to respond to validated questionnaires evaluating bowel&#xD;
      function (&gt;4 years of age), urinary tract function (&gt;4 years of age), sexual function (&gt;18&#xD;
      years of age) and quality of life (&gt;8 years of age). Data will be analyzed with descriptive&#xD;
      and comparative statistics.&#xD;

      Background Anorectal malformations comprise a spectrum of congenital anomalies, that range&#xD;
      from mild anterior displacement of the anus to very complex anomalies, involving both the&#xD;
      hindgut and the urogenital tract. The birth prevalence in Sweden is approximately 1:3000 (1).&#xD;
      Associated anomalies are encountered in 50-60 % of individuals with anorectal malformation.&#xD;
      Anorectal malformations are associated with tethered cord in 20-30% of patients, which may&#xD;
      impair bowel and urinary tract function. Development of surgical techniques and neonatal care&#xD;
      have improved survival of children with anorectal malformations over the last decades. The&#xD;
      focus of care has shifted from survival to optimizing bowel and urinary tract function as&#xD;
      well as reducing the negative impact on quality of life. Current surgical techniques were&#xD;
      introduced during the early 1980's. The outcomes compare favorably with older techniques,&#xD;
      although there is still limited information on the outcomes up to adult age. Particularly,&#xD;
      there are limited data of composite outcomes of bowel function, urinary tract function,&#xD;
      sexual function and quality of life in comparison to age- and gender-matched controls from&#xD;
      the normal population. Newborn infants are often screened for tethered cord with ultrasound.&#xD;
      It is unclear if infants with normal ultrasound also need an MRI at a later stage to exclude&#xD;
      spinal cord anomalies. Tethered cord is frequently asymptomatic. There are conflicting data&#xD;
      with respect to prophylactic de-tethering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The overall aim of this project was to assess composite outcomes, bowel function,&#xD;
      urinary tract function, sexual function, and quality of life in a cross-sectional study of&#xD;
      children with ARM managed at Karolinska University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess if bowel function, urinary tract function, sexual function, and quality of&#xD;
           life is impaired in children with ARM compared with normative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess if bowel function, urinary tract function, sexual function and quality of life&#xD;
           correlate&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess if individuals with ARM and tethered cord benefit from detethering.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess if ultrasound of the spinal cord and MRI are equal imaging modalities to&#xD;
           diagnose tethered cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design Cross-sectional observational study. The STROBE Statement for reporting&#xD;
      of observational studies will be used (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings and participants All individuals managed for an anorectal malformation at Karolinska&#xD;
      University Hospital from 1994 to 2017 will be eligible for the study. Patients and/or parents&#xD;
      who provide informed consent and fill in the questionnaires will be included in the study.&#xD;
      There will be 300-400 eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources and variables Demographic and clinical details will be recorded retrospectively&#xD;
      from the medical records, including gender, birth weight, gestational age, associated&#xD;
      syndromes and anomalies, family history, presenting symptoms, type of ARM, surgical details&#xD;
      including postoperative complications and re-operations. Questionnaires will be sent&#xD;
      according to age to the participants to assess bowel function, urinary tract function, sexual&#xD;
      function, and quality of life. Questionnaires on sexual function and quality of life will not&#xD;
      be sent to individuals with intellectual impairment, eg. Down syndrome. It will be possible&#xD;
      to respond to the questionnaires using a digital platform. Bowel function will be assessed in&#xD;
      individuals more than 4 years of age using a bowel function score (BFS) questionnaire (3)&#xD;
      developed for assessment of bowel function in pediatric anorectal disorders and validated in&#xD;
      patients and in the general Finnish population (4). Urinary tract function will be assessed&#xD;
      in individuals more than 4 years of age with a questionnaire on lower urinary tract symptoms,&#xD;
      with questions addressing history of urinary tract infection, urgency, urge incontinence,&#xD;
      stress incontinence, straining to begin urination, and leakage of urine without physical&#xD;
      activity or apparent need to urinate, based on items adapted from the previously validated&#xD;
      Danish Prostatic Symptom Score. Profile of Sexual Female function will be used to assess&#xD;
      sexual function in the female patients more than 18 years of age. IIEF will be used to assess&#xD;
      sexual function in males more than 18 years of age. KIDSCREEN, a validated instrument&#xD;
      assessing children's and adolescents subjective health and well-being, will be used to assess&#xD;
      the quality of life in children and adolescents 8 to 18 years of age. In patients more than&#xD;
      18 years old, Psychological general well-being index (PGWB) will be used to assess quality of&#xD;
      life. In a sub-study, individuals with tethered cord will be identified. The outcomes among&#xD;
      patients with tethered cord who have undergone de-tethering will be compared with those who&#xD;
      have not undergone an operation. In a second sub-study, spinal cord ultrasound and MRI images&#xD;
      will be reviewed by two experienced pediatric radiologists in a blinded fashion. Correlation&#xD;
      between the two imaging modalities will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Pseudonymized data will be recorded in Excel spread sheets. Data will be&#xD;
      analyzed with descriptive and comparative statistics. Matched controls and normative&#xD;
      population-based data will be used for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Patients and/or caregivers will receive written information about the study and&#xD;
      provide written informed consent. Data that are entered into the project database will be&#xD;
      pseudonymized to protect privacy. The benefit of the study are considered to exceed the&#xD;
      risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance The knowledge of long-term outcomes up to adulthood in patients with anorectal&#xD;
      malformations is limited. Particularly controlled data are scanty. This study may contribute&#xD;
      important additional understanding and contribute to improved care of individuals with&#xD;
      anorectal malformations.&#xD;
&#xD;

      patients. Spring 2021: All patients will be invited to participate and questionnaires sent&#xD;
      out. Data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;

      summarized in publications.&#xD;
