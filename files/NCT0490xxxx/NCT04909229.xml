      the real-world effectiveness of a mobile-delivered, prescription digital therapeutic (PDT)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial to assess the real-world effectiveness&#xD;
      of a mobile-delivered, prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) device delivering Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (i.e., Somryst, herein called PEAR-003b) using a novel&#xD;
      patient-centered data sharing platform (called Hugo), with linkage to Fitbit (Inspire 2),&#xD;
      among 100 patients with chronic insomnia. Half of the patients with insomnia will receive the&#xD;
      PEAR-003b digital therapeutic with linkage to the Hugo platform and Fitbit (Inspire 2) and&#xD;
      half of the patients with insomnia will not receive the PDT but will receive a Fitbit and be&#xD;
      enrolled in the Hugo platform. The treatment duration will be 9 weeks with a 21-, 35-, and&#xD;
      61-week follow-up. All patients will be evaluated at baseline, as well as prompted to&#xD;
      complete additional assessments at weeks 9, 21, 35, and 61. The PEAR-003b intervention will&#xD;
      deliver CBT-I via mobile devices as 6 treatment core modules over 9 weeks. Additionally, the&#xD;
      Hugo platform will be used to collect patient-generated engagement data, healthcare&#xD;
      utilization outcomes, and patient activity/clinical outcomes. These real-world data points&#xD;
      and trends collected as part of this pilot investigation will help inform a future larger&#xD;
      healthcare effectiveness and outcomes research study.&#xD;

    <description>Insomnia will be measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score. Participants rate the severity of sleep problems (e.g. problems with sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakening), interference with daytime functioning, how noticeable the impairment is to others, distress or concern caused by the sleep problem(s), as well as satisfaction with the current sleep pattern on a 5-point Likert scale. The ISI's total score ranges from 0 (not clinically significant) to 28 (clinically significant)</description>
