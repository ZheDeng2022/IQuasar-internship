      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well women may adopt a Contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      Spectral Mammography (CESM) as their yearly breast screening test compared to the standard&#xD;
      2-D or 3-D mammogram.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an FDA approved tool for breast cancer&#xD;
      detection. However, adoption into clinical practice has been slow. In this study, we will&#xD;
      explore patient issues related to the use of CESM for breast cancer screening. For this&#xD;
      study, 210 women with heterogeneous or dense breast tissue reported on a previous mammogram,&#xD;
      will be recruited to undergo a screening Contrast-enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM). The&#xD;
      CESM will serve as the subject's annual screening breast exam for clinical care. A survey&#xD;
      will be administered before and after the examination that evaluates the patient experience.&#xD;
      Women will not be at high risk for breast cancer (&lt;20% lifetime risk). All abnormal findings&#xD;
      will be acted upon independently. Results of the general screening population survey will be&#xD;
      compared with those of women who choose to undergo the CESM examination in order to evaluate&#xD;
      the influence of age, education, and lifetime risk on decision making about advanced&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;

Data summarization: Pre and post CESM survey responses that are binary or Likert scaled responses will be summarized by frequencies and percentages. Pre and post CESM survey responses that are continuous scaled responses will be summarized by the mean and standard deviation, the median and interquartile range, and the range of distribution.</description>

    <description>Subject will be asked to complete a questionnaire that will ask you about your general attitude toward Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM). Questions will include:&#xD;
Thoughts regarding risk of breast cancer&#xD;
Concerns regarding contrast procedures such as the CESM&#xD;
Past mammogram/breast imaging experience</description>

    <description>CESM is a mammogram performed after the injection of IV contrast. CESM is used most often when additional information is needed after a standard mammogram. CESM has also been used to determine the extent of a known breast cancer, to screen patients at high risk for developing breast cancer due to a family history or positive cancer genes, and for women with dense breast tissue. Two images are taken almost at the same time during the exam, after the iodine based contrast injection is administered. The first image is comparable to a regular mammogram. The second image shows areas that take up the contrast (enhance) showing increased blood flow. Breast cancers often enhance with contrast due to a greater amount of blood vessels. Non-cancerous lesions can also have greater blood flow.</description>
