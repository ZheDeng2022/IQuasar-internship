  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proof of concept clinical study will investigate the efficacy of active lens with frame&#xD;
      in alleviating the symptoms of migraine which are caused by photosensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spectacles cut out blue light wavelength and hypothetically alleviate symptoms of&#xD;
      migraine and thus either treat or prevent migraine headaches from occurring.&#xD;

      Patients will be randomised to one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients wear sham glasses for 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients have 1 week's washout&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients wear active glasses for 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients wear active glasses for 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients have 1 week's washout&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients wear sham glasses for 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will aim to determine whether wearing the active lens successfully reduces the&#xD;
      symptoms of migraine, compared to wearing sham lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a fairly conservative SD in the primary endpoint of 8 points, a total of 56&#xD;
      participants would be required to have 90% power to detect a minimum clinically significant&#xD;
      difference of 5 points in a two-sample t-test. Allowing for a 20% drop-out rate, 70&#xD;
      participants would need to be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be in the trial for a total of 13 weeks (4 week run-in, two 4 week periods,&#xD;
      with 1 week washout in between).&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is the change in Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) score from end of run-in (Baseline) to end of treatment period following 4 weeks of treatment. The HIT 6 questionnaire is a licensed questionnaire with standardised calculations to assess the responses to the questions in the questionnaire.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 13 weeks for each patients participation</time_frame>
    <description>A headache diary. A headache diary serves to:&#xD;
Monitor the frequency, duration and severity of your headaches over time&#xD;
Identify patterns that may help determine triggers and improve treatment&#xD;
Track medication use and response&#xD;
Maintain long term records of what has worked and what has not</description>

    <description>Migraine episodes are often triggered or exacerbated by environmental factors, particularly light. Active lens has been designed by blocking particular range of wavelength and hypothetically alleviate symptoms of migraine and thus either treat or prevent migraine headaches from occurring.&#xD;
