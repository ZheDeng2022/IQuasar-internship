  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the impact of patient and&#xD;
      provider facing educational materials and peer comparison on medical testing conversations&#xD;
      during annual physicals. The investigators hypothesize that education materials and peer&#xD;
      comparison will improve conversation quality about medical testing decisions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical tests may show unexpected findings leading to additional tests, treatments, and&#xD;
      visits that cost money and take time but may not have benefits. This is a prevalent issue&#xD;
      with major consequences for patients and clinicians. Making informed decisions about when to&#xD;
      order medical tests may help avoid unnecessary costs and worry. However, doctors don't always&#xD;
      have detailed conversations about medical testing and there are patient gaps in knowledge.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that education materials and peer comparison to promote&#xD;
      conversations about medical tests will improve conversation quality about medical testing&#xD;
      decisions. The investigators have developed patient and provider-facing interventions to&#xD;
      educate on and promote conversations about the uses and consequences of medical tests, and&#xD;
      the investigators will test the impact of this just-in-time educational and peer comparison&#xD;
      intervention on the likelihood of patients having productive conversations about medical&#xD;
      tests. The effects of the intervention will be assessed using surveys before and after the&#xD;
      study. This work has the potential to help patients feel more supported by their healthcare&#xD;
      system, empower patients to participate in shared decision-making, and build trust between&#xD;
      patients and clinicians.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>20 primary care physicians will be recruited and randomized to an intervention and a control arm. For each physician, we will recruit 10 of their patients with upcoming scheduled physicals. All included patients of intervention physicians will receive the intervention, and all included patients of control physicians will receive general patient visit prep materials.</intervention_model_description>
