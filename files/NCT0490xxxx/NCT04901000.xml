  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective analysis of all patients that underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for&#xD;
      stenotic disease - diagnosed at pre-operative investigation - prior to CABG as staged&#xD;
      operation within 6- months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of postoperative stroke and complications was compared between CEA performed under&#xD;
      Local anaesthetic (LA) to those performed under General anaesthetic (GA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcome was the rate of postoperative stroke in patients that had staged CEA&#xD;
      prior to CABG. This was defined as CEA within a period of 4 weeks prior to CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We retrospectively looked at those patients that fulfilled the inclusion criteria and had CEA&#xD;
      performed either under LA (Group A) or under GA (Group B). We measured the 30 days'&#xD;
      postoperative stroke rate as the main outcome. We also looked at the rate of intraoperative&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, we assessed the rate for developing nerve injuries and/or hematoma&#xD;
      postoperatively. Finally, we examined the risk for developing postoperative stroke in&#xD;
      patients with bilateral significant carotid artery disease that underwent surgery in one&#xD;
      side.&#xD;
