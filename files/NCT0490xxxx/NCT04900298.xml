  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of a personal hand hygiene system (SafeHavenTM) by&#xD;
      anesthesia providers in the adult operating room, combined with a novel infectious pathogen&#xD;
      tracking system (OR PathTrac) will decrease participant exposure to pathologic bacteria in&#xD;
      the adult operating room.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, single center, unmasked, controlled before and after study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Arm: Use of SafeHaven hand hygiene system in the operating room&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Arm: Standard of care hand hygiene&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operating Room Selection: Two patients (case-pair) having surgery in a serial manner in a&#xD;
      randomly selected operating room will be evaluated for detection of pathogenic bacteria. The&#xD;
      operating room for investigation will be randomly selected through the following process:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All the operating rooms with scheduled surgeries in the South Operating Rooms on a&#xD;
           particular day will be entered into a random number generator (example: operating rooms&#xD;
           2, 3, 5, 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The random generator will sort these operating rooms into a rank list (example:&#xD;
           operating rooms 5, 3, 2, 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The investigators will start at the top of this list and work down until the first&#xD;
           operating room meeting all inclusion criteria is found (example: operating room 5 only&#xD;
           has one surgery, operating room 3 has pediatric surgery, operating room 2 meets&#xD;
           inclusion criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. This process will be duplicated for each case-pair&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to map transmission of bacteria through the operating room and&#xD;
      compare mapping with the SafeHaven Hand Hygiene system to mapping without the SafeHaven Hand&#xD;
      Hygiene system. Thus, case-pairs will be randomized to the same assignment. For example,&#xD;
      subject 1 and 2 will have surgery in South Operating Room 8 and both will be randomized to&#xD;
      the control group. The first 10 case-pairs will be assigned to the control arm and the second&#xD;
      10 case-pairs will be assigned to the intervention arm.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a prospective, single center, unmasked, controlled before and after study. Two patients (case-pair) having surgery in a serial manner in a randomly selected operating room will be evaluated for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. The first twenty patients (10 case-pairs) will be enrolled in the control (standard care) arm followed by 20 patients (10 case-pairs) being enrolled in the intervention (SafeHaven) arm.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Anesthesia providers in the intervention arm will be given a personal hand hygiene device, containing 64% ethyl alcohol, which provides actionable real-time performance feedback. The personalized device will be affixed to the provider's waist and will remain there for use throughout the perioperative period. Performance feedback is given to the anesthesia provider in real time with the number of personal hand hygiene events and an hourly hand hygiene rate, which is displayed on the device. Devices will be handed out to participating providers in the preoperative bay and retrieved in the post-anesthesia care unit upon case completion.</description>
