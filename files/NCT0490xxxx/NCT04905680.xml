  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to address two questions. Firstly, how might a suite of interventions and&#xD;
      data feedback (activity, diet, mood*, continuous blood glucose) through coaching be effective&#xD;
      in influencing behaviour change for individuals at-risk of developing type 2 diabetes?&#xD;
      Secondly, what elements of coaching might be extracted for automated implementation in a&#xD;
      scalable coach-light model?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Face-to-face health coaching is a common lifestyle intervention for healthy individuals who&#xD;
      are at risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes. However, it is highly resource-intensive&#xD;
      and has limitations in scaling up to reach wider populations. Advances in technology present&#xD;
      opportunities to scale health coaching to the wider population through automation, enabling&#xD;
      the delivery of personalised messages for individuals via mobile applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices could also potentially augment the&#xD;
      effectiveness of health coaching by providing coaches with a tool for coachees'&#xD;
      self-discovery of their individual physiological responses to lifestyles and modifications&#xD;
      such as diet and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, the present study seeks to leverage smart wearable devices (e.g., Bluetooth&#xD;
      smartwatches) and CGM devices accompanying a customized mobile application to deliver&#xD;
      lifestyle coaching interventions. This suite of lifestyle interventions, including feedback&#xD;
      about their own blood glucose levels, aims to influence participant's lifestyles and&#xD;
      behaviours through guided self-discovery and face-to-face coaching. This intervention will be&#xD;
      compared with a control group to examine its effects on lifestyle change, anthropometric&#xD;
      measures and biometric measures. In addition, the findings from this study will contribute to&#xD;
      the development of a novel coach-light intervention that can be implemented at a wider&#xD;
      population level via Singapore's Health Promotion Board's (HPB) existing programmes and&#xD;
      channels.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is an experimental-control study design where up to 260 individuals at risk of developing diabetes (blood glucose levels of 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L) will be randomly allocated to the experimental and control groups (1:1 randomization).&#xD;
Participants in the control group will not receive any health coaching and are not required to carry out any study activities after they have completed the baseline lifestyle tracking session. At the end of the study, they will attend a 20- to 30-minute session with a coach to have their baseline lifestyle tracking results explained to them and receive personalised suggestions on lifestyle modifications.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The health screening before the study and at the end of study will collect anthropometric data (height, weight, waist and hip circumference), blood pressure data, and blood samples (for testing of HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin and lipid profile). Individuals are provided with an educational brochure upon receiving their screening results. Participants will then go through a baseline lifestyle tracking session using a study-issued smartphone and smartwatch, pre-installed with certain study applications. For participants in the control arm, there is no health coaching or study activities until the end of the study, where individuals will attend a 20- to 30-minute session with a coach to have their baseline lifestyle tracking results explained to them and receive personalised suggestions on lifestyle modifications.</description>

    <description>The activities during health screening before the study and at the end of study is similar to the control. Individuals are provided with an educational brochure upon receiving their screening results. Participants will then go through a baseline lifestyle tracking session using a study-issued smartphone and smartwatch, pre-installed with certain study applications, which will be used for the lifestyle tracking sessions. The experimental arm will go through 4 additional lifestyle tracking sessions (i.e., total of 5 including baseline), of which 1 will include Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) tracking. For this CGM tracking session, participants will receive real-time feedback through the study applications, which will display the CGM trace. The data collected during the lifestyle tracking sessions will be discussed with the participants during 3 face-to-face coaching and 2 tele-coaching sessions, where the participants will develop and implement lifestyle change action plans.</description>
