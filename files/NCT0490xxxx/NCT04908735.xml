  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is an effective but toxic therapy, and lung injury&#xD;
      affects as many as 25% of children receiving HSCT. Improved transplant techniques and major&#xD;
      improvements in survival mean that HSCT is being more widely used, and more mismatched grafts&#xD;
      are being used. Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is a major limitation of pediatric HSCT success&#xD;
      as BO is commonly diagnosed late in children, when lung injury is irreversible, leading to&#xD;
      long term morbidity or even death. Currently, there are major gaps in our knowledge regarding&#xD;
      incidence, etiology and optimal treatment of BO following HSCT, and important diagnostic&#xD;
      limitations specific to children. Diagnosis of BO is usually based on performance of&#xD;
      pulmonary function tests, which is usually impossible in ill children under 10. Even older&#xD;
      children who feel unwell or un-cooperative may be unable to produce interpretable data. These&#xD;
      deficiencies in diagnosis mean that BO is commonly diagnosed late, meaning fibrosis has&#xD;
      occurred and lesions are irreversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this interventional trial is that early treatment with standard&#xD;
      Flovent/montelukast and steroids plus ruxolitinib will reverse lung injury and reduce the&#xD;
      frequency of chronic pulmonary impairment or florid BO.&#xD;
