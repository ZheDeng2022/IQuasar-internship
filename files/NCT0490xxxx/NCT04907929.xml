  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that in deaf people, cortical reorganisation occurs and can accelerate&#xD;
      age-related cognitive decline. Therefore, even though a number of Cochlear Implantation&#xD;
      Reference Centres are setting up tests to detect cognitive disorders, these remain global and&#xD;
      not very specific to deafness. Similarly, auditory rehabilitation could make cognitive&#xD;
      decline reversible and bring about major changes in the cognitive functioning of patients&#xD;
      which will be decisive for the effectiveness of speech therapy and the effectiveness of&#xD;
      implantation. Indeed, it has been shown that, in the deaf postlingual patient, less neuronal&#xD;
      activity in the auditory cortex and a reallocation of the cortical regions dedicated to&#xD;
      auditory processing to visual tasks took place. This could subsequently influence the outcome&#xD;
      of the cochlear implant. The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      targeted speech therapy aimed at cognitive reorganisation on post-implant gain.&#xD;

    <measure>Verbal fluency test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This test consists of giving as many words as possible beginning with the same letter in two minutes (phonological fluencies) and as many words of the same category in two minutes (semantic fluencies). The interest of the study of fluencies is that they allow us to observe both the preferred functioning of patients (semantic vs. phonological) and other components such as working memory and semantic memory. The duration of this test is four minutes.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Grober et Buschke's test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This test assesses verbal memory and is composed of 16 items belonging to 16 different semantic categories. Indicative recall is used to check the efficiency of encoding and to dissociate memory disorders according to their type.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Door test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This test assesses visual-spatial episodic memory. It consists of presenting 24 pictures of doors to the patient. The patient must then recognise each of these doors in the presence of three distractors. It is divided into two parts which differ in terms of difficulty of recognition.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety end Depression scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HAD scale is an instrument to screen for anxiety and depressive disorders. It consists of 14 items rated from 0 to 3. Seven questions relate to anxiety (total A) and seven others to the depressive dimension.</description>
