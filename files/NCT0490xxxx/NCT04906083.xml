      randomized, prospective, randomized controlled Phase IV Clinical trial to discuss the&#xD;

      End stage liver disease is prone to thrombocytopenia. This study aims to discuss the Efficacy&#xD;
      and Safety of Avatrombopag in Patients with End-stage Liver Disease and Thrombocytopenia in a&#xD;
      multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial. The patients were divided into one of&#xD;
      the groups according to if receiving avatrombopag. Avatrombopag was taken to maintain&#xD;
      platelet count 50~100×10^9/L. Starting dose is recommended according to the patient's&#xD;
      baseline platelet count level. Routine treatment was taken in the Control group and&#xD;
      Interventional group. This trial will take about 2 to 2.5 years from the first participant&#xD;
      signing an informed consent form (ICF) until all study-related telephone follow-ups or visits&#xD;
      end.&#xD;
