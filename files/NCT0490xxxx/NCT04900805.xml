  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The temperature on selected points of the hands has been monitored during meditative&#xD;
      practices. The practitioner is in complete rest for the time of the measure, and only mental&#xD;
      activity is carried out. The purpose is to verify if the heat sensation, that is normally&#xD;
      felt, is a real, measurable physiological effect, or if it is just a subjective feeling.&#xD;
      Quantitative data analysis is foreseen.&#xD;

      Qigong is a traditional Chinese method for wellness and healing. During practice, which is&#xD;
      based on the Qi circulation, it is usual to feel warmth, especially at the hands. The main&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to verify if the sensation of heat is not just a subjective feeling&#xD;
      but is a real, measurable physiological effect. Quantitative information will be hopefully&#xD;
      derived from a simple data analysis. The study will be extended also to deep prayer&#xD;
      meditation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement sessions will consist of two periods of practice separated by one pause&#xD;
      period, to ensure that the temperature variation is not due to spurious effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T type thermocouples will be used for the temperature measurements, with sensors in the form&#xD;
      of small copper disk. The thermocouples will be connected to a data logger, and the results&#xD;
      analyzed. The sensors will be positioned in different points of the hands, either on the palm&#xD;
      and on the dorsum. The Laogong (PC8) acupuncture point will be preferentially chosen, because&#xD;
      is a very important point, from the energetic point of view, of the Traditional Chinese&#xD;
      Medicine. and because the sensation of heat is more acute in this point. Other points will be&#xD;
      also measured, and compared with the Laogong.&#xD;
