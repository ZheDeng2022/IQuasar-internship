  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SY-1425 is being studied as a treatment for participants with a type of leukemia called acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia, or AML for short. SY-1425 is being studied as a treatment for participants&#xD;
      with AML whose cancer has a specific genetic abnormality characterized by the overexpression&#xD;
      of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene. This genetic profile is found in about 3 of&#xD;
      every 10 people with AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial, SY-1425 will be given with 2 other drugs that are already used together to&#xD;
      treat people who have AML and who cannot start treatment with standard chemotherapy.&#xD;

      This study consists of 3 parts. In Part 1, the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      evaluation of SY-1425/venetoclax/azacitidine combination will inform the appropriate triplet&#xD;
      dose and regimen for Part 2. In Part 2, participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either&#xD;
      SY-1425/venetoclax/azacitidine or venetoclax/azacitidine to explore comparative clinical&#xD;
      activity of the 2 combinations. In Part 3, SY-1425 will be added to the&#xD;
      venetoclax/azacytidine regimen of a subset of Part 2 participants who experience progressive&#xD;
      disease, relapse after initial complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete blood count&#xD;
      recovery (CRi) response, or treatment failure.&#xD;
