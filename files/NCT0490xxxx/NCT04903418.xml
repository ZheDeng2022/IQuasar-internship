      There have been no cross-sectional studies conducted on the Egyptian population studying the&#xD;
      relationship between maxillary sinus floor and the maxillary posterior root tips position&#xD;
      using CBCT, and whether the maxillary sinus mucosal thickening is associated with periapical&#xD;
      lesions as well as periodontal disease. Such study will raise the diagnostic and&#xD;
      interpretational abilities of dental radiologists and decision making of oral surgeons and&#xD;
      endodontists.&#xD;

      II-Introduction In the human body, the first and largest, sinus to develop is the Maxillary&#xD;
      Sinus (MS). The growth of this sinus begins in the intrauterine period of life, and reaches&#xD;
      its maximum size and forms the shape of a pyramid by the time of the third molar eruption or&#xD;
      at the age of approximately 21 years. The inferior wall of sinus is lined with Schneiderian&#xD;
      membrane which is the unique lining of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses (Kilic et al.,&#xD;
      2010). Normally, the thickness of the Schneiderian membrane is approximately 1 mm (Cakur B et&#xD;
      al., 2013; Borgonovo et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Odontogenic sinusitis is the most common result of iatrogenic injury of Schneiderian membrane&#xD;
      which could result in its thickening due to inflammatory reaction (Troeltzsch et al., 2015;&#xD;
      Zirk et al., 2017). Tooth extraction, posterior maxillary dental implant placement, sinus&#xD;
      lift, and orthognathic surgery are the main cause relations of odontogenic sinusitis. Other&#xD;
      potential causes include periodontal and periapical diseases (Pen˜arrocha-Oltra et al.,&#xD;
      2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed study of the proximity of the maxillary posterior teeth root apices to the maxillary&#xD;
      sinus floor (MSF) is a mandatory step before some procedures as endodontic procedures in&#xD;
      order to avoid over-instrumentation or over-filling of restorative materials. Pushing foreign&#xD;
      material into the MS may result in the spread of infection (Obayashiet al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The condition of maxillary posterior teeth is usually examined by periapical and panoramic&#xD;
      radiographs during routine dental visits. However, plain films are 2-dimensional to represent&#xD;
      the 3-dimensional structures which make it difficult to evaluate the actual relation between&#xD;
      sinus floor and adjacent teeth (Whyte et al., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography (CT) is considered the gold standard for sinus diagnosis (Mafee et al.,&#xD;
      2006). However, recently, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely utilized in oral and&#xD;
      maxillofacial region and provides several advantages over traditional CT, including lower&#xD;
      radiation dose and chair side process (Scarfe et al., 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of CBCT to assess the presence and possible spread of infection from the periapical&#xD;
      area to the MSF achieved prompt radiological diagnosis and allowed superior treatment options&#xD;
      and minimized the possibility of complications (Oberli et al., 2007; Estrela et al., 2008;&#xD;
      Nunes et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several 3-D radiographic studies involving the maxillofacial region revealed apical&#xD;
      protrusion of the maxillary root apices into the MS but with significant variation between&#xD;
      populations (Mudgade, D. K. et al., 2018; Hameed, K. S. et al., 2020) Considering the&#xD;
      individual variations of position between different maxillary posterior teeth, the aim of&#xD;
      this study is to detect the relationship between maxillary sinus floor and the maxillary&#xD;
      posterior root tips position, and to find the association between periapical lesions as well&#xD;
      as periodontal disease and maxillary sinus mucosal thickening in a sample of Egyptian&#xD;
      population using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6c. Specific objectives: To detect the relationship between maxillary sinus floor and root&#xD;
      tips position of maxillary premolars versus maxillary molars&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find the association between periapical lesions and maxillary sinus mucosal thickening&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find the association between periodontal disease and maxillary sinus mucosal thickening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: null&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of the Problem Close relationship of maxillary posterior teeth root tips to&#xD;
      maxillary sinus may lead to perforation of its floor, formation of oro-antral fistula, or&#xD;
      root displacement into the maxillary sinus during endodontic treatment, tooth extraction, or&#xD;
      any surgical procedure. Other conditions, including, periapical infection and periodontal&#xD;
      diseases may have a precursor effect on the occurrence of sinus mucosal thickening.&#xD;
      Therefore, accurate evaluation of the anatomic relationship of maxillary sinus and posterior&#xD;
      teeth is crucial in the clinical practice for preoperative treatment planning in order to&#xD;
      avoid such complications.&#xD;
