  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Less toxic and more effective treatments are needed for cancers caused by viruses. These&#xD;
      cancers include Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, head and neck&#xD;
      cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gastric cancer, anal cancer, cervical cancer, vaginal&#xD;
      cancer, vulvar cancer, penile cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and&#xD;
      leiomyosarcoma. Researchers want to see if a combination of drugs can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find a safe dose of pomalidomide plus nivolumab in people with cancers caused by viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 or older who have cancers caused by Epstein Barr virus (EBV), human herpes&#xD;
      virus 8/Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (HHV8/KSHV), human papilloma virus (HPV), hepatitis B or C&#xD;
      virus (HBV/HCV), and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) that have not responded to previous&#xD;
      treatments or have relapsed, or in adults who do not want to have surgery because of&#xD;
      disfigurement or other risks. Adults who have HIV with any CD4 T cell count are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with blood and urine tests, scans, and heart tests. They will&#xD;
      have a physical exam. Their ability to perform normal daily activities will be assessed. They&#xD;
      may have a tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be given in 28-day cycles. Participants will take pomalidomide as a tablet by&#xD;
      mouth for 21 days of each cycle, for up to 24 cycles. They will get nivolumab by intravenous&#xD;
      infusion once each cycle. They will take an aspirin each day until 30 days after their last&#xD;
      dose of the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a pill diary. They will bring it to their study visit at the end of&#xD;
      each cycle. At these visits, some screening tests will be repeated. Participants with Kaposi&#xD;
      sarcoma will have pictures taken of their lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give blood and saliva samples for research. They may have optional anal&#xD;
      and/or cervical swabs. They may have optional biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit 30 days after they stop taking the study drugs, then&#xD;
      every month for 100 days. Some screening tests will be repeated. Then they may by contacted&#xD;
      by phone every 3 months for 9 months, and then every 6 months thereafter....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is an unmet need for less toxic and more effective treatments for virus-associated&#xD;
           malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pomalidomide induces polyfunctional T cell, NK cell, and dendritic cell activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pomalidomide has shown promising activity in Kaposi sarcoma, likely due in part to&#xD;
           immune modulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Downregulation and/or deregulation of immune surface markers by viruses can thwart&#xD;
           immunologic therapy, which may be prevented or reversed by pomalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PD-L1 is expressed in virus-associated malignancies and modulation of PD-1 signaling is&#xD;
           a promising approach to treatment of virus-associated malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Checkpoint inhibitors used alone have been shown to have some activity in certain&#xD;
           virus-induced tumors (e.g. Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, Merkel cell carcinoma, and&#xD;
           HPV-associated nasopharyngeal cancer). It is thus rational to explore combination&#xD;
           strategies that overcome viral-mediated immune evasion and provide potentially better&#xD;
           immunologic anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Assess the safety and tolerability of pomalidomide plus nivolumab (Pom/Nivo) in participants&#xD;
      with virus-associated solid malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically or cytologically proven selected virus-associated tumors that are&#xD;
           systemic, metastatic or locally advanced and not amenable to curative treatment options&#xD;
           or relapsed/refractory to first-line therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For solid tumors or hematologic malignancies at least one measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least five measurable cutaneous KS lesions with no previous local radiation, surgical&#xD;
           or intralesional cytotoxic therapy to these measurable lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG Performance Status (PS) less than or equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be willing to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants can be HIV positive or negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV+ patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants receiving other investigational agents will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a Phase I study assessing the safety and efficacy of a fixed dose of nivolumab&#xD;
           combined with increasing doses of pomalidomide in participants with viral associated&#xD;
           malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 6 participants treated in a 3+3 dose de-escalation schema for pomalidomide using&#xD;
           one dose de-escalation and one dose escalation levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following identification of an optimal dose, an expansion phase will be initiated&#xD;
           through a protocol amendment. Up to 30 participants will be enrolled. Of these 12&#xD;
           participants must have a KS diagnosis and 12 participants must have EBV and/or&#xD;
           KSHV-associated lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab will be administered IV at a dose of 480 mg at day one of each cycle, except&#xD;
           for cycle one when it will be administered on day 8. One cycle equals 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pomalidomide will be administered as an oral planned starting dose of 3 mg daily.&#xD;
           Pomalidomide will be given from day 1 to day 21 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive therapy up to 24 cycles or until unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
           clinical progression, the participant s request to discontinue therapy, or PI decision.&#xD;

                    -  Mycobacterium avium infection in last 6 months or that has been treated for&#xD;
                       at least 1 month&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  For participants with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection,&#xD;
                       participants must be on suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Participantatients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must&#xD;
                       have been treated and cured. For participants with HCV infection who are&#xD;
                       currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV&#xD;
                       viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Able to take aspirin 81mg daily or a substitute thromboprophylaxis such as&#xD;
                       low molecular weight heparin at a prophylactic dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Participants with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain&#xD;
                       imaging after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no&#xD;
                       evidence of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Participants with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain&#xD;
                       metastases) or leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician&#xD;
                       determines that immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is&#xD;
                       unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Participants with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or&#xD;
                       treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or&#xD;
                       efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this&#xD;
                       trial, such as carcinoma in situ or low-grade prostate carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Participants may not have cardiac or pulmonary abnormalities severe enough&#xD;
                       that they would pose a danger to receive treatment. To mitigate risks for&#xD;
                       cardiac AEs, screening EKG, echocardiogram, CPK, and troponin will be&#xD;
                       required and significant abnormalities as determined by the PI will need to&#xD;
                       be evaluated by Cardiology prior to enrollment. Participants with pulmonary&#xD;
                       symptoms will be required to undergo pulmonary function testing and&#xD;
                       Pulmonary evaluation at the discretion of the PI prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Current or history of systemic autoimmune disease requiring systemic&#xD;
                       immunosuppressive therapy will not be allowed. Note: the following will not&#xD;
                       be exclusionary: 1) the presence of laboratory evidence of autoimmune&#xD;
                       disease (e.g. positive antinuclear antibody titer or lupus anticoagulant)&#xD;
                       without associated symptoms; 2) clinical evidence of vitiligo or other forms&#xD;
                       of depigmenting illness; 3) mild&#xD;
&#xD;
        autoimmunity not impacting the function of major organs (e.g. controlled Hashimoto&#xD;
        thyroiditis, limited psoriasis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons of childbearing potential (PCBP, defined as a sexually mature person assigned&#xD;
             female at birth who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or&#xD;
             2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, i.e., has&#xD;
             had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months) must have a negative&#xD;
             serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10-14&#xD;
             days prior to and again within 24 hours of starting pomalidomide and must either&#xD;
             commit to continued abstinence from receptive vaginal intercourse or begin TWO&#xD;
             acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional&#xD;
             effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking&#xD;
             pomalidomide. PCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Persons assigned male&#xD;
             at birth must agree to use a latex condom during penetrative vaginal intercourse with&#xD;
             a PCBP even if they have had a vasectomy. All participants must be counseled at a&#xD;
             minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had anticancer treatment within the last 2 weeks, unless the&#xD;
             cancer treatment is for a malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have&#xD;
             the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial, such as local treatment for&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ or hormonal therapy for prostate or breast carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer&#xD;
             therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; Grade 1) with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Elevated triglyceride attributed to ART and/or HIV (must be less than or equal to&#xD;
                  Grade 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Laboratory or clinical abnormalities that are assessed as more likely to be from&#xD;
                  the underlying tumors, HIV disease, or other non-treatment causes will not be&#xD;
                  considered an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alopecia, neuropathy and ototoxicity (i.e., AEs that are not expected to improve&#xD;
                  within the washout period)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be excluded if they are on systemic steroid therapy that cannot be&#xD;
             discontinued, with the exception of the use of prednisone or equivalent&#xD;
             &lt;0.125mg/kg/day as replacement therapy. Inhaled or topical steroids are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to pomalidomide and/or nivolumab or compounds&#xD;
             of similar chemical or biologic composition to pomalidomide and/or nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received prior allogeneic stem cell or organ transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with severe uncontrolled intercurrent illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cirrhosis with Child-Pugh score of B or C&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance&#xD;
             with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and nursing persons are excluded from this study because pomalidomide is a&#xD;
             thalidomide analog. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes severe birth&#xD;
             defects or embryo-fetal death. These potential risks may also apply to nivolumab based&#xD;
             on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies. In animal reproduction&#xD;
             studies, administration of nivolumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of&#xD;
             organogenesis through delivery resulted in increased abortion and premature infant&#xD;
             death.&#xD;
