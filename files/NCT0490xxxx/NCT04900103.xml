  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      How can offer support to patients and families through a volunteer caring program based on&#xD;
      new technologies? The aim of this study is to implement and evaluate a volunteer training&#xD;
      programme in the use of new technologies: ITV-Pal Programme to support patients facing a&#xD;
      life-threatening illness and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will created two groups of volunteers, one group will follow the CUDECA standard training&#xD;
      program, the other will follow the proposed intervention, ITV-Pal programme. Volunteers will&#xD;
      be allocated randomly to each group. Second stage will consist in the implementation of the&#xD;
      direct support to patients and families through the volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expectation is that ITV-Pal volunteers trained will be able to increase general welfare&#xD;
      of patients and families they care for. To test it, the quality of life of patients, families&#xD;
      and volunteers, the quality of the dying process, and identify how new technology supports&#xD;
      volunteer end of life care will be measure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The inclusion of volunteers to the Team in the care of the patient and the family is&#xD;
      continually increasing. The requests for volunteers by the Medical Care Teams have been&#xD;
      increasing year after year by 5%, reaching about 75 requests received in 2019. 85% of these&#xD;
      requests are assigned a volunteer and the 15% who are not assigned is because the volunteer&#xD;
      does not have the required profile which responds to the patient's needs. These statistics&#xD;
      show, on the one hand, the important and irreplaceable work that volunteers offer in social&#xD;
      support to the patient and this is perceived both by the patient and their family who decide&#xD;
      to have it, and also by the Care Team that is aware of the benefits of &quot;non-professional&quot;&#xD;
      care, which also humanises palliative care. On the other hand, the volunteer is increasingly&#xD;
      present in our society and this is positive, so that more people offer their collaboration&#xD;
      and this in turn &quot;normalises&quot; their role in palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although volunteers contribute millions of hours of work, the review of bibliography found no&#xD;
      sufficiently robust studies to merit inclusion, and even less when associating PC&#xD;
      volunteering and NT. As more research is needed on the impact of training and support for&#xD;
      palliative care volunteers, this study intends to study the state of art of technophilia and&#xD;
      technophobia among patients, relatives, volunteers and healthcare professionals in PC, and&#xD;
      according to the results, implement and evaluate a volunteer training programme in the use of&#xD;
      new technology to support patients dying at home and their relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best approach to evaluate the implementation process of complex intervention is the&#xD;
      combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Basic quantitative measures of&#xD;
      implementation may be combined with in-depth qualitative data to provide detailed&#xD;
      understandings of intervention functioning on a small scale. Use quantitative methods to&#xD;
      measure key process variables and allow testing of pre-hypothesised mechanisms of impact and&#xD;
      contextual moderators. Use qualitative methods to capture emerging changes in implementation,&#xD;
      experiences of the intervention and unanticipated or complex causal pathways, and to generate&#xD;
      new theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pragmatic cluster randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy (the unit of&#xD;
           randomization is the volunteer and the unit of analysis is the patient/relative).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before-after design for satisfaction of volunteers and HPC with the intervention and its&#xD;
           implementation to test the effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost-utility study from the perspective of the funder with a time horizon of one year. A&#xD;
           detailed cost analysis including costs for the adaptation of volunteer standard course&#xD;
           to ITVPal Programme as well as the recruitment and training costs of the volunteers will&#xD;
           be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative approach: interviews (individuals and groupal) with HPC, volunteers and with key&#xD;
      informants of patients/relatives to test at the beginning the need and usefulness of NT, and&#xD;
      also during the implementation process to test changes and experiences.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life. five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.&#xD;
to describe and value health across a wide range of disease areas. They are also frequently used in research into health in the general population.</description>
