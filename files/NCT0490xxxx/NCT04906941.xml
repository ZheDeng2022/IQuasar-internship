      Patients meeting the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria will be offered to participate in&#xD;
      the study. If they agree, they will perform an MRI without injection to obtain the QSM then&#xD;
      perform the MRI with injection that was prescribed to them as part of the care, then they&#xD;
      will perform a second time the MRI without injection to obtain the QSM. They will also answer&#xD;
      a short questionnaire documenting their previous exposure to gadolinium.&#xD;
