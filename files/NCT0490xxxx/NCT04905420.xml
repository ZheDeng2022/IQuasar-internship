      A Multi-centre, retrospective study describing the impact of PCCM standardized implementation&#xD;
      on healthcare management among Asthma or COPD or Asthma-COPD overlap patients in Tianjin city&#xD;
      of China, using real world electronic medical record database collected in local health care&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center retrospective study to describe the impact of PCCM on healthcare&#xD;
      management of Asthma or COPD or ACO patients in Tianjin healthcare big data platform database&#xD;
      in China from Jan 01, 2015 to Jun 30, 2020. The impact of PCCM on healthcare management among&#xD;
      Asthma or COPD or ACO patients will be explored. Analyses will be performed separately by&#xD;
      disease, by hospitals with or without PCCM implementation, by period (pre-PCCM vs post-PCCM&#xD;
      period) and by hospital grade. Patients enrolled into pre-PCCM period who also had post-PCCM&#xD;
      visit(s) will be counted separately in two periods. The statistical analyses of this study&#xD;
      will be primarily descriptive in nature and does not attempt to test any specific a priori&#xD;
      hypotheses unless otherwise specified.&#xD;
