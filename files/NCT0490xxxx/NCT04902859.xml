  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are at risk of developing ROP (retinopathy of prematurity), an eye condition&#xD;
      that can cause blindness. Preterm infants born before gestation week (GA) 30 are therefor&#xD;
      screened regularly with eye examinations. These eye examinations are painful and despite a&#xD;
      lot of research no clear method of pain relief have been found. Since pain in the preterm&#xD;
      infant can lead to both short- and longterm negative consequences an effective pain relief&#xD;
      during these examinations are of importance. In this study we will investigate if Clonidine&#xD;
      can be effective as pain-relief during ROP eye examinations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants born before gestational week (GA) 30 who are cared for in neonatal units at the&#xD;
      university hospitals in Örebro and Uppsala, Sweden can be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to power calculations 18 infants are needed for a power of 80% and significance&#xD;
      level of 0.05 in order to cover for potential dropouts we plan to include 25 infants. Since&#xD;
      the eye examinations are performed without eye speculum in Örebro and with eye speculum in&#xD;
      Uppsala we plan to include 25 infants at each unit. The patient will be its own control and&#xD;
      examined according to the units´ guidelines. Data will be collected during the patients´&#xD;
      first two eye examinations. In order to exclude potential effects of previous pain experience&#xD;
      the order of treatment (clonidine/sterile water) will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty minutes before the first eye examination the infant will receive Clonidine or sterile&#xD;
      water in corresponding volumes in the GI-tube by a nurse. During the examination the infant&#xD;
      will be placed on a heated examination table and connected to an oxygen saturation probe&#xD;
      (measuring oxygen saturation and heart rate) on one foot and electrodes for Galvanic skin&#xD;
      response (GSR) on the other. The ophthalmologist will examine the infants eyes without eye&#xD;
      speculum or with eye speculum on the respective unit. The infants face, oxygen saturation and&#xD;
      heart rate will be videotaped before, during and after the examination making it possible to&#xD;
      perform av PIPP-R pain assessment at a later time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the eye examination the ophtalmologist will be asked to estimate hos easy the infant&#xD;
      was to examine by putting an &quot;x&quot; somewhere on a 10 centimeter long line where one end&#xD;
      signifies &quot;very easy to examine&quot; and the other end signifies &quot;very difficult to examine&quot;. The&#xD;
      ophtalmologist can also write any other comments regarding the examination on the same form.&#xD;
      The same procedure will be repeated during the infants´ second examination, but with the&#xD;
      treatment he/she did not receive during the first examination.&#xD;
