    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after five brain stimulation sessions</time_frame>
    <description>The score is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index. The degree of impairment of upper and lower limbs is measured.</description>

    <measure>Changes in cortical activity using fNIRS signals during brain stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, during, immediately after five brain stimulation sessions</time_frame>
    <description>Cortical activities before, during and after brain stimulation sessions are compared.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in motor evoked potential</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after five brain stimulation sessions</time_frame>
    <description>Resting motor threshold (rMT) and amplitude of motor evoked potential in first dorsal interosseous muscle are measured. These outcomes are measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor hotspot. The rMT is defined as the minimum stimulus intensity that produced a minimal motor evoked response at rest. The amplitude means peak to peak of the muscle response.</description>
