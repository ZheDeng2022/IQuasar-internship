      Pilot study done to evaluate the breakdown and and potential utility of a bioabsorbable&#xD;
      ventilation ear tube made with gelatin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Institutional Review Board- Park Nicollet Institute approval was granted 3/2011 for 15&#xD;
      patients to be enrolled in pilot study of use of a bioabsorbable ventilation ear (PE) tube.&#xD;
      IRB stated compliance with FDA as defined in 21 CFR, Part 56 and with regulations of DHHS.&#xD;
      Federal assurance number FWA00000914. Prior to commencing this study, IRB approval was&#xD;
      obtained and each participating clinician completed the NIH training for &quot;Protecting Human&#xD;
      Research Participants&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14 patients (15 ears) were enrolled in this study and were examined by 2 independent&#xD;
      examiners at approximately 3, 6 and 12 week follow-ups. Lumen patency and time to complete&#xD;
      resorption were documented by each examiner. There were no adverse reactions. This pilot&#xD;
      study suggests that there is utility for a bioabsorbable ear tube made from gelatin material,&#xD;
      as the device was found to break down over the expected time frame and remained functional&#xD;
      long enough to have clinical utility.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>14 patients underwent placement of a novel absorbable ventilation tube to test utility of this prototype device and monitor resorption over a period of weeks. 14 participants were approved for this study of feasibility to allow for patients who did not follow up per the study protocol.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>2 examiners used otomicroscopy to document the function of the ear tube by documenting the number of weeks the lumen remained patent and the number of weeks until the device was fully resorbed. All examiners documented results independent of the other examiner.</masking_description>
