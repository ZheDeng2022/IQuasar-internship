    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lulizumab, a CD28-specific&#xD;
      domain antibody (CD28 dAb), compared to tacrolimus, as the primary immunosuppressant in&#xD;
      first-time renal transplant recipients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2a, open-label, prospective, randomized (1:1), controlled, single center&#xD;
      study evaluating the safety and efficacy of lulizumab (a CD28 specific domain antibody&#xD;
      [CD28dAb]) compared to tacrolimus as the primary immunosuppressant in first-time renal&#xD;
      transplant recipients. The study will take place at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta,&#xD;
      Georgia, United States (US).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two arms/groups in this study, the Control (tacrolimus) group and the&#xD;
      Investigational (lulizumab) group. The two arms will be assigned to treatment regimens for&#xD;
      the first 12 months after transplantation; at that point, all participants in each arm will&#xD;
      be transitioned to a physician directed Standard of Care (SOC) immunosuppressive regimen, and&#xD;
      all participants will be assessed at 15 months after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive induction therapy with Thymoglobulin and Methylprednisolone and&#xD;
      maintenance therapy with Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) and Prednisone.&#xD;
