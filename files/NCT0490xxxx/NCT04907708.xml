    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose level&#xD;
      mainly due to defect in insulin secretion or resistance. In pregnancy, insulin resistance&#xD;
      increases as the pregnancy advances, due to the placental hormones predisposing the female to&#xD;
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Placenta is a vital organ as it provides nutrition to&#xD;
      the fetus. It shows morphological changes in patients with GDM leading to feto-maternal&#xD;
      complications. Insulin, a traditional treatment given for GDM is also known to cause intra&#xD;
      uterine deaths, stillbirths and hypoglycemia in mothers and newborns. Insulin being anabolic&#xD;
      hormone makes placenta larger in size and causes hypoxic changes with vascular insufficiency,&#xD;
      infarctions and hemorrhages. In contrast to this, oral insulin sensitizing drug Metformin, is&#xD;
      euglycemic in nature. It has been proven now that Metformin is a vasculo-protective agent,&#xD;
      with better patient compliance and beneficial micro-vascular effects in type 2 diabetics.&#xD;
      This study was designed to clearly visualize in detail if there are any unrevealed beneficial&#xD;
      vascular effects of Metformin on placental tissues and also to compare these effects with&#xD;
      Insulin and diet restriction therapy, by doing placental light microscopy, morphometric&#xD;
      studies and immunohistochemistry.&#xD;

      Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorder with relative or absolute deficiency of&#xD;
      insulin. Pregnancy is a potentially glucose intolerant condition as insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      decreases with the progress of pregnancy leading to the development of gestational diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (GDM). It is diagnosed in approximately 3-9% of pregnancies and is growing in&#xD;
      prevalence. In Pakistan the recent prevalence of GDM is reported to be 3-3.45% but the&#xD;
      complications are much higher due to poor glycemic control, lack of awareness and inadequate&#xD;
      medical facilities. Placenta is an important feto-maternal organ which is responsible for&#xD;
      nutrition of the fetus. It also provides the retrospective information regarding infant's&#xD;
      prenatal development. Structurally, human placenta is a complex vascular organ that allows&#xD;
      exchange of nutrients and chemicals between fetal and maternal blood. Proper development and&#xD;
      maturity of placenta are strongly connected with fetal growth and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GDM produces anatomical and physiological alterations in placenta. This can be related to&#xD;
      altered levels of fetal insulin and multiple growth factors such as placental vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Insulin like growth factors (IGF and IGF binding proteins)&#xD;
      which regulate the fetal and placental development. Morphologically, diabetic placentae are&#xD;
      larger in size and volume. Microscopically, diabetic placenta shows degenerative alternations&#xD;
      such as villous fibrinoid necrosis, chorangiosis, villous immaturity, calcification and&#xD;
      syncytial knots formation which show intense hypoxia of the placental tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional therapy (diet control) is foremost important for achieving target glucose values&#xD;
      during pregnancy but in uncontrolled cases pharmacological intervention is required. Parental&#xD;
      Insulin is the traditional therapy in such circumstances, but is an expensive medication and&#xD;
      is associated with high incidence of neonatal and maternal hypoglycemia, still births,&#xD;
      neonatal morbidity and mortality. It is documented to produce many placental alterations such&#xD;
      as immature villi, hemorrhages, edema, cystic changes and fibrinoid necrosis. It has been&#xD;
      postulated that the reason behind all these hypoxic changes are the variation in the blood&#xD;
      glucose level that occur in the maternal blood as sugar level suddenly dropped soon after&#xD;
      Insulin injection and are at highest just before the next dose of Insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of oral anti-diabetic medications such as Metformin in the management of gestational&#xD;
      diabetes has increased over the past several years. Recent studies has established that&#xD;
      Metformin can be a better option for GDM as it well controls glycemia (produces euglycemic)&#xD;
      with good pregnancy outcomes. Metformin is an oral anti-diabetic drug from biguanide group;&#xD;
      work by improving insulin sensitivity, reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis and also by&#xD;
      increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. It is now been upgraded to category B&#xD;
      drug as is not associated with teratogenic effects. But what are the effects of Metformin on&#xD;
      stereological morphometric study and immunochemistry of placental tissues were left to be&#xD;
      evaluated. Stereology provides practical measurements and significant approach for obtaining&#xD;
      quantitative estimates of small structures on histological slides. In placental tissue it is&#xD;
      performed to obtain unbiased quantitative estimates of placental components that inform about&#xD;
      development and also estimate of structural parameters that have direct influence on&#xD;
      placental functional capacity. Immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence of tissue sections&#xD;
      also provide valuable insight to placental structure and protein expression with&#xD;
      three-dimensional spatial information, including morphology that cannot be obtained on&#xD;
      microscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this background knowledge, study was designed with the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the placental gross and microscopic changes in normal, diet control,&#xD;
           Metformin and Insulin treated in newly enrolled GDM females&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate stereological morphometric details of placenta in normal, diet control,&#xD;
           Metformin and Insulin all enrolled females&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate immunohistochemistry of placental tissues in normal, diet control, Metformin&#xD;
           and Insulin in all enrolled females&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the placental morphology, stereology and immunohistochemistry with in the&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the fetal and maternal outcome in normal, diet control, Metformin and&#xD;
           Insulin treated gestational diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To correlate the placental morphology with the fetal and maternal outcome in Metformin&#xD;
           and Insulin treated gestational diabetics&#xD;
