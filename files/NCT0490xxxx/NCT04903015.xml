  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate, using MRI, the microstructural consequences and&#xD;
      the onset of any cognitive impairment in professional soccer players at the end of their&#xD;
      career, who have experienced repeated minor head injuries. Over the long term, these head&#xD;
      injuries could lead to morphological lesions and have an impact on soccer players' cognitive&#xD;
      skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main evaluation criterion corresponds to the modifications found on MRI in the&#xD;
      professional soccer player group (diffusion tensor, cerebral perfusion, fMRI, cerebral&#xD;
      volumetry and cortical thickness, spectroscopy, susceptibility imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exposure/nonexposure study assessing the onset of MRI abnormalities (diffusion&#xD;
      tensor, cerebral perfusion, fMRI, volumetry and cortical thickness, spectroscopy,&#xD;
      susceptibility imaging) in professional soccer players exposed to repeated mild head&#xD;
      injuries, who are either at the end of their career or retired for approximately 10 years,&#xD;
      compared to high-level athletes not exposed to head injuries.&#xD;
