  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing physical activity is vital for children's physical and mental health. It is&#xD;
      important to address inactivity early and engage children in positive behaviours which can be&#xD;
      sustained throughout life. Teachers are well placed to understand and influence in-school&#xD;
      factors impacting children's physical activity. As wearable technologies continue to improve&#xD;
      and become more accessible, they offer the opportunity to engage schools in the data&#xD;
      collection process, as well as providing them with the capacity to monitor strategies&#xD;
      designed to improve physical activity. This study is a within-subject, pre-post, co-developed&#xD;
      intervention design.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous interventions have not successfully increased physical activity levels in primary&#xD;
      schools. This is arguably due to a lack of comprehensive data collection methods and the lack&#xD;
      of co-involvement of teachers and children in intervention design. In previous research,&#xD;
      accelerometers have been used by researchers to quantify children's physical activity levels.&#xD;
      However, these have been research-grade devices which require a more complex analysis to&#xD;
      extract results; because of this, these types of measurement tools have not been utilised by&#xD;
      schools. This study will aim to utilise user-friendly technologies which can engage schools&#xD;
      in the data collection process and be employed by schools to implement and measure strategies&#xD;
      designed to increase physical activity by providing immediate feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to investigate whether data from wearable technologies can be used to&#xD;
      inform primary school-based practices and improve children's physical activity within school&#xD;
      hours using co-developed interventions. This project is a participatory mixed-methods design&#xD;
      in two phases. 7-9 schools will be recruited. The first phase in each school involves&#xD;
      baseline measures of pupils' physical activity for 2-weeks, using accelerometers which have&#xD;
      been specifically designed for school use. Pupils will be blinded to the physical activity&#xD;
      data during this period. During this 2-week baseline teachers will be instructed to carry out&#xD;
      lessons as normal, not changing their behaviour, or encouraging the pupils' physical&#xD;
      activity. Data visualisations will be created from the 2-weeks of physical activity data&#xD;
      collected within each school. Teachers will then be interviewed online, using Microsoft&#xD;
      Teams, and encouraged to reflect on the physical activity data and co-develop 3-5 action&#xD;
      points or strategies to increase children's physical activity. Teachers will then be asked to&#xD;
      implement these action points over the subsequent 2-weeks, where again children's physical&#xD;
      activity will be measured with the accelerometers. This time children will not be blinded to&#xD;
      the data and can receive physical activity feedback if this is a strategy selected by their&#xD;
      teacher. These changes will be at each schoolteacher's discretion and managed in a way they&#xD;
      deem most appropriate. Following these 2-week changes teachers will be interviewed again&#xD;
      about their experiences of using the technology and implementing strategies to encourage&#xD;
      physical activity. They will then be shown similar data visualisations as before, comparing&#xD;
      changes in pupils' physical activity between each 2-week period.&#xD;

    <description>During the following 2-weeks teachers will be implementing strategies to improve their class' physical activity. These are individualised strategies which will be co-developed during semi-structured interviews where teachers will discuss data visualisations with the researcher which depicts their class' physical activity over the 2-week baseline period. Teachers will then implement these strategies over the subsequent 2-weeks. During this time teachers are able to share the physical activity data with their pupils if they wish.</description>
