      This study will look at the five different types of sickle cell and their relation to&#xD;
      self-reported ill health to determine whether or not one or two of the sickle cell haplotypes&#xD;
      are correlated with worse health outcomes. Participants can do complete the study in under&#xD;
      half an hour in the privacy of their own home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell anemia is a disease which results from the inheritance of two hemoglobin S (Hb S)&#xD;
      genes. Sickle-cell anemia individuals are referred to as Hb SS patients, and are known to&#xD;
      suffer from a variety of life-threatening symptoms. Paramount in the clinical complications&#xD;
      of sickle cell patients is the &quot;sickle-cell crisis&quot;. If a crisis is not stopped by prompt&#xD;
      medical attention, it may result in death. It is becoming increasingly clear that some sickle&#xD;
      cell anemic patients have more benign clinical profiles than do others. The genetic reason&#xD;
      for such clinical differences has been well determined: although the mutation that changes&#xD;
      the &quot;normal&quot; hemoglobin gene is the same in all patients, the genetic material outside of the&#xD;
      gene influences how the gene is expressed. This genetic material is referred to as the&#xD;
      beta-globin haplotype. Carriers of the sickle cell gene are referred to as Hb AS individuals.&#xD;
      Hb AS carriers usually have a normal life free of the clinical problems associated with the&#xD;
      disease suffered by sickle cell patients. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that&#xD;
      under strenuous situations, some Hb AS carriers do experience heat illness and other life&#xD;
      threatening problems while others do not. The purpose of this project is to determine if&#xD;
      there is a genetic reason for why some athlete carriers of the sickle cell trait experience&#xD;
      heat illness, while others do not. Although the genetic reason for the different clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of sickle cell anemic patients is now well understood (different haplotypes result&#xD;
      in different disease courses), the possibility that the same haplotypes might be the reason&#xD;
      why some sickle cell carriers have worse clinical profiles has never been explored. In this&#xD;
      project we will work with a sickle-cell trait registry of athletes, and we will test the&#xD;
      haplotypes of Hb AS athletes who have and who have not had heat illness. Our study is the&#xD;
      first to attempt to clarify if there is a genetic reason for this occurrence. Total&#xD;
      participation time for the study is thirty minutes or less. Information provided by the&#xD;
      participant will be analyzed within one year of participation. Deidentified results will be&#xD;
      kept for five years, per the University of South Florida's Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      protocol, and will be available upon request to the principal investigator. Participants can&#xD;
      do complete the study in under half an hour in the privacy of their own home.&#xD;
