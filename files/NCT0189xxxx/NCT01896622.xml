      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People who have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) often take several medications to&#xD;
      control their disease. They may also need to take medicine to prevent blood clots. Taking&#xD;
      both kinds of medicine together can cause bleeding or other problems. But this might not&#xD;
      happen if the medications are taken at different times. Researchers will study two particular&#xD;
      HIV drugs (ritonavir and cobicistat) and how they interact with blood clot medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To understand how HIV medicine and blood clot medicine interact, so doctors can choose what&#xD;
      to prescribe for people who take both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy adults between 18 and 70 years old who are not on any medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples&#xD;
           will be collected. Urine samples will be collected from participants who might become&#xD;
           pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will visit the National Institutes of Health 7 times after the screening&#xD;
           visit. Three visits will last about 12 hours. The other 4 will last about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take a daily dose of either study medication for 22 days. They will&#xD;
           keep a diary of medicine they take and any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be monitored with blood tests over about 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When the study of one drug is completed, the next drug study will begin with a different&#xD;
           group of participants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Advances in antiretroviral (ARV) pharmacotherapy have translated to increased longevity and&#xD;
      improved quality of life in people living with HIV; hence, elderly individuals comprise an&#xD;
      increasing proportion of today s HIV population. Moreover, HIV infection itself has become&#xD;
      recognized as a condition characterized by a hypercoaguable state and premature immunologic&#xD;
      aging. Potential interactions between ARVs and anticoagulant medications are of particular&#xD;
      concern considering that many elderly, and even non-elderly HIV patients will require&#xD;
      short-term or chronic anticoagulation to prevent and/or treat systemic embolism. Dabigatran,&#xD;
      administered as dabigatran etexilate, is an oral irreversible, competitive direct thrombin&#xD;
      inhibitor, which has been shown to be superior to warfarin, and non-inferior to enoxaparin,&#xD;
      in preventing thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation and undergoing orthopedic&#xD;
      surgery, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While dabigatran itself is not a substrate of Permeability-glycoprotein (P-gp), its&#xD;
      inactivepro-drug, dabigatran etexilate, is a substrate of P-gp. Co-administration of&#xD;
      dabigatran etexilate with P-gp modulators has resulted in significant changes in dabigatran&#xD;
      exposure. The pharmacokinetic enhancers, ritonavir and cobicistat, as inhibitors of P-gp, are&#xD;
      expected to increase plasma concentrations of dabigatran; however, neither agent has been&#xD;
      studied in combination with dabigatran etexilate, to date. Hence, the purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to determine whether the separate co-administration of ritonavir or cobicistat with&#xD;
      dabigatran etexilate increases the systemic exposure of dabigatran in healthy volunteers, and&#xD;
      if so, whether adjusting the administration times of these medications can circumvent this&#xD;
      interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this open-label study, 32 healthy volunteers will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups. Group A&#xD;
      will consist of 16 subjects who will take 22 days of ritonavir; Group B will consist of 16&#xD;
      subjects who will take 22 days of cobicistat. All subjects will receive 3 separated single&#xD;
      doses of dabigatran etexilate. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) sampling for&#xD;
      dabigatran will occur on Days 0 1, Day 19 1 20, and Day 26 1 27.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PD effects of dabigatran will be characterized via ecarin clotting time (ECT)&#xD;
      measurements. Dabigatran PK/PD parameters will be determined using non-compartmental methods&#xD;
      with the WinNonlin professional computer program (version 5.2; Pharsight Corporation,&#xD;
      Mountain View, CA). The following PK/PD parameters will be compared between the groups: area&#xD;
      under the curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24), maximum total dabigatran plasma concentration&#xD;
      (Cmax), area under the curve from 0 to infinity hours (AUC0- ), time to maximum plasma&#xD;
      concentration (tmax), terminal half-life (T (Omega)), apparent oral clearance (CL/F), area&#xD;
      under the effect curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUEC0-24), and the maximum effect ratio over&#xD;
      baseline (ERmax).&#xD;
