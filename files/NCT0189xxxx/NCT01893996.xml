  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease because of&#xD;
      systemic inflammation that can persist even in patients with well-controlled joint disease.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that adding an anti-tumor necrosis factor medication, adalimumab, to standard&#xD;
      non-biologic therapy for rheumatoid arthritis will improve endothelial function (reduce&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk) in these patients. The design of the trial is as follows: 18 month&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, double-blind crossover trial comparing the addition of adalimumab to&#xD;
      the addition of placebo. The primary endpoint is a change in endothelial cell function, as&#xD;
      detected by brachial artery FMD, at 6 months of adalimumab treatment compared to 6 months of&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excess mortality associated with RA is due largely to CVD that is not explained by&#xD;
      traditional risk factors. Although articular manifestations usually dominate the clinical&#xD;
      picture, RA is a systemic inflammatory disease, and systemic inflammation is the thought to&#xD;
      be the underlying mechanism responsible for the increased CVD risk associated with RA.&#xD;
      Because chronic inflammation can persist in treated RA patients with little or no clinically&#xD;
      detectable joint inflammation, treatment to targets based largely on clinically measured&#xD;
      joint activity may not adequately suppress the systemic inflammation associated with&#xD;
      progression of atherosclerosis. The ACR recommends treatment to a therapeutic target of low&#xD;
      disease activity as determined by standardized clinical assessments. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      treated RA patients who have reached this ACR target of low disease activity nonetheless have&#xD;
      persisting systemic inflammation that contributes to atherogenesis. We further hypothesize&#xD;
      that acceleration of RA-directed therapy with systemic anti-inflammatory treatments (TNF&#xD;
      inhibition) in patients with low disease activity will improve endothelial function, reduce&#xD;
      vascular inflammation and improve the functionality of HDL particles, key biological features&#xD;
      in the progression of atherosclerosis and its clinical manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design: Prospective, randomized, double-blind crossover trial comparing the addition of&#xD;
      adalimumab to the addition of placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 60 RA patients on non-biological DMARDs with low disease activity as&#xD;
      determined by a standardized clinical assessment (Disease Activity Score 28 joints [DAS28] &lt;&#xD;
      3.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Primary endpoint is change in endothelial cell function, as detected by&#xD;
      brachial artery FMD, at 6 months of adalimumab treatment compared to 6 months of placebo. We&#xD;
      postulate that anti-TNF therapy with adalimumab will lead to an absolute increase of 2% in&#xD;
      FMD, which typically translates into a 15% reduction in cardiovascular event rates.&#xD;
