  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Transeuro Transplant study is a trial which will involve grafting foetal tissue into the&#xD;
      brain of patients with Parkinson's disease, who are already been followed in the&#xD;
      observational study. The tissue inserted in the brain is to help replace and rebuild lost&#xD;
      dopamine from the brain due to Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Update April 2019:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 11 PD patients were grafted in Cambridge, UK and Lund, Sweden. No further&#xD;
      surgeries are planned. The final patient will complete the study's clinical endpoint (36&#xD;
      months post-graft) in 2021. We continue to assess these patients bi-annually alongside a&#xD;
      control group which did not receive any intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical trials of cell therapy in PD patients were first performed in Lund in the late&#xD;
      1980s, followed by a number of similar, small trials in other European and North American&#xD;
      centres. These initial studies performed on small groups of advanced PD patients were all&#xD;
      open label but firmly established safety of the procedure. The results obtained in these&#xD;
      trials have shown that the grafted dopaminergic [DA] neurons can survive and function&#xD;
      long-term, over more than 10 years, and that some patients have shown clear clinical&#xD;
      benefits, especially with respect to their bradykinesia and rigidity, with reductions in&#xD;
      L-dopa requirements. Using functional imaging it has also been shown that the grafted DA&#xD;
      neurons can restore striatal DA release and provide a sustained re-activation of motor&#xD;
      cortical areas, i.e. key areas that were underactive prior to grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-mortem studies have shown excellent long-term survival of the grafted DA neurons,&#xD;
      notwithstanding the observation that some of the long-term surviving transplants (at 12-15&#xD;
      years after grafting) have now been shown to contain signs of PD-related pathologies, i.e.&#xD;
      neuronal Lewy-bodies and alpha-synuclein positive inclusions in the grafts. However, such&#xD;
      changes have been observed only in some and not in all patients and when seen the extent of&#xD;
      the pathology is limited to a small number of the grafted DA cells and the clinical&#xD;
      consequence, if any, not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the outcomes of two NIH sponsored double blind placebo controlled trials, which&#xD;
      published their main findings in 2001 and 2003, have raised major concerns. In both these&#xD;
      trials the grafted patients did not show any significant improvement overall compared to&#xD;
      sham-operated controls at 1 and 2 years post grafting. Furthermore, a significant number of&#xD;
      patients in both trials developed GIDs, which in some cases were so severe that further&#xD;
      neurosurgery was needed to remedy the situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reasons for the variable, and overall poor, outcome in these trials, including the&#xD;
      generation of GIDs, have been the subject of much debate but have recently centred on three&#xD;
      key elements, with an additional possible fourth element:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The selection of patients in terms of clinical phenotype, disease stage and pattern of&#xD;
           striatal dopaminergic denervation at the time of grafting;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The differences in immunosuppressive regimes and the risk that incomplete&#xD;
           immunosuppression in combination with the use of solid graft methods may lead to the&#xD;
           development of detrimental immune/inflammatory reactions at the graft site with&#xD;
           compromise of the grafted dopamine cell function;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mode of engraftment and differences in graft cell survival, and the risk for&#xD;
           inhomogeneous delivery of dopaminergic neurons and the generation of potentially&#xD;
           dyskinesia-inducing &quot;patchy&quot; innervations in the host striatum;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A final possible element is the composition of the grafted tissue and the ratio of&#xD;
           serotoninergic to dopaminergic neurons within the graft. There is emerging evidence that&#xD;
           serotoninergic neurons can release dopamine in a relatively unregulated fashion given&#xD;
           they lack transporters for it, and as such may use L-dopa as a false transmitter which&#xD;
           may not only underlie the development of L-dopa induced dyskinesia's but may also&#xD;
           contribute to GIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure of the NIH trials to demonstrate any overall clinical benefits in the grafted&#xD;
      patients, and the unexpected and worrisome development of GIDs in a significant number of&#xD;
      patients in these trials has represented a major hurdle for the future development of cell&#xD;
      based therapies for PD and it is in this and related areas that this project seeks to move&#xD;
      the field forward and go beyond the current state of the art for this treatment approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has gathered together all the available expertise in this area to resolve or&#xD;
      reduce the risk of the previous complications seen with VM transplants in patients with PD.&#xD;
      We will conduct a new round of clinical trials, involving a step-by-step optimisation of all&#xD;
      technical aspects of the grafting procedure and patient selection and assessment, in order to&#xD;
      improve clinical efficiency and consistency, in the absence of troublesome dyskinesia's.&#xD;
