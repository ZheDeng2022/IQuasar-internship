      The clinical effects of simulation-based ultrasound training has not yet been explored. To&#xD;
      examine the long-term effects of training, we plan to conduct a trial, where half of all new&#xD;
      residents are randomized to simulation-based training and the other half to traditional&#xD;
      clinical training only. The effects are assessed after two months of practice by evaluating&#xD;
      two ultrasound scans performed by the residents. These scans are subsequently evaluated by a&#xD;
      blinded consultant gynecologist and rated using the Objective Structured Assessment of&#xD;
      Ultrasound Skills, which has been validated in previous studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasonography has become increasingly used in many medical specialties over the last&#xD;
      decades as smaller and less expensive ultrasound equipment has become available. Although&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging traditionally is considered safe, its use is highly operator dependent&#xD;
      (EFSUMB 2010). The lack of sufficient operator skills can lead to diagnostic errors that&#xD;
      eventually compromise patient safety due to unnecessary tests or interventions (Moore &amp; Copel&#xD;
      2011). Clinical ultrasound training is challenged with long learning curves and is therefore&#xD;
      both time consuming and requires large teacher resources (Jang et al. 2010). Some trainees&#xD;
      may therefore never acquire the basic skills and knowledge needed for independent practice&#xD;
      (Tolsgaard et al. 2012). In the search for effective training methods, simulation-based&#xD;
      training has proven to be an effective adjunct to clinical training, which has been&#xD;
      documented in several studies on interventional procedures (Larsen et al. 2009, Zendejas et&#xD;
      al 2011, Barsuk et al. 2009). Most comparative studies on simulation-based training have,&#xD;
      however, only examined the initial effects of simulation-based training on the first couple&#xD;
      of procedures, it is not known if VR simulation training provides sustained improvements&#xD;
      trainee performance throughout their learning curves until they reach clinical proficiency.&#xD;
      Large resources are currently being allocated to simulation training in many different&#xD;
      specialties but the effects of simulation may easily be over-estimated if only evaluating the&#xD;
      immediate effects of simulation training. A small difference in the number of supervised&#xD;
      ultrasound examinations needed for proficiency may not justify the financial costs associated&#xD;
      with investing in simulation equipment, space for simulation training as well as teacher&#xD;
      resources during simulation training. Therefore, the research questions of this study was:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a group of ultrasound novices, what are the implications of simulation-based training&#xD;
      compared to clinical training alone on the technical quality of scans performed after two&#xD;
      months of training?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This study is reported according to the CONSORT statement&#xD;
      (www.consort-statement.org). A randomized observer-blind study to compare VR ultrasound&#xD;
      training with traditional supervised practice on subsequent patient scans (see Figure 1 for&#xD;
      flowchart of study design). Ethical approval was obtained from the Regional Ethical Committee&#xD;
      of the Capital Region, Denmark. The Danish Data Protection Agency approved the storing of&#xD;
      patient relevant information. This randomized trial is reported to clinicaltrials.gov prior&#xD;
      to inclusion of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting This study is carried out at the Departments of Gynecology at the Juliane Marie&#xD;
      Centre, Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark, Næstved Hospital, and Hillerød Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Participants are all new OB/GYN residents at three different hospitals in&#xD;
      Eastern Denmark. Inclusion criteria are 1) proficiency in written and oral Danish, 2)&#xD;
      informed written consent. The exclusion criteria are 1) prior employment at an OB/GYN&#xD;
      department in a clinical position, 2) any formal ultrasound training with or without hands-on&#xD;
      practice and (3) prior experience with virtual reality simulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization A research fellow at The Center for Clinical Education, Rigshospitalet,&#xD;
      independently performs randomisation of participants by computer to either intervention group&#xD;
      (simulation training) or control group (clinical training only). The allocation of&#xD;
      participants is concealed to the primary investigator during the enrolment of participants.&#xD;
      Once informed consent has been signed and a participant number has been provided, the&#xD;
      allocation sequence is retrieved per telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Participants in the intervention group receive simulation training using two&#xD;
      types of ultrasound simulators (see Figure 2 for flowchart of the simulation programme).&#xD;
      Participants are introduced to a high-fidelity Virtual-Reality (VR) simulator (Scantrainer,&#xD;
      Medaphor). The VR simulator provides images obtained from real patients and haptic feedback&#xD;
      from the ultrasound probe. Participants train on this type of simulator until a predefined&#xD;
      proficiency-level has been attained. The selection of modules is based on a previous&#xD;
      validation study and only modules and items that discriminate between novice and expert&#xD;
      performances are included in the training programme (Madsen et al. 2013). All participants&#xD;
      are provided feedback after completing each module. When all modules are passed on the VR&#xD;
      simulator, the participants receive proficiency-based training training on the low-fidelity&#xD;
      simulator (BluePhantom) to allow participants to review the functions, they just trained,&#xD;
      using real ultrasound equipment. The simulator performances are assessed using the Objective&#xD;
      Structured Examination of Ultrasound Skills (OSAUS) and feedback is provided using this&#xD;
      framework after each trial. Proficiency is set according pass/fail-scores established in a&#xD;
      previous study (Tolsgaard et al. 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical training Participants in both groups receive traditional clinical training. This&#xD;
      includes supervised practice in terms of apprenticeship learning followed by supervision&#xD;
      during independent practice. The new residents do not usually go on calls for the first one&#xD;
      to two weeks. Local department rules dictates which types of examinations that always&#xD;
      requires a second examination by a supervising clinicians (e.g. fetal demise or pregnancy of&#xD;
      unknown location).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measure The main outcome measure is the technical proficiency after two months&#xD;
      of practice. Two scans from the emergency department are recorded and subsequently assessed&#xD;
      by a blinded clinician, who also had access to the ultrasound descriptions that corresponded&#xD;
      to each scan. The assessments were performed using the Objective Structured Assessment of&#xD;
      Ultrasound Skills (Tolsgaard et al. 2013), which has been validated in a construct validity&#xD;
      study including 30 clinicians with different levels of experience prior to this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Sample size calculations are based on previous studies on clinical&#xD;
      performances of ultrasound novices with the performance of medical students, who completed a&#xD;
      simulation-based training programme (Tolsgaard et al. 2013). The average difference in OSAUS&#xD;
      scores between these groups was 0.85 (2.65-1.8 (mean SD 0.4). It was anticipated that these&#xD;
      differences would be diluted according to literature from other areas of simulation-based&#xD;
      technical skills training (Smith et al. 2010), where simulation effects persisted after 3&#xD;
      months of training but the differences between groups was diminished to 55% of the initial&#xD;
      effects. Assuming a 55% dilution, an alpha-level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, the total&#xD;
      number of participants needed was 26.&#xD;
