  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to look at the effects of Aerobic Exercise (AE) on daily and&#xD;
      neurocognitive functioning including memory, attention, the ability to plan activities, and&#xD;
      learn new information. Participants will be assigned by chance to receive regular care or&#xD;
      exercise sessions in addition to regular care. This study will allow determining the&#xD;
      potential positive influence of AE on cognitive and daily functioning in individuals with&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with schizophrenia often display cognitive difficulties. Studies among&#xD;
      non-clinical populations suggest that Aerobic Exercise (AE) training is effective in&#xD;
      increasing both aerobic fitness and cognitive functioning. However, these associations have&#xD;
      not been studied among individuals with schizophrenia, despite the presence of highly&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle in this population To elucidate this putative link, the present study&#xD;
      will evaluate the influence of AE on cognitive functioning and daily functioning in&#xD;
      individuals with schizophrenia using a single-blind, randomized clinical trial. Outpatient&#xD;
      individuals with schizophrenia receiving treatment will be randomly assigned to AE training&#xD;
      or Treatment As Usual (TAU). Participants in the AE training will undergo a 12-week, 3 times&#xD;
      per week, 1-hour AE sessions. All participants will continue their regular psychiatric and&#xD;
      medical care. Assessments of neurocognitive and daily functioning abilities, along with&#xD;
      symptom severity, and physiological and behavioral measures of aerobic fitness will be&#xD;
      completed before and after the 12-week program.&#xD;
