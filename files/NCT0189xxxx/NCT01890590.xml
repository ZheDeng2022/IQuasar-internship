  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CyberKnife Based Radiosurgery is a way to deliver large doses of radiation very accurately to&#xD;
      a tumor. The ability of this technology to minimize radiation dose to organs adjacent to the&#xD;
      target tumor allows a high dose to be delivered to the tumor, thus potentially increasing the&#xD;
      efficacy of radiation treatment. Currently, radiosurgery is commonly used for brain&#xD;
      metastases, Stage I lung cancer, spine tumors, and localized prostate cancer. The purpose of&#xD;
      this protocol is to evaluate the role of Radiosurgery for the treatment of clinically&#xD;
      localized primary renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;

      Before the research starts (screening) Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be&#xD;
      part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in&#xD;
      the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or&#xD;
      may not have to be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A medical history, which includes questions about your health, current medications, and&#xD;
           any allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance status, which evaluates how you are able to carry on with your usual&#xD;
           activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gold seed (Fiducial) Placement: Placement of at least one (usually up to 3) gold&#xD;
           fiducial(s) must be placed in or around the tumor by a surgeon or interventional&#xD;
           radiologist a minimum of one week or more prior to pre-treatment planning simulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An assessment of your tumor by X-ray, CT (Computerized Tomography) scan, MRI (Magnetic&#xD;
           Resonance Imaging) or PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will undergo a simulation of the intervention procedure. It will involve the study&#xD;
           team helping you position yourself for the study procedure as you undergo a CT scan of&#xD;
           the abdomen while holding the correct position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will&#xD;
      begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able&#xD;
      to participate in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening procedures confirm that you are eligible to participate in the research&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive a series of Cyberknife Radiosurgery treatments, with the amount of radiation&#xD;
      dosing adjusted for the size of your tumor. The treatment will ideally take place over the&#xD;
      course of 3-4 days, but not more than 14 days overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be positioned in a stable position laying on your back, capable for reproducibility&#xD;
      of positioning and not allowing you to move from simulation to treatment, allowing you to&#xD;
      feel as comfortable as possible. A variety of systems may be utilized to keep you still;&#xD;
      including vacuum bag, alpha cradle, or stereotactic frames that surround you on three sides&#xD;
      and large rigid pillows conforming to your body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the final dosing We would like to keep track of your medical condition for the rest of&#xD;
      your life. We would like to do this by calling you on the telephone once a year to see how&#xD;
      you are doing. Keeping in touch with you and checking your condition every year helps us look&#xD;
      at the long-term effects of the research study.&#xD;
