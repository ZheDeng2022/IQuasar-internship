      The broad, long-term objective of this project is to evaluate the therapeutic value of vein&#xD;
      of Marshall (VOM) ethanol infusion when added to catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      (AF). AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia in adults, and it is a leading cause of&#xD;
      stroke, disability and increased mortality. Catheter ablation - pulmonary vein (PV) antral&#xD;
      isolation (PVAI)- can lead to cure, but is best suited for paroxysmal AF, in which ectopic&#xD;
      beats arising from the pulmonary veins were shown to initiate AF. PVAI success is lower in&#xD;
      persistent AF, in which the role of the cardiac autonomic system, particularly the intrinsic&#xD;
      cardiac ganglia, is being increasingly recognized. Expanding the ablation lesions to include&#xD;
      greater areas the left atrial (LA) anatomy marginally improves outcomes, but also leads to&#xD;
      increases in procedural complexity and duration, need of repeat procedures, and complications&#xD;
      such as atrial flutters, particularly perimitral flutter (PMF). The investigators have&#xD;
      developed a technique to perform rapid ablation of atrial tissues in AF using ethanol&#xD;
      infusion in the vein of Marshall (VOM), and have shown: 1) Effective, rapid and safe tissue&#xD;
      ablation of LA tissue neighboring the LA ridge and left inferior PV; 2) Regional LA vagal&#xD;
      denervation by reaching the intrinsic cardiac ganglia; and 3) Facilitation of cure of PMF by&#xD;
      ablating most of the mitral isthmus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to evaluate outcomes differences yielded by VOM ethanol when added&#xD;
      to conventional PVAI. The specific aims are: #1.To assesses the impact of VOM ethanol&#xD;
      infusion in procedure success when added to de novo catheter ablation of persistent AF. The&#xD;
      investigators will randomize patients with persistent AF undergoing a first AF ablation to&#xD;
      standard PVAI vs. a combined VOM ethanol infusion plus PVAI (VOM-PV) #2. To assess the impact&#xD;
      of VOM ethanol infusion added to repeat catheter ablation of recurrent AF after a failed&#xD;
      ablation. Patients undergoing a repeat procedure for persistent AF after a failed PVAI will&#xD;
      be randomized to either PVAI or VOM-PV as their repeat procedure. End points will include&#xD;
      freedom from symptomatic or electrocardiographic AF after 12-15 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the risk of stroke is comparable in persistent and paroxysmal AF, the prevalence of&#xD;
      persistent AF increases dramatically with increasing age, and thus is an overall more&#xD;
      significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In the United States, there are currently an&#xD;
      estimated 3.0 million adults with AF, and this number is expected to double in the next 25&#xD;
      years. Hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of AF are close to half a million per year,&#xD;
      which generates a tremendous economic burden on the health care system. When compared to&#xD;
      health care costs of non-AF control subjects, patients with AF have greater annual healthcare&#xD;
      costs (up to $8705 total annual incremental cost). On the basis of current prevalence data,&#xD;
      it is estimated that AF leads to a national incremental health care cost of up to $26&#xD;
      billion. Inadequacy of pharmacological treatment options for persistent AF Management&#xD;
      strategies are directed at heart rate control and stroke prevention -mere palliation- or at&#xD;
      rhythm control. It has been shown that rhythm control strategies using antiarrhythmic drugs&#xD;
      offer no benefit in elderly patients or patients with heart failure. Most of the lack of&#xD;
      benefit of such rhythm control strategy is thought to be due to the adverse effects and&#xD;
      suboptimal efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs that can potentially augment mortality. Indeed,&#xD;
      preservation of normal sinus rhythm is associated with decreased mortality. Dronedarone, the&#xD;
      only antiarrhythmic drug shown to improve outcomes in nonpermanent AF compared to placebo,&#xD;
      has been shown to double mortality, stroke and hospitalization for heart failure in the&#xD;
      PALLAS study in patients with permanent. Thus, antiarrhythmic drugs remain suboptimal at best&#xD;
      for the treatment of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shortcomings of catheter ablation of persistent AF Weak mechanistic rationale: Isolation of&#xD;
      the pulmonary vein (PVs2) and adjacent LA (PV antrum) is the accepted procedural endpoint,&#xD;
      based on the mechanistic concept that atrial extrasystoles arising from the PVs initiate&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF. Other, non-PV triggers have been demonstrated.36 The link between PV extra&#xD;
      systoles and AF is clear in paroxysmal AF, but not in persistent AF, in which the mechanisms&#xD;
      of AF seem to be related more to a chronic atrial substrate than to acute triggers.4 Indeed,&#xD;
      intramural reentry in the posterior LA seems to be particularly relevant in chronic models of&#xD;
      AF. In persistent AF, the procedure has evolved, rather simplistically, to include additional&#xD;
      lesions -besides isolation of the PVs, variably placed in the posterior wall, LA roof, and&#xD;
      towards the mitral annulus, the superior vena cava,44 left atrial appendage, and other areas&#xD;
      where complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) may be mapped. This brute force&#xD;
      approach of simply destroying more tissue has yielded additional success, but new procedural&#xD;
      targets with solid mechanistic bases are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suboptimal success and need for repeat procedures. Despite the additional tissue destruction,&#xD;
      ablation success in persistent AF is with much lower than in paroxysmal AF, with single&#xD;
      procedure success reported as low as 27%, 36%, or 49%, but up to 61% or 67%, depending on&#xD;
      study heterogeneities in: definitions of persistent AF and of recurrence of AF, the type of&#xD;
      AF monitoring, and ablation technique and operator experience. In order to achieve overall&#xD;
      acceptable success rates, (which can reach up to 79%-94%), there is a consistent need for&#xD;
      repeat procedures (sometimes up to 4) and the concomitant use of antiarrhythmic drugs. The&#xD;
      rate of repeat procedures in experienced centers can reach up to 70 to 80%.PMF after catheter&#xD;
      ablation of persistent AF. Clinical failures of a first ablation procedure are caused, in a&#xD;
      significant portion of patients, by atrial flutters, rather than recurrent AF, and recurrence&#xD;
      as flutter portends a greater chance of success in a second procedure. Such atrial flutters&#xD;
      may be caused by perimitral reentry in up to 33-60% of the patients. Catheter ablation of PMF&#xD;
      involves the creation of a linear lesion from the mitral annulus to the left inferior PV (the&#xD;
      so-called mitral isthmus).Achieving a complete ablation (defined by bidirectional conduction&#xD;
      block across the ablation line) can be very difficult, with success rates reported as 32%,&#xD;
      64%, or 71%. It sometimes requires ablation inside the coronary sinus (CS), in close&#xD;
      proximity to the circumflex coronary artery, which could be damaged of note, incomplete&#xD;
      ablation of the mitral isthmus is proarrhythmogenic, increasing the risk of recurrent flutter&#xD;
      by up to 4 times.&#xD;
