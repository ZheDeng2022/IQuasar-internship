      The Hyper-CL™ lenses are indicated for therapeutic use as a bandage to protect the corneal&#xD;
      surface and to relieve corneal pain in the treatment of acute or chronic ocular pathologies,&#xD;
      such as bullous keratopathy, corneal erosions, entropion, corneal edema, and corneal&#xD;
      dystrophies as well as post-surgical conditions resulting from cataract extraction and&#xD;
      corneal surgery. The lenses may be prescribed for daily wear with removal for cleaning and&#xD;
      disinfection (chemical, not heat) prior to reinsertion, as recommended by the eye care&#xD;
      professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition Hyper-CL™ contact lenses can also provide optical correction during healing if&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective open-label, randomized, crossover clinical study To evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the Hyper-CL™ lens in subjects suffering from corneal edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of the Hyper-CL™ lens contact lens on corneal&#xD;
      edema thickness as compared with salt solution treatment only in subjects suffering from&#xD;
      corneal edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with the Hyper-CL™ lens may result with greater reduction in edema thickness as&#xD;
      compared with treatment with salt solution only in subjects suffering from corneal edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women suffering from a decrease in vision due to corneal edema that meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and provide written Informed Consent will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 25 subjects will be enrolled. Each subject will be treated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A: Hyper-CL™ lens only (7 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B: Hyper-CL™ lens + salt solution (7 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment C: salt solution only (7 days) One week (7 days) of washout without any&#xD;
           treatment will be between treatments. Subject will be equally allocated (with a&#xD;
           1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio) to one of the following 6 crossover regimen based on a randomization&#xD;
           scheme with blocks stratified by center: C-A-B; B-C-A; A-B-C; C-B-A; B-A-C; A-C-B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 2 centers will participate in this study. Each subject will be followed from baseline&#xD;
      to 42 days. All Subjects will come for a clinic visit at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 days post&#xD;
      first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of active enrolment is anticipated to last approximately 6 months. The primary end&#xD;
      point will be achieved when the final study subject has completed 42 day follow-up.&#xD;
