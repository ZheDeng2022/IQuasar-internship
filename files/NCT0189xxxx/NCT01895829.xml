  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if ferumoxytol, when given at the time&#xD;
      of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can help researchers learn more about the spread of&#xD;
      certain kinds of cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ferumoxytol is designed to deliver iron to treat iron-deficiency anemia (low red blood cell&#xD;
      counts) in patients with chronic kidney disease. In this study, it will be used as an MRI&#xD;
      contrast. Contrasts are used by doctors in order to see MRI images more clearly.&#xD;

      Study Scans:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have 2 study MRIs. These&#xD;
      scans will be performed at the Center for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (CABI), in the South&#xD;
      Campus Research Building at MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, you will have 2 standard MRIs, as part of your standard of care. About an hour&#xD;
      after these 2 scans, you will receive ferumoxytol by vein. Right after that, you will have&#xD;
      your first study MRI. The study MRI will be performed in the same way that a standard MRI is&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 2, about 24 and 72 hours after you receive ferumoxytol, you will have a second study&#xD;
      MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1 and 3, as well as 4 weeks after the first study MRI:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and/or to check your iron&#xD;
           level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have not had one in the last month, you will have a PET-CT scan to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on study for about 4 weeks. You will be taken off study if you have intolerable&#xD;
      side effects or you are unable to have the scans for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Ferumoxytol is commercially available and FDA-approved for&#xD;
      the treatment of iron deficiency anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 20 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>Feasibility defined as at least 15 (75%) patients finish the imaging process and good quality images obtained. Good quality image defined as subjective quality assessment score of 4 by two independent radiation oncologists and one radiologist for clinical usability for radiotherapy planning on a 5-point scale. The 5-point scale is defined with 0 implying unable to assess and 5 implying optimal image quality.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients 18 years of age or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed head&#xD;
             and neck squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Measurable clinical and/or radiographic poly-nodal disease defined as stage N2b, N2c&#xD;
             or N3 disease with multiple involved lymph nodes as defined by the American Joint&#xD;
             Committee on Cancer (AJCC) cancer staging criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have received or are dispositioned to receive a Positron emission&#xD;
             tomography (PET) and computerized tomography (CT) [PET-CT] scan within two weeks of&#xD;
             starting definitive therapy for their head and neck malignancy and their participation&#xD;
             in this study. This implies patients must receive a PET-CT to be eligible for the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have undergone definitive resection of their primary or nodal disease as&#xD;
             well as any chemotherapy or radiation therapy for their head and neck primary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients unable or unwilling to give written, informed consent or to undergo MRI&#xD;
             imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Women of childbearing potential (A woman of child-bearing potential is a sexually&#xD;
             mature woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or who has not been naturally&#xD;
             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months [i.e., who has had menses at any&#xD;
             time in the preceding 24 consecutive months]). Male partners must practice effective&#xD;
             contraception (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive; tubal&#xD;
             ligation; intra-uterine device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or vasectomized&#xD;
             partner) throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients unable to tolerate DCE-MRI or having an estimated GFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m^2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Contraindications to iron supplementation include hemochromatosis, colitis, history of&#xD;
             GI bleeds, alcoholism, or liver disease. Ferumoxytol is contraindicated in patients&#xD;
             with evidence of iron overload and/or known hypersensitivity to Feraheme or any of its&#xD;
             components. Consequently, we will plan to exclude patients who have symptoms or signs&#xD;
             that might be caused by iron overload. These include patients with (unexplained):&#xD;
             arthritis (including premature osteoarthritis), congestive heart failure or&#xD;
             cardiomyopathy, adult-onset diabetes, secondary hypogonadism, increased skin&#xD;
             pigmentation, or patients with persistently elevated serum ferritin not explained by&#xD;
             an underlying inflammatory/systemic disease, unless these patients demonstrate a&#xD;
             fasting transferrin saturation &lt;/= 0.45.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with any evidence of iron overload on pre-imaging laboratory studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with any contraindications to gadolinium-based contrast agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
