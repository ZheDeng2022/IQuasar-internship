      Present study is conducted on Gutkha and Pan Masala users to find out the impact of ban on&#xD;
      them. It will also try to find out awareness about ban and source of information for the&#xD;
      same. Availability of Gutkha and Pan Masala in post ban period will also be assessed.&#xD;

      Background: Based on the various reports indicating health hazards of gutka and pan masala&#xD;
      there are various efforts to ban the production, consumption, sale, storage and&#xD;
      transportation of these products by various states in India. The situation had gone to such&#xD;
      an extent that government had no other option than to ban these products. In India gutka is&#xD;
      classed as a food item and falls within the purview of Prevention of Food Adulteration act.&#xD;
      The Central Committee on Food Standards (CCFS) had already reported a complete ban to the&#xD;
      Central Government a decade ago itself. The reasons unanimously given by CCFS for a complete&#xD;
      ban on Gutka were 1) Children are getting addicted to these products in large numbers; 2)&#xD;
      Users develop Oral Submucous Fibrosis and cancer over a relatively shorter duration and die&#xD;
      earlier compared to smokers; 3) Women prefer smokeless tobacco due to social disapproval of&#xD;
      their smoking and therefore may be particularly vulnerable to gutka addiction. Tamil Nadu had&#xD;
      banned Gutka in 2001 itself. Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Maharashtra &amp; Rajasthan had also followed&#xD;
      the same in August 2002.4 Subsequently following some legal battles ban on Gutka in&#xD;
      Maharashtra was lifted. But now following the example of eight other states in India,&#xD;
      Government of Maharashtra has finally banned the manufacture, storage, distribution or sale&#xD;
      of Gutka and Pan masala, containing either tobacco and/or nicotine or Magnesium Carbonate as&#xD;
      ingredients by whatsoever name these are available in the market and any other products&#xD;
      marketed separately to constitute as Gutka and Pan Masala, etc. as final products from July&#xD;
      19, 2012.8 The appeal filed by some manufacturers in Bombay High Court has been quashed and&#xD;
      the ban is to continue now unless it is reversed by the Supreme Court of India. Sensing the&#xD;
      possibility of Supreme Court (SC) appeal by gutka and pan masala manufacturers the Government&#xD;
      of Maharashtra has already filed an caveat there so that there plea will be heard first by SC&#xD;
      before passing any order in this matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a large population addicted to Gutkha and pan-masala all over India. We would like&#xD;
      to study the impact of this ban on the users of this product and on the tobacco vendors. Even&#xD;
      if the ban is reversed by the Supreme Court, we would still like to study its impact in the&#xD;
      interim period when the ban was imposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Seeing the addictive potential of the contents of gutka and pan masala, it will be&#xD;
      interesting to record the effect of ban of these products on the regular consumers. Whether&#xD;
      they have stopped the consumption or are still getting the products (by smuggled routes) is&#xD;
      an important issue. If they have shifted to other tobacco products, it will be important to&#xD;
      study the shift pattern. If at all some withdrawal symptoms are reported by them, it will be&#xD;
      helpful to record it so as to devise our cessation strategies. If the previous regular&#xD;
      consumers have stopped the consumption of gutka and pan masala because of ban, it is positive&#xD;
      sign in support of legal ban for the maintenance of proper public health. The response of&#xD;
      gutka and pan masala users to the ban has to be studied. To what extent they have accepted&#xD;
      the ban and what reaction they are giving are important issues to be studied. In depth&#xD;
      analysis of all these points will be helpful in the development of further public health&#xD;
      strategy as far as use of gutka and pan masala is concerned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aspect of this study is to investigate the response and implications of tobacco&#xD;
      vendors to the ban. In last few years there was tremendous increase in vendors of tobacco&#xD;
      especially Gutka and Pan-masala. These products being cheaply available were marketed in&#xD;
      almost all corners of cities and villages. Even public transport vehicle were also flooded by&#xD;
      the presence of many street vendors. Ultimately all these vendors were working as the&#xD;
      merchants of deadly tobacco products. So the study of the response of these people to ban is&#xD;
      an issue of interest. The implication of the ban on them if studied in depth can help us to&#xD;
      devise some strategy for their rehabilitation and preventive programmes to deter them from&#xD;
      indulging into such type of business. We may also get some newer insights to strengthen the&#xD;
      ban.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the knowledge of gutkha and pan-masala users regarding the ban&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the awareness regarding health hazards of gutkha and pan masala among the&#xD;
           users&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate the effectiveness with which the gutkha and pan masala ban has been&#xD;
           implemented&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the impact of gutkha and pan masala ban on previous users in terms of&#xD;
           availability, reduction of use, quitting, switch over to other tobacco products, cost of&#xD;
           available products etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To understand the perception of gutkha and pan masala among users regarding the ban.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To record any personal positive or negative experience (e.g. health effects) that the&#xD;
           user experienced after the ban.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To assess the perception of tobacco vendors regarding the ban.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To understand the financial implications of the ban on the vendors&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To record if the vendors still sell gutkha and pan-masala and the details regarding the&#xD;
           same (source, brands, costing etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. To record if the tobacco vendors themselves were gutka and pan masala users and their&#xD;
           tobacco related behaviour after the ban.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. To observe if there are empty sachets of Gutkha/ pan masala lying near the shops of&#xD;
           tobacco vendors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To record the prevalence of gutkha and pan-masala use in low socio economic community in&#xD;
      Mumbai suburbs (before the ban was imposed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study type : Cross sectional study Study area : PMGP area - Pocket No. 6, Mankhurd, Mumbai&#xD;
      Low socio-economic community in suburbs of Mumbai Total population: Around 6000 Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria : For survey: All tobacco users Part I - All the persons (≥ 18 years) using gutkha&#xD;
      and/or pan masala (at the time of implementation of ban) in the selected community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part-II All tobacco vendors (≥ 18 years) in the selected locality Exclusion criteria : Those&#xD;
      dead, shifted out of the area, unwilling to give consent and severely ill will be excluded&#xD;
      Sample size : The selected community PMGP area - Pocket No. 6, Mankhurd has a total&#xD;
      population of around 6000, with 1100 tobacco users (as documented in the previous&#xD;
      departmental program) will be surveyed to enlist the gutka and pan-masala users who are the&#xD;
      eligible participants for the Part I of the trial (Expected about 75-90). For Part II of the&#xD;
      trial all tobacco vendors in the PMGP area - Pocket No. 6, Mankhurd will be invited for&#xD;
      participation. (Expected about 10) Study duration : Three months Study tool : Two separate&#xD;
      Pre-designed and pre-tested questionnaires to be administered by trained Medical Social&#xD;
      Workers, one for the gutka and pan-masala users and the other for the tobacco vendors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis : The data entry will be done by EDP Technicians in SPSS software&#xD;
      version 19. Data errors will be checked. The compiled data will be analysed with the help of&#xD;
      Stata software. The qualitative data will be analysed with the help of Non parametric tests.&#xD;
      The effects of the ban on change in tobacco habit and various factors responsible for the&#xD;
      same will be analysed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical manpower:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Social Workers: 2 EDP Technician: 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is proposed to be conducted at PMGP area (Pocket No.6), which is one of the&#xD;
      clusters of the mobile outreach programme of the department of Preventive Oncology. Under&#xD;
      this programme women are screened for breast, cervix and oral cavity cancers. A list of male&#xD;
      and female tobacco users in this area will be made available from the previous program data.&#xD;
      This area is being selected for the present trial since our observation suggests that the&#xD;
      prevalence of tobacco usage among both men and women is high in this area though the data&#xD;
      inputting is still on-going. The project will be carried out even if the ban is lifted by the&#xD;
      Supreme Court to understand the behaviour of the gutka and pan-masala users in the interim&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first all the important stakeholders in the concerned issue will be identified.viz&#xD;
      Community leaders, NGOs, health care providers etc. The plan to establish community rapport&#xD;
      with the help of these stakeholders for the current project will be developed. Then required&#xD;
      staff members will be recruited. They will be given necessary training at Preventive Oncology&#xD;
      Department. Pre-designed proforma will be pilot tested in community and necessary changes&#xD;
      will be made. Maps of the households are available from our previous program. However,&#xD;
      extensive mapping of the tobacco vendors in the area and detailed micro-plan to implement the&#xD;
      project will be undertaken. Suitable time of the day will be identified for interview so as&#xD;
      to maximise the response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Medical Social workers will undertake house to house visits only to houses of male and&#xD;
      female tobacco users in the community (as identified in the previous project). The list of&#xD;
      the same will be made available to them from the previous program data. The MSWs will conduct&#xD;
      a short survey to identify the Gutkha and Pan-masala users amongst this population (at the&#xD;
      time of implementation of the ban). They will be taken into confidence and explained about&#xD;
      the objectives and methods of the study. They will then be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      trial and a written informed consent in local language will be obtained from them. Left hand&#xD;
      thumb impression will be obtained from those who are illiterates. A person from the same&#xD;
      community will be invited to witness the procedure of informed consent and will sign as an&#xD;
      impartial witness. Help of a translator will be taken whenever necessary. The invited&#xD;
      participants will be given the patient information sheet. Only after obtaining the informed&#xD;
      consent the participants will be enrolled in the trial and will be interviewed with the help&#xD;
      of pre-designed and pre-tested proforma questionnaire. A pamphlet containing information&#xD;
      regarding the health hazards of tobacco in both pictoral form and written in local language&#xD;
      will be given to the participant after the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aspect of the study deals with the response and implications of the ban on the&#xD;
      tobacco vendors. Here all the tobacco vendors in the same selected community PMGP area&#xD;
      (Pocket No.6) will be mapped and enumerated by MSWs. After initial interaction with them,&#xD;
      suitable time of the day will be selected to interview them again to get the maximum possible&#xD;
      response. After explaining the purpose of the study, they will then be invited to participate&#xD;
      in the trial. A written informed consent in local language will be obtained from them. Left&#xD;
      hand thumb impression will be obtained from those who are illiterates. A person from the same&#xD;
      community will be invited to witness the procedure of informed consent and will sign as an&#xD;
      impartial witness. Help of a translator will be taken whenever necessary. The invited&#xD;
      participants will be given the patient information sheet. Only after obtaining the informed&#xD;
      consent the participants will be enrolled in the trial. They will be interviewed using&#xD;
      another set of questionnaire so as to understand their response and implications to the ban.&#xD;
      Also observational survey will be made in the surrounding area to see if there are gutkha/&#xD;
      pan masala packets in the shop, direct or surrogate advertisements nearby, empty sachets of&#xD;
      Gutkha and pan masala lying in the nearby area etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will be completed in six months time. Data analysis will be done and&#xD;
      logical interpretations will be drawn and publicized so as to develop further strategies for&#xD;
      advocacy in support of the ban.&#xD;
