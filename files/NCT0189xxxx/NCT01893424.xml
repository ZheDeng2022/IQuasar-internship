      This project is intended to evaluate self-emulsifying drug delivery system termed&#xD;
      Piperine-Pro-Nano-Lipospheres (P-PNL) for enhancing the oral bioavailability of&#xD;
      tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD).The oral bioavailability of these&#xD;
      cannabinoids is hampered by extensive first pass metabolism, resulting in relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of 6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of THC-CBD P-PNL product for&#xD;
      oral administration to Sativex® buccal spray, as measured by AUC 0-24h, Tmax and Cmax.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disabling, lifelong disease of the central nervous system. The&#xD;
      currently available treatments with analgesic drugs for the management of MS associated pain&#xD;
      are limited in their efficacy, and frequently uncontrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most successful treatment for this MS pain was found to be the use of the combination of&#xD;
      Δ 9 -Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD) in 1:1 ratio. The rationale for the&#xD;
      combination of the two cannabinoids was aroused by the reports in the scientific literature&#xD;
      that CBD could not only potentiate the therapeutic effects of THC but also diminish the&#xD;
      undesirable effects of THC such as anxiety, panic, sedation, dysphonia and tachycardia.&#xD;
      Additionally, co-administration of THC and CBD was reported to be safe with no tolerance,&#xD;
      abuse or withdrawal effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although therapeutic rationale for the THC and CBD combination was established, an optimal&#xD;
      oral dosage form to deliver this cannabinoids combination is not available yet. The reason&#xD;
      for that is the marked &quot;first pass&quot; metabolic effect of the cannabinoids in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract leading to very limited oral bioavailability of 6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project we shall utilize our biopharmaceutical experience using an advanced&#xD;
      self-emulsifying drug delivery system termed Piperine-Pro-Nano-Lipospheres (P-PNL) for&#xD;
      enhancing the oral bioavailability of THC and CBD. P-PNL is an isotropic mixture of a natural&#xD;
      alkaloid (piperine) and the active compounds (THC and CBD) in a combination of lipids,&#xD;
      surfactants and co-solvent termed the pre-concentrate, which is administered in a soft&#xD;
      gelatin capsule. We have shown in pre-clinical investigation that incorporation of THC and&#xD;
      CBD into P-PNL is a promising strategy to enhance their oral bioavailability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the primary goal of this study: is to evaluate the bioequivalence of the developed&#xD;
      THC-CBD P-PNL product for oral administration to Sativex®. This is a currently available&#xD;
      product of THC and CBD combination. Sativex® is a solution that has to be administered by&#xD;
      spray onto the oromucosal surface to bypass the &quot;first pass&quot; metabolism of the cannabinoids&#xD;
      associated with intestinal absorption. SATIVEX® is approved in various countries (i.e.&#xD;
      Canada, UK, Spain, New Zealand and Israel-distributed by Neopharm) for a MS pain treatment&#xD;
      and in Canada also for cancer pain treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed on 12 healthy male volunteers. It will be an open label,&#xD;
      cross-over single-arm two sequences study intended to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of THC&#xD;
      and CBD. Each volunteer will receive THC:CBD capsule and Sativex® . Both study groups&#xD;
      THC-CBD-Piperine-PNL vs. Sativex® will receive identical doses of THC and CBD; 21.6 mg and 20&#xD;
      mg respectively. blood samples will be withdrawn through indwelling cannula from the forearm&#xD;
      30 minutes before (pre-dose) and every 30 minutes interval for the first 4 hours then blood&#xD;
      samples will be taken at, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 24 hours after the intake of the study drug.&#xD;
      Blood concentration profiles of THC, CBD and their main metabolites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      11-hydroxy-THC, 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC and CBD-glucoronide will be determined in order to&#xD;
      calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters of THC and CBD.&#xD;
