  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome raises the risk of heart disease and is currently at epidemic&#xD;
      proportions in the U.S. It consists of 3 of the following components: central obesity, high&#xD;
      triglycerides, low HDL, abnormal blood pressure and impaired fasting glucose levels. Previous&#xD;
      studies have suggested that omega-3 fish oil may influence some of these components but the&#xD;
      mechanisms involved are not well understood. Therefore, this proposal will investigate how&#xD;
      omega-3 fish oils affect inflammation, lipids and fat breakdown by comparing it to placebo.&#xD;
      Favorable outcomes from this study could translate into a new approach to improve heart&#xD;
      disease risk in men and women with the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;

      Metabolic Actions of Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Inflammation and Adipocyte Lipolysis in the&#xD;
      Metabolic Syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies identify metabolic syndrome (MetS) as a biomarker of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD) risk, and recent AHA scientific statements recommend intensive lifestyle diet&#xD;
      and exercise measures to reduce risk. Marine-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such&#xD;
      as, eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) improve many constituents of the metabolic syndrome such as&#xD;
      lowering fasting TG and glucose levels, inflammation, insulin resistance and blood pressure.&#xD;
      These improvements may be mediated by increased fat cell storage and metabolism and lipids,&#xD;
      reducing inflammation and ectopic fat deposition in visceral abdominal tissue, muscle and&#xD;
      liver that results in excessive pro-inflammatory intra-abdominal fat (IAF), insulin&#xD;
      resistance and reduced levels of HDL cholesterol, hallmark characteristics of the MetS. The&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory actions of EPA lower acute phase reactants (APRs) and proinflammatory&#xD;
      mediators are mechanisms for their lipid lowering and insulin sensitizing effects to reduce&#xD;
      CVD risk. The systematic investigation of marine-derived omega-3 PUFAs on these inflammatory,&#xD;
      metabolic and physiological parameters will provide new mechanistic insights for the&#xD;
      therapeutic use of a potentially beneficial, safe nutraceutical, EPA in patients with MetS.&#xD;
      Thus, it is our hypothesis that supplementation of marine-derived omega-3 PUFAs, will reduce&#xD;
      constituents of MetS as well as systemic and tissue inflammation, insulin resistance&#xD;
      (HOMA-IR), adipocyte lipolysis and cytokine release from AT to enhance TG storage capacity of&#xD;
      subcutaneous AT. The reduction in inflammation and increase in insulin sensitivity will&#xD;
      remodel adipose tissue to function more efficiently in TG uptake and storage; thus, reducing&#xD;
      circulating FFAs and cytokines. We postulate that these metabolic effects may decrease&#xD;
      ectopic fat deposition in viscera (IAF and muscle), an intriguing, novel outcome that&#xD;
      provides rationale for the 9 month treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims are to conduct a pilot 9 month randomized trial in adults with high Tg and&#xD;
      at least one other component of the MetS to compare the effects of EPA vs. placebo on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Metabolic (e.g., lipoproteins, inflammatory cytokines, acute phase reactants, glucose&#xD;
      tolerance/insulin resistance) and adipose tissue responses (basal and insulin suppression of&#xD;
      lipolysis (ED50), LPL activity, cytokine release and lipogenesis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Regional fat distribution quantified anthropometrically as waist and hip&#xD;
      circumference, visceral and subcutaneous adipose volumes and muscle lipid accumulation by&#xD;
      CT-scan and body composition (total and regional fat mass) by dual energy absorptiometry&#xD;
      (DXA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These outcomes have potentially intriguing therapeutic implications for marine derived&#xD;
      omega-3 PUFA supplementation as part of a lifestyle program for patients at increased&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk.&#xD;
