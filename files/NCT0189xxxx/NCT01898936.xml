      Organ transplant recipients (OTR) have an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer, in&#xD;
      particular squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), often developing in areas of field cancerization,&#xD;
      areas with multiple precancerous actinic keratoses. The risk of developing SCC in OTR is&#xD;
      65-100-fold the normal population (Jensen 1999, Lindeløf 2000), and this cancer often runs a&#xD;
      more aggressive course with metastasis reported to occur in 5-8% of cases (Berg 2002). The&#xD;
      treatment options in field cancerization are limited. In Norway, the registered treatment&#xD;
      alternatives are the topical immune response modifier imiquimod and photodynamic treatment.&#xD;
      Neither of these treatments has shown long term beneficial effects.&#xD;

      Protocol for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;A randomized half-side comparative trial of fractional laser-assisted daylight photodynamic&#xD;
      therapy versus daylight photodynamic therapy in organ transplant recipients with multiple&#xD;
      actinic keratoses of the scalp or forehead&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organ transplant recipients (OTR) have an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer, in&#xD;
      particular squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), often developing in areas of field cancerization,&#xD;
      areas with multiple precancerous actinic keratoses. The risk of developing SCC in OTR is&#xD;
      65-100-fold the normal population (Jensen 1999, Lindeløf 2000), and this cancer often runs a&#xD;
      more aggressive course with metastasis reported to occur in 5-8% of cases (Berg 2002). The&#xD;
      treatment options in field cancerization are limited. In Norway, the registered treatment&#xD;
      alternatives are the topical immune response modifier imiquimod and photodynamic treatment.&#xD;
      Neither of these treatments has shown long term beneficial effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photodynamic treatment (PDT) is a treatment that selectively targets abnormal cells, through&#xD;
      radical oxygen species (ROS) generated by photosensitizers activated by visible light.&#xD;
      Activation by light can be performed with lamps (LED lamps) or by daylight. Daylight-PDT is&#xD;
      shown to be less painful than PDT performed with lamps (Wiegell 2008). The photosensitizer is&#xD;
      applied directly on the skin surface after careful removal of hyperkeratosis. PDT is shown to&#xD;
      be effective in treating epithelial dysplasia in the immunocompetent population, with&#xD;
      clearance rates of 71-100% for facial and scalp keratosis, and 44-73% on acral sites (Morton&#xD;
      2002). The lesser effectiveness on extremities is possibly due to more hyperkeratosis on&#xD;
      extremities with less absorption of the cream. PDT is shown to be less effective in the&#xD;
      transplant population compared to the non-immunosuppressed (Dragieva 2004, Morton 2008). The&#xD;
      reason is most likely multifactorial, but the thickness of the hyperkeratotic layer is&#xD;
      regarded as an important factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal models as well as in humans, it has been shown by fluorescence measurements that&#xD;
      ablative fractional laser treatment facilitates delivery of the photosensitizing cream deeply&#xD;
      into the skin (Haedersdal 2010, Togsverd-Bo 2012). The laser ablates columns of skin,&#xD;
      facilitating penetration and thereby increasing the absorption of the drug to deeper layers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will study the effect of pre-treating the skin with ablative, fractional&#xD;
      carbondioxide laser before PDT in a group of OTR with multiple actinic keratoses. Two&#xD;
      symmetrical areas of the scalp or forehead will be randomized and one side will be allocated&#xD;
      to receive fractional ablative carbondioxide laser treatment. Both symmetrical areas will&#xD;
      then receive daylight PDT. The primary endpoints will be a comparison of the fraction of&#xD;
      lesions with a complete response to treatment (CR). Secondary endpoints will be graded&#xD;
      treatment response and adverse effects to treatment; both acute (pain) and long-term (scars&#xD;
      and pigmentary changes). The patients will be evaluated 4 months after the treatment&#xD;
      procedure. For a detailed description of the procedure, see below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, two-treatment half-side comparative study of daylight PDT with or&#xD;
      without ablative fractional carbondioxide laser with blinded treatment assessment. The study&#xD;
      will compare both efficacy and tolerability of one treatment of fractional laser assisted&#xD;
      daylight-PDT versus daylight-PDT only treating multiple actinic keratoses in two symmetrical&#xD;
      areas of the scalp or forehead in organ transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be pre-treated with removal of thick keratoses (grade 2 and 3) from both&#xD;
      sides of scalp or forehead one week before randomization and treatment. After randomization,&#xD;
      one side will be allocated to treatment with ablative fractional carbondioxide laser and&#xD;
      daylight PDT; the other side will receive daylight-PDT only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain will be evaluated with a VAS score after 2 hours in daylight, and patients will be&#xD;
      instructed to repeat this score evaluating pain in treatment areas the successive days after&#xD;
      treatment, and report this when contacted by phone after one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      15 OTR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization is performed immediately before the fractional laser procedure from a computer&#xD;
      generated list and allocation is concealed by drawing lots of sealed, opaque envelopes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After written informed consent patients are offered removal of superficial hyperkeratosis by&#xD;
      curettage and/or keratolytic cream one week before inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two symmetrical treatment areas in either scalp or forehead are marked with a pen,&#xD;
      photographed and long hair will be cut in the treatment areas. Actinic keratoses will be&#xD;
      registered and graded according to Olsen (Olsen 1991). Treatment areas will then covered with&#xD;
      plastic and marked with areas to be treated and the keratotic lesions (with grading). The&#xD;
      plastics will be saved/transferred to paper and saved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be a field treatment performed with a 30 W Lutronic carbondioxide laser;&#xD;
      covering one of the symmetrical treatment areas allocated to fractional carbondioxide laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laser settings will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fluence will initially be 10mJ/cm2 delivered with a 120 micron tip (producing 120 micron&#xD;
      ablative columns) with 5% density. The fluence will be increased until the patient&#xD;
      experiences pain (pain indicating penetration to dermis), and then reduced to maximum fluence&#xD;
      without pain. Allocation to laser therapy is blinded for the future evaluator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PDT procedure includes application of Metvix cream on the skin on both symmetrical areas&#xD;
      with a thickness of approximately 1 mm, plastic covering for 30 minutes before entering&#xD;
      daylight for 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients did not receive prophylactic treatment of antibiotics as originally stated after an&#xD;
      overall reevaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will return the treatment site after daylight exposure to register immediate&#xD;
      adverse events (pain) and will be contacted by phone 1 week after the treatment procedure to&#xD;
      evaluate adverse effects the days after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinded evaluation will be performed at 4 months after the treatment procedure, and will&#xD;
      include registration and grading of actinic keratoses in the treatment areas. Evaluation will&#xD;
      be supported by pre-treatment photographs and plastics with drawings.(Comment: Patiens were&#xD;
      originally planned to be evaluated after 4 and 12 months, but after 4 months we observed new&#xD;
      Aks among the patients, and it would be unethical to wait to next evaluation after 12 months&#xD;
      before the new Aks were treated. This is the reason why we changed to only 4 monts follow-up)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluation Patients will be evaluated at 4 months by an investigator blinded to&#xD;
      which side was allocated to assisted ablative fractional laser treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics We will test treatment effects on clearance and improvement by a logistic&#xD;
      regression model with generalized estimating equations (GEEs) taking multiple AKs within the&#xD;
      same patient into account (robust estimator and exchangeable working correlation). The&#xD;
      results will be presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. The reason why this&#xD;
      method will be used instead of Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test is the GEEs has&#xD;
      greater power and is better for this kind of data. Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to&#xD;
      compare paired data regarding pain.&#xD;
