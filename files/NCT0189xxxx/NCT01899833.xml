  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare how well a new radiolabeled imaging agent ECDG compares to the&#xD;
      current testing for coronary artery disease (radiolabeled Sestamibi) during a rest and stress&#xD;
      cardiac test as documented from results of a coronary angiogram (if performed).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, open-label, multi-center study assessing the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of 99mTc-EC-DG compared to 99mTc-SPECT MPI imaging for detecting the presence,&#xD;
      location, and severity of CAD as established by coronary angiography. Approximately 60&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will be patients who have been evaluated for CAD within 3 to 30 days by any&#xD;
      cardiovascular diagnostic imaging method (nuclear, ultrasound, CTA, MRI, etc.) and their&#xD;
      physician has planned for coronary angiography but angiography has not yet been performed. In&#xD;
      addition, the patient has not had coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). These patients can be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will be patients who have been evaluated for CAD within 3 to 30 days by any&#xD;
      cardiovascular diagnostic imaging method (nuclear, ultrasound, CTA, MRI, etc.) and the&#xD;
      patient has already had coronary angiography performed but has not received any coronary&#xD;
      intervention subsequent to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following sequence of imaging procedures will be performed for both Group 1 and 2&#xD;
      patients: The first procedure will be a 99mTc-EC-DG rest study. This will be followed within&#xD;
      24 hours to 3 days with a 1-day protocol 99mTc-SPECT MPI rest/stress study. This will be&#xD;
      followed within 24 hours to 3 days with a 99mTc-EC-DG stress study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both Group 1 and 2, if 1 of the diagnostic imaging procedures performed to evaluate the&#xD;
      presence of CAD was a traditional 99mTc-SPECT MPI rest/stress study, this procedure must be&#xD;
      repeated as 1 of the 3 SPECT imaging procedures required by the trial protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modality for provocative stress testing (exercise, pharmacologic, or&#xD;
      exercise/pharmacologic) will be matched between the 99mTc-SPECT study and the 99mTc-EC-DG&#xD;
      study. All prospectively performed 99mTc-EC-DG and 99mTc-SPECT studies will be conducted&#xD;
      using regadenoson as the pharmacologic stress agent. All imaging studies (99mTc-EC-DG,&#xD;
      99mTc-SPECT, coronary angiography) will be over-read by blinded, trained reviewers. The&#xD;
      consensus blinded read will determine and record the location of the CAD by relating the wall&#xD;
      of the myocardium affected to include: anterior, Inferior, lateral, septal and apex. The&#xD;
      angiography study will identify the arteries associated with the CAD; namely, left anterior&#xD;
      descending, circumflex or right coronary arteries. The study will also determine the severity&#xD;
      of the CAD by visually comparing the size and intensity of the ischemic signal on rest and&#xD;
      stress images obtained approximately 15 and 60 minutes post injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from the consensus blinded read of coronary angiography will be considered truth&#xD;
      for the presence, location, and severity of obstructive CAD and degree of stenosis.&#xD;

    <description>1. Determine efficacy (sensitivity and specificity) of 99mTc-ED-DG: i. Compare efficacy of a rest and stress study at approximately 15 minutes post injection compared with efficacy of a standard 99mTc-SPECT rest/stress perfusion study for detecting the presence of CAD using invasive coronary angiography as the truth standard.* ii. Compare efficacy of a rest and stress study at approximately 60 minutes post injection compared with a standard 99mTc-SPECT rest/stress perfusion study for detecting the presence of CAD using invasive coronary angiography as the truth standard.*&#xD;
* Images will be displayed using the standard Cedars Sinai tomographic display software which projects images in the short axis, vertical long, and horizontal long axis displays.</description>
