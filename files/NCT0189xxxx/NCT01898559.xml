    <textblock>
      This study examines the effects of smoking little cigars in different groups of smokers. The&#xD;
      investigators are focusing on differences in how smokers' bodies break down and eliminate&#xD;
      nicotine from their systems. Some people are fast metabolizers of nicotine, meaning they&#xD;
      break down and eliminate nicotine from their bodies more quickly. Other people are slower&#xD;
      metabolizers meaning they break down and eliminate nicotine more slowly. The investigators&#xD;
      are comparing these two groups of smokers when they switch to smoking cigars instead of&#xD;
      cigarettes.&#xD;

      This study examines the effects of switching from cigarette to little cigar smoking on&#xD;
      smoking behaviors and toxin exposure in fast and slow nicotine metabolizing smokers. We will&#xD;
      recruit current smokers (split between slow and rapid nicotine metabolizing smokers) for a&#xD;
      20-day protocol. Participants will smoke their own brand cigarettes during a baseline 5 day&#xD;
      period, followed by 15 days smoking little cigars. This study will use a validated,&#xD;
      phenotypic marker of nicotine metabolism rate that may identify those individuals at greatest&#xD;
      risk of harm exposure when using little cigars. This study will examine the compensatory&#xD;
      effects of little cigars on smoking behaviors and toxin exposure among slow and rapid&#xD;
      nicotine metabolizers.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  adults age 21-65.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  smoking at least 10 cigarettes per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  smoking daily for the last 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provide a baseline breath CO reading 10 parts per million.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  smoke predominantly filtered cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  not currently using any other nicotine containing products such as smokeless tobacco,&#xD;
             nicotine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  replacement therapies (patch or gum).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are fluent in English and are capable of providing written informed consent, which&#xD;
             includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the combined&#xD;
             consent and HIPAA form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have smoked at least 25 cigars in their lifetime&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and attend an Intake Visit for&#xD;
             medical screening will be asked to provide a blood sample to determine NMR. Only those&#xD;
             individuals who are characterized as slow or rapid, based on NMRs .26, or .42, will be&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. use of any nicotine containing products other than cigarettes&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. current or impending enrollment in smoking cessation program&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. history in the last year or current treatment of substance abuse (other than nicotine&#xD;
             dependence)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. positive drug screen for cocaine or opiates for urine drug screen at intake session&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. alcohol use greater than 25 standard drinks per week&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. current or planned pregnancy or lactating&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. history or current diagnosis of psychosis, bipolar disorder, mania, or schizophrenia&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. current major depression (history of major depression but in remission for a minimum 6&#xD;
             months is eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. serious or unstable disease within past year (e.g. cancer other than melanoma, heart&#xD;
             disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. history or current diagnosis of COPD&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. history of stroke or heart attack&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. age less than 21 years- participants must be 21 years old to give consent to volunteer&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. age more than 65 years - smoking is often associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary&#xD;
             obstructive diseases that manifest later in life. As smokers develop these problems,&#xD;
             smoking behavior and biomarkers of harm may be affected therefore we will restrict&#xD;
             enrollment to those under age 65&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. provide baseline CO reading less than 10 at initial session&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. current use (or use within past 14 days) of any medication that affects the&#xD;
             biotransformation of nicotine, such as anticonvulsant drugs, rifampin, and disulfiram;&#xD;
             or any psychoactive medications which can affect smoking behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. any conditions viewed by the PI or study physician as creating a potential increased&#xD;
             risk to a participant due to their participation will be reasons for exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. at the discretion of the PI, any participants viewed as non-compliant will be excluded&#xD;
             from further participation&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Smoke cigarettes with a filter size other than standard or slim sized as the&#xD;
             topography mouthpieces are sized for standard filters and have an adapter for slim&#xD;
             cigarettes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Participants with a positive breath alcohol reading at intake session where they are&#xD;
             being consented may be rescheduled. If participants have a positive breath alcohol at&#xD;
             a rescheduled intake session, they will be excluded.&#xD;
