      The main objective is to assess the variation in plasma levels of cathelicidin before and&#xD;
      after influenza vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All bibliographic data suggests that supplementation vitamin D in the elderly often deficient&#xD;
      in this vitamin may have a double interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By induction of cathelicidin, assist in anti-infective response in particular to the&#xD;
           influenza virus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The normalization of vitamin D status, promote the return to an appropriate immune&#xD;
           response limiting excess inflammation and improving capacity to respond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire project will collect new information on the merits of the use of vitamin D in&#xD;
      aging. A better knowledge of mechanisms involved and the impact of aging on them is a&#xD;
      necessary prerequisite the definition of a new strategy using this drug in the elderly&#xD;
      particularly fragile in order to improve its autonomy. This definition seems a sociological&#xD;
      interest obvious economic knowing the current aging population and its impact future of our&#xD;
      health system.&#xD;

           l: presentation of two ampoules of Vitamin D. Visit 5 - Month 3 vaccination INTANZA 15 ®&#xD;
           (3 months after the start of supplementation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recovery of boxes and empty ampoules of vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the clinical safety of vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of anthropometric data: measurement of current weight and BMI,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting blood sampling: for dosing of vitamin D, cathelicidin, exploration of&#xD;
           immunocompetent cells, calcium, phosphorus, urea and creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Influenza serology, Visit 6 - Month 4: end of study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination with assessment of tolerability of vaccination and delivery of the&#xD;
           form of reporting due to immunization and infectious complications side effects&#xD;
           according to the criteria of toxicity CTCNCI Bethesda,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of anthropometric data: measurement of current weight, calculating the weight&#xD;
           change,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting blood sampling: for dosing of vitamin D, cathelicidin, exploration of&#xD;
           immunocompetent cells, calcium, phosphorus, urea and creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of seroconversion, seroprotection, MGT antibodies following vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of the study Removal of anonymity for physician investigators to propose a vitamin D the&#xD;
