      Hypothesis: Deferasirox can be used as a therapeutic agent to deplete the liver, heart and&#xD;
      bone marrow of excess iron in patients with iron overload caused by myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      (MDS) and hemochromatosis (HC.&#xD;
&#xD;

      overload and their usefulness to monitor iron depletion treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study the effect of iron overload and iron depletion on intracellular signal transduction,&#xD;
      trace metals concentrations in serum and urine and markers of oxidative stress in blood cells&#xD;

      The two most important causes of iron overload disease in humans are the iron-loading&#xD;
      disorder hereditary hemochromatosis (HC), and transfusional siderosis in patients with&#xD;
      chronic hematological diseases like myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), thalassemia, and&#xD;
      leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemochromatosis. In HC the molecular regulation of iron uptake across the intestinal mucosa&#xD;
      is disturbed, leading to hyperabsorption and accumulation of iron in parenchymal tissues such&#xD;
      as the liver, pancreas, endocrine organs and heart. Hepcidin, a small peptide hormone&#xD;
      synthesized in the liver, apparently functions as the master regulator of systemic iron&#xD;
      homeostasis by its ability to control the efflux of iron from the enterocytes and macrophages&#xD;
      into blood plasma. This happens by diminishing the iron transfer capacity through the&#xD;
      basolateral, transmembrane protein, ferroportin. Expression of hepcidin is carefully adjusted&#xD;
      by the iron status of the hepatocytes through a multimolecular signal transducing pathway&#xD;
      which acts as a positive feedback mechanism with increased hepcidin synthesis in iron&#xD;
      overload (and inflammation). Mutation of one of the signal molecules, leads to inadequate&#xD;
      hepcidin synthesis. The most common are the classic C282Y and H63D point mutations of the&#xD;
      hemochromatosis protein HFE, which disturbs its interaction with the transferrin receptor 1,&#xD;
      the first step in the hepcidin signal cascade. Homozygosity for C282Y is the strongest risk&#xD;
      factor for serious iron overload and disease which develops after a long-lasting,&#xD;
      asymptomatic period. In Norway the prevalence of C283Y homozygosity is approximately 0.75 in&#xD;
      both genders. The preclinical, biochemical phenotype of HC is disclosed by blood tests with&#xD;
      elevated transferrin saturation as a marker of hyperabsorption of iron, and increasing&#xD;
      ferritin concentration as a surrogate marker of a growing iron overload. As an alternative to&#xD;
      liver biopsy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) seems to be a powerful non-invasive method to&#xD;
      directly assess the iron content of the liver and heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myelodysplastic syndrome and transfusional siderosis. Transfusional iron overload is the&#xD;
      result of multiple blood transfusions supplied over a long time period, each of which adds&#xD;
      approximately 220 to 250 mg of extra iron to the body. Because iron loading occurs via a&#xD;
      parenteral route with the macrophages as the primary target cells, the normal homeostatic&#xD;
      mechanisms are not responding adequately and the plasma hepcidin level can be normal or even&#xD;
      increased. Even if excess iron is better tolerated in macrophages than in parenchymal cells,&#xD;
      a life-threatening iron overload develops much faster with transfusional siderosis than&#xD;
      HFE-associated HC. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of stem cell&#xD;
      disorders with inefficient hematopoiesis and increased risk of developing acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia. The MDS International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) which is based on numbers of&#xD;
      cytopenias, cytogenetic features and number of blasts in the bone marrow, enables separation&#xD;
      of four risk groups with the following median survival years: low-risk patients, 5.7 years;&#xD;
      intermediate-1, 3.5 years; intermediate-2, 1.2 years; and high-risk 0.4 years. Many patients&#xD;
      become transfusion-dependent and get serious transfusional iron overload. Iron chelation is&#xD;
      recommended to low-risk and intermediate-1 patients with probable need of lifelong&#xD;
      transfusion therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequences of iron overload. If not interrupted, continuous iron loading will at some point&#xD;
      start to gradually damage vital organs such as liver, heart and endocrine organs, and lead to&#xD;
      serious disease and a shortened lifetime. At the molecular level persistently increased&#xD;
      amounts of reactive, small molecular weight iron complexes or the sporadic presence of free&#xD;
      iron in blood and tissues, are probably the fundamental pathogenetic mechanism in iron&#xD;
      overload. These substances are highly toxic due to their strong ability to catalyze the&#xD;
      formation of free radicals such as Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). The activity of free&#xD;
      radicals with damage of native molecules (e.g. DNA) and cellular structures is considered to&#xD;
      be the first step in organ and tissue injury. In blood, reactive iron exists as&#xD;
      Non-Transferrin Bound Iron (NTBI), mainly in the form of small molecular weight iron-citrate&#xD;
      complexes. NTBI is rapidly taken up by the liver and other organs where it adds to the&#xD;
      intracellular, reactive labile iron pool (LIP). The presence of NTBI and LIP has been found&#xD;
      to correlate with hepatic and cardiac damage in transfusional siderosis and HC. In addition,&#xD;
      the homeostasis of other trace metals may be abnormal in iron overload. Little is known about&#xD;
      this issue, which warrants a deeper study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment. In HC, the preferred iron removal therapy is venesection, whilst transfusional&#xD;
      iron overload is treated with iron chelators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical aims of study. The major objective is to determine the efficacy of deferasirox to&#xD;
      remove iron from the liver, heart and bone marrow in HC- and MDS-patients with iron overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explorative aims. Determine the correlation between the novel biomarkers hepcidin and NTBI,&#xD;
      and ferritin and transferrin saturation in serum; and liver iron concentration (LIC), heart&#xD;
      iron concentration (HIC), and bone marrow iron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the effect of iron overload and iron depletion with either deferasirox or venesection,&#xD;
      on the concentration of trace metals in serum and urine in HC and MDS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study the influence of iron overload and iron depletion with either deferasirox or&#xD;
      venesection, on intracellular signal transduction in blood cells isolated from HC and MDS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study the influence of iron overload and iron depletion with either deferasirox or&#xD;
      venesection on oxidative damage of DNA (examined in urine), and the antioxidant status in red&#xD;
      blood cells isolated from HC and MDS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establish reference values for the investigational serum and urine tests in healthy control&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the study. The major rationale of the study is related to the need to assess the&#xD;
      potential use of deferasirox to treat HC- and MDS-patients with iron overload. However,&#xD;
      several &quot;learning objectives&quot; are included: the impact of iron overload and iron depleting&#xD;
      treatment on NTBI, hepcidin, markers of oxidative stress, trace metals and intracellular&#xD;
      signal transduction molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although venesection is a safe and effective means of depleting iron in HC patients, it may&#xD;
      suppress hepcidin and thus increase iron absorption, particularly at the end of a long&#xD;
      treatment period. Also, some HC patients not only feel the cumbersome impact of frequent&#xD;
      phlebotomies in daily life, but also experience troublesome side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjective perception of venesection side effects was recently communicated in a survey&#xD;
      study among 210 HC patients across the United States and some european countries. Of these,&#xD;
      52% of patients undergoing weekly venesections and 37% of the patients in the maintenance&#xD;
      phase reported side effects &quot;always&quot; or &quot;most of the time&quot;, and 16% would &quot;definitely&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;probably&quot; refuse phlebotomy if they were offered an alternative treatment. Therefore,&#xD;
      investigation of the effect of chelator as a potential alternative therapy in HC is&#xD;
      warranted. Chelation therapy may not only remove excess iron from the body, but may also&#xD;
      counteract formation of reactive, free radicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In MDS patients transfusion dependency worsens the survival due to development of damaging&#xD;
      iron overload. With every 500 ng/mL increase of s ferritin above the threshold, the risk of&#xD;
      death increases by 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, iron depletion therapy has been monitored by s-ferritin, which decreases as&#xD;
      iron is progressively eliminated. However, s-ferritin is a non-specific parameter which is&#xD;
      sensitive to acute phase reactions associated with inflammations, chronic diseases and tissue&#xD;
      injury. Furthermore, s-ferritin does not offer information about the burden of free radical&#xD;
      production stimulated by reactive iron. For this reason, one aim of this study will be to&#xD;
      investigate whether new blood markers like NTBI and hepcidin, along with MRI assessment of&#xD;
      LIC and HIC, will improve the diagnosis of iron overload and more accurately identify those&#xD;
      patients who are at increased risk of iron induced damage and therefore will benefit from&#xD;
      iron depletion therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron overload can weaken the cellular antioxidant defence and result in oxidative DNA-damage&#xD;
      as the first step in carcinogenesis. Examination of the influence of iron overload and iron&#xD;
      depletion with either deferasirox or venesection on oxidative damage of DNA, and on the&#xD;
      antioxidant status in red blood cells will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased knowledge of how intracellular signal transduction is influenced by cellular iron&#xD;
      and use of deferasirox may provide new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of iron&#xD;
      overload. This will be examined in single leukocyte cell flowcytometry assays of the&#xD;
      following intracelluar signal parameters: stress sensor p53, mTOR and NFkB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, little is known about how iron overload interacts with the metabolism of other trace&#xD;
      metals. The concentration of a broad spectrum of trace metals in serum (S) and urine (U) will&#xD;
      be monitored throughout the study period by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry&#xD;
      (ICP-MS) (28) : boron (S,U), barium (S,U), beryllium (S,U), cadmium (S,U), cobalt (S,U),&#xD;
      cesium (S,U), copper (S,U), mercury (U), lithium (U), manganese (S), molybdenum (S), nickel&#xD;
      (S,U), lead (S,U), antimony (S,U), selenium (S,U), tin (S,U), strontium (S,U), thallium&#xD;
      (S,U), tungsten (S), yttrium (S,U), zinc (S,U).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tolerability of deferasirox will also be assessed throughout the study, either as sole&#xD;
      treatment in MDS patients or compared to venesection in HC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers are used solely as controls to determine the normal blood concentration of&#xD;
      the biomarkers and tests which will be performed in the patients. The controls will not be&#xD;
      treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous clinical trials in HC and MDS. Deferasirox has been studied in a variety of diseases&#xD;
      with transfusional iron overload, particularly in thalassemia. It has a favorable profile&#xD;
      with respect to efficacy, safety and tolerability. However, controlled clinical studies with&#xD;
      deferasirox in HC and MDS are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study by Phatak et al (2010) was the first clinical trial to demonstrate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of deferasirox in patients with C282Y-homzygot hemochromatosis. They showed that&#xD;
      serum ferritin levels were reduced similarly in two cohorts given respectively 10 mg/kg/day&#xD;
      and 15 mg/kg/day of deferasirox. Since the dose of 15 mg/kg/day caused a higher frequency of&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs), they recommended a staring dose of 10 mg/kg/day to be most appropriate&#xD;
      in HC- patients. The most important AEs were associated with an increase in serum creatinine&#xD;
      and liver enzymes. The study was limited by pretreatment of some patients with phlebotomy&#xD;
      prior to the deferasirox study; in addition, many of the patients had only mild iron&#xD;
      overload. For this reason, we see no argument to use a higher dose in our study, and&#xD;
      therefore we choose a starting deferasirox dose of 10 mg/kg/day in HC- patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study, 24 heavily transfused MDS patients were enrolled to receive 52 weeks of&#xD;
      deferasirox therapy. Deferasirox was well tolerated and effectively reduced LIC, labile&#xD;
      plasma iron and s-ferritin in patients completing 24 to 52 weeks of therapy, despite ongoing&#xD;
      receipt of red blood cell transfusions. In addition to reducing long-term toxicity of iron&#xD;
      overload, chelation therapy has shown beneficial effects on hematopoiesis in a small&#xD;
      proportion of MDS patients. One ongoing study comparing deferasirox with placebo was found in&#xD;
      Cochrane search carried out in June 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics of deferasirox. Deferasirox (Exjade®) is a bivalent iron chelator which is&#xD;
      taken orally as a tablet, once per day. It is readily absorbed and reaches peak concentration&#xD;
      in blood after 1 to 2 hours. The half-life is 12 to 17 hours, and effective levels of active&#xD;
      chelator are maintained in the blood for more than 24 hours. The drug is eliminated via the&#xD;
      hepatobiliary system. The dose varies from 10 mg/kg/day in patients with mild iron overload&#xD;
      to 30 mg/kg/day in patients with overt iron toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs) of deferasirox. The most frequent adverse clinical events are&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disturbances and skin rash. The most frequent laboratory side effects are&#xD;
      mild increase in serum creatinine and liver transaminases. The adverse events have for the&#xD;
      most part been reported in patients with transfusional iron overload. In HC patients the data&#xD;
      are more scarce due to the very few studies that have been performed in this group. Other&#xD;
      common AEs include headache, constipation, abdominal distension, dyspepsia, pruritus, and&#xD;
      proteinuria. Less common AEs include anxiety, sleep disorder, dizziness, early cataract,&#xD;
      maculopathy, hearing loss, pharyngolaryngeal pain, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastric&#xD;
      ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastritis, oesophagitis, hepatitis, cholelithiasis, pigmentation&#xD;
      disorder, renal tubulopathy, glycosuria, pyrexia, edema, and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse reactions reported during post-marketing experience include pancytopenia,&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reaction, hepatic failure, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, urticaria, erythema&#xD;
      multiforme, alopecia, acute renal failure, and tubulointerstitial nephritis, gallstones and&#xD;
      related biliary disorders, elevations of liver transaminases, and hepatic failure. Any such&#xD;
      adverse events will be recorded in the subject's Case Report Form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study incorporates 4 arms, which will recruit in parallel:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: (open, randomized, comparative) will consist of 10 patients with confirmed HC, who&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive standard treatment with venesection (withdrawal of 450 mL blood&#xD;
      every 8 to 10 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: (open, randomized, comparative) will consist of 10 patients with confirmed HC, who&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive investigational treatment with deferasirox (10 mg/kg orally&#xD;
      given once daily) for a period of 12 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3: (open, non-comparative) will consist of 20 patients with confirmed MDS, all of whom&#xD;
      will receive investigational treatment with deferasirox (initially 10 mg/kg orally given once&#xD;
      daily, can be increased to max 40 mg/kg) for a period of 12 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 4: will consist of 10 healthy volunteers who will undergo the same screening assessments&#xD;
      (i.e. with respect to relevant exclusion criteria) and will act as non-treated normal&#xD;
      controls for comparison of investigational blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be non-blinded. Subjects and investigators will be aware of their subject and&#xD;
      treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo assessments at screening (within 1-14 days prior to baseline), and for&#xD;
      patients at baseline Day 0, and at 2,4,6,8 weeks, and thereafter monthly until 12 months, and&#xD;
      at follow up 4-6 weeks after treatment has been completed. Healthy controls will be examined&#xD;
      at screening, 2,6 and 12 months. Study-specific assessments will include physical&#xD;
      examinations/vital signs, sampling of blood, urine, and for patients only: bone marrow and&#xD;
      MRI to assess the effect of iron overload and iron reduction treatment on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conventional tests to indicate iron overload: ferritin and transferrin saturation in&#xD;
           serum; LIC and HIC, bone marrow iron content using microscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepcidin concentration in serum;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NTBI concentration in serum;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intracellular signal transduction parameters: Analysis of the stress sensor p53, NFkB,&#xD;
           and mTOR in leukocytes from peripheral blood;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trace metal concentrations in serum and urine;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antioxidant capability in blood hemolysate: Cu,Zn-SOD;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Free radical damage to DNA and RNA: 8-oxodG concentration in urine;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For MDS patients: number of transfusions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For HC and MDS patients: number of hospitalizations and overall survival;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients and controls, samples of peripheral blood will be taken pre-dose, and at 24&#xD;
      hours after dosing, for assessment of stress sensor p53, NFkB, and mTOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim assessments. Routine blood and urine tests will be performed for patients at 2,4,6,8&#xD;
      weeks, and thereafter monthly until 12 months and at follow up 4-6 weeks after end of&#xD;
      treatment for monitoring the disease, for safety reasons, and to obtain data for comparison&#xD;
      traditional biomarkers with the new investigational biomarkers hepcidin and NTBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will undergo all safety assessments plus investigational blood and urine tests.&#xD;
      They will not undergo MRI, bone marrow examinations, registrations of transfusions, or active&#xD;
      treatment with deferasirox or venesection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with HC or MDS will undergo a follow-up assessment 4 to 6 weeks after last dose. At&#xD;
      this visit, all safety assessments and investigational blood and urine tests, including a&#xD;
      pregnancy test, will be repeated, but MRI and bone marrow examination will not be performed.&#xD;
      Volunteer controls will not attend for this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory study with no sample size calculation and no minimum enrollment&#xD;
      requirement. It is anticipated that a maximum of 40 patients will be enrolled in order to&#xD;
      obtain at least 30 patients fulfilling the study criteria; 10 volunteers will also be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
