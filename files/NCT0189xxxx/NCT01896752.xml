  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-dose methotrexate therapy (HDMTX) is an important part of treatment of childhood acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). HDMTX would be improved substantially if it were possible to&#xD;
      predict the clearance of MTX for each patient and use this to tailor an individualized dosing&#xD;
      of the drug. However, only about 3.7, 0.2, and 2% of the inter-individual variation in MTX&#xD;
      clearance is explained by age, gender and ancestry, respectively. Genetic variation seems to&#xD;
      explain about 10% of this difference, and SNPs in genes encoding transporter proteins (e.g.&#xD;
      organic anion transporter 1B1 (OATP1B1) and reduced folate carrier (RFC)) are suggested to&#xD;
      have a particular large impact. A serious limitation to the applicability of SNPs in&#xD;
      prediction of MTX pharmacokinetics, however, is the substantial intra-individual variation in&#xD;
      MTX clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intra-individual variation in MTX clearance is related to renal function but a large&#xD;
      amount of a HDMTX dose also enters the liver, where it is metabolized to 7-hydroxy MTX and&#xD;
      probably also undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Thus, the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the role of the liver and renal function in MTX pharmacokinetics, and evaluate the&#xD;
      predictive potential of pharmacogenetic (e.g. the rfc SNP) and pharmacokinetic parameters of&#xD;
      MTX elimination during HDMTX.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Due to optimization of dosing and intensity of conventional anticancer drugs combined with&#xD;
      early risk group classification and clinical trials the cure rates of childhood acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is now beyond 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the most important drugs in the treatment of ALL and is a key&#xD;
      component in all treatment phases. Infusions with high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) are used in&#xD;
      many treatment protocols for ALL but the optimal dose and infusion time remain undefined. The&#xD;
      systemic clearance of MTX exhibits a large inter- and intra-individual variability and this&#xD;
      cause several clinical problems. Fast MTX clearance has been associated with increased risk&#xD;
      of relapse, whereas patients with slow MTX clearance have more side effects. In situations&#xD;
      with extremely low MTX clearance it is necessary to administer very high doses of leucovorin&#xD;
      in order to minimize toxicity; unfortunately treatment with this antidote can potentially&#xD;
      rescue some of the cancer cells and thereby increase the risk of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy with high-dose MTX would be improved substantially if it were possible to predict the&#xD;
      clearance of MTX for each patient and use this to tailor an individualized dosing of the&#xD;
      drug. However, only about 3.7, 0.2, and 2% of the inter-individual variation in MTX clearance&#xD;
      is explained by age, gender and ancestry, respectively. Genetic variation seems to explain&#xD;
      about 10% of this difference, and SNPs in genes encoding transporter proteins (e.g. reduced&#xD;
      folate carrier and the anion transporter 1B1, OATP1B1) are suggested to have a particularly&#xD;
      large impact. A serious limitation, however, is that SNPs are difficult to use in the&#xD;
      prediction of MTX pharmacokinetics when the intra-individual variation in MTX clearance has&#xD;
      been shown to be up to six fold. In order to use genetic variation in a clinically setting it&#xD;
      is necessary to reduce the large intra-individual clearance of MTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intra-individual variation in MTX clearance is related to renal function but a large&#xD;
      amount of a HDMTX dose also enters the liver, where it is metabolized to 7-hydroxy MTX and&#xD;
      probably also undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Additionally, an insignificant amount of&#xD;
      MTX is degraded to the inactive metabolite 4-amino-4-deoxy-N-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA). In&#xD;
      order to determine whether the renal or hepatic function is responsible for the large&#xD;
      intra-individual variation in MTX clearance the urinary excretion of MTX and the liver&#xD;
      metabolite 7-hydroxy MTX have been studied, and modelling was applied to predict the&#xD;
      individual time span for complete MTX excretion and to reveal early pharmacogenetic/kinetic&#xD;
      patterns predictive of elimination of MTX during HDMTX courses in children with ALL.&#xD;
