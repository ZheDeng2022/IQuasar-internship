      The purpose of this research study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of using two CRS&#xD;
      Arrays (microelectrodes) for long-term recording of brain motor cortex activity and&#xD;
      microstimulation of brain sensory cortex.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with tetraplegia (paralysis caused by illness or injury that results in partial&#xD;
      or total loss of the use of the arms and legs) have intact brain function but are unable to&#xD;
      move due to injury or disease affecting the spinal cord, nerves or muscles. Brain-machine&#xD;
      interface (BMI) technology is based on the finding that with intact brain function, neural&#xD;
      (nerve) signals are generated even though they do not reach the arms, hands and legs. By&#xD;
      placing (implanting) sensors on the surface of the brain, individuals can be trained to send&#xD;
      neural signals which are interpreted by a computer and translated to movement which can then&#xD;
      be used to control a variety of devices or computer displays. Using neural activity to&#xD;
      control an external device is referred to as a brain-machine interface (BMI) technology. In&#xD;
      addition, areas of the brain that are involved in interpreting sensations from the arms,&#xD;
      hands and legs remain functional after injury. It is therefore possible to send tiny&#xD;
      electrical pulses through implanted arrays to mimic sensory input that would normally come&#xD;
      from the arms, hands and legs. The investigators refer to this as &quot;microstimulation.&quot;&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must have limited or no ability to use both hands due to cervical spinal cord&#xD;
             injury, brainstem stroke or spinal stroke. Individuals with tetraplegia must have less&#xD;
             than grade 4 muscle strength in elbow extension and wrist extension and less than&#xD;
             grade 2 strength in finger flexor and abduction on the contralateral side to the&#xD;
             implant. We will include subjects with both complete and incomplete injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must report that they are unable to perform functional activities with the&#xD;
             hand contralateral to implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must be over 1 year post-injury at time of implantation. In addition, subject&#xD;
             must report no worsening in neurologic status (strength, sensation) for the previous 6&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must be between the ages of 22-70 years old. Participants outside this age&#xD;
             range may be at an increased surgical risk and increased risk of fatigue during BMI&#xD;
             training.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must live within 1 hour of the University of Pittsburgh during the study or&#xD;
             be willing to travel to the University of Pittsburgh at least once per week for BMI&#xD;
             training.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. If subjects do not live in the Pittsburgh area, they are expected to stay somewhere&#xD;
             within 1 hour of the University of Pittsburgh for at least 18 months after enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects must be able to communicate with the investigators in English because of the&#xD;
             need to follow the instructions of the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects must show an understanding of the study goals and have the ability to follow&#xD;
             simple directions as judged by the investigators&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects must have results that are within normal limits on neuropsychological and&#xD;
             psychosocial assessment; psychosocial health and support will be assessed by interview&#xD;
             with the psychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects must be able to activate distinct cortical areas during imagined or attempted&#xD;
             movement tasks (i.e. hand movement and speaking or moving the mouth); this will be&#xD;
             evaluated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as part of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects must have a stable psychosocial support and caregivers who are able to&#xD;
             perform the necessary daily care of the participant's skin and pedestal site. This&#xD;
             requires that the subject identify a caregiver and a backup who have been in place for&#xD;
             greater than 6 months and are able to provide needed physical and psychosocial&#xD;
             support. This will be assessed by the sponsor-investigator and study neurosurgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects must have a life expectancy greater than 18 months as assessed by the study&#xD;
             investigator and neurosurgeon sub-investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Documentation of informed consent must be obtained from the participant or their legal&#xD;
             representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Visual impairment such that extended viewing of a computer monitor would be difficult&#xD;
             even with ordinary corrective lenses&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Another serious disease(s) or disorder(s) that could affect ability to participate in&#xD;
             this study (verified during pre-op anesthesia evaluation to determine surgical risk&#xD;
             status)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Recent history of pressure sores that could be exacerbated by 1-2 days of bed rest&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Metallic implant(s) that would prohibit the subject from having an fMRI scan; spinal&#xD;
             fixators are generally non-ferrous and would not exclude someone from participating in&#xD;
             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any type of implantable generator such as a pacemaker, spinal cord stimulator,&#xD;
             cochlear implant, deep brain stimulator (DBS), DBS leads, vagus nerve stimulator, or&#xD;
             defibrillator&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women of childbearing age who are pregnant, lactating, or plan to become pregnant&#xD;
             during the next 25 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Allergy to contrast medium or kidney failure that could be exacerbated by contrast&#xD;
             agent (for MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects receiving medications (such as sedatives) chronically that may retard motor&#xD;
             coordination and cognitive ability&#xD;
&#xD;

             arrhythmias&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Individuals with an implanted hydrocephalus shunt&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Individuals who have had a stroke caused by a surgical procedure&#xD;

&#xD;
         24. Individuals who have had previous neurosurgical intervention involving the frontal&#xD;
             lobes (especially the motor cortex) and/or parietal lobe (especially the somatosensory&#xD;
