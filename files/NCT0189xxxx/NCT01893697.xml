      FRI could give the opportunity to investigate the possible effect of a lateral posture on&#xD;
      airway diameter and airflow distributions. This physiological study in healthy subjects may&#xD;
      help to identify the role of positioning as an aid in airway clearance techniques for&#xD;
      patients with respiratory diseases.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many respiratory diseases require a physiotherapeutic treatment that focusses on clearance of&#xD;
      excessive mucus from the airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying physiological hypothesis why those mucus clearance techniques are effective is&#xD;
      based on the development of an optimal expiratory airflow velocity that applies shearing&#xD;
      forces on the mucus at the inner surface of the airway. These shearing forces eventually lead&#xD;
      to displacement of mucus to the central airways were it could be evacuated.To accomplish&#xD;
      optimal velocity with the same expiratory airflow, it is necessary to decrease the airway&#xD;
      diameter and hence increase in the airflow velocity. In other words, the airway diameter and&#xD;
      resistance are important factors to take into account in mucus clearance techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many mucus clearance techniques, postural position is used to facilitate this clearance.&#xD;
      Clinical trials in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis where they combined clearance techniques with different postural positions showed to&#xD;
      be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of posture has been evaluated in the lateral decubitus position and resulted in&#xD;
      a greater clearance of mucus in the depended lung. The authors suggested that this may be due&#xD;
      to a better deflation of the depended lung that is favored by 3 forces: gravity, mediastinum&#xD;
      weight and pressure of abdominal viscera on the infra lateral lung. Deflation of this lung&#xD;
      leads not only to a decrease in lung volume, but also results in a decrease in airway&#xD;
      diameter. Nevertheless, it is not known to what extend this decrease in diameter occurs in a&#xD;
      lateral position. Furthermore, an optimal expiratory flow must be retained in the underlying&#xD;
      lung at lower lung volumes. These regional changes in the underlying lung cannot be measured&#xD;
      by for example classic lung function tests since these test are not sensitive enough. Indeed,&#xD;
      Washko et. al. found no significant changes of overall residual volume (RV), total lung&#xD;
      capacity (TLC) and vital capacity (VC) between the different positions in healthy subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, Functional respiratory imaging (FRI) is able to assess the regional changes in&#xD;
      healthy subjects. This 3D imaging technique in combination with computational fluid dynamics&#xD;
      (CFD) is accurate in calculating regional changes such as airway diameter, volume and&#xD;
      resistance. In addition, repetitive FRI measures are able to assess lobar expansion, which is&#xD;
      an indirect measure of airflow distribution in a specific part of the lung.&#xD;

    <description>A low dose 3D spiral high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan will be taken on 2 volumes TLC and functional residual capacity (FRC) in both supine and lateral decubitus position. Image post processing is performed to look at local changes in airway or lobar volume [liter] and airway resistance [kiloPascal.seconds/liter] distribution in the lung</description>
