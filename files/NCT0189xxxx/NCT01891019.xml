    <measure>Pruritus Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week</time_frame>
    <description>The change in pruritus score from Baseline to Week 12 (or end of treatment).&#xD;
The pruritus grading system (PGS) score for each patient was based on: distribution, frequency,severity of itch and quality of sleep. Each patient's itch grade is calculated as the sum of the individual scores as:&#xD;
Mild grade: if total score is between 0 and 5. Moderate grade: if total score is between 6 and 11. Severe grade: if total score is between 12 and 19.</description>

    <description>Thalidomide will be administered nightly, with each subject taking 2 capsules totaling 100 milligrams for the initial two weeks of treatment, 3 capsules totaling 150 milligrams for week 2 to week 4, and 4 capsules totaling 200 milligrams for week 4 to end of treatment. The subjects will take the medication for 12 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable or worsening psoriasis that involves 5% or greater of total body surface area&#xD;
             (BSA) involvement with a minimum PASI score of 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis, defined by a minimum score of 1 for each of&#xD;
             erythema, scaling, and plaque thickness (using a 0 - 4 scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving systemic retinoids, prednisone, methotrexate, or cyclosporine&#xD;
             should be on a stable dose at least 28 days prior to the first dose of thalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving topical treatments should be consistent with such treatments&#xD;
             throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The ability and willingness to follow all study procedures, attend all scheduled&#xD;
             visits, and successfully complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be&#xD;
             obtained prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The ability to understand, agree to, and comply with the requirements of the System&#xD;
             for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety (S.T.E.P.S.).**&#xD;
&#xD;
        (*Because of the known teratogenic effects of thalidomide and in an effort to prevent to&#xD;
        the greatest extent possible any chance of fetal exposure to thalidomide,&#xD;
        THALOMID(thalidomide) is approved for marketing only under a special restricted&#xD;
        distribution program approved by the FDA. Under this program, the System for Thalidomide&#xD;
        Education and Prescribing Safety (S.T.E.P.S.), only prescribers and pharmacists registered&#xD;
        with the program are allowed to prescribe and dispense thalidomide (Zeldis JB et al. 1999).&#xD;
        In addition, patients must be advised of, agree to, and comply with the requirements of the&#xD;
        S.T.E.P.S. Program. To monitor patient compliance with the S.T.E.P.S. program, all patients&#xD;
        must complete the S.T.E.P.S. program informed consent and participate in a mandatory and&#xD;
        confidential surveillance registry.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable psoriasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable or unwilling to meet all criteria for contraception as required in STEPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to thalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal laboratory test results that the investigator feels would compromise patient&#xD;
             safety or evaluation of drug safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The introduction of drugs for other medical conditions which are known to affect&#xD;
             psoriasis (e.g., lithium, beta-adrenergic blockers, etc.) during the period 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to and during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any investigational therapy within the 4 weeks prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             thalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expectation of exposure to strong sunlight during the course of the study (e.g.&#xD;
             planned holiday in high sunlight area) or intention of sunbathing for prolonged&#xD;
             periods of time during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current drug or alcohol abuse (drug screening not required).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical conditions that preclude thalidomide therapy. Any other condition which, in&#xD;
             the judgment of the investigator, would put the subject at unacceptable risk for&#xD;
             participation in the study.&#xD;
