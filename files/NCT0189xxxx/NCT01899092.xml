  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a first in man, dose escalation study that will measure the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of TT-034 in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. The study is divided into 5&#xD;
      dose levels. Subjects will be given a single dose delivered by IV infusion. The subjects will&#xD;
      be monitored and the data analyzed. After a set time, between 6 and 10 weeks depending on the&#xD;
      dose level, the next set of subjects will be dosed. The study drug is a gene therapy&#xD;
      treatment that produces molecules that destroy the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in infected cells.&#xD;
      Once the study drug is given, it cannot be withdrawn. Additionally, once an individual&#xD;
      receives a dose, he or she will not be able to receive a second dose, but will remain&#xD;
      eligible to receive most other HCV treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-time use of a method of therapy designed to transfer anti-HCV genetic&#xD;
      sequences into the hepatocytes of subjects infected with HCV. The anti-HCV sequences will be&#xD;
      comprised of three different short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) that have the ability to directly&#xD;
      cleave the RNA genome of HCV by a process known as RNA interference. The transfer of the&#xD;
      anti-HCV sequences will be accomplished using a &quot;vector&quot; that was made from an&#xD;
      adenovirus-associated virus (AAV) by removing the viral genes and replacing them with a&#xD;
      non-replicating genetic sequence that produces three different shRNA that target three&#xD;
      different regions within the HCV genes. This type of vector has been used in other clinical&#xD;
      trials in order to transduce the hepatocytes of subjects who suffer from hemophilia.&#xD;
