      Categorization of glucose levels into 'healthy', 'pre-diabetic' or 'diabetic' is increasingly&#xD;
      seen as artificial. Furthermore, most micro and macrovascular complications may be present&#xD;
      already at the pre-diabetic stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperglycemia, pre-diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are fully reversible, thus,&#xD;
      maintaining normal blood sugar levels is crucial for the prevention and control of diabetes&#xD;
      and the various other consequences of the metabolic syndrome. Only interventions that are&#xD;
      individually tailored can achieve proper glycemic control, and the glycemic index (GI), which&#xD;
      quantifies the glycemic response to particular foods, was developed for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will characterize the blood glucose responses and microbiota&#xD;
      of healthy individuals, aiming to assess the influence of food intake on gut microbiota and&#xD;
      the influence of gut microbiota on glycemic responses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Advances in characterization and diagnosis of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) led to the&#xD;
      identification of a rapidly growing number of individuals who fall under a 'gray zone' of&#xD;
      disturbed yet non-diabetic fasting or post-prandial glucose levels, termed pre-diabetes,&#xD;
      impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or simply individuals with fasting or post-prandial glucose&#xD;
      levels in the upper-normal range. All of these poorly characterized groups are at substantial&#xD;
      risk for long-term medical complications. Consequently, categorization of glucose levels into&#xD;
      'healthy', 'pre-diabetic' or 'diabetic' is increasingly seen as artificial, and both glucose&#xD;
      levels and risk of diabetes are considered as continuous variables. In the past three&#xD;
      decades, glucose levels have been rapidly increasing in the overall population in developed&#xD;
      and developing countries alike, resulting in a sharp incline in the prevalence of both&#xD;
      pre-diabetes and IGT. In the U.S. alone, the estimates are that 79 million people have been&#xD;
      affected by 2010, and the projections suggest that 472 million people will be affected&#xD;
      worldwide by 2030. Up to 70-90% of those individuals with IGT or pre-diabetes proceed to&#xD;
      develop full-blown T2DM. Furthermore, most micro and macrovascular complications, including&#xD;
      chronic renal disease, sensory and autonomic neuropathy and diabetic retinopathy, may be&#xD;
      present already at the pre-diabetic stage. In addition, pre-diabetic hyperglycemia is linked&#xD;
      to multiple manifestations of the metabolic syndrome, such as obesity, hypertension and&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia, and is an independent risk factor for major macrovascular events such&#xD;
      as coronary heart disease and total vascular mortality. Despite these serious risks, and in&#xD;
      striking contrast to overt diabetes, hyperglycemia, pre-diabetes and IGT are fully&#xD;
      reversible, with up to 55- 80% of individuals reported to revert to normoglycemia and&#xD;
      normoinsulinemia upon life-style modifications. Thus, maintaining normal blood sugar levels&#xD;
      is crucial for the prevention and control of diabetes and the various other consequences of&#xD;
      the metabolic syndrome. The glycemic index (GI), which quantifies the glycemic response to&#xD;
      particular foods, was developed for this purpose, but low GI diets have poor predictive value&#xD;
      for T2DM development in both the healthy and pre-diabetic settings. This limited success of&#xD;
      the GI index may be an inherent problem to any method that assigns a single value to a given&#xD;
      food, since individuals vary greatly in their glycemic response to the same food, and even&#xD;
      the nature of variation is currently poorly characterized. Along these lines, emerging data&#xD;
      from our group and others strongly suggest that proper control and modulation of the glycemic&#xD;
      response to foods relies on person-specific factors and thus, only interventions that are&#xD;
      individually tailored can achieve proper glycemic control. Although variations in&#xD;
      host-related genetic factors affect the normal and post-prandial glycemic response, these&#xD;
      factors are estimated to account for only ~10% of the metabolic phenotype. This low estimate&#xD;
      is reinforced by the growing incidence of diabetes in recent years. In contrast, increasing&#xD;
      importance in glucose homeostasis is being attributed to environmental factors such as the&#xD;
      composition and function of the cumulative intestinal microbiota. This immense and poorly&#xD;
      understood ecosystem of over 1500 species of bacteria, fungi, and their viruses are modulated&#xD;
      by diet, and in turn, profoundly regulate host metabolic processes. Evidence for this&#xD;
      host-microbiota interplay includes a distinct microbiota composition found in T2DM patients;&#xD;
      and numerous alterations in the microbiome composition and expression of major metabolic&#xD;
      pathways found one day after switching from a plant polysaccharide-based diet to a sugary&#xD;
      &quot;western&quot; diet in germ-free mice inoculated with a human microbiota. Furthermore,&#xD;
      microbiota-induced local gut inflammation was recently linked to a propensity for glucose&#xD;
      intolerance, which was reversible upon antibiotic treatment. In this study the investigators&#xD;
      will characterize the blood glucose responses and microbiota of healthy individuals, aiming&#xD;
      to assess the influence of food intake on gut microbiota and the influence of gut microbiota&#xD;
      on glycemic responses.&#xD;
