      To determine if baseline asthma control influences susceptibility to pollutant-induced health&#xD;
      effects in African-American children with moderate-to-severe asthma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the general public, certain sub-populations are at higher risk for adverse health effects&#xD;
      due to air pollution exposure. Asthmatics have been identified as one such susceptible&#xD;
      population due to the observed association of elevated air pollution levels and increased&#xD;
      incidences of acute asthma exacerbations as evidenced by decreased lung function values and&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms, shortness of breath, emergency department (ED) visits, and&#xD;
      hospitalizations (6-13). A study conducted by Mar et al (2004) reported that health outcomes&#xD;
      associated with coarse particulate matter (PM2.5-10) were more notable in children with&#xD;
      asthma than in adults with asthma (14) and a large epidemiological study of asthmatic&#xD;
      children in the Northeastern US showed that asthma morbidity on high ozone days was&#xD;
      consistently highest among children age 6 to 18 years (15). Furthermore, children with&#xD;
      persistent asthma (requiring daily maintenance medication) were shown to be at increased risk&#xD;
      of respiratory symptoms and rescue medication use after ambient ozone exposure compared to&#xD;
      children with mild intermittent asthma (16). Together, these studies demonstrate an&#xD;
      additional level of susceptibility to air pollution in children compared with adults and in&#xD;
      children with persistent asthma compared with mild intermittent asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      African-American patients appear to be particularly susceptible to asthma-related&#xD;
      complications, with rates of asthma-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations,&#xD;
      and death approximately 2 to 3 times the rates found in Caucasian subjects (17) .&#xD;
      Furthermore, a higher proportion of African-American asthmatics have poorly-controlled asthma&#xD;
      compared to non-African-American asthmatics (18). In a recent pediatric study, very poorly&#xD;
      controlled asthmatics had an increased risk of asthma-related hospitalization, emergency&#xD;
      department visits, or corticosteroid burst (OR, 6.4; 95% CI, 1.2-34.5) compared with those&#xD;
      whose asthma was under better control over a 2-year period (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this panel study is to determine if African-American children with&#xD;
      poorly-controlled moderate-to-severe persistent asthma are at increased risk for&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary effects as a result of ambient air pollution exposure compared to age- and&#xD;
      race-matched well-controlled moderate-to-severe asthmatic children. The primary cohort for&#xD;
      this panel study will be African-American children between the ages of 12-17 years with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe asthma (divided between the study populations of poorly-controlled asthma&#xD;
      and well-controlled asthma). Since this study is exclusively focused on an African-American&#xD;
      population, it is not designed to address the effect of race/ethnicity on baseline asthma&#xD;
      control. Volunteers will be recruited primarily from the UNC Pediatric Pulmonary clinic and&#xD;
      the UNC Allergy/Immunology clinic located at Rex Hospital in Raleigh, NC in which Dr.&#xD;
      Hernandez is an attending physician. These volunteers are well-characterized asthmatics&#xD;
      followed regularly by a pediatric pulmonologist (Dr. Ceila Loughlin) and by a pediatric&#xD;
      allergist (Dr. Michelle Hernandez) at the Rex location. In order to ensure that the two&#xD;
      cohorts experience equivalent daily exposures to ambient air pollutants, the study population&#xD;
      will be recruited from a defined geographical region within a reasonable driving distance of&#xD;
      the Rex Hospital and in relative proximity to the state-operated monitoring station for&#xD;
      ambient air pollutants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishing a relationship between asthma control and adverse health outcomes in response to&#xD;
      air pollution exposure will provide health care providers and parents of children with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe asthma the information necessary to take proactive action on high air&#xD;
      pollution days as they are communicated to the public through color-coded days based on the&#xD;
      National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) established by the EPA. If asthma control is&#xD;
      determined in this study to be a risk factor for susceptibility, future work will be directed&#xD;
      toward establishing the mechanism underlying the susceptibility which may then lead to the&#xD;
      potential design of new therapies or intervention strategies.&#xD;
