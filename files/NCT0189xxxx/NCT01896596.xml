  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the UK, infants currently receive a 5-in-1 vaccine (Pediacel) at 2, 3 and 4 months of age,&#xD;
      which protects against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), polio and Haemophilus&#xD;
      influenzae type b (Hib). Infants also routinely receive a meningococcal group C vaccine&#xD;
      (MenC) at 3 and 4 months and a 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (Prevenar13) at 2 and 4 months&#xD;
      of age. This study aims to offer infants a 6-in-1 vaccine (Infanrix-Hexa)that also helps&#xD;
      protect against hepatitis B alongside the other routine vaccinations in the UK infant&#xD;
      immunisation schedule and assess their immune responses to the different vaccines. Hepatitis&#xD;
      B virus infects the liver and usually affects adults, but children can be infected through&#xD;
      close contact with carriers of the virus. Children with hepatitis B infection may not have&#xD;
      symptoms for many years but may go on to develop liver failure, cirrhosis and cancer. Many&#xD;
      other countries already use Infanrix-Hexa and this study is being undertaken to help decide&#xD;
      whether the UK can do the same. Babies taking part in this study will receive Infanrix-Hexa&#xD;
      instead of Pediacel. All other vaccines given will be the same as in the routine schedule but&#xD;
      will include one MenC vaccine instead of 2 doses because the UK infant immunisation schedule&#xD;
      is soon going to change so that all babies will receive only one MenC vaccine at 3 months of&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently several licensed MenC vaccines that can be given to babies. In order to&#xD;
      check whether there are differences in protection, babies taking part will randomly receive&#xD;
      one of 3 MenC-containing vaccines: NeisVacC, Menjugate or Menitorix. Studies have already&#xD;
      shown that one dose of Neis-Vac or Menjugate given to babies at 3 months provides similar&#xD;
      protection against MenC infection as two doses given at 3 and 4 months. Menitorix protects&#xD;
      against both Hib and MenC, so babies in the group receiving MenitorixTM will have an extra&#xD;
      dose of Hib which is also included in Infanrix-Hexa but might have a lower antibody response&#xD;
      to MenC compared to the other two MenC vaccines, although all infants should be&#xD;
      well-protected after their 12-month booster vaccinations, which also contain Menitorix.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants in the United Kingdom are routinely immunised against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis&#xD;
      (whooping cough), polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) as a single 5-in-1&#xD;
      (DTaP5-IPV-Hib) combination vaccine given as a 2-3-4 month schedule. They also receive&#xD;
      vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C (MenC) at 3 months and against 13&#xD;
      pneumococcal serotypes (PCV13) at 2-4 months. From 01 July 2013, infants will also receive an&#xD;
      oral rotavirus vaccine at 2 and 3 months of age. Combination vaccines reduce the number of&#xD;
      injections administered to infants and, therefore, minimise the number of visits to general&#xD;
      practitioners while, at the same time, improving compliance, parental satisfaction and the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of vaccination programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development and manufacture of combination vaccines, however, is complex because of&#xD;
      possible interactions between different antigens, carrier proteins and adjuvants used in such&#xD;
      vaccines. Administration of Hib conjugate vaccine as part of a diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis&#xD;
      (DTP-Hib) combination results in much lower Hib antibody concentrations compared to the Hib&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine administered separately (Eskola et al., 1996; Schmitt et al., 1998; Schmitt&#xD;
      et al., 2000). Similarly, the immunogenicity of the Hib component of combination vaccines&#xD;
      containing acellular pertussis (DTaP-Hib) is significantly lower when compared to those&#xD;
      containing whole cell pertussis (DTwP-Hib) (Bar-On et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interactions can also occur between vaccines that are given during the same visit (Dagan et&#xD;
      al., 2008, Borrow et al, 2011). Vaccines that use a diphtheria mutant toxin (CRM197) as their&#xD;
      primary carrier protein, for example, have been shown to interfere with the immune response&#xD;
      to the Hib component of combination vaccines in a dose-dependent manner, even when the&#xD;
      vaccines are administered on different limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, MenC vaccines that use tetanus as their carrier protein (e.g. NeisVac-C™)&#xD;
      may enhance immune responses to the Hib component of combination vaccines. In the UK, the&#xD;
      current acellular-pertussis-containing 5-in-1 combination vaccine (DTaP5/Hib/IPV; Pediacel™)&#xD;
      has been extremely effective at maintaining control of the diseases it is aiming to prevent.&#xD;
      In particular, control of invasive Hib disease is now the best that has been achieved since&#xD;
      the introduction of routine Hib vaccination almost 20 years ago (HPR, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMMUNISATION AGAINST HEPATITIS B Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global problem.&#xD;
      HBV is highly infectious and is transmitted mainly through sexual intercourse, perinatal&#xD;
      transmission during childbirth, injecting drug use and blood-to-blood contact (National&#xD;
      disease surveillance centre, 1988). HBV can cause acute or chronic infection. Most of the&#xD;
      burden of HBV infection is due to chronic infection, which may be asymptomatic for many years&#xD;
      but is associated with an increased long-term risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (Beasley, 1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of chronic HBV infection is inversely related to age, with up to 90% of those&#xD;
      infected in childhood developing chronic infection compared with &lt;10% among those infected as&#xD;
      adults (Edmunds et al., 1993; Kane, 1995; McMahon et al., 1985; Medley et al., 2001). Because&#xD;
      of the high global burden and chronic nature of the disease, the WHO has recommended that all&#xD;
      countries should include hepatitis B vaccine in national immunisation programmes (World&#xD;
      Health Organization, 1992). By 2008, 177 countries had introduced routine neonatal, infant&#xD;
      and/or adolescent vaccination into their national immunisation programme (World Health&#xD;
      Organization, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UK, however, adopted a selective HBV immunisation strategy targeting infants born to&#xD;
      carrier mothers &amp; close family members, individuals who change sexual partners frequently,&#xD;
      injecting drug users, prisoners, individuals with frequent exposure to blood (including&#xD;
      healthcare workers) and certain high-risk patient groups (Department of Health, 2006). The&#xD;
      most recent data based national epidemiology and laboratory surveillance of acute HBV&#xD;
      infections suggest that the risk of acquiring the infection within the UK is low, with only&#xD;
      512 acute or probable acute cases reported in 2010 in England (rate 0.99 per 100,000&#xD;
      population), mainly in adults (Health Protection Agency, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent cost-effectiveness analysis estimated that the introduction of a HBV vaccine into&#xD;
      the UK infant immunisation programme could prevent 81% of HBV-associated morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality but at a cost of £260,000 per QALY gained (Siddiqui et al., 2010). An adolescent&#xD;
      vaccination programme was less effective, with only 45% morbidity prevented at a cost of&#xD;
      £493,000 per QALY gained (Siddiqui et al., 2010). For the UK, the threshold cost per&#xD;
      vaccinated child at which a universal infant vaccination programme would be considered&#xD;
      cost-effective was less than £4.09, indicating clearly that a HBV vaccine could only&#xD;
      realistically be considered cost-effective in the UK immunisation programme as part of a&#xD;
      combination vaccine (Siddiqui et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are concerns, however, that the only two Hepatitis B-containing combination vaccines -&#xD;
      DTaP/Hib/IPV/HepB (Infanrix- Hexa™, GSK Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) and DTa3P-HBV-IPV&#xD;
      (Infanrix-Penta, GSK Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) - currently licensed in the UK produce&#xD;
      lower Hib antibody levels compared to Pediacel™ which could result in another Hib resurgence&#xD;
      as observed in the UK a decade ago (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE INFANRIX-HIB™ VACCINE In the UK, from late 1999 to mid-2002, around 50% of infants&#xD;
      received a previously licensed DTa3P-Hib (Infanrix-Hib™, GSK Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium)&#xD;
      combination vaccine containing a three-component acellular pertussis vaccine (a3P) to&#xD;
      supplement a shortage of DTwP-Hib supply. This vaccine was known to produce lower Hib&#xD;
      antibody concentrations in comparison to DTwP-Hib vaccines, although this difference was not&#xD;
      considered to be clinically significant (Goldblatt et al., 1999; Eskola et al., 1999). In&#xD;
      2000, however, the number of invasive Hib cases in the UK increased, particularly among&#xD;
      previously vaccinated toddlers (McVernon et al., 2003). Possible reasons for the resurgence&#xD;
      include a greater than expected decline in protective Hib antibody concentrations after&#xD;
      primary infant immunisation without a booster in the second year of life and waning of herd&#xD;
      protection offered by the initial catch-up campaign (Ladhani et al., 2008). However,&#xD;
      temporary use of the less immunogenic Infanrix-Hib™ vaccine also contributed to the observed&#xD;
      increase in cases. A UK case-control study comparing vaccine failure cases from this period&#xD;
      with healthy children born on the same day found that receipt of each dose of Infanrix-Hib™&#xD;
      compared to DTwP-Hib in the infant primary schedule resulted in an increasing risk of vaccine&#xD;
      failure resulting in invasive Hib disease (trend per dose: 1.87; 95% CI, 1.46- 2.40; P&lt;0.001)&#xD;
      (McVernon et al., 2003). This observation was subsequently confirmed in other studies&#xD;
      (Johnson et al., 2006; McVernon et al., 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response to the increase in Hib cases included suspending the use of Infanrix-Hib™ in&#xD;
      favour of DTwP-Hib and, in 2003, implementation of a Hib booster campaign for children aged&#xD;
      &gt;6 months and &lt;4 years, the cohort that would have received Infanrix-Hib™ in infancy (Ladhani&#xD;
      et al., 2008). In September 2004, the combination vaccine used for routine infant&#xD;
      immunisation was changed to DT-aP5/Hib/IPV (Pediacel™), which includes five acellular&#xD;
      pertussis antigens (aP5), after head-to-head comparison with DTwP-Hib administered at the&#xD;
      2-3-4 month UK schedule showed only marginally lower Hib antibody concentrations with&#xD;
      Pediacel™ (Kitchin et al., 2007). Moreover, from September 2006, a routine Hib booster dose&#xD;
      (given as combined Hib-MenC, Menitorix™, GSK Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) was added to&#xD;
      the childhood immunisation programme at 12 months of age. Since 2007, Hib cases started to&#xD;
      decline again. In 2010, there were only 30 cases of invasive Hib disease, with only 6 cases&#xD;
      in children aged &lt; 5 years and there have been no Hib-related deaths in this age group since&#xD;
      2007 (HPR, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEWER INFANRIX™ VACCINES Although Infanrix-Hib™ is no longer available, the currently&#xD;
      licensed Infanrix-Penta™ and Infanrix-Hexa™ share the same antigens. Therefore, there are&#xD;
      reasonable concerns that re-introduction of an Infanrix™-based combination vaccine might&#xD;
      adversely impact on the current excellent control of invasive Hib disease in the UK. There&#xD;
      are, however, indirect data from some, as yet, unpublished studies conducted in other&#xD;
      European countries at 3-4-5 and 3-5 month immunisation schedules that suggest that the&#xD;
      inclusion of IPV into Infanrix-Hib® improves the immunogenicity of the Hib component, while&#xD;
      the addition of HepB does not appear to have any significant impact on Hib immunogenicity&#xD;
      (Dagan et al., 2008). On the other hand, immunogenicity data for Infanrix™-based Hib&#xD;
      combination vaccines have been consistently lower in UK studies compared to those in other&#xD;
      countries. It is likely that multiple factors, including the accelerated infant schedule (at&#xD;
      2-3-4 months) and the absence of a booster dose of Hib in the second year of life,&#xD;
      contributed to the loss of control of Hib disease in the UK. In the Republic of Ireland, the&#xD;
      use of Infanrix-Hib-IPV™ at a 2-4-6 month schedule without a booster dose may also have&#xD;
      contributed to an increase in invasive Hib disease (Fitzgerald et al., 2005; Fitzgerald &amp;&#xD;
      Cotter, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recent manufacturer-sponsored studies suggest that Infanrix-Hexa™ may provide an&#xD;
      adequate Hib response under a 2-3-4 month schedule, although none of the studies took place&#xD;
      in the UK. In the two reported studies, however, the immunogenicity of the Infanrix™-based&#xD;
      Hib vaccine was half that of Pediacel. Other EU countries that have used Infanrix™-based&#xD;
      vaccines have not experienced major increases in Hib incidence. In Germany, where&#xD;
      Infanrix™-based vaccines have been used at a 2-3-4 month schedule with a booster dose at&#xD;
      11-14 months for over a decade, control of invasive Hib disease has remained good. Studies of&#xD;
      vaccine effectiveness for the period August 2000 to December 2004 estimated protection of&#xD;
      90.4% (95% CI: 70.6-96.8) for the full primary series (Kalies et al., 2008). However, infants&#xD;
      in Germany rarely receive immunisation on schedule. The median ages at first dose, third dose&#xD;
      and booster immunisation were 3.3, 6.0 and 14.4 months respectively, in the years when&#xD;
      Infanrix-Hexa™ was routinely used (Kalies et al., 2006). Such differences in vaccination&#xD;
      schedules, along with differences in Hib epidemiology and different surveillance methods in&#xD;
      use mean that the German experience may not be applicable to the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHOICE OF MENC VACCINE The UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recently&#xD;
      recommended reducing the infant MCC schedule to a single dose in infancy and adding an extra&#xD;
      MCC dose to the adolescent immunisation schedule (JCVI, 2011). There are currently two MCC&#xD;
      conjugate vaccines used in the UK - NeisVac-C™ (which uses a tetanus toxoid carrier protein)&#xD;
      and Menjugate™(which uses the CRM carrier protein) that are suitable for use in a single dose&#xD;
      priming schedule (Findlow et al., 2012). Tetanus-based MCC vaccines (MCC-TT) not only improve&#xD;
      the immunogenicity of the Hib component of combination vaccines (Tables 2 &amp; 3) , but also&#xD;
      result in higher MenC primary and booster responses compared with MCC-CRM vaccines under the&#xD;
      UK accelerated immunisation schedule (Southern et al., 2009; Kitchin et al., 2007). If given&#xD;
      with a concomitant MCC-TT containing vaccine, therefore, Infanrix-Hexa™ may provide a better&#xD;
      Hib antibody response under the UK 2-3-4 month schedule. NeisVac-C™ is the only available&#xD;
      MCC-TT vaccine and has been shown to be adequately immunogenic when given as a single dose at&#xD;
      3 months of age with Pediacel™ (DTaP5/Hib/IPV) vaccine (Findlow et al., 2009). Use of a&#xD;
      single dose of the combined MCC-TT/Hib-TT vaccine (Menitorix™) currently used for the routine&#xD;
      12-month booster in the UK, would be an attractive alternative. Although Menitorix™ contains&#xD;
      less MenC antigen in the vaccine and, therefore, may not induce as good a post-primary&#xD;
      antibody response as a single dose of NeisVac-C™ or possibly even Menjugate™, antibody&#xD;
      response to the routine 12-month booster dose of Menitorix™ is likely to be satisfactory and&#xD;
      may be better than the booster response in those primed with Menjugate™ (Findlow et al.,&#xD;
      2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study, therefore, is to evaluate the immunogenicity of Infanrix-Hexa™ when&#xD;
      given at a 2-3-4 month schedule with PCV13 at 2-4 months and incorporating a random study of&#xD;
      three different MCC vaccines (Menjugate™, NeisVac-C™ and Menitorix™) given at 3 months of&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
