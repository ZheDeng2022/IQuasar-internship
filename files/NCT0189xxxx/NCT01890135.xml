  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a major complication of atherosclerosis when blockages in&#xD;
      the arteries to leg reduce blood flow and one of the resulting problems is termed&#xD;
      intermittent claudication (IC). IC is leg pain with walking that is relieved with rest and IC&#xD;
      is the most frequent clinical manifestation of PAD and it effects millions of Americans. The&#xD;
      number of patients with, and the health care costs of, PAD will increase as the prevalence of&#xD;
      PAD is associated with advancing age, diabetes, and smoking. Zibotentan (ZD4054) is an&#xD;
      endothelin receptor A (ETA) blocker that undergone extensive human testing and has been shown&#xD;
      to be safe in several patient population. There is ample evidence to suggest that an ETA&#xD;
      blocker could improve blood flow to the legs in patients with PAD. In a study that will be&#xD;
      funded by the National Institute of Health, the investigators will test the ability of this&#xD;
      medication to allow better blood flow to the legs of patients with PAD. In patients with IC,&#xD;
      the investigators will test the ability of ZD4054 to improve leg blood flow using a&#xD;
      non-invasive imaging technique. In parallel the study will test for the ability of patients&#xD;
      with leg pain to walk further and feel better.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a major complication of atherosclerosis that affects &gt;8&#xD;
      million people in the United States alone. Intermittent claudication (IC), defined as leg&#xD;
      pain with walking that is relieved with rest, is the most frequent clinical manifestation of&#xD;
      PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a proposal that was just funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH) National Center&#xD;
      for Advancing TRanslational Sciences (NCATS) the investigators pose to test the &quot;reuse&quot; of&#xD;
      zibotentan (ZD4054, an Asta-Zeneca compound), an orally active, endothelin receptor A (ETA)&#xD;
      antagonist in patients with IC. The study will seek to confirm the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      10mg of ZD4054 in patients with intermittent claudication (Rutherford II or III) and, in&#xD;
      parallel, establish the capacity of ZD4054 to change calf muscle perfusion, as assessed by&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, functional treadmill performance, and quality&#xD;
      of life indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 44 subjects&#xD;
      with intermittent claudication with randomization stratified based on the entry calf muscle&#xD;
      perfusion. The investigators will use magnetic resonance imaging to quantify changes in blood&#xD;
      flow to the ischemic limb from baseline to week 12 between those randomized to drug vs.&#xD;
      placebo. Based on the prior experience and the known tolerability of ZD4054, the experience&#xD;
      of the investigative team with a mechanistically appropriate end-point measure that is part&#xD;
      of other NIH funded projects, the investigators will proceed directly to this Phase II trial.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study will be the change in absolute perfusion in the index calf&#xD;
      muscle from baseline to follow-up, after 12 weeks on the 10 mg dose or placebo. Additional&#xD;
      outcome measures will be: a) ability of patients with PAD to tolerate 10 mg dose of ZD4054&#xD;
      vs. placebo; b) freedom from unexpected serious adverse events; c) change in peak walking&#xD;
      time from baseline to 12 weeks between 10 mg of ZD4054 and placebo groups; d) change in&#xD;
      ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI) from baseline to 12 weeks between 10 mg of ZD4054&#xD;
      and placebo groups, and; d) change in quality of life measure between 10 mg of ZD4054 and&#xD;
      placebo groups.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;40 years. Patients less than 40 years of age could well have a form or&#xD;
             &quot;thromboangitis obliterans&quot; often called Berger's Disease and the investigators wish&#xD;
             to enroll only subjects with atherosclerotic vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently taking all standard medications that are part of the &quot;good medical care&quot; for&#xD;
             patients with PAD including an anti-platlet agent, an angiotensin-converting enzyme&#xD;
             inhibitors or receptor blockers, beta-blockers if indicated for ischemic heart&#xD;
             disease, and cholesterol lowering therapy; unless documented contra-indications to&#xD;
             these therapies exist. Those patients not on these therapies will be referred back&#xD;
             with the suggestion that they be added and they can be re-approached for enrollment at&#xD;
             a later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exercise induced thigh, calf, buttock pain and absence of Rutherford Class IV, V, or&#xD;
             VI.3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A resting ABI of &lt;0.9 but &gt;0.4 and the presence of both superficial femoral artery&#xD;
             stenosis (70% or greater) disease and below the knee disease with a significant&#xD;
             stenosis in at least one of the run-off vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of critical inflow (iliac or common femoral) disease. The profunda femoral&#xD;
             artery is the major source of collateral blood vessels. The investigators initial&#xD;
             approach will be to try and enroll as homogenous of a patient population as possible&#xD;
             to allow us to focus on the primary endpoint of the study (the change in muscle&#xD;
             perfusion to the ischemic limb over time).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to undergo magnetic resonance imaging and provide informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious known concomitant disease with life expectancy of less than one year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior amputation or history of critical limb ischemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;45 to permit safe administration of the gadolinium&#xD;
             contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke or transient ischemic attack&#xD;
             within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  American Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure or known left&#xD;
             ventricular ejection fraction less than 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of anemia&#xD;
