      This research is being done to assess the effects of pancreatic duct stenting on relief of&#xD;
      obstructive pain (pain due to outflow obstruction of main pancreatic duct) caused by&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although most people with pancreatic cancer (80-85%) suffer distressing pain, it is poorly&#xD;
      controlled. Currently, medical management has been focused on frequent use of opioid&#xD;
      painkillers (narcotics) which are associated with several complications. Pain in pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer is mainly caused by tumor invasion to nerves near pancreatic gland, but in certain&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic cancer, pain is believed to be obstructive in nature and is due to&#xD;
      outflow obstruction of main pancreatic duct (PD) which extracts pancreatic secretions. This&#xD;
      kind of pain is specifically marked by pain occurring after eating. With this respect,&#xD;
      decompression of pancreatic duct has been associated with pain relief in people with chronic&#xD;
      inflammation of pancreas due to obstruction of its main duct (chronic pancreatitis).&#xD;
      Therefore; we think that it might be beneficial in the management of obstructive pain in&#xD;
      people with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic stenting of pancreatic duct is a way for decompression and appears to be effective&#xD;
      and safe palliative (pain relief) treatment for pain management in patients with chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis. Besides safety, pancreatic stenting seems to be associated with a significant&#xD;
      decrease in amount of required opioids and analgesic drugs (and their side effects) for pain&#xD;
      management, and may improve patients' quality of life. There are only a few old reports about&#xD;
      beneficial effects of endoscopic pancreatic duct decompression for relief of obstructive pain&#xD;
      in pancreatic cancer. Currently, we have improved stents. Since prior clinical practice has&#xD;
      shown that pain improves, we plan to place stents with the expectation that pain will&#xD;
      improve. We hope that it will decrease need for recurrent hospitalizations for pain control&#xD;
      and decrease in need for medications (narcotics) and medication side effects, and also will&#xD;
      improve the quality of life. Specific instruments will be applied as research tools to&#xD;
      monitor pain score and quality of life before and after pancreatic duct stenting in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
