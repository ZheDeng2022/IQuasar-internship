      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of quizartinib when given in&#xD;
      combination with azacitidine or cytarabine in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      or myelodysplastic syndrome that have come back (relapsed) or are not responding to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). Quizartinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine and cytarabine work&#xD;
      in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving quizartinib with&#xD;
      azacitidine or cytarabine may work better in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the&#xD;
      combination of quizartinib (AC220) with either azacitidine (5-azacitidine [AZA]) or low-dose&#xD;
      cytarabine (LDAC) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome (MDS). (Phase I) II. To determine the clinical activity of the combination of&#xD;
      quizartinib with either AZA or LDAC in patients with AML or MDS. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the clinical activity of the combination of quizartinib with either AZA or&#xD;
      LDAC in patients with AML or MDS. (Phase I) II. To determine the safety of the combination of&#xD;
      quizartinib with either AZA or LDAC in patients with AML or MDS. (Phase II) III. To determine&#xD;
      the induction of hypomethylation, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage and FLT3 signaling&#xD;
      during therapy with this combination and its correlation with response. (Phase I and II) IV.&#xD;
      To determine the effect of this combination therapy on plasma levels of FLT3-ligand. (Phase I&#xD;
      and II) V. To determine the pharmacodynamics of this combination therapy in patients with AML&#xD;
      or high-risk MDS. (Phase I and II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of quizartinib followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study. Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive quizartinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 5-28 of cycle 1 and&#xD;
      on days 1-28 of subsequent cycles and azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 10-40 minutes on days 1-7. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive quizartinib PO QD on days 5-28 of cycle 1 and on days 1-28 of&#xD;
      subsequent cycles and cytarabine SC twice daily (BID) on days 1-10. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE I&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refractory or relapsed disease defined as follows: patients with MDS or chronic&#xD;
             myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) should have failed prior therapy (e.g., with a&#xD;
             hypomethylating agent, clofarabine, and/or with lenalidomide); patients with AML&#xD;
             should have failed any prior induction therapy or have relapsed after prior therapy;&#xD;
             patients (any age) with MDS or CMML who received therapy with a hypomethylating agent&#xD;
             and progress to AML are eligible at the time of diagnosis of AML regardless any prior&#xD;
             therapy for AML. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification will be used for&#xD;
             AML; patients with any of the eligible diagnoses who have received no prior therapy&#xD;
             are eligible if not candidates to receive standard intensive therapy (i.e., high-dose&#xD;
             cytarabine-based chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are eligible regardless of their FLT3 mutation status.&#xD;

          -  COHORT 2A: Patients with MDS, CMML or AML who are either: age 60 years or older and&#xD;
             newly diagnosed, previously untreated. Prior therapy with hydroxyurea or single agent&#xD;
             ara-C for the purpose of control of white blood cells (WBC) is acceptable.; age 18&#xD;
             years or older and with refractory or relapse disease who have received no more than&#xD;
             one prior treatment regimen and will be receiving first salvage. For this purpose, a&#xD;
             second induction cycle with the same drugs used during the first cycle, consolidation&#xD;
             chemotherapy or stem cell transplant in complete remission (CR) (or complete response&#xD;
             with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp] or complete response with incomplete bone&#xD;

             with refractory or relapse disease who have received no more than two prior treatment&#xD;
             regimens and will be receiving second salvage, or who have received a prior SCT and&#xD;
             will be receiving their first salvage. For this purposes, a second induction cycle&#xD;
             with the same drugs used during the first cycle, consolidation chemotherapy or stem&#xD;
             cell transplant in CR (or CRp or CRi) will be considered part of the prior regimen.&#xD;
             Prior therapy for MDS (or other malignancies) is not considered a prior regimen for&#xD;
             AML in patients who progress from MDS (or other malignancies)&#xD;

             with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the start of study therapy and&#xD;
             for the first four weeks on therapy. The additional days of hydrea after 28 is&#xD;
             permitted as clinically indicated, on case by case basis after discussion with the&#xD;
             principal investigator (PI). Other agents given transiently with the intention to&#xD;
