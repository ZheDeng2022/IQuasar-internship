      Many postmenopausal women suffer from vaginal symptoms such as dryness, itching, and painful&#xD;
      intercourse. The underlying pathology is unknown. Since symptoms are comparable to those&#xD;
      found in infectious vaginitis during the reproductive life stage, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the vaginal milieu in symptomatic postmenopausal women is comparable to&#xD;
      inflammation in vaginitis. The investigators therefore study vaginal cytokines in symptomatic&#xD;
      and asymptomatic postmenopausal women.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vulvovaginal irritation is a frequent complaint among postmenopausal women who are not on&#xD;
      hormone therapy. Common symptoms include pruritus. Patients describe the irritation to be&#xD;
      similar to that of vulvovaginal candidiasis during their reproductive years. Clinical&#xD;
      improvement is seen with estrogen therapy. Most clinicians attribute the symptoms to vaginal&#xD;
      dryness secondary to estrogen deficiency. However, the underlying pathophysiology of this&#xD;
      clinical entity is not well defined. Since cytokines have been shown to play a significant&#xD;
      role in the pathogenesis of infectious vaginitis, and there is evidence to suggest that&#xD;
      estrogen influences cytokine production, we postulate that estrogen deficiency causes a&#xD;
      disturbance in the vaginal cytokine environment similar to that of infectious vulvovaginitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies that investigate the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis,&#xD;
      and vestibulitis have identified changes in the level of antibodies and cytokines in the&#xD;
      vagina during these processes. Donders and co-workers performed a study looking at the&#xD;
      correlation between disturbance of the lactobacillary flora, vaginal pH, interleukin 1beta&#xD;
      (IL-1b), and interleukin 8 (IL-8). Menopausal women were excluded from this study. Vaginal&#xD;
      pH, IL-8, and IL-1β concentrations increased linearly with decreasing lactobacilli by 4 to 10&#xD;
      fold. IL-1β concentration was most closely related to decreasing lactobacilli, and IL-8&#xD;
      concentration was most closely related to positive culture results. Regúlez, Garcia&#xD;
      Fernández, and co-worker performed a study to correlate the symptoms of vulvovaginal&#xD;
      candidiasis with vaginal IgE levels. Patients who have clinically overt vulvovaginal&#xD;
      candidiasis with classical symptomatology regardless of whether yeast or mycelia is&#xD;
      identified in fresh smear or culture had higher IgE levels in their vagina than asymptomatic&#xD;
      carriers or uninfected controls. This variation of host response has been proposed as one of&#xD;
      the mechanism why only some women with vulvovaginal candidiasis experience symptoms. This&#xD;
      concept of an imbalance between TH1 to TH2 cell reactivity with preference to the latter was&#xD;
      further suggested by Puccetti, Romani and Bistoni. In contrary to the findings by Regúlez,&#xD;
      Garcia Fernández and co-workers, Fidel, Ginsburg, and co-workers studied the&#xD;
      vaginal-associated immunity in women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and found that&#xD;
      Th-1 type response is increased. This area is certainly controversial and requires further&#xD;
      investigations. Since IL-6 has been suggested as one of the cytokines involved in Th-2 or&#xD;
      immediate-type hypersensitivity response, it will be of interest to study whether its level&#xD;
      is increased for patients with symptomatology. Foster and Hasday compared the levels of&#xD;
      IL-1b, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) in perineal biopsy between women with vulvar&#xD;
      vestibulitis and pain-free subjects, and found an increase in both cytokines in the former&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estrogen has been shown to influence cytokine activity in the reproductive tract.&#xD;
      García-Velasco and Arici published a review article on chemokines and human reproduction. In&#xD;
      the article, the clinical relevance of chemokines in normal human reproductive events such as&#xD;
      ovulation, menstruation, and implantation were summarized. There was however little&#xD;
      information on their relevance in vaginal physiology. This is consistent with the little&#xD;
      information on the topic of vaginal physiology in the literature. A study by Franklin, and&#xD;
      Kutteh on the variation of immunoglobulins, and cytokines in cervical mucus in twelve women&#xD;
      on oral contraceptives (OCs), and fifteen naturally cycling women showed a definite influence&#xD;
      of exogenous and endogenous hormones on their levels. Cervical IgA, and IL-1b levels in women&#xD;
      taking Ortho Novum 777® paralleled the increasing dosage of oral norethindrone, and the&#xD;
      levels decreased after discontinuation of the oral contraceptive. Cervical IL-1b, and IL-10&#xD;
      both peaked just before ovulation in natural cycles. Cervical mucus IL-1b levels were found&#xD;
      to correlate directly to changes in estrogen level during a natural cycle. Vaginal cytokine&#xD;
      levels were not investigated in the study. Al-Harth, and co-workers measured cervicovaginal&#xD;
      IL-1b, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon-gamma (INF-gamma), transforming growth factor-beta&#xD;
      (TGF-b), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1a)&#xD;
      and TNG receptor II (TNFR II) during the follicular, and luteal phases of ovulatory cycle of&#xD;
      six premenopausal women. Cervicovaginal IL-1b, and IL-6 were found to vary in level&#xD;
      throughout the ovulatory cycle. Both IL-1b, and IL-6 were 5-fold higher in the follicular&#xD;
      phase than in the luteal phase. Other cervicovaginal cytokines levels were not altered&#xD;
      between the two phases. Plasma IL-8 level was higher in the follicular than luteal phase. The&#xD;
      investigators' hypothesis is that postmenopausal estrogen deficiency causes changes in&#xD;
      cytokine levels in the vagina similar to that found with vaginal candidiasis and bacterial&#xD;
      vaginosis. A common cytokine etiology will account for the similarity of the symptomatology&#xD;
      of infectious vaginitis and postmenopausal vaginal irritation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unpublished preliminary data from a study done on premenopausal women by Ballagh in the&#xD;
      co-operating Howard and Georgeanna Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine, Department of&#xD;
      Obstetrics and Gynecology, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, Virginia, USA, has shown&#xD;
      that the mean levels of vaginal IL-1b and IL-8, as measured by ELISA, are higher in the&#xD;
      luteal phase than the follicular phase in naturally cycling women. The median level of IL-1b&#xD;
      is higher in the luteal phase than follicular phase but that of IL-8 is higher in the&#xD;
      follicular phase than luteal phase. These results show that vaginal interleukin environment&#xD;
      varies throughout the menstrual cycle to another. Women on oral contraceptive pills have&#xD;
      increased mean levels of both vaginal IL-1b, and IL-8 compared to naturally cycling women.&#xD;
      These data, though preliminary, support the theory that steroid hormone may play a role in&#xD;
      the regulation of vaginal cytokine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal goal of this pilot study is to determine the correlation between postmenopausal&#xD;
      vulvovaginal irritative symptoms with vaginal interleukin levels. Cytokines to be evaluated&#xD;
      in vaginal lavage will include IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α. Plasma interleukin levels will be&#xD;
      assessed concurrently, and compared to the vaginal levels to ensure that the vaginal levels&#xD;
      obtained are not a result of contamination by plasma transudate. This study is thought to be&#xD;
      the basis for a future randomised controlled trial involving the treatment of symptomatic&#xD;
      menopausal women for investigation whether the resolution of the symptoms with e.g. estrogen&#xD;
      and DHEA therapy is associated with a decrease in the interleukin levels.&#xD;
