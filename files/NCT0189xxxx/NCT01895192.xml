    <textblock>
      A new concept for observing the fine morphology of spermatozoa at high magnification (x6000)&#xD;
      with an inverted microscope, a numeric camera using differential interference contrast has&#xD;
      been developed (1). This technique called Motile Sperm Organellar Morphology Examination&#xD;
      allows to see some abnormalities, mainly vacuoles on the head of spermatozoa. These vacuoles&#xD;
      appear to be related to sperm DNA damage and to affect embryo developmental potential (2, 3,&#xD;
      4). The application of Motile Sperm Organellar Morphology Examination may represent an&#xD;
      improvement in the evaluation of semen quality, with some potential clinical repercussions at&#xD;
      the diagnostic/prognostic level. First of all, the investigators need data on fertile men in&#xD;
      order to define &quot; normality &quot; of sperm morphology at high magnification. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is therefore to better characterize these vacuoles (number, surface, position) in a&#xD;
      population of men fertile in order to establish normality criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population studied consisted in 50 men aged 18 to 45 years with proven spontaneous&#xD;
      fertility. All subjects gave their informed consent to participate in the study. After&#xD;
      questioning on full medical and andrological history, semen samples were collected by&#xD;
      masturbation after 2 to 5 days of sexual abstinence and were processed for analysis after&#xD;
      liquefaction for 20 min at 37°C. We carried out a sperm count, motility, vitality and&#xD;
      conventional morphology analysis as well as a detailed morphometric analysis of the vacuoles&#xD;
      at high magnification using an image analysis software. For the analysis at high&#xD;
      magnification, fifty microliters of fresh sperm was washed in 2.5 ml of washing solution by&#xD;
      centrifugation for 5 minutes at 400g. The pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of washing&#xD;
      solution and the spermatozoa were fixed by addition of 100 µl Phosphate Buffer&#xD;
      Saline-formaldehyde 3.7%. Two microliters of this suspension was placed in a glass-bottomed&#xD;
      dish and examined by Nomarski interference contrast microscopy with a camera mounted on a&#xD;
      microscope with an immersion objective lens x100. For each sample, sperm head vacuoles were&#xD;
      analyzed on 100 spermatozoa that were randomly photographed and separately analyzed using&#xD;
      digital imaging system software. Measurements using the software were carried out by a single&#xD;
      operator. The Interactive Measurement module allows measurement of sperm head areas and&#xD;
      vacuole areas by manually depicting their outline. The area and position of each vacuole were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
