  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare different methods of collecting the amount of&#xD;
      radiation exposure patients receive in a clinical study. As part of the PROMISE study, the&#xD;
      Duke Clinical Research Institute Outcomes and Follow-up Group will be contacting patients&#xD;
      every six months to ask if they had any heart procedures or testing. This information will be&#xD;
      used to estimate the amount of radiation that they may have received from heart testing being&#xD;
      studied in this study, PROMISE-SAFER. Patients will be asked to collect information about&#xD;
      each heart testing they receive during the time that they are enrolled in the PROMISE study.&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the study, we will be able to determine which method was most accurate&#xD;
      in collecting the amount of radiation exposure for this clinical study. Through this study we&#xD;
      hope to develop an improved methodology to estimate cumulative radiation exposure from&#xD;
      cardiac imaging. Comprehensive measurement of cumulative radiation exposure to patients may&#xD;
      be critically important to minimize potential harm in future studies and in clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

    <measure>Methods to measure cumulative radiation exposure from a cardiac imaging trial will be compared to radiation measurements from the &quot;gold standard&quot; electronic medical records</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>In a single site (San Jose Medical Center - Kaiser Permanente) at a health maintenance organization where patients undergo all testing on site and comprehensive radiation records are maintained, 3 approaches to obtaining follow-up radiation dosimetry estimates will be compared: 1) the standard method used at all sites of combining those procedures identified on follow-up surveys with measured or imputed procedure dose estimates, 2) Radiation Log forms that patients will receive and will be asked to complete whenever they undergo further imaging, and 3) &quot;gold standard&quot; review of patient electronic medical records to identify all procedures with ionizing radiation and measured dose estimates from each procedure.</description>
