      The Nutrition Research Unit at Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev will during the fall&#xD;
      2013 initiate a randomized and controlled intervention study engaging 390 obese pregnant&#xD;
      women. The overall aim of APPROACH is to investigate how an optimal diet during pregnancy&#xD;
      influences the programming of the offspring. The children will after birth be included in a&#xD;
      prospective cohort according to maternal randomization and examined six times from delivery&#xD;
      until the age of nine years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with increased risk of&#xD;
      high birth weight; furthermore there is increased risk of the child developing overweight,&#xD;
      diabetes and other metabolic diseases in childhood or adulthood. The effect of reducing&#xD;
      gestational weight gain while supplying optimized amount and sources of nutrients is not well&#xD;
      investigated. Increased knowledge to the possibility and efficacy of preventing overweight&#xD;
      and related diseases is necessary. Modification of protein source and increase in ratio of&#xD;
      protein in relation to amount of carbohydrate and reduction of glycaemic index (GI) has in&#xD;
      observational studies individually been linked to improved fetal body composition, metabolism&#xD;
      and weight control later in life, and less weight gain and weight retention for the mother.&#xD;
      The overall aim of APPROACH is to investigate how an optimal diet during pregnancy influences&#xD;
      the programming of the offspring. This study will increase the knowledge of the effect of a&#xD;
      specific nutrient composition and weight retention during pregnancy on growth and development&#xD;
      during the foetal stage and until nine years off age, risk markers later metabolic diseases,&#xD;
      especially diabetes and metabolic syndrome. APPROACH will be a dietary intervention&#xD;
      investigating differences in responds to a high-protein, especially marine and dairy protein&#xD;
      and low-GI diet versus a diet according to the Nordic Nutritional Recommendations. All visits&#xD;
      and assessment will be performed by trained staff at Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev.&#xD;
      Subjects will be women with expected delivery at Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics and&#xD;
      all examinations of gestational development and foetal growth will take place her; assessment&#xD;
      of the children will be performed at the Department of Paediatrics. A total of 390 obese&#xD;
      (body mass index (BMI) â‰¥ 30 kg/m2) pregnant women will be randomized to intervention or&#xD;
      control and engage in the program from late first trimester or early second trimester to&#xD;
      birth. After birth the children will be included in a prospective cohort according to&#xD;
      maternal randomization and examined six times from delivery until the age of nine years.&#xD;
      APPROACH will increase the knowledge of the effect of a nutrient composition with high&#xD;
      protein for carbohydrate ratio and weight retention during pregnancy on growth and&#xD;
      development during the foetal stage and until nine years off age, risk markers later&#xD;
      metabolic diseases, especially diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Plasma lipids, markers of&#xD;
      metabolic diseases, epigenetics and vitamin D status will be assessed at baseline and several&#xD;
      times during pregnancy; and in both intervention and control group these data will increase&#xD;
      the knowledge of the effect of supplementing with marine oils and vitamin D in pregnant&#xD;
      women. Results from the intervention will be communicated to the general population and&#xD;
      published in peer-relieved journals.&#xD;
