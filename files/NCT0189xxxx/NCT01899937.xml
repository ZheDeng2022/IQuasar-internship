  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flow mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery has been widely used as a non-invasive&#xD;
      measure of endothelial function. FMD independently predicts future cardiovascular events and&#xD;
      can be readily influenced by pharmacological, dietary or lifestyle interventions. However,&#xD;
      the interpretation of FMD data is currently importantly hampered by differences in&#xD;
      measurement methodologies and analysis techniques between laboratories. These differences&#xD;
      result in large variation of 'normal' values between laboratories, highlighting the need for&#xD;
      adopting widely supported and evidence-based guidelines.&#xD;

      Background: Flow mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery has been widely used as a&#xD;
      non-invasive measure of endothelial function. FMD independently predicts future&#xD;
      cardiovascular events and can be readily influenced by pharmacological, dietary or lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for a review: Differences in methodology, guidelines (to control for moderating factors)&#xD;
      and analysis techniques contribute to large variation in FMD between laboratories, limiting&#xD;
      the widespread use and interpretation of FMD data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To identify methodological and technological factors that contributes to the&#xD;
      variability (i.e. repeatability) of the brachial artery FMD. This will allow for development&#xD;
      of quality guidelines for FMD measurement based on systematic data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The planning and conduct of the proposed meta-analyses will follow the Cochrane&#xD;
      handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. The reporting will follow the Preferred&#xD;
      Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE Chemical Abstracts, Biosis and The Cochrane Central Register of&#xD;
      Controlled Trials will be searched using appropriate search terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: Observational cohorts and control groups of intervention studies with ≥ 50&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A list of quality criteria for scoring of FMD data will be defined both by expert&#xD;
      consensus and by thorough review of the literature. Subsequently, a database of brachial&#xD;
      artery FMD data (from published data and available individual data) will be compiled. The&#xD;
      investigators will investigate which of the quality criteria significantly contribute to the&#xD;
      variability of FMD by multiple meta-regression analyses. This data set will also allow us to&#xD;
      investigate which quality criteria have the strongest impact on the variability of the FMD,&#xD;
      to further refine the list of quality criteria.&#xD;
