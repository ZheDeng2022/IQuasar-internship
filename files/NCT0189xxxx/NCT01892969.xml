      Project Summary We propose an ancillary study to The Heart and Lung Failure Pediatric Insulin&#xD;
      Titration trial (HALF PINT), which is investigating the impact of normalizing blood glucose&#xD;
      using insulin infusions on clinical outcomes among children with hyperglycemia and heart and&#xD;
      lung failure. In this ancillary study, we will measure plasma levels of inflammatory,&#xD;
      coagulation, and fibrinolysis proteins and genotype DNA for polymorphisms among patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the HALF PINT trial. The results from this ancillary study will help us to&#xD;
      understand potential mechanisms through which normalizing blood glucose provides benefit,&#xD;
      which may lead to development of new therapeutic strategies in critically ill children&#xD;

      ABSTRACT Hyperglycemia occurs frequently among critically ill children and is associated with&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality. Approximately 25% of critically ill children with heart&#xD;
      and lung failure (i.e., those receiving mechanical ventilation and/or inotropes) develop&#xD;
      hyperglycemia within 24 hours of admission, and if the hyperglycemia is sustained (lasting&#xD;
      for &gt; 50% of PICU stay), it results in a 6-fold increase in the odds of mortality. Previous&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that tight glycemic control with insulin, aimed at achieving&#xD;
      normoglycemia (TGC-NL) can result in improvement in mortality and morbidity in selected&#xD;
      groups of critically ill patients with hyperglycemia. However, the precise mechanism by which&#xD;
      TGC-NL leads to improvement in morbidity and mortality is not known. Hyperglycemia is known&#xD;
      to result in a pro-thrombotic state via activation of coagulation and impairment of&#xD;
      fibrinolysis. This pro-thrombotic, anti-fibrinolytic state, may lead to intravascular fibrin&#xD;
      deposition and micro thrombi, which can be a key contributor to the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      multi-organ failure. We propose to take advantage of The Heart and Lung Failure Pediatric&#xD;
      Insulin Titration trial (HALF PINT) - an NHLBI-funded randomized, controlled trial designed&#xD;
      to study the impact of TGC-NL on clinical outcomes among children with heart and lung failure&#xD;
      - to investigate the effect of TGC-NL on inflammation, fibrinolysis, and coagulation and to&#xD;
      determine the extent to which improvement in deranged coagulation and fibrinolysis by TGC-NL&#xD;
      contributes to improvement in clinical outcomes. We propose to enroll 800 critically ill&#xD;
      patients with hyperglycemia and heart and lung failure from the HALF PINT study. Since the&#xD;
      parent trial will not collect any blood samples other than for confirmation of blood glucose,&#xD;
      we will approach parents or surrogates of children enrolled in the HALF PINT trial and obtain&#xD;
      informed consent for participation in this ancillary study. We will collect blood samples&#xD;
      (3cc from children 2 years and younger, and 5ml from children 3 years and older) at Days 1,&#xD;
      3, and 5 after randomization. We will measure plasma levels of selected markers of&#xD;
      coagulation and fibrinolysis and genotype DNA for polymorphisms in the corresponding genes.&#xD;
      We will correlate changes over time in the biomarkers with allocation to treatment arm to&#xD;
      test whether the beneficial effects of TGC-NL are achieved via normalization of coagulation&#xD;
      and fibrinolysis. We will also genotype for tag SNPs in the corresponding genes and test for&#xD;
      association of the plasma and genetic markers with clinical outcomes. The results from this&#xD;
      study will provide mechanistic insights into the effect of TGC-NL on clinical outcome and&#xD;
      could lead to the use of anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulant or pro-fibrinolytic agents as&#xD;
      adjunctive therapies among select groups of critically ill children with hyperglycemia who&#xD;
      may not be amenable to tight glucose control or are at higher risk of adverse clinical&#xD;
      outcomes from a pro thrombotic environment. Results from this study may lead to&#xD;
      identification of protein or genetic markers that will identify critically ill children most&#xD;
      likely to benefit from existing anticoagulant therapies such as activated protein C.&#xD;
