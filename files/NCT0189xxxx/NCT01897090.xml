    <textblock>
      A 16-week randomized, pilot study to determine if an elimination diet reduces symptoms of&#xD;
      Crohn's disease. Sixty (60) adult patients (18-75 yrs) with a mild or moderate Crohn's&#xD;
      Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of 150-450, will be recruited through the GI practices at Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins University. Patients agree not to be on any other major treatments, with the&#xD;
      exception of consistent/stable doses of 5-aminosalicylate (ASA) drugs/other medications&#xD;
      during the course of the study and will obtain their physician's permission.They will be&#xD;
      divided into a treatment and standard diet group: thirty (30) patients will be on the&#xD;
      &quot;Crohn's Disease Diet&quot; (primarily an &quot;anti-inflammatory diet that is an elimination diet -&#xD;
      gluten-free, casein-free based with limited carbohydrate) and thirty (30) patients will be&#xD;
      given the Dietary Guideline recommendations and similar dietary counseling attention. To&#xD;
      assess the clinical efficacy and tolerance of the trial population, patients will be&#xD;
      monitored by two office visits (at 0 and 12 weeks) by visits with the Clinical Research Unit&#xD;
      (CRU) registered dietitians (RDs) at 0, 6, 12, and 16 weeks (4 weeks after the end of the&#xD;
      study) for blood and dietary data collection. Clinical endpoints will be Crohn's disease&#xD;
      Activity Index (CDAI) scores (remission &lt; 150; mild = 150-220; moderate = 220-450; severe =&#xD;
      450+), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) values (0-0.8 mg/L), sedimentation rate /(male: 15-20 mm/hr,&#xD;
      female: 20-30 mm/hr)/, possibly interleukin-6(/normal value: &lt;10pg/ml)/, Overall Quality of&#xD;
      Life (QOL) through the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), Dudley IBD Symptom&#xD;
      Questionnaire (DISQ) surveys, and Brown's Gastrointestinal Quality of Life (QOL)&#xD;
      Questionnaire, and health care costs measured by a health care cost questionnaire.&#xD;
