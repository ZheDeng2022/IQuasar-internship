    <textblock>
      Climacteric or Menopausal Transition is defined as the time period where there is a change to&#xD;
      non-reproductive reproductive life, with extension of variable length. During this period,&#xD;
      and after the establishment of Menopause and non-functioning ovarian, the appearance of&#xD;
      various symptoms that express the depletion of ovarian follicles is common; among these&#xD;
      symptoms, the most frequently reported by women are vasomotor symptoms or hot flashes. In&#xD;
      addition to hormonal therapy, other medications have been employed in an attempt to improve&#xD;
      these symptoms; although they present better results than placebo, yet have little clinical&#xD;
      impact in reducing vasomotor symptoms. Therefore, this gap allows the evaluation of&#xD;
      alternative therapies, such as Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). The rationale&#xD;
      for studying the effect of this technique in this context is its possible autonomic&#xD;
      modulatory effect. What reinforces the choice of this technique is the fact that it&#xD;
      demonstrated efficacy in other pathologies such as depression, pain, Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
      among others. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a renewed method of&#xD;
      non-invasive brain modulation. It is based on a transcranial application of weak direct&#xD;
      currents in a non-invasive, simple and painless manner. Its use in the treatment of vasomotor&#xD;
      symptoms has not been studied. The objective of this study is to evaluate the improvement of&#xD;
      vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women, after application of tDCS, and compare them to a&#xD;
      control group. This Randomized Clinical Trial will be held in female postmenopausal patients,&#xD;
      followed in the outpatient Menopause Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology Service, Hospital de&#xD;
      Clinicas de Porto Alegre. From these results, it is expected to present a new therapeutic&#xD;
      option in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms.&#xD;

      Primary Outcome: evaluate the effect of tDCS on vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women&#xD;
      treated at a tertiary hospital in southern Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome: compare the effect of tDCS with sham-tDCS in postmenopausal women on&#xD;
      vasomotor symptoms, FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) levels, salivary cortisol, BDNF&#xD;
      (Brains derived neurotrophic factor)levels,depressive symptoms and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Application of tDCS for a period of 10 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active stimulation: the anode electrode is placed in the area of the motor cortex M1 C3 or C4&#xD;
      position of the dominant hemisphere (International 10-20 EEG System). The cathode electrode&#xD;
      is placed over the contralateral supraorbital region to the anode electrode. Treatment time&#xD;
      and intensity of the stimulus: 2 mili Ampere, 20min, 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo-sham: appliance off during the entire period without active stimulation, with the&#xD;
      position of the electrodes in the same sites of active stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo group do not receive pharmacological treatment or other during the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, patients will be reassessed in a week, a month and three months with new&#xD;
      application of questionnaires and sample collection.&#xD;
