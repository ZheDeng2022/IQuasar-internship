  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/2 study that is being conducted in two parts. The&#xD;
      Phase 1 part (closed to accrual as of January 25, 2016) comprised dose escalation and&#xD;
      expansion parts to establish the MTD and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) when&#xD;
      tazemetostat was given BID (twice daily) orally on a continuous basis. Additionally, in&#xD;
      separate cohorts in Phase 1, the effect of food on the bioavailability of tazemetostat as&#xD;
      well as the drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of tazemetostat were evaluated. The Phase 2&#xD;
      part was initiated once the MTD and /or RP2D was established. Phase 2 enrolls subjects with&#xD;
      DLBCL (Cohorts 1-3 and 6) and FL (Cohorts 4 and 5) for the determination of efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of tazemetostat monotherapy (Cohorts 1-5and of tazemetostat in combination with&#xD;
      prednisolone (Cohort 6) with placement determined by centrally confirmed histology, cell of&#xD;
      origin (COO), and EZH2 mutation status.&#xD;

             daily (or equivalent corticosteroid, excluding protocol-defined prednisolone dosing&#xD;
             for subjects enrolled in Cohort 6) when used for treatment of lymphoma related&#xD;
             symptoms, with the intent to taper by the end of Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Males or females aged ≥ 18 years at the time of informed consent (Phase 2). Males or&#xD;

             negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG] test with a minimum sensitivity&#xD;
             of 25 IU/L or equivalent units of beta-hCG). A separate baseline assessment is&#xD;
             required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before&#xD;
             the first dose of study drug. All females will be considered to be of childbearing&#xD;
             potential unless they are postmenopausal (at least 12 months consecutive amenorrheic,&#xD;
             in the appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been&#xD;
             sterilized surgically (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy or bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dose). Females of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception, from the&#xD;
             last menstrual period prior to randomization, during Treatment Cycles, and for 6&#xD;
             months after the last final dose of study drug; any male partner must use a condom.&#xD;
             Highly effective contraception is one that results in a failure rate of &lt;1% per year&#xD;
             when used consistently and correctly and includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Double barrier methods of contraception such as condom plus diaphragm or&#xD;
                  cervical/vault cap with spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Placement of an intrauterine device.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Established hormonal contraceptive methods: oral, injectable, or implant. Females&#xD;
                  who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of the same&#xD;
                  hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to dosing and must&#xD;
                  continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 6 months after&#xD;
                  study drug discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Female subjects exempt from this requirement are subjects who practice total&#xD;
             abstinence or have a male partner who is vasectomized. If currently abstinent, the&#xD;
             subject must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception as described&#xD;
             above if they become sexually active during the Treatment Cycles, and for 6 months&#xD;
             after study drug discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (with confirmed azoospermia) or&#xD;
             they and their female partner must meet the criteria above (ie, not of childbearing&#xD;
             potential or practicing highly effective contraception and use a condom throughout the&#xD;
             study period and for 3 months after study drug discontinuation). Nonvasectomized male&#xD;
             subjects must also agree to refrain from donating sperm from first dose of&#xD;
             tazemetostat until 3 months following the last dose of tazemetostat.&#xD;
