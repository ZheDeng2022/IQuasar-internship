  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study is to determine if Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)&#xD;
      measurement of corneal power and astigmatism is more accurate than conventional Placido-ring&#xD;
      corneal topography. A second goal is to evaluate OCT-based epithelial thickness mapping. The&#xD;
      postoperative epithelial thickness variation will be used to calculate refractive effects and&#xD;
      calibrate the smoothing parameter in the mathematical model relating corneal mean curvature&#xD;
      and epithelial thickness. A third goal is to assess the repeatability of OCT measurements. A&#xD;
      fourth goal is to develop a method of estimating the focusing power, astigmatism, and HOA of&#xD;
      the crystalline lens based on measurements of the lens' anterior and posterior capsular&#xD;
      topographies and positions with the ultrahigh-speed MIT OCT prototype.&#xD;

      A prospective observational study on refraction and HOA changes after LASIK will be conducted&#xD;
      at OHSU and Baylor. We will enroll 50 subjects undergoing routine LASIK for the correction of&#xD;
      myopia or hyperopia. The Optovue anterior segment OCT prototype will be used to measure&#xD;
      corneal power, astigmatism, HOA, and epithelial thickness map. The ultrahigh-speed MIT OCT&#xD;
      prototypes will also be used when they become available. A comprehensive eye examination will&#xD;
      be performed preoperatively. OCT scan, manifest refraction, visual acuity, Placido-ring&#xD;
      corneal topography, slit scanning/Scheimpflug camera, and wavefront measurements will be&#xD;
      acquired preoperatively and 3-6 months after the surgery. The LASIK-induced refraction and&#xD;
      wavefront HOA changes will be used as the reference standard to evaluate the accuracy of&#xD;
      OCT-measured corneal power, astigmatism, and HOA changes. The primary goal of the study is to&#xD;
      determine if OCT measurement of corneal power and astigmatism is more accurate than&#xD;
      conventional Placido-ring corneal topography. A second goal is to evaluate OCT-based&#xD;
      epithelial thickness mapping. The postoperative epithelial thickness variation will be used&#xD;
      to calculate refractive effects and calibrate the smoothing parameter in the mathematical&#xD;
      model relating corneal mean curvature and epithelial thickness. A third goal is to assess the&#xD;
      repeatability of OCT measurements. A fourth goal is to develop a method of estimating the&#xD;
      focusing power, astigmatism, and HOA of the crystalline lens based on measurements of the&#xD;
      lens' anterior and posterior capsular topographies and positions with the ultrahigh-speed MIT&#xD;
      OCT prototype. The reference standard for lens focusing power and astigmatism will be based&#xD;
      on a Gaussian optics model that takes as inputs manifest refraction, crystalline lens&#xD;
      position, axial eye length, and OCT corneal power and astigmatism measurements. The reference&#xD;
      standard for lens HOA will be the difference between wavefront HOA and corneal HOA. For each&#xD;
      eye, the best-fit effective index of the lens will be found so that OCT measurements will&#xD;
      match the reference data. Although the lens index is likely to be higher centrally than&#xD;
      peripherally, this secondary perturbation will be accounted for by a posterior shift of the&#xD;
      posterior lens capsule in OCT images, due to the fact that apparent distances in OCT images&#xD;
      is a product of physical distance and optical group index. Thus HOA due to index variation in&#xD;
      the lens would translate to unevenness in the posterior capsule surface that could be&#xD;
      measured with OCT.&#xD;
