      The purpose of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of identifying and interviewing&#xD;
      healthcare triads (patients, loved ones and oncologists) in a research study and evaluate the&#xD;
      influences of patients' loved ones and oncologists on cancer treatment decision-making. the&#xD;
      study team plans to explore concordance or discordance within the triad about the decisions,&#xD;
      and also assess decisional conflict, regret and distress. Study methods involve interviewing&#xD;
      a total of 75 patients, their loved ones and oncologists about past cancer treatment&#xD;
      decisions. Analysis will consist mainly of qualitative content analysis. The investigators do&#xD;
      not anticipate risk or safety issues beyond loss of confidentiality or minimal discomfort&#xD;
      while discussing a cancer treatment decision.&#xD;

      The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the influences of oncologists and patients'&#xD;
      loved ones on cancer treatment decision-making. The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Test the feasibility of identifying and interviewing health care triads (patients,&#xD;
      loved ones, and oncologists) in a research study about treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Assess perceptions of the decision-making experience from the perspective of three&#xD;
      parties within the health care triad (patients, loved ones, and oncologists) and examine the&#xD;
      relationships among the triadic perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3: Explore concordance or discordance within the triad about cancer treatment decisions&#xD;
      and assess decisional conflict, decisional regret, and distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory pilot study of 25 health care triads. Triads will include: (1) a&#xD;
      patient diagnosed with advanced cancer, (2) a loved one, and (3) an oncology provider. In a&#xD;
      few instances, the study team may interview more than one oncologist or loved one per&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase one of recruitment, oncologists will be recruited and enrolled. In phase two, the&#xD;
      study team will recruit patients who receive care from at least one enrolled oncologist and&#xD;
      at least one of the patient's friends or family members. While oncology providers may&#xD;
      participate in the study with multiple patients and their loved ones, the patients will be&#xD;
      unique to each triad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators anticipate enrolling two triads per week for a total of three months. They will&#xD;
      utilize mainly qualitative methods, and specifically, content analysis, in this exploratory&#xD;
      pilot study to (1) further hone and develop research questions and aims for a larger study&#xD;
      with appropriate statistical power, (2) test the feasibility of recruiting health care triads&#xD;
      in the oncology context, and (3) strengthen our study design, protocols and surveys. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to use an iterative process of coding to allow for protocol and survey&#xD;
      revisions, and in particular the inclusion of new probes, during the study. The codebook will&#xD;
      include inductive and deductive codes related to the general decision making process,&#xD;
      expectations and decisional outcomes, conflict and concordance between members of the triad,&#xD;
      and other relevant topics. Two coders will review each interview and the team will review for&#xD;
      themes and exemplars. The investigators plan to pilot three scales in this study that might&#xD;
      be used in a larger future study.&#xD;
