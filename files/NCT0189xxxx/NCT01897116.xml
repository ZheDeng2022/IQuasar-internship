    <textblock>
      This study is testing vemurafenib and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of metastatic&#xD;
      BRAF V600E+ melanoma. Patients will be getting a known active treatment for their disease in&#xD;
      combination with HCQ which may help overcome resistance so that responses to vemurafenib are&#xD;
      more durable.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of Stege IV metastic melanoma&#xD;
             positive for BRAF V600E mutation by either the COBAS test or other CLIA approved&#xD;
             assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have the following hematologic, renal and liver function: absolute&#xD;
             neutrophil count &gt; 1500/mm3, platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3, hemoglobin &gt;9g/dL, creatinine ≤&#xD;
             2 times the upper limits of normal (ULN), albumin &gt; 2g/dL, total bilirubin ≤ 1.5&#xD;
             mg/dl, ALT and AST ≤ 3 times above the upper limits of the institutional norm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to commencement of dosing in&#xD;
             premenopausal women. Women of non-childbearing potential may be included without serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test if they are either sugically sterile or have been postmenopausal for ≥&#xD;
             1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Fertile men and women must an effective method of contraception during treatment and for at&#xD;
        least 6 months after completion of treatment as directed by their physician. Effective&#xD;
        methods of contraception are defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e.,&#xD;
        less than 1% per year) when used consistenly and correctly (for example implants,&#xD;
        injectables, combined oral contraception or intra-uterine devices). At the discretion of&#xD;
        the Investigator, acceptable methods of contraception may include total abstinence in cases&#xD;
        where the lifestyle of the patient ensures compliance. (Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar,&#xD;
        ovulation, sympothermal, postovulation methods) with withdrawal are not acceptable methods&#xD;
        of contraception.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with treated brain metastases that have been stable for 1 month are eligible;&#xD;
             patients must be off steroids for 1 week prior to starting study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any number and type of prior anticancer therapies except BRAF or MEK inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have discontinued active immunotherapy (IL-2, interferon, CTLA-4, etc.)&#xD;
             or chemotherapy at least 4 weeks prior to entering the study and oral targeted therapy&#xD;
             at least 2 weeks prior to entering the study and have recovered from adverse events&#xD;
             due to those agents. Patients must not receive any other investigational anticancer&#xD;
             therapy during the period on study or the four weeks prior to entry, with the&#xD;
             exception of vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with serious concurrent infection or medical illness, which would jeopardize&#xD;
             the ability of the patient to receive the treatment outlined in this protocol with&#xD;
             reasonable safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant and breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving concurrent therapy for their tumor (i.e.chemotherapeutics or&#xD;
             investigational agents).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with leptomeningeal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a concurrent or prior malignancy within the last 2 years, unless they&#xD;
             are patients with curatively treated carcinoma-in-situ, or basal cell carcinoma or&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Patients with treated prostate cancer or breast&#xD;
             cancer for which no concurrent therapy is indicated are eligible for this study.&#xD;
             Patients who have been free of disease (any prior malignancy) for ≥ five years are&#xD;
             eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to risk of disease exacerbation patients with porphyria are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to risk of disease exacerbation patients with psoriasis are ineligible unless the&#xD;
             disease is well controlled and they are under the care of a specialist for the&#xD;
             disorder who agrees to monitor the patient for exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drugs (EIADs) (i.e.&#xD;
             phenytoin, carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, primidone, or oxcarbazepine) are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previously documented macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy are&#xD;
             ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior exposure to BRAF or MEK inhibitors are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because patients witn immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections&#xD;
             when treated with bone marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients are excluded&#xD;
             from the study. For patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy, the&#xD;
             potential impact of pharmacokinetic interactions with HCQ and VEM is unknown.&#xD;
             Appropriate studies may be undertaken in patients with HIV and those receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retrovital therapy in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of congenital long QT syndrome or a corrected QTc interval ≥ 450 msec at&#xD;
             baseline.&#xD;
