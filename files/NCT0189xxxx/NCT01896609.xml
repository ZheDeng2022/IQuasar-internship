      A single Center, Prospective Phase IV, Open-Label, Controlled, Randomized Trial comparing the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Quadritherapy regimen (Reiferon Retard® , Ribavirin ,&#xD;
      Nitazoxanide and Alfacalcidol (Bon-One ® ) versus Triple therapy regimen (Reiferon Retard® ,&#xD;
      Ribavirin and Nitazoxanide) versus the standard of care regimen(Reiferon Retard® and&#xD;
      Ribavirin) in the treatment of Naïve chronic hepatitis C among the Egyptian population.&#xD;
      Effectiveness will be evaluated based on Sustained Virological Response (SVR) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE(S): The primary objectives of this trial are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy of the three treatment arms in naïve Chronic Hepatitis C Virus&#xD;
           (HCV) genotype 4 patients by evaluating the sustained virological response ( SVR) at&#xD;
           week 60 ( 3 months after end of treatment period)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify optimum treatment protocol for HCV genotype 4 in respect to used combination of&#xD;
           medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether adding vitamin D, a potent immunomodulator, could improve viral response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This is a phase IV, single center, open labeled, randomized (1:1:1) controlled&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF EVALUABLE SUBJECTS: 300 NUMBER OF CENTER/S: 1 Country:Egypt DURATION OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
      94 weeks TREATMENT: randomized 1:1:1 ratio into 3 Arms SUBJECT POPULATION: male or female&#xD;
      subjects assessed by BMI less than 35, between the ages of 20 and 50 years. Subjects have to&#xD;
      be diagnosed as Naïve Chronic Hepatitis C genotype 4 patients with compensated liver disease&#xD;
      assessed by hematological and biochemical tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - DURATION OF THE STUDY: 94 weeks as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated Enrollment Duration: 16 weeks Collection of last Case Report Form (CRF) : 2 weeks&#xD;
      from Last patient out. Queries Resolution: 4 weeks from Collection of last CRF. Database lock&#xD;
      planned date: 2 weeks from Quires resolution. Final Study Report: 8 weeks from Database lock.&#xD;
      Estimated duration of subject participation: 62 weeks as follows;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening period per subject = 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment phase per subject = 48 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up phase per subject = 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      N.B : Each patient will receive medications for Maximum 48 weeks if his/her Polymerase Chain&#xD;
      Reaction (PCR) -ve at weeks 12 and 24 , and if his/her PCR +ve at week 12 or week 24 the&#xD;
      treatment will be stopped .&#xD;
