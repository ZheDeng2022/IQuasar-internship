      Objectives. We will evaluate the effect of ischemic postconditioning (PCON) on microvascular&#xD;
      obstruction (MVO) in patients with a first ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)&#xD;
      treated with primary angioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background. PCON appears as a potentially beneficial tool in STEMI. Its impact on MVO is&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. In a multicenter study, 132 patients with a first STEMI will be randomized to&#xD;
      undergo primary angioplasty followed by PCON or primary angioplasty alone (non-PCON). MVO and&#xD;
      infarct size (IS) will be quantified (% of left ventricular mass) in a core laboratory&#xD;
      analyzing late enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) timely coronary reperfusion is the&#xD;
      primary therapeutic goal to improve patients' outcome and to reduce left ventricular (LV)&#xD;
      infarct size (IS). Unfortunately, despite successful reperfusion of the epicardial blood flow&#xD;
      an impairment of microvascular perfusion persists in a significant number of patients, a&#xD;
      phenomenon referred to as microvascular obstruction (MVO). This is a multifactorial process&#xD;
      caused, among other factors, by microembolization, vasospasm and cells plugging. Cell&#xD;
      reperfusion injury related to inflammation as well as to mitochondrial damage provoked by a&#xD;
      rapid normalization of the acidotic myocardial environment do play a key role in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of MVO. In recent years MVO has been demonstrated to be a powerful and&#xD;
      independent predictor of adverse outcome and larger IS. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (CMR) has become the state of the art technique for an early non-invasive&#xD;
      comprehensive assessment of the structural consequences of STEMI, this including MVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Availability of inexpensive and easy-to-implement therapies that could solidly reduce MVO and&#xD;
      subsequently optimize the beneficial effects of prompt primary percutaneous intervention&#xD;
      would be of utmost importance. In recent years ischemic postconditioning (PCON) has appeared&#xD;
      as a promising option. It permits a progressive, rather than brisk, restoration of blood flow&#xD;
      to the jeopardized myocardium by means of consecutive cycles of inflation and deflation of&#xD;
      the angioplasty balloon used to open the acute coronary occlusion. Previous experimental&#xD;
      evidence and preliminary clinical data suggest that this simple strategy exerts, in&#xD;
      comparison with the traditional rapid reperfusion using single balloon inflations, a number&#xD;
      of protective myocardial effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last two years the effect of PCON on CMR-derived infarct size in STEMI patients&#xD;
      has been evaluated but the results have been controversial. In routine practice, the time&#xD;
      window to achieve any additional reduction in IS beyond that derived from timely coronary&#xD;
      reperfusion is extremely tight. To the contrary, MVO owing to its pathophysiology and more&#xD;
      progressive time course, seems a more suitable and realistic objective to explore the impact&#xD;
      of this complementary therapy. Nevertheless the effect of PCON on MVO in STEMI is unknown so&#xD;
      far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study we aim to analyse the effect of PCON on CMR-derived MVO in a randomized&#xD;
      series of patients with a first STEMI treated with primary angioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group in patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of age ≥18 years admitted to two university hospitals for a first STEMI within the&#xD;
      first 12 h of chest pain onset, with ST-segment elevation of &gt;0.1 mV in at least 2 contiguous&#xD;
      leads and for whom the clinical decision to treat with percutaneous coronary intervention is&#xD;
      made, will be considered for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria will be as follows: documented history of previous infarction; primary&#xD;
      percutaneous revascularization not attempted; severe clinical or hemodynamic deterioration;&#xD;
      left main stem disease; Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 2-3 or Rentrop&#xD;
      collateral flow grade ≥1 upon patient arrival; death, re-infarction, cardiac surgery or&#xD;
      severe clinical deterioration before CMR study; patients who deny participation in the&#xD;
      registry; any contraindications to CMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The institutional ethics committees of the participating institutions has approved the&#xD;
      research protocol and written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reperfusion therapy in patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEMI patients admitted to the institutions participating in the present study will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to either the PCON or the non-PCON group. Randomization will be performed&#xD;
      using a computer-generated randomization sequence. In summary, once diagnostic coronary&#xD;
      angiography has been carried out and the decision to undertake primary angioplasty has been&#xD;
      made, operators will acceed with their personal codes to a web page specifically developed&#xD;
      for the present study (Universitat Politecnica, Valencia, Spain) where the patient will be&#xD;
      recorded and, then, the study group assignment will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics, clinical data and the TIMI risk score will be prospectively&#xD;
      recorded in all cases. The percentage of sum ST-segment resolution 90 min after reperfusion&#xD;
      therapy will be determined. Times over the upper reference limit (xURL) of creatine-kinase MB&#xD;
      mass will be serially measured upon patient arrival and at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after&#xD;
      reperfusion and the peak value will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMR study in patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMR (1.5-T, Sonata Magnetom, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) will be performed 1 week after STEMI&#xD;
      according to our laboratory protocol. All images will be acquired by a phased-array body&#xD;
      surface coil during breath-holds and will be ECG-triggered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMR studies will be analyzed in a core lab (INCLIVA, Valencia, Spain) by an experienced&#xD;
      observer blinded to all patient data using customized software (QMASS MR, 6.1.5, Medis,&#xD;
      Leiden, The Netherlands).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cine imaging, LV ejection fraction (%), end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes indexes&#xD;
      (ml/m2) and mass (g/m²) will be calculated by manual planimetry of endocardial and epicardial&#xD;
      borders of all short-axis views (Figure 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MVO will be visually defined as a lack of contrast uptake in the core of tissue showing late&#xD;
      gadolinium enhancement (Figure 2); the extent of MVO will be manually defined and expressed&#xD;
      as percentage of LV mass. In order to avoid artifacts and based on the prognostic value&#xD;
      previously demonstrated by our study group, significant MVO will be considered to be present&#xD;
      if it is detected in more than one segment using the 17-segment model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intra-observer variability for the quantification of all exposed CMR parameters in our&#xD;
      core lab has been previously determined and is less than 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the present study will be to assess the effect of PCON on the&#xD;
      occurrence and extent of MVO in STEMI patients treated with primary angioplasty. The&#xD;
      secondary endpoint will be to explore, in the same scenario, the effect of PCON on IS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target sample size has been calculated to assess the effect of PCON on the occurrence of&#xD;
      MVO measured by CMR imaging. The expected effect was a 50% reduction in the occurrence of MVO&#xD;
      with a statistical power of 80% and a probability of a type I error of 0.05 with a 2-sided&#xD;
      test. Assuming a drop-out rate of 25%, the total sample consists of 98 patients randomized&#xD;
      equally to the two groups. For security reasons we will randomized 132 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be tested for normal distribution using the one-sample&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Continuous normally distributed data will be expressed as the mean ±&#xD;
      standard deviation and compared using the Student's t-test. Non-parametric data will be&#xD;
      expressed as the median with the interquartile range and will be compared with the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U-test. Group percentages will be compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical significance will be considered for two-tailed p &lt;0.05. SPSS 11.0 (SPSS Inc,&#xD;
      Chicago, Illinois, USA) was used throughout.&#xD;
