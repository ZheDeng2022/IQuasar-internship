      The main objective of the study is to investigate the impact of H. pylori infection on immune&#xD;
      activation and clinical outcome in HIV patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other specific study objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the effects of H. pylori infection on immune activation and the T-cell&#xD;
           profile in HIV positive patients and compare those with HIV negative controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the influence of H. pylori infection on virological and immune parameters, and&#xD;
           on clinical progression of HIV infection (WHO stage, opportunistic infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the prevalence of H. pylori infection among HIV patients in the Komfo Anokye&#xD;
           Teaching Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in HIV patients in Kumasi.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the association of H. pylori infection with gastrointestinal symptoms and&#xD;
           pathology in HIV patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To compare the clinical and immunological response to antiretroviral therapy and in&#xD;
           HIV-patients with and without concomitant H. pylori infection.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational case control study with longitudinal follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1000 HIV patients regularly attending to the KATH HIV clinic will be screened for H. pylori&#xD;
      infection and other parasitic gastrointestinal infections (as possible confounders).&#xD;
      Demographic, clinical and immunological data of those patients will be documented by study&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups with each 100 patients with H. pylori infection and 100 patients without H. pylori&#xD;
      infection are then selected, matched according to sex, age, baseline HIV viral load, CD4 cell&#xD;
      count and other confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 healthy blood donors without HIV infection are equally screened for H. pylori and other&#xD;
      gastrointestinal infections and serve as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be recruited after the study procedure and potential risks associated&#xD;
      with participating in the study have been explained and written informed consent has been&#xD;
      obtained. The inclusion into the study shall in no way affect the decision to initiate HAART&#xD;
      or the choice of antiretroviral drugs. Patients may withdraw consent to participate in part&#xD;
      or in full at any time during the study without giving reasons. The withdrawal of consent&#xD;
      will in no way negatively affect the further management. Recruitment will begin after ethical&#xD;
      approval has been obtained from the appropriate authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline demographic, clinical and socioeconomic data, as well as the medical history will be&#xD;
      documented by the attending physicians involved in HIV services, who are blinded to&#xD;
      immunological parameters (except CD4 cell count) and stool test results. Routine laboratory&#xD;
      parameters will be extracted from patient's folders, including CD4 cell count, full blood&#xD;
      count as well as liver and kidney function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are asked to provide a fresh stool sample to be tested for worm eggs, protozoa and&#xD;
      H. pylori. After concentration and preparation with sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin&#xD;
      (SAF), specimens are stained with iodine and kinyoun solution for microscopy. Untreated fresh&#xD;
      stool is frozen at -80°C for H. pylori testing using a commercially available H. pylori stool&#xD;
      antigen test (Premier Platinum HpSA Plus, Meridian) according to the specifications of the&#xD;
      manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A venous blood sample (2x 8ml CPT tube, Becton Dickinson) is taken together with the blood&#xD;
      collection for the routine laboratory investigations. Plasma is separated for the analysis of&#xD;
      cytokines by Elisa or cytometric bead arrays (CBA) and the remaining plasma is stored at&#xD;
      -80°C. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are isolated according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      specifications and prepared for further testing by flow cytometry. A proportion of PBMC will&#xD;
      be stored in liquid nitrogen for later analysis. Plasma samples will be mainly used to assess&#xD;
      the cytokine profile (inflammatory and TH1/TH2 cytokines) by ELISA and multi-bead flow&#xD;
      arrays. PBMC will be analysed by flow cytometry to determine the frequency and phenotype of&#xD;
      Treg, defined as CD4+, CD25+, FoxP3+ cells, and the activation status and T-cell profile&#xD;
      (e.g. CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RA, CD38, CD39, CD69), as well as apoptosis markers. Ex vivo&#xD;
      intracellular cytokine assay for IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-17 will be performed on&#xD;
      unstimulated and stimulated PBMC. FACS analyses will be conducted in the KATH immunology&#xD;
      laboratory, using the FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and the CellQuest Pro&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline evaluation, patients are followed up for one year. 12 months after the&#xD;
      baseline evaluation, a venous blood sample (2x8ml CPT) is taken and the immunological&#xD;
      parameters are repeated as specified for the baseline evaluation. Patients who receive&#xD;
      treatment of intestinal pathogens, or who are started on antiretroviral therapy, according to&#xD;
      clinical indication, will be asked to provide an additional blood sample for immunological&#xD;
      evaluation three months after initiation of treatment. In case of treatment for an intestinal&#xD;
      pathogen, a stool sample will also be collected after three months to confirm eradication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Frequency and activation status of T-cell subsets in HIV positive patients with versus&#xD;
           without H. pylori infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change of CD4 cells and HIV viral load in HIV positive patients with versus without H.&#xD;
           pylori infection during follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Incidence of clinical events in HIV positive patients with versus without H. pylori&#xD;
           infection during follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prevalence of H. pylori infection in HIV patients in Kumasi, Ghana, compared to blood&#xD;
           donors&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prevalence of infection with helminth and other gastrointestinal parasites in HIV&#xD;
           patients in Kumasi, Ghana, compared to blood donors&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prevalence and risk factors for gastrointestinal infections in HIV patients in Kumasi,&#xD;
           Ghana&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Association of gastrointestinal infections with gastrointestinal symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Association of gastrointestinal infections with nutrition status, wasting and anemia in&#xD;
           HIV patients in Kumasi, Ghana&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of the HIV infection will be carried out according to national and&#xD;
      institutional guidelines and will not be influenced by the study participation. Patients&#xD;
      found to be infected with pathogen parasites (e. g. Ascaris lumbricoides) will be offered&#xD;
      treatment. Patients with H. pylori infection and pertinent symptoms will be offered&#xD;
      eradication therapy according to national guidelines. If treatment costs are not covered by&#xD;
      the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), costs will be covered by the study budget.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No interventions are carried out within this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculations on the planned sample size were done but not quoted since not well&#xD;
      substantiated. Since there exist no data on the alterations of T-cell populations during H.&#xD;
      pylori infection, a substantiated sample-size analysis is not possible. We assume a&#xD;
      difference of the frequency of regulatory T cells (Treg), as one key end point, in the range&#xD;
      of 1-2%, as the minimum to be clinically significant. To demonstrate a significant difference&#xD;
      of 1% between the groups with a statistical power of 0.9 and α=0.05, using the unpaired,&#xD;
      2-sided t-test, a sample size of 380 patients would be needed. No reliable data exist on the&#xD;
      prevalence of H. pylori infection among HIV patients in Ghana. According to data from other&#xD;
      African countries, we assume a prevalence of 60-80%. To be sure to obtain sufficient H.&#xD;
      pylori negative patients and to be able to select a matched group of H. pylori uninfected&#xD;
      patients, we still suggest screening 1000 HIV infected patients. All patients recruited and&#xD;
      screened for H. pylori will be analysed for clinical progression of HIV disease. Likewise,&#xD;
      there exist no data to estimate the consequences for the clinical course. However, such&#xD;
      differences are difficult to identify due to the high variability of the clinical course of&#xD;
      HIV disease, and the multiplicity of confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables are to be compared by paired Student's t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank&#xD;
      test depending on statistical distributions. Linear regression analysis and Fisher's&#xD;
      transformation test will be used for continuous variables. Proportions will be compared by&#xD;
      chi-square tests. Multiple regression analysis and logistic regression analysis will be&#xD;
      performed as appropriate in order to correct for confounders. A p-value &lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
