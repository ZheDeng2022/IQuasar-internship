  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to find out what eating meals in a short time period early&#xD;
      in the day (time-restricted feeding) versus eating meals spread out during the day (grazing)&#xD;
      does to the body's ability to control blood sugar and to the health of its blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that time-restricted feeding will be more effective at&#xD;
      improving glucose tolerance and vascular condition (inflammation and micro- and&#xD;
      macro-vascular function) than grazing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each participant will eat according to one of the two eating schedules (grazing or&#xD;
      time-restricted feeding) for 5 weeks, have a 7-week washout period, and then eat according to&#xD;
      the other eating schedule for 5 weeks. Measurements of glucose homeostasis and vascular&#xD;
      condition will be performed before and after a participant follows each eating schedule.&#xD;
