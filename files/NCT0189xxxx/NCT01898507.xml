    <textblock>
      This study examines the effects of smoking low nicotine cigarettes in different groups of&#xD;
      smokers. The investigators are focusing on differences in how smokers' bodies break down and&#xD;
      eliminate nicotine from their systems. Some people are fast metabolizers of nicotine, meaning&#xD;
      they break down and eliminate nicotine from their bodies more quickly. Other people are&#xD;
      slower metabolizers meaning they break down and eliminate nicotine more slowly. The&#xD;
      investigators are comparing these two groups of smokers for their responses to low nicotine&#xD;
      cigarettes. The investigators hypothesize that individuals who smoke low nicotine cigarettes&#xD;
      may smoke more intensely or smoke more each day, thereby maintaining their desired nicotine&#xD;
      levels, and as a result continue to be exposed to significant toxin levels.&#xD;

      This study examines the effects of smoking low nicotine cigarettes on smoking behaviors and&#xD;
      toxin exposure in fast and slow nicotine metabolizing smokers. We will recruit current&#xD;
      smokers (split between slow and rapid nicotine metabolizing smokers) for a 35-day protocol.&#xD;
      Participants will smoke their own brand cigarettes during a baseline 5 day period, followed&#xD;
      by a 15-day period of smoking low nicotine content cigarette level 1: 0.25 mg nicotine&#xD;
      content, followed by a 15-day period of smoking low nicotine content cigarette level 2: 0.08&#xD;
      mg nicotine content. This application is designed to provide empirical science to inform the&#xD;
      FDA on the effect smoking low nicotine content cigarettes will have on use patterns and harm&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. adults age 21-65.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. smoking at least 10 cigarettes per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. smoking daily for the last 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Provide a baseline breath CO reading equal to or greater than 10 parts per million.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. smoke predominantly non-menthol filtered cigarettes (research cigarettes are only&#xD;
             non-menthol).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. not currently using any other nicotine containing products such as cigars, smokeless&#xD;
             tobacco, nicotine replacement therapies (patch or gum).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. are fluent in English and are capable of providing written informed consent, which&#xD;
             includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the combined&#xD;
             consent and HIPAA form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and attend an Intake Visit for&#xD;
        medical screening will be asked to provide a blood sample to determine NMR. Only those&#xD;
        individuals who are characterized as slow or rapid, based on NMRs ≤ .26, or ≥ .42, will be&#xD;
        eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. use of any nicotine containing products other than cigarettes&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. current or impending enrollment in smoking cessation program&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. history in the last year or current treatment of substance abuse (other than nicotine&#xD;
             dependence)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. positive drug screen for cocaine, methamphetamines or opiates for urine drug screen at&#xD;
             intake session&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. alcohol use greater than 25 standard drinks per week&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. current or planned pregnancy or lactating&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. history or current diagnosis of psychosis, bipolar disorder, mania, or schizophrenia&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. current major depression (history of major depression but in remission for a minimum 6&#xD;
             months is eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. serious or unstable disease within past year (e.g. cancer other than melanoma, heart&#xD;
             disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. history or current diagnosis of COPD&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. history of stroke or heart attack&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. age less than 21 years- We wish to recruit smokers with well established smoking&#xD;
             patterns and will restrict recruitment to those over 21&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. age more than 65 years - smoking is often associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary&#xD;
             obstructive diseases that manifest later in life. As smokers develop these problems,&#xD;
             smoking behavior and biomarkers of harm may be affected therefore we will restrict&#xD;
             enrollment to those under age 65&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. provide baseline CO reading less than 10 at initial session&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. current use (or use within past 14 days) of any medication that affects the&#xD;
             biotransformation of nicotine, such as anticonvulsant drugs, rifampin, and disulfiram;&#xD;
             or any psychoactive medications which can affect smoking behaviors&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. any conditions viewed by the PI or study physician as creating a potential increased&#xD;
             risk to a participant due to their participation will be reasons for exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. at the discretion of the PI, any participants viewed as non-compliant will be excluded&#xD;
             from further participation&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Smoke cigarettes with a filter size other than standard or slim sized as the&#xD;
             topography mouthpieces are sized for standard filters and have an adapter for slim&#xD;
             cigarettes only.&#xD;
