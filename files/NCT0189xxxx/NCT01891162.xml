  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age, parity, obesity and a number of comorbidities are the major clinical and lifestyle risk&#xD;
      factors for female urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse at the population level.&#xD;
      The socioeconomic risks for incontinence have however, conflicting evidence with assorted&#xD;
      measures of socioeconomic status. Brazil is a country with enormous social contrasts, and&#xD;
      deep inequality. We have a mixed origin of cultures and different economic and regional&#xD;
      conditions. We believe that the perception and the impact that has Pelvic floor dysfunction&#xD;
      in the quality of life of the woman must vary widely according to socioeconomic status&#xD;
      (including household income, highest educational level, family income). There is to date no&#xD;
      studies have correlated a criterion for classifying economic official in Brazil with the&#xD;
      impact of quality of life (based in KHQ or PQOL) of women with urinary incontinence and&#xD;
      pelvic organ prolapse.&#xD;

      The research is being conducted at the Department of Gynecology of a referral hospital in the&#xD;
      state of Ceará, Brazil in the period October 2011 to February 2012. Women will be referred&#xD;
      from Primary Care and Health scheduled for evaluation in the sector of Urogynecology Cesar&#xD;
      Cals General Hospital, Department of Health of the State of Ceará. During the study period&#xD;
      200 patients will be treated with complaints of urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse&#xD;
      in the sector. Included in the study women who were postmenopausal, who are not taking&#xD;
      hormone therapy in the last six months. Women with urinary loss, which does not have&#xD;
      non-inhibited contraction of the detrusor proven by urodynamic study. Will be compared with a&#xD;
      group of women without pelvic floor dysfunction confirmed by clinical history and&#xD;
      gynecological examination with the same characteristics in relation to postmenopausal status,&#xD;
      all from the general gynecology outpatient clinic. Will be used for data collection&#xD;
      socioeconomics an interview administrated questionnaire adapted from the Brazil Economic&#xD;
      Classification Criterion - 2011 (CCEB) The CCEB is an instrument of economic segmentation&#xD;
      that uses the survey of household characteristics (presence and quantity of some items of&#xD;
      comfort and home schooling level of household head) to differentiate the population. The&#xD;
      criterion assigns points according to each household characteristic and performs the sum of&#xD;
      these points. Then will be made a match score of the test strips and layers of economic&#xD;
      status defined by A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D, E. This criterion was designed to define broad&#xD;
      classes that meet the needs of segmentation (by purchasing power) of most companies. To&#xD;
      evaluate Quality of Life in Urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse women we used the&#xD;
      KHQ questionnaire, QoL-P respectively. To evaluate the Overall Quality of Life, SF-36. For&#xD;
      functional evaluation of the pelvic floor (AP) bidigital evaluation was performed using the&#xD;
      classification of Ortiz (1996) and schema PERFECT Oxford (1990). Will be used the application&#xD;
      EpiInfo version 6.04, Atlanta, USA. Will be studied the socioeconomic variables (age,&#xD;
      educational level, economic status and income), health perception variables (the impact of&#xD;
      incontinence / prolapse, the limitations of performance tasks, physical limitation, social&#xD;
      limitation, personal relationships, the emotions, sleep and energy and gravity measurements).&#xD;
      Will be used the prevalence of urinary incontinence as a measure of the occurrence and&#xD;
      chi-square test and test of Pearson to evaluate the statistical significance considering p&#xD;
      &lt;0.05. Exploratory analysis will also performed to describe the frequency distribution of&#xD;
      socioeconomic variables.&#xD;
