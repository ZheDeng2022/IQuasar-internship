    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine in female patients who suffer mixed urinary&#xD;
      incontinence (MUI) the following: 1) the proportion of patients that are cured or improved by&#xD;
      a single modality therapy (drug or surgery alone), cured or improved by a combined therapy&#xD;
      (drug and surgery in any order) or non-responders to any of theses therapies; 2) which of the&#xD;
      combined therapy sequences (surgery first, then followed by oral drug therapy or oral drug&#xD;
      therapy first, then followed by surgery) is the most effective in patients needing combined&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that&#xD;
             the subject (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all&#xD;
             pertinent aspects of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Female outpatients older than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Naïve* mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) consisting of involuntary urine leakage&#xD;
             associated with urge incontinence and incontinence with physical exertion, coughing,&#xD;
             sneezing, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Positive Cough Stress Test (CST):&#xD;
&#xD;
             A positive CST is confirmed with visualization of urine leakage at the external&#xD;
             urethral opening, concurrent with a vigorous cough and following filling of the&#xD;
             bladder at capacity&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Positive 24-hours Pad Test (PT):&#xD;
&#xD;
             A positive SPT is confirmed with leakage of &gt;8.0g/24h of urine into a pad placed over&#xD;
             the external urethral opening. After 24 hours the pads are placed in the sealable&#xD;
             plastic, which is weighed and the urine lost during the 24-h period is calculated&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Daytime voiding frequency equal to or greater than to 8 times per day, with night time&#xD;
             frequency &gt; to 2 times per night.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,&#xD;
             laboratory tests, the self-completion of study questionnaires and diary, and other&#xD;
             trial procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Urgency or urge incontinence defined by a score at the overactive bladder symptom&#xD;
             score (OABSS) &gt; 25 and/or urodynamic signature of the urge incontinence consisting in&#xD;
             any uninhibited detrusor contraction during the filling phase of the CMG.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Naïve MUI means that the patient never received Oxytrol (oxybutynin) or surgical&#xD;
                  treatment for this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Symptoms of MUI &lt; 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of uncontrolled narrow angle glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of relevant neurological disease (e.g. multiple sclerosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of lower urinary tract anatomical anomaly, e.g., grades 2 to 4 urogenital&#xD;
             prolapse (at or beyond the hymen with valsalva).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History or evidence of urinary outlet obstruction or urinary retention, including post&#xD;
             void residual (PVR) urine volume &gt; 50ml&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Chronic persistent local pathology that may cause urinary symptoms, e.g. interstitial&#xD;
             cystitis, tumour, bladder stone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects using any pharmacological agent or device for their urinary incontinence less&#xD;
             than 6 weeks prior to the inclusion or having ever used Oxytrol (oxybutynin)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with any of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Indwelling urinary catheters or who perform Intermittent Self Catheterization&#xD;
                  (ISC)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Passive urinary incontinence (e.g., vesico-vaginal fistula).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Not capable of independent toileting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects with a documented and untreated UTI (temporary exclusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who require Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) must have been taking this at a&#xD;
             stable dose for at least 3 months prior to study entry. Any change in dose or type of&#xD;
             HRT taken during the study will be considered a protocol violation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects with uncontrolled narrow angle glaucoma (opinion of treating ophthalmologist&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Subjects who have; on urodynamic investigation evidence of a poor bladder compliance&#xD;
             and/or neurogenic detrusor hyperactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects who in the opinion of the investigator or that of the trial Clinician, are&#xD;
             unable and/or unlikely to comprehend the nature, scope and possible consequences of&#xD;
