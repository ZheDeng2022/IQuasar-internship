  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following chemotherapy, breast cancer patients primarily gain fat mass and lose muscle mass.&#xD;
      Both depletion of muscle and an increase of fat mass in breast cancer patients are related to&#xD;
      short survival, and decreased skeletal muscle mass and function may result in fatigue and&#xD;
      inactivity, which contributes to fat mass changes and can be responsible for chemo-toxicity&#xD;
      and increased mortality. The purpose of this study is to provide detailed insight in&#xD;
      chemotherapy related changes in lipid metabolism and gut digestion and absorption of fat in&#xD;
      breast cancer patients compared to matched healthy controls. This will provide required&#xD;
      information that is necessary to implement new strategies to develop optimal nutritional&#xD;
      regimen in breast cancer patients. The hypothesis is that chemotherapy in breast cancer is&#xD;
      related to altered gut function and absorption and to increases in fat synthesis that lead to&#xD;
      fat accumulation. In addition, we will examine the effect of cancer, chemotherapy, and gender&#xD;
      by comparing fat digestion/absorption and fat metabolism of the breast cancer before and&#xD;
      after chemotherapy, to aged matched healthy female and male controls.&#xD;

      This research study involves 5 visits for the breast cancer subjects and 3 visits for the&#xD;
      healthy controls. The first visit includes the informed consent and a screening and the&#xD;
      second and third visit for the study days before chemotherapy and the fourth and fifth visit&#xD;
      for the study days after chemotherapy. For the first test day, 2 hours of the subjects time&#xD;
      will be for urine and blood sample collection, and to ingest the deuterated water. Subjects&#xD;
      are allowed to go home after and eat normally. On the second study day, subjects will arrive&#xD;
      early that morning and a DXA scan will be performed first. For the duration of the study,&#xD;
      subjects have to lie in the bed (except for bathroom privileges). They can watch tv or bring&#xD;
      and use a book/tablet. The research nurse or study staff will be present in the human subject&#xD;
      area to assist the subject if necessary. Subjects are not allowed to eat or drink during the&#xD;
      second test day, except for the test drink (meal) and water. One IV catheter will be placed&#xD;
      in a vein of the arm/hand for blood draws. The hand will be placed in a hot box during blood&#xD;
      collection. Another IV catheter will be placed in the contra-lateral forearm for a primed and&#xD;
      continuous infusion of 2H5-glycerol. Over the two day time period, a total of 100-120 ml of&#xD;
      blood will be obtained over approximately 19 samples. Stable isotopes will be ingested on the&#xD;
      first test day, added to the test drinks on the second test day after the second hour, and&#xD;
      infused on the second day. On the second test day, subjects will fill out questionnaires and&#xD;
      perform muscle function tests. After completion of the study, we will provide the subject&#xD;
      with a meal.&#xD;

        Subjects with breast cancer will be recruited when visiting a medical or cancer clinic in&#xD;
        and outside the surrounding area of College Station. Cancer patients and healthy subjects&#xD;
        will also be recruited by responding to distributed flyers in the community in the College&#xD;
        Station area; for example in hospital/clinic waiting areas, clinic rooms and bulletin&#xD;
        boards at Scott &amp; White and the CSMC or any other hospital. Other general recruitment&#xD;
        material in relation to the nutrition research that the research group performs at Texas&#xD;
        A&amp;M can be placed on bulletin boards at Scott &amp; White and the CSMC.&#xD;
