  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to measure the frequency and clinical types of mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (MCI) or dementia that occur among up to 150 military retirees with and without a&#xD;
      history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) among residents of the Armed Forces Retirement Home,&#xD;
      Washington D.C. and the Veterans Home of California-Yountville. Investigators will compare&#xD;
      the characteristics of dementia in those who have had a prior TBI to the characteristics in&#xD;
      those without a history of TBI. It is our hypothesis that the dementia or MCI among those&#xD;
      with prior TBI has distinct neuropsychological features that distinguishes it from those with&#xD;
      dementia or MCI without a history of TBI.&#xD;

      75 participants with a history of TBI will be the cases (exposed) group. A control group of&#xD;
      75 retirement home residents without a history of TBI who are age-matched to the cases will&#xD;
      also be recruited. Participants will be evaluated in a single visit, which will include&#xD;
      neurological, psychiatric, and cognitive assessment. The evaluation will take approximately 4&#xD;
      hours. In some cases, the evaluation may be split into two 2 hour sessions.&#xD;

        Subjects for this study will be recruited from the Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH) in&#xD;
        Washington, DC and the Veterans Home of California- Yountville. Up to 150 AFRH residents&#xD;
        from both the independent living and the assisted living facilities will be invited to take&#xD;
        the screening questionnaire and enroll in the study.&#xD;
