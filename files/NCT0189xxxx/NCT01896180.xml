      This is a pilot, proof of concept study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ALZ-1101 dosed&#xD;
      once daily for 28 days compared to latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution in patients with&#xD;
      elevated intraocular pressure not adequately controlled with latanoprost.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, pilot, proof of concept Phase 2 study. The objectives include the&#xD;
      comparison of efficacy of ALZ-1101 to latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution in reducing&#xD;
      elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular&#xD;
      hypertension who have IOP not adequately controlled with latanoprost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      70 Subjects (35 per arm) will be treated once daily (QD) in the evening with either ALZ-1101&#xD;
      or latanoprost for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed at 3 separate times (8 AM, 10 AM and 4 PM) on each treatment visit&#xD;
      (Days 0, 7, 14 and 28) by Goldmann applanation tonometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include slit lamp examination/anterior chamber cell and flare&#xD;
      grading, ophthalmoscopy/fundus examination, visual acuity, visual field testing and&#xD;
      colelction of adverse events. Subject rating of study medication comfort will be collected at&#xD;
      each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy endpoint is the between-group comparison of the mean IOP at the 10 am time&#xD;
      point at visit 5 (Day 28). Secondary endpoints include the between-group comparisons of the&#xD;
      mean change from baseline in IOP at all time-points, between group comparison of the mean&#xD;
      change from baseline in diurnal IOP at all post-baseline visits and the proportion of&#xD;
      subjects with IOP ≤ 18 mm Hg at all time points at all post-baseline visits.&#xD;
