  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To identify the changes in the brain following repeated sports-related concussion in men's&#xD;
      football, women's soccer, and women's lacrosse college athletes by reviewing the findings of&#xD;
      MRI studies that look at the structure of the brain and the appearance of the white matter at&#xD;
      baseline, during the acute phase of a concussive injury, and upon completion of collegiate&#xD;
      athletic play and correlate these findings with standard clinical measures.&#xD;

      This proposal seeks to study Diffusion Tensor Imaging and functional MRI of the brain at 1)&#xD;
      baseline, 2) after concussion and 3) at the end of an athlete's college career. Findings will&#xD;
      be compared to standard clinical measures already performed in the management of concussion&#xD;
      at the University of Florida Athletic Association and to serum biomarkers already being&#xD;
      obtained as part of a UF/ Banyan Biomarker Study. As in the biomarker study, UF athletes on&#xD;
      teams with higher incidences of sports related concussion; men's football, women's soccer,&#xD;
      and women's lacrosse will be offered enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal examinations will allow identification and quantification of concussive DTI&#xD;
      findings as comparisons can be made to the individual athlete's baseline data. This will&#xD;
      provide valuable correlation of imaging findings with severity of clinical symptoms at the&#xD;
      time of injury and also with timing of return to play.&#xD;
