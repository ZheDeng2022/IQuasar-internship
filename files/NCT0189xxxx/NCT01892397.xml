  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good or bad, the Optune device has on&#xD;
      the patient and meningioma. This study is being done because currently there are no proven&#xD;
      effective medical treatments for a progressive meningioma that has failed surgery and/or&#xD;
      radiation. The study uses an experimental device called Optune. Optune is &quot;experimental&quot;&#xD;
      because it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this type&#xD;
      of tumor, although it has been approved for a different type of brain tumor.&#xD;

    <description>The treatment plan is to have patients use the Optune device in monotherapy for â‰¥ 18 hours per day as per the treatment standard established from prior studies. A medical professional will see each patient at least once per month while on the device for toxicity assessment, compliance evaluation via downloading of the log-file on the device by the Novocure technician (which involves the technician simply attaching the device to a computer via USB where software reads how many hours per day on each day the device was used), and physical examination. Extent of disease evaluations will occur at baseline, 8 weeks, and then every 8 weeks thereafter. These evaluations will include MRI of the brain with and without contrast and perfusion (or CT head if a patient cannot undergo MRI).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically proven recurrent WHO grade II (atypical) or grade III (anaplastic)&#xD;
             intracranial supratentorial meningioma. MSKCC central review of histology is not&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI with and without contrast and with&#xD;
             perfusion (or CT scan is MRI with contraindicated). The scan must be performed within&#xD;
             14 days of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be on a stable or decreased dose of steroids for at least 5 days prior&#xD;
             to baseline imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with recent resection for recurrent disease must have recovered from the&#xD;
             effects of surgery and should not start treatment for at least 28 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least 1cm x 1 cm of contrast&#xD;
             enhancing disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received prior radiotherapy for meningioma. Patients may have&#xD;
             received standard external beam radiation, interstitial brachytherapy, or radiosurgery&#xD;
             in any combination. An interval of &gt; 4 weeks (28 days) must have elapsed from the&#xD;
             completion of radiotherapy to study entry and there must be subsequent evidence of&#xD;
             tumor progression. Patients with prior interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic&#xD;
             radiosurgery must have confirmation of true progressive disease rather than radiation&#xD;
             necrosis based on PET, MR-perfusion, MR-spectroscopy, or surgical documentation of&#xD;
             disease. If there is any question, investigators should discuss with the MSKCC PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy: there is no limit on the number of prior surgeries, radiation therapy&#xD;
             treatments, radiosurgery treatments, or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must be able to provide informed consent indicating that they are aware&#xD;
             of the investigational nature of the study. Patients must provide an authorization for&#xD;
             the release of their protected health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; or = to 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; or = to 60%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4 weeks (28 days) from any radiation treatment, stereotactic radiosurgery,&#xD;
             conventional surgery, or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy at least 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with NF (Neurofibromatosis) are eligible, and may have other stable CNS&#xD;
             tumors, such as schwannoma, acoustic neuroma, or ependymoma, but ONLY if these lesions&#xD;
             have been stable in size for the preceding 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or&#xD;
             carcinoma in-situ of the cervix, unless in complete remission and off all therapy for&#xD;
             the disease for a minimum of 3 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of any other investigational drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent treatment on another clinical trial. Supportive care trials or&#xD;
             non-treatment trials (i.e. Quality of life) are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding. Patients must be surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or&#xD;
             agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The definition of&#xD;
             effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal investigator or&#xD;
             a designated associate. Male patients must be surgically sterile or agree to effective&#xD;
             contraception. Female patients of child bearing potential (ages 11-55) must have a&#xD;
             negative B-HCG pregnancy test documented within 14 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Implanted medical device such as a pacemaker, defibrillator, deep brain stimulator, or&#xD;
             vagus nerve stimulator, or documented significant arrhythmia at the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of increased intracranial pressure (midline shift &gt;5mm, clinically&#xD;
             significant papilledema, vomiting and nausea, or reduced level of consciousness).&#xD;

             concurrent growing supratentorial meningioma that serves as the target lesion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Coagulopathy (as evidenced by PT or APTT &gt;1.5 times upper limit of normal in patients&#xD;
             not undergoing anticoagulation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;100x10^3/uL) Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count&#xD;
             &lt;1x10^3/uL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe acute infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Skull defect with missing bone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ventricular shunt/catheter&#xD;
