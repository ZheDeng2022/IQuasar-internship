      This study would assess the impact of radio-frequency catheter ablation on exercise capacity&#xD;
      and quality of life in long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (LSP-AF) patients&#xD;

      III. Goals of the Project The purpose of this study is to determine whether pulmonary vein&#xD;
      isolation with radiofrequency ablation will improve exercise capacity and endothelial&#xD;
      function in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. We hypothesize that exercise capacity&#xD;
      and endothelial function will improve in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation following&#xD;
      pulmonary vein isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Easy fatigability is a frequent complaint in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Prior&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that exercise capacity in patients with &quot;lone atrial fibrillation&quot;&#xD;
      is less than that in healthy matched controls. Other investigators have also shown the&#xD;
      adverse effect of AF by comparing peak oxygen uptake VO2 prior to and after cardioversion. At&#xD;
      present, the majority of studies have focused on patients in whom with AF with either mild&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease or congestive failure. No study to date has assessed if pulmonary vein&#xD;
      isolation (PVI) via intracardiac ablation is able to improve exercise capacity in patients&#xD;
      with chronic LSP-AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective registry will assess exercise capacity in patients with chronic AF (CAF)&#xD;
      over a minimum period of 3 months; prior to and after PVI. Chronic AF is defined as those&#xD;
      patients who have an unsuccessful cardioversion and/or an ongoing AF episode (e.g. a year or&#xD;
      more). The observed results will be used to establish a better understanding of overall&#xD;
      quality of life and exercise tolerance prior to and after ablation. This registry may be&#xD;
      further expanded in the future and in a second study to assess exercise tolerance in patients&#xD;
      with CAF who have been treated with alternative treatment strategies. The findings from this&#xD;
      study may begin to pave the way for future clinical practice changes to best manage patients&#xD;
      with CAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the procedures: Patients will be required to fast and refrain from smoking at&#xD;
      least 4 hours prior to each testing session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial Stiffness Arterial stiffness will be measured non-invasively. Two indices of&#xD;
      arterial stiffness will be calculated including carotid augmentation index and aortic pulse&#xD;
      wave velocity after the subject has assumed the supine position for at least 10 minutes.&#xD;
      Blood pressure cuffs will be placed on both arms and legs, and ECG sensors will be placed on&#xD;
      both wrists. Carotid augmentation index will be calculated as the ratio of the amplitude of&#xD;
      the pressure wave above its systolic shoulder to the total pulse pressure. Aortic pulse wave&#xD;
      velocity will be calculated by dividing the distance (carotid to femoral artery) by the&#xD;
      transit time (time delay between the carotid and femoral &quot;foot&quot; waveforms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial Health The VENDYS 5000 BCTM (Endothelix, Houston, TX) is an FDA approved device&#xD;
      that will be used to measure vascular responsiveness, which is an index of endothelial&#xD;
      function. It measures changes in skin temperature of the fingertip in response to changes in&#xD;
      blood flow in the arm induced by a 5-minute cuff occlusion, and provides information about&#xD;
      vascular health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be seated for this test with a cuff fixed around the upper right arm and&#xD;
      VENDYS probes on the index fingers of both hands. Fingertip temperatures will be measured&#xD;
      throughout the procedure until 3 minutes after deflation of the cuff. Baseline fingertip&#xD;
      temperature will be measured for 3 minutes before cuff inflation. Following baseline&#xD;
      measures, the cuff will rapidly inflate to 200 mmHg or 50 mmHg above resting systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure and will remain inflated for 5 minutes. During this time, the fingertip temperature&#xD;
      will fall due to the occlusion of blood flow. After 5 minutes, the cuff will rapidly deflate&#xD;
      allowing blood flow to return to the arm. Skin temperature will be measured constantly for 3&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Capacity Subjects will perform a modified version of the Balke2 incremental&#xD;
      treadmill exercise test. The test begins with a 0% grade at a constant speed of 3.0 mph. The&#xD;
      grade will be increased by 1% every minute while the speed remains constant. Oxygen&#xD;
      consumption, heart rate, and ratings and perceived exertion (Borg Scale) will be measured&#xD;
      throughout the test and total exercise time to exhaustion will be recorded. Oxygen&#xD;
      consumption will be measured with a metabolic cart while the subjects breathe through a mouth&#xD;
      piece. Blood pressures and ECG will be monitored continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life Assessment The MOS 36-short form is a multi-purpose, short-form health survey&#xD;
      with only 36 questions. It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being&#xD;
      scores as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures and a&#xD;
      preference-based health utility index. It is a generic measure, as opposed to one that&#xD;
      targets a specific age, disease, or treatment group. Accordingly, the MOS-36 has proven&#xD;
      useful in surveys of general and specific populations, comparing the relative burden of&#xD;
      diseases, and in differentiating the health benefits produced by a wide range of different&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
