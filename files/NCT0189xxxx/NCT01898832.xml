    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate maternal and fetal serum IL-17 levels in pregnant&#xD;
      women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and to find out if Th-17 cells have a role&#xD;
      in progress of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is the most prevalent pregnancy-specific liver&#xD;
      disease. It occurs mainly in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. It typically&#xD;
      resolves after delivery spontaneously but it is associated with an increased risk of adverse&#xD;
      fetal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause of ICP is heterogeneous, pathophysiology is poorly understood and therapies have&#xD;
      been empiric. Genetic predispositions, environmental influences, dietary factors and hormonal&#xD;
      influences have been studied and cited in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparing with placebo, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been shown improvement in treatment&#xD;
      of pruritus in previous studies. S-adenosylmethionine, guar gum, activated charcoal,&#xD;
      dexamethasone, cholestyramine, etc. are not effective in the treatment of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD4+ T cells are an essential regulators of immune responses and inflammatory diseases. They&#xD;
      are also called chief of orchestra cells of immune system. The balance between T&#xD;
      helper-(Th)1, Th-2 and Th-17 cells and their cytokinergic interaction are crucial for the&#xD;
      response of the organism. Th17 and its specific cytokine IL-17 are responsible for&#xD;
      pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases as autoimmune uveitis, experimental autoimmune&#xD;
      encephalomyelitis in animal models and potentially also in human autoimmune diseases such as&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, primary biliary&#xD;
      cirrhosis. Recently, IL-17 targeted therapies (secukinumab, ixekizumab and brodalumab) are&#xD;
      being studied in Phase III clinical trials to evaluate their overall efficacy and safety for&#xD;
      certain autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Th-17 levels have been investigated in normal and abnormal pregnancies and results were&#xD;
      incompatible with each other. Some researchers have said that the level of IL-17 increased&#xD;
      during pregnancy but the others not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low serum IL-17 is associated with premature birth. Up-regulation of the IL-17 is associated&#xD;
      with preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      K. Harada et all. (2009) demonstrated that IL-17-positive cells are associated with the&#xD;
      chronic inflammation of bile ducts in primary biliary cirrhosis(PBC). Also, some authors&#xD;
      demonstrated that Th-17-related cytokines were increased significantly in patients with PBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maho Ichikawa et all. presented a case of male newborn infant who showed progressive severe&#xD;
      cholestasis with selectively high Levels of Serum IL- 17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on all this information, we decided to investigate maternal and fetal serum IL-17&#xD;
      levels of pregnants with ICP and the effects of UDCA therapy on it and find out if Th-17&#xD;
      cells have a role in progress of ICP.&#xD;
