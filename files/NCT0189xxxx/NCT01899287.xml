  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Occupational hand eczema (OHE) is a frequent disease which often takes a chronic course. The&#xD;
      burden of the disease is high in a personal as well as in a socio-economic context. There is&#xD;
      a need for evaluating new strategies to improve the prognosis for OHE patients. The&#xD;
      objectives of the study is to evaluate the effect of group education on sick lave,&#xD;
      health-related quality of life and disease severity among individuals with newly notified&#xD;
      OHE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial population consist of individuals from the Capital Region of Denmark and Region&#xD;
      Zealand with a suspected skin-related industrial injury notified to the Danish National Board&#xD;
      of Industrial Injuries (DNBII). Recruitment is started Juli 2012, and will continue until the&#xD;
      designed number of participants have been included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be assessed in a questionnaire at time T=0 with regard to: self&#xD;
      evaluated disease severity, health-related quality of life, skin protective behaviour,&#xD;
      knowledge of skin protection, self-efficacy, work-role function and if active in workforce.&#xD;
      The participants will then be randomised. The intervention group will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the educative course, and work place visits will be offered. In the&#xD;
      intervention group a telephone hot line will be available for further questions concerning&#xD;
      these topics. The control group will not have access to any of these interventions. Both&#xD;
      intervention group and control group will be contacted every eighth week about number of days&#xD;
      of sick leave/absence from workforce. Both groups are re-assessed using a questionnaire at&#xD;
      T=12 months. There will be a total of 742 included participants.&#xD;

      The hypotheses of the PREVEX trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early information build on evidence-based skin-protection programmes and work-place&#xD;
           visits with counselling in skin care, followed by telephone hotline, will give the&#xD;
           participants increased level of knowledge concerning the treatment and prevention of&#xD;
           OHE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased level of knowledge concerning prevention and focus on skin care will have a&#xD;
           positive impact on skin-protective behaviour and will lower the severity of HE and&#xD;
           prevent the development of chronic eczema.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The decrease in severity of HE will decrease sick leave and keep the participants in&#xD;
           job, or prevent job loss, or facilitate the re-entry into the workforce.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In total, the intervention will have a positive effect on health-related quality of&#xD;
           life.&#xD;

    <description>The following outcomes will be assessed as explorative, as there is insufficient information to conduct power calculations.&#xD;
Eczema-related sick leave; measured as self-reported number of days with eczema-related sick leave during the trial period.&#xD;
Absence registered by the DREAM-register; only absence for more than 28 days from workplace is registered here. This will be done at T=12 months. We will measure absence from work because of sick leave for more than 21 days , yes or no.&#xD;
Behaviour measured as number of points achieved in a questionnaire concerning both occupational and private risk behaviour at time T=12.&#xD;
Knowledge of skin protection measured as numbers of points achieved in a multiple choice questionnaire at time T=12 months.&#xD;
Performance management at time T=12 months of the participant measured by the number of points achieved in:&#xD;
Self-efficacy; and&#xD;
Self-evaluated ability to self-care.</description>
