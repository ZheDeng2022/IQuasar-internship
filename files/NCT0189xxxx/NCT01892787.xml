  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The airways in the lungs get smaller the further into the lungs they go. Most simple&#xD;
      measurements of lung function only reflect the larger 'central' airways and do not provide&#xD;
      information on the smaller 'peripheral' airways. Newer measurements have been developed that&#xD;
      can now give us accurate information on how the smaller airways are working. Indeed the small&#xD;
      airways seem to play a significant role in asthma in terms of inflammation and airway&#xD;
      narrowing. Recently, new types of inhaler formulations have been developed that have a much&#xD;
      smaller particle size than other standard formulations. These formulations have been shown to&#xD;
      go further into the lungs, thus getting into the smaller airways. In this study we aim to&#xD;
      compare the two extremes of available long acting beta agonists in terms of particle size&#xD;
      i.e. extra fine formoterol (Atimos) versus coarse particle salmeterol (Serevent)in asthmatics&#xD;
      with abnormal small airway function using a breathing test called impulse oscillometry. By&#xD;
      using this test we will be able to find out whether using an extrafine particle inhaler&#xD;
      improves small airway function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The small airways are gaining greater recognition for their role in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      persistent asthma and as a relevant target for asthma treatment(1). Pathological&#xD;
      abnormalities in the small airways have been demonstrated regardless of asthma severity and&#xD;
      seem to persist even in patients with stable asthma(2, 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, the small airways have been difficult to assess. Spirometry generally reflects&#xD;
      large airways function although the mean forced expiratory flow (FEF) between 25% and 75% of&#xD;
      FVC (FEF25-75) has been used to assess small airway obstruction.(4) More recently, impulse&#xD;
      oscillometry (IOS) has been used to assess the role of small airways in asthma(5). IOS is an&#xD;
      effort-independent test, using oscillation of differing sound waves to derive a variety of&#xD;
      output measurements determining both the degree of total and peripheral airway resistance.&#xD;
      Resistance at 5 Hz reflects total airway resistance and central airway resistance is&#xD;
      approximated using resistance at 20 Hz (R20). The peripheral or small airway component can&#xD;
      thus be evaluated by calculating the difference between these two measurements i.e. R5 - R20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have identified from our database of primary care referrals, a cohort of patients who&#xD;
      appear to have evidence of an unmet physiological need in terms of persistent small airways&#xD;
      dysfunction, on the basis of impairment of R5 and R5-R20 despite taking step 2/3/4 asthma&#xD;
      treatment(6). Approximately 32% of patients across steps 2/3/4 had severely abnormal values&#xD;
      for both R5-R20 (&gt;0.05 kPa/L.s) and R5 (&gt; 150%). Such small airway dysfunction at step 3/4&#xD;
      occurred despite patients being prescribed ICS with LABA, although there were no patients&#xD;
      being prescribed extra fine ICS/LABA or extra fine LABA (i.e. Fostair or Atimos). In terms of&#xD;
      the ICS moiety, observational data has shown that patients taking extra fine&#xD;
      HFA-beclometasone solution (Qvar) have equal or better control than those taking Fluticasone&#xD;
      suspension, while receiving a lower maintenance dose of ICS(7). In another study, patients&#xD;
      switched from beclometasone suspension to solution at half the dose had an improvement in&#xD;
      asthma quality of life. In neither of these studies was there any information available&#xD;
      regarding small airway dysfunction in order to explain the potential improvements with&#xD;
      HFA-beclometasone(8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a paucity of information on the potential benefits of extra fine formoterol on the&#xD;
      small airways. In a single dosing study comparing extra fine HFA versus coarse particle dry&#xD;
      powder formulations of formoterol, there was a 30% difference (absolute difference of 2.9&#xD;
      kPa/L.s.min)in R5 AUC0-60min and 63% difference (absolute difference of 2.4 kPa/L.s.min) in&#xD;
      R5-R20 AUC0-60min, although this was not the primary end point(9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 RATIONALE Thus, the primary objective for the present study is to compare the two&#xD;
      extremes of available long acting beta-agonist formulations - i.e. extra fine HFA formoterol&#xD;
      ( Atimos ) versus coarse particle DPI salmeterol (i.e. Serevent Accuhaler). If there turns&#xD;
      out to be a significant improvement in small airways function conferred by extra fine&#xD;
      formoterol, then this would in turn support the rationale for performing a further chronic&#xD;
      study to assess the clinical impact of treating persistent small airways dysfunction at step&#xD;
      3/4 by switching patients to Fostair HFA and comparing to Seretide DPI, in terms of improving&#xD;
      asthma control in patients with the small airway phenotype who are already taking&#xD;
      conventional ICS/LABA formulations. We will use impulse oscillometry to assess the small&#xD;
      airways response using the difference between resistance measured at 5Hz and 20Hz (R5-R20) as&#xD;
      the primary outcome. In this regard we have previously reported in asthmatic patients&#xD;
      receiving propranolol that there was a 104.1 % (95%CI 22.6-185.6%) worsening of R5-R20 in&#xD;
      terms of the bronchoconstrictor response to propranolol, and following subsequent histamine&#xD;
      challenge, there was a 115.6 % (95%CI 55.6-175.7% ) improvement in R5-R20 in terms of the&#xD;
      bronchodilator response to nebulised salbutamol.(10)&#xD;
