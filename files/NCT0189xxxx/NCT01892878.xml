      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate fusion of the facet joints in a prospective&#xD;
      cohort of patients utilizing the VerteLoc facet fixation device in patients receiving lumbar&#xD;
      laminectomy (L1-S1), without ancillary stabilization devices such as pedicle and transfacet&#xD;
      screws.&#xD;

      Study Design: Non-randomized, prospective, single arm clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population and Sample Size: Patients (n=25) from up to 2 clinical site, who have been&#xD;
      medically evaluated, found appropriate for, and have agreed to treatment by lumbar&#xD;
      decompressive laminectomy and facet fixation, including unilateral and/or bilateral&#xD;
      posterolateral fusion according to accepted medical standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the fusion status of facet joints following laminectomy and facet fixation&#xD;
           using the VerteLoc system in combination with unilateral and/or bilateral posterolateral&#xD;
           fusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subject success / Clinical outcome: Evaluate the reduction in baseline VAS back pain&#xD;
           score at 2-3 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Explore the effect of preoperative bone density on facet fusion status;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the ease of use of the VerteLoc system;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Record operative time using the VerteLoc system;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Monitor the occurrence of adverse events related or possibly related to the use of the&#xD;
           VerteLoc system;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Monitor the occurrence of subsequent surgical intervention at the target level(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Subject success/Clinical outcome (Assess additional improvement criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Evaluate Fusion rate in relations to DEXA value&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: Candidates must meet ALL of the following:&#xD;

        3. Are skeletally mature, and are at least 18 years of age;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If female, are not pregnant;&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. Require additional and/or other surgical technique and/or approach to the laminectomy at&#xD;
           the index level(s), which may in the opinion of the Primary Investigator confound&#xD;
           measurement of outcome variables;&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        8. BMI &gt;40% ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. History of tobacco smoking within the past 6 months;&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
       11. Are participating in any other clinical trial. Study Duration : 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
