  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research study is a cross-sectional study enrolling young children with sickle&#xD;
      cell disease between 5 and 12 years of age. They will be screened as outpatients for consent&#xD;
      to perform pulmonary function testing (PFT) and echocardiography. In addition, the degree of&#xD;
      bronchodilator response will be assessed at each session. To estimate presence of pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension, echocardiography will be performed at the time of PFT measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enroll children aged 5 to 12 years of age with sickle cell disease (HbSS, HbSC, HbS beta&#xD;
           plus thalassemia, HbS beta zero thalassemia, and HbS OArab) who are established patients&#xD;
           within the Duke Pediatric Sickle Cell Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perform a chart review of all enrolled subjects to obtain specific details regarding&#xD;
           birth history, nutritional status (weight, height), family history, sickle cell&#xD;
           genotype, parental smoking history, recent laboratory parameters, parental smoking&#xD;
           history, any concurrent conditions (atopy, asthma, airway anomaly), history of sickle&#xD;
           cell complications and prescribed medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perform spirometry and plethysmography with the administration of albuterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Before or after completion the PFT session, the patient will have echocardiography in&#xD;
           the PFT lab area&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Using medical record information, determine number of hospitalizations for any pulmonary&#xD;
           symptoms indicative of acute chest syndrome (ACS) (dyspnea, fever, wheezing, hypoxia,&#xD;
           cough, chest pain). In addition, we will track any respiratory or cardiac symptoms or&#xD;
           therapies for each subject 6 years after enrollment up to age 18 years using the&#xD;
           registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. As standard of care, refer any child identified as having lung disease or pulmonary&#xD;
           hypertension to a pediatric pulmonologist and/or cardiologist for monitoring, treatment&#xD;
           and ongoing care.&#xD;
