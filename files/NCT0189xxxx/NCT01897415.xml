      This is a Phase I safety and feasibility study. Subjects will be enrolled serially. For&#xD;
      subject safety, the preceding subject must have completed one cycle of therapy (28 days)&#xD;
      before the next subject can be treated. Subjects will be treated with i.v. administration of&#xD;
      1 to 3e8 per meter squared RNA CAR T cells three times weekly (M-W-F) for three weeks.&#xD;

      This phase I study is being conducted to establish safety and feasibility of intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      RNA mesothelin re-directed autologous T cell administration in patients with&#xD;
      chemotherapy-refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled serially. For subject safety, the preceding subject must have&#xD;
      completed therapy and be 28 days from their last infusion before the next subject can be&#xD;
      treated.. Subjects will be treated with IV administration of 1 to 3e8/m2 RNA CAR T cells&#xD;
      three times weekly (M-W-F) for three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main eligibility criteria: Subjects with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA)&#xD;
      who have chemotherapy-refractory disease. Inclusion criteria include patients older than 18&#xD;
      years of age diagnosed with metastatic PDA with ECOG 0-1 performance status and 3 month&#xD;
      expected survival. Exclusion criteria include a pericardial effusion, active autoimmune&#xD;
      disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy, active anti-coagulation therapy, known HIV or&#xD;
      HTLV I/II positivity, prior treatment with murine monoclonal antibodies or history of allergy&#xD;
      to murine proteins.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of metastatic disease and failure of at least 1 prior chemotherapy for&#xD;
             metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have measureable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Satisfactory organ and bone marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood coagulation parameters: PT such that international normalized ratio (INR) is&#xD;
             less than or equal to 1.5 (or an in-range INR, usually between 2 and 3, if a subject&#xD;
             is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin for management of venous thrombosis&#xD;
             including pulmonary thromboembolus) and a PTT less than or equal to 1.2 time the upper&#xD;
             limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have adequate venous peripheral access for apheresis. Patients must also&#xD;
             have adequate venous access for subsequent modified CAR T cell administration which&#xD;
             can be done through a central venous access (e.g. port for systemic chemotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Short-term therapy for acute conditions not specifically related to pancreatic cancer&#xD;
             is allowed if such therapy does not include immune modulating agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and Female subjects agree to use approved contraceptive methods (e.g. birth&#xD;
             control pills, barrier device, intrauterine device, abstinence) during the study and&#xD;
             for 3 months following the last dose of the study cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must understand and sign the study-specific informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participated in any other trial in which receipt of an investigational study drug&#xD;
             occurred within 28 days (42 days for non-murine monoclonal antibodies) prior to entry&#xD;
             into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received any anticancer medication in the 2 weeks (i.e. 14 days) prior to receiving&#xD;
             their first dose of study treatment and no other concurrent chemotherapy or&#xD;
             immunotherapy (e.g. monoclonal antibodies)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active invasive cancer other than pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patients with active&#xD;
             non-invasive cancers (such as non-melanoma skin cancer, superficial cervical and&#xD;
             bladder and prostate cancer with PSA level less than 1.0) are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV, HCV, and HBV positive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease (including but not limited to: systemic lupus&#xD;
             erythromatosis, Sjogrens syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple&#xD;
             sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.) requiring immunosuppressive therapy&#xD;
             within the past 4 weeks, with exception of thyroid replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with ongoing or active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned concurrent treatment with systemic high dose corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior gene therapy or therapy with murine monoclonal antibodies or products of murine&#xD;
             origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent treatment with any anticancer agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to murine proteins&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum&#xD;
             albumin, DMSO, and Dextran 40)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant pericardial effusion; CHF (NY Heart Association Grade&#xD;
             II-IV) or cardiovascular condition that would preclude assessment of mesothelin&#xD;
             induced pericarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects on active anti-coagulation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because autologous transduced T cells may&#xD;
             have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants, secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with autologous transduced T cells, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Feasibility assessment demonstrates less than 20% transfection of target lymphocytes&#xD;
             or insufficient expansion of modified CAR T cells to complete 9 infusions.&#xD;
