  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dumping Syndrome consists of (1) a too rapid gastric emptying, (2) an inappropriate release&#xD;
      of GI hormones (as a reaction to the hyperosmolar contents in the duodenum) and (3) an&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic response to a too rapid absorption of glucose. Because it is not well known&#xD;
      which somatostatin receptor(s) (sst1-5) influence(s) Dumping Syndrome most, the goal of this&#xD;
      trial is to evaluate :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the effect of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) on the control of gastric emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the effect of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) on the release of GI hormones (during&#xD;
           OGTT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the effect of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) on the hyperinsulimic response (during&#xD;
           OGTT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the efficacy of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) for control of objective parameters&#xD;
           of Dumping Syndrome (hematocrit (Hct), pulse rate and occurrence of hypoglycemia after&#xD;
           an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) with 75g of glucose)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the efficacy of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) for control of overall symptoms as&#xD;
           measured by the combined Dumping Syndrome score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the efficacy of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) for control of symptoms as measured&#xD;
           by (a) early and (b) late phase dumping symptom score separately&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the efficacy of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) for control of quality of life (QoL&#xD;
           SF-36)&#xD;

      This will be a single centre, randomized, double-blind, controlled cross-over study during 35&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 4 weeks screening period, patients who fulfill the entrance criteria will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned on a 1:1 basis to either the pasireotide treatment arm or to the placebo treatment&#xD;
      arm. They will be treated with pasireotide sc or placebo sc for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks,&#xD;
      patients will be switched to the other treatment arm after a 7 days wash out period. This&#xD;
      phase is double-blind: both the patient and investigator will be blinded to treatment&#xD;
      assignment.&#xD;

    <description>The dumping score is the sum of the early and late dumping symptoms. Early dumping starts immediately after a meal, within 1 hour (&lt; 1 hour). Late dumping starts later than 1 hour after a meal (≥ 1 hour). In case a symptom starts immediately after a meal and lasts longer than 1 hour, the score for early AND late dumping should be ticked.&#xD;
