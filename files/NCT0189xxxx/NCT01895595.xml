      Guided imagery, a mind-body complementary/alternative treatment modality, offers promise to&#xD;
      reduce stress and promote lifestyle behavior change to reduce diabetes and heart disease risk&#xD;
      in obese Latino adolescents. The overall purpose of this study was to determine whether&#xD;
      guided imagery, could reduce diabetes risk in obese Latino adolescents undergoing a lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention. The specific objectives were: 1) To pilot test a new 12-week lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention in obese Latino adolescents, in order to determine the effects of the mind-body&#xD;
      technique of Interactive Guided ImagerySM, over and above those of healthy lifestyle&#xD;
      education, on eating and physical activity behaviors, stress and stress biomarkers, and&#xD;
      hormonal markers of diabetes risk; and 2) To explore the way that changes in stress produced&#xD;
      by the intervention were associated with changes in hormonal markers of diabetes risk,&#xD;
      particularly insulin resistance. The investigators hypothesized that participants who&#xD;
      received guided imagery program in addition to the healthy lifestyle education would show&#xD;
      greater improvements in insulin resistance, physical activity, dietary intake, and stress,&#xD;
      than those receiving the healthy lifestyle education without the guided imagery. The&#xD;
      investigators further hypothesized that reductions in stress due to the intervention would be&#xD;
      associated with improvements in insulin resistance, a major hormonal marker of diabetes risk.&#xD;
      For this study, obese, Latino adolescents (age 14-17) were randomized to receive either 12&#xD;
      weekly sessions of the lifestyle education plus guided imagery program, or lifestyle&#xD;
      education plus a digital storytelling computer program (as a control). Outcome measures were&#xD;
      assessed before and after the 12-week intervention, comparing the differences between the&#xD;
      intervention groups behavioral (eating and physical activity behaviors), biological (insulin&#xD;
      resistance and stress hormones), and psychological (stress) outcomes.&#xD;

      The current proposal pilot tests the investigators' guided imagery intervention in a limited&#xD;
      sample of subjects in order to refine the intervention (Study 1) and then proceeds to test&#xD;
      the intervention in a controlled, randomized trial (Study 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1: Pilot test and refinement of guided imagery program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To pilot, evaluate, and complete development of a guided imagery intervention&#xD;
      program based on stress reduction and improving lifestyle behaviors for use with overweight&#xD;
      Latino adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Objectives: Findings from Study 1 will permit us to test the intervention via a&#xD;
      controlled, randomized trial in Study 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The guided imagery intervention program will be combined with a lifestyle&#xD;
      education program and will be piloted, one module weekly for 12 weeks, in 8 overweight Latino&#xD;
      adolescents (4 males, 4 females). Upon completion of the pilot intervention, participants&#xD;
      will participate in an idea-building session about their experiences with the program, in&#xD;
      order to develop ideas to add to or modify the program. Participants will discuss the&#xD;
      acceptability, cultural relevance, developmental appropriateness and obstacles to efficacy&#xD;
      and delivery of the program. The information from these sessions will be analyzed in order to&#xD;
      improve the intervention's developmental and cultural relevance and appeal. Analyses of the&#xD;
      idea-building data will be similar to analyses used for focus group data, including&#xD;
      recording, transcription, and examination of the data for emergent themes. Based on&#xD;
      information obtained during the pilot study and from the idea-building sessions, the program&#xD;
      will be modified for the intervention study, Study 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2: Clinical trial of guided imagery program intervention Specific Aim 2 : To conduct a&#xD;
      randomized and controlled trial to test the direct and mediated effects of adding a guided&#xD;
      imagery intervention program to a lifestyle education program. Major outcomes will include&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, psychosocial measures, and dietary and physical activity behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The addition of a guided imagery intervention program to a lifestyle education program&#xD;
           will be more effective than the lifestyle education program alone in increasing insulin&#xD;
           sensitivity (independent of body fat), improving body composition, reducing stress&#xD;
           hormone (cortisol) secretion, and decreasing cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The addition of a guided imagery intervention program will be more effective than the&#xD;
           lifestyle education alone in improving health-promoting dietary and physical activity&#xD;
           behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The guided imagery intervention program will change behavior and physiology through&#xD;
           lowering stress and through changing the meanings of dietary and physical activity&#xD;
           behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This study is a 12-week randomized, controlled clinical trial. After collection&#xD;
      of baseline psychosocial, behavioral, and metabolic outcome measurements, participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to either &quot;Treatment Group&quot; with guided imagery program + lifestyle&#xD;
      education (n = 20), or &quot;Control Group&quot; with the same lifestyle education + digital&#xD;
      storytelling program to ensure equal contact time (n = 20). At the end of the 12-week&#xD;
      treatment period, all baseline measures will be repeated, and differences in outcome&#xD;
      variables between groups will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: see below&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: see below&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Recruitment: Clinic-based recruitment, past lists of potential recruits from our&#xD;
      prior studies, referrals from hospital, local health fairs, and extensive word of mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12-Week Intervention Participants will be randomized to treatment group (lifestyle program&#xD;
      plus guided imagery, n=20) or control group (lifestyle program alone, n=20), stratified by&#xD;
      sex in order to ensure equal numbers of girls and boys in each study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control and Treatment (guided imagery) interventions will be delivered in weekly, 1.5 hour&#xD;
      sessions over a 12-week period in the late afternoon after school. Each session will begin&#xD;
      with a 45-minute lifestyle education component delivered in groups of 4-8 subjects, followed&#xD;
      immediately by an individual 45 minute guided imagery module for each subject in the&#xD;
      Treatment Group, or an individual 45 minute Digital Storytelling module for each subject in&#xD;
      the Control Group, in order to ensure equal contact time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lifestyle education program curriculum consists of 12 weekly modules focused on decreased&#xD;
      intake of added sugars and increased intake of whole grains and fiber in the diet, combined&#xD;
      with the non-dieting philosophy of intuitive eating. Educational content relating to&#xD;
      principals of healthy nutrition and physically active lifestyle contained within the proposed&#xD;
      lifestyle education curriculum are fully consistent with expert committee recommendations for&#xD;
      obesity intervention in adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guided imagery program curriculum consists of 12 weekly, one-on-one imagery modules based&#xD;
      on 2 major underlying theoretical principles: 1) relaxation/stress reduction imagery; and 2)&#xD;
      imagery designed to improve eating and physical activity behaviors. The protocol of each&#xD;
      one-on-one imagery module will follow the standard procedures of Interactive Guided&#xD;
      ImagerySM, consisting of 3 essential aspects: 1) foresight (identification of the issue to be&#xD;
      addressed in imagery); 2) insight (the facilitated imagery experience itself); 3) hindsight&#xD;
      (discussion and integration of the imagery experience).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The digital storytelling program curriculum, to control for contact time with research staff,&#xD;
      consists of 12 weekly 45-minute modules delivered one-on-one immediately following the&#xD;
      lifestyle education class each week. Subjects will learn to create and edit their own short&#xD;
      films by writing a script, gathering media (images and music), and editing the complete&#xD;
      product. The subjects will be free to choose their own topic for their project, excluding&#xD;
      topics relating to obesity or health behaviors.&#xD;
