  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this province, optometrists are often responsible for contacting the retinal specialists'&#xD;
      office to arrange patients to be examined for suspected emergencies or more routine referrals&#xD;
      related to the eye. This is often done by faxing a referral form to the specialists' office,&#xD;
      where the retinal specialist will examine the information presented in the referral form and&#xD;
      make a decision on when the patient should be seen. This current method has some important&#xD;
      considerations, such as the difficulty of transmitting clear images of the back of the eye&#xD;
      over fax. Having this information could help the retinal specialist in determining when the&#xD;
      patient should be seen, especially in terms of booking additional tests or when treatment&#xD;
      should be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teleophthalmology is a branch of telemedicine that delivers eye care through digital&#xD;
      equipment and telecommunications technology. It offers some unique advantages, such as the&#xD;
      ability to be integrated with electronic health records, the ability to be viewed by multiple&#xD;
      members of the health care team, and potentially reduce wait times and travel times to the&#xD;
      ophthalmologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is no comparison known to the study team between whether patients being&#xD;
      referred from optometrists to retina specialists through a teleophthalmology system will be&#xD;
      treated earlier than patients through a conventional fax system. This study aims to examine&#xD;
      and provide more information on this topic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within the province of Ontario, there are a limited number of retinal specialists for a large&#xD;
      and geographically diverse population of 13.5 million people in 2012. Because the majority of&#xD;
      these specialists are located in larger urban centers, many rural patients have difficulty&#xD;
      travelling the significant distance from their communities to the city. Currently in Ontario&#xD;
      optometrists are responsible for triaging retinal eye diseases; emergency referrals such as&#xD;
      endophthalmitis are organized by same-day telephone consultations, while more routine&#xD;
      referrals are scheduled by fax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current method of triage has particular important considerations. Because of the limited&#xD;
      number of retinal specialists long wait times can lead to permanent vision loss if the&#xD;
      referral is inaccurate, where the patient should have been seen and treated sooner instead of&#xD;
      later such as the case of wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) and Diabetic Macular&#xD;
      Edema (DME). In addition, essential vision tests such as fluorescein angiography (FA) are&#xD;
      often available only in a hospital setting rather within physician or optometrists' office.&#xD;
      For patients from rural or remote communities, this inconvenience could result in lost wages,&#xD;
      a long return trip back the next day or even an overnight stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teleophthalmology is a branch of telemedicine that delivers eye care through digital&#xD;
      equipment and telecommunications technology. It offers some unique advantages, such as the&#xD;
      ability to be integrated with electronic health records, the ability to be viewed by multiple&#xD;
      members of the health care team, and potentially reduce wait times and travel times to the&#xD;
      ophthalmologist. Within Canada, there have been different teleophthalmology initiatives to&#xD;
      provide access to specialists to optometrists and primary care practitioners particularly in&#xD;
      rural and remote areas, improving ophthalmologic care and reducing unnecessary patient travel&#xD;
      expenditures. These teleophthalmology systems can include fundus and Optical Coherence&#xD;
      Tomography (OCT) images to aid the ophthalmologist in more accurately diagnosing and triaging&#xD;
      the referral. Hanson et al. in a retrospective case series noted that tele-referrals to&#xD;
      retinal specialists from optometrists reduced average travel time, travel distance and the&#xD;
      number of office visits to retina specialists while improving efficiency of clinical&#xD;
      examination, testing, and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there currently is no research known to the study team that actively compares the&#xD;
      time to treatment for patients based on teleophthalmology referral and assessment versus a&#xD;
      conventional paper referral system from optometrists to retinal specialists. For conditions&#xD;
      like wAMD and DME related to Diabetic Retinopathy that are often referred via&#xD;
      teleophthalmology, the difference in time to treatment could prevent vision loss. The&#xD;
      inclusion of fundus and OCT images in teleophthalmology could also improve triage accuracy&#xD;
      and prioritization of referrals and appointments to the retinal specialist. This study&#xD;
      focuses on comparing the time to treatment for a tele-retinal referral system to a paper&#xD;
      referral system by focusing on two prevalent retinal conditions: wet AMD and DME. The results&#xD;
      could demonstrate that tele-ophthalmology can reduce the time to treatment for patients with&#xD;
      wet AMD and DME in Ontario, improving access to retinal specialists and allowing for more&#xD;
      efficient triage of patients.&#xD;
