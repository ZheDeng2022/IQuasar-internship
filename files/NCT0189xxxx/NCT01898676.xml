      A study in stable epilepsy patients comparing levels of valproic acid after administration of&#xD;
      brand and generic divalproex sodium extended release tablets.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study consists of a screening visit, four treatment periods and a final follow-up visit. Each&#xD;
      treatment period consists of a four night in-house stay followed by two outpatient visits.&#xD;
      Each treatment period will be separated by a washout period. During each treatment period,&#xD;
      safety evaluations will include vital signs, physical exams, safety laboratory tests, weight&#xD;
      measurement, electrocardiograms, adverse event collection and concomitant medication&#xD;
      recording. Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected during each treatment period.&#xD;
      Seizure activity will be recorded in a seizure diary during the study. A standardized&#xD;
      high-fat, high-calorie meal will be served prior to each dose during each treatment period.&#xD;

    <description>This is an open-label, randomized, two-sequence, two-treatment, single dose, four-period, fully replicated crossover study in which 16 subjects will receive one of the two study drugs, Depakote ER or a generic equivalent, during each treatment period. Subjects will be patients with epilepsy who are otherwise healthy and who are stable on anti-epileptic therapy, not including any formulation of divalproex sodium.</description>
