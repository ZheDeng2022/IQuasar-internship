    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that twice overnight high-dose&#xD;
      rosuvastatin loading before RNA followed by 3-month treatment with regular doses of&#xD;
      rosuvastatin can reduce both the acute and late renal artery damage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the availability and use of different classes of antihypertensive drugs, 5-30% of&#xD;
      patients still show elevated blood pressure (EUROASPIRE III survey, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a novel catheter-based radiofrequency ablation technique has been developed&#xD;
      allowing for renal nerve ablation (RNA). Currently, two different catheter-based systems are&#xD;
      primarily used (Simplicityw catheter by Medtronic-Adrian and the EnligHTNTM multi-electrode&#xD;
      RNA catheter from St Jude Medical).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RNA technique has been associated with a very low complication rate, but the development&#xD;
      of a renal artery stenosis after RNA has been reported (J Am Coll Cardiol 2012;60:2694-2695).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although little is known about the vascular injury induced by the RNA procedure at the site&#xD;
      of ablation, a recent study has reported for the first time the evidence at optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT) of local vascular injury induced by the radiofrequency energy. Such local&#xD;
      tissue damage, which is not apparent with angiography, is characterized by local and diffuse&#xD;
      vasospasm, oedema formation, and endothelial injury with thrombus generation (Templin et al.&#xD;
      Eur Heart J, 25 April 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental research have suggested that these abnormalities are only present in the acute&#xD;
      phase immediately after RNA and seem to be the consequence of a transient phenomenon of&#xD;
      inflammation (Clin Res Cardiol 2011;100:1095-1101), similarly to what occurs in the coronary&#xD;
      arteries after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last decade, multiple studies have convincingly shown that the pre-procedural&#xD;
      administration of statins can significantly reduce the extent of cardiac damage at time of&#xD;
      PCI (Patti et al, JACC 2011). No previous investigation, however, has assessed whether&#xD;
      pre-procedural statin load play any protective role on renal arteries at time of RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Patients with resistant arterial hypertension scheduled to undergo renal&#xD;
      artery ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Patients will be randomized to receive two overnight high doses of Rosuvastatin&#xD;
      (40 mg 12 h before RNA and another 10 mg dose 2 h before the procedure, N=50) or placebo&#xD;
      (N=50).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Patients will be randomized to receive two overnight high doses of Rosuvastatin&#xD;
      (40 mg 12 h before RNA and another 10 mg 2 hours prior to the procedure, N=56) or placebo&#xD;
      (N=56).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA will be performed with two different catheter-based systems (Simplicityw catheter by&#xD;
      Medtronic-Adrian and the EnligHTNTM multi-electrode RNA catheter from St Jude Medical).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have OCT utilizing the C7-XR imaging system (Light-Lab Imaging, Inc.,&#xD;
      Westford, USA) before and after renal denervation of both renal arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure, patients included in the Rosuvastatin-group will be given rosuvastatin&#xD;
      10 mg/day for 3 months and patients included in the Placebo-group will receive placebo 1&#xD;
      pill/day for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At end of the 3-month follow-up period, patients will undergo repeat OCT of both renal&#xD;
      arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size If we expect an incidence of 50% for each of the three primary endpoints&#xD;
      (vasospasm, oedema or thrombus) in the control arm and hypothesize a 50% risk reduction of&#xD;
      such incidence in the rosuvastatin arm, a total sample size of 112 patients would provide 80%&#xD;
      power to detect this difference with an alpha level of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the trial: 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary End-point&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography evidence of vascular injury induced by the radiofrequency&#xD;
      energy, as detected by the evidence of at least one of the following 3 abnormalities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence (vs. absence) of local and diffuse vasospasm (i.e. as defined by immediate loss&#xD;
           of lumen area or lumen diameter in any part of renal artery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence (vs.r absence) of oedema formation (i.e. as defined as any significant&#xD;
           endothelial-intimal notch detected on the luminal wall surface)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence (vs. absence) of endothelial injury (i.e. disruptions of the superficial&#xD;
           intimal lining defined as endothelial detachments or vessel dissections) with thrombus&#xD;
           generation (i.e. as a protruding mass attached to the luminal surface with a diameter of&#xD;
           0.5 mm in at least three following cross-sections)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary End-points&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of the extent of vascular injury between the two catheter-based systems used&#xD;
           for the study (EnligHTNTM vs. Simplicityw)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison vs. baseline of 24-hour and 48-hour post-procedural changes in CRP,&#xD;
           creatinine. eGFR (as expressed in ml/min/1.73 m2), urine albumin:creatinine ratio, and&#xD;
           absolute values of NGAL (Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected findings According to a previous preliminary experience with optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (Templin et al. Eur Heart J, 25 April 2012), the expected frequency of vascular&#xD;
      injury in statin-na√Øve patients is 42% for vasospasm, 96% for oedema, and 67% for thrombus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect a reduction of at least 25% in the frequency of abnormalities with pre-treatment&#xD;
      with rosuvastatin.&#xD;
