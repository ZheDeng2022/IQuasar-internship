    <textblock>
      A mother of a preterm infant listening to music while pumping her breasts will produce more&#xD;
      milk than a similar mother who is not listening to music. A mother listening to live music&#xD;
      will produce more milk than a mother listening to recorded music&#xD;

      1. Purpose of the study. The purpose of this study is to determine whether listening to music&#xD;
      under three conditions: (1) when a music practitioner is playing background harp music, (2)&#xD;
      when a CD is playing exactly the same background harp music, or (3) when no background music&#xD;
      is being played will have an effect on the flow, lipid (fat), or the sodium content of breast&#xD;
      milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY HYPOTHESES: (1) A primiparous mother of a preterm infant listening to music while&#xD;
      pumping her breasts will produce more milk than a similar mother who is not listening to&#xD;
      music. (2) A mother listening to live music will produce more milk than a mother listening to&#xD;
      recorded music.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY HYPOTHESIS: (1) The milk of a mother listening to music while pumping her breasts&#xD;
      will have higher lipid content and lower sodium content than a mother who is not listening to&#xD;
      music.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: This pilot study will investigate the feasibility of measuring the amount&#xD;
      of breast milk produced by mothers who are pumping breast milk for their preterm infant under&#xD;
      one of three conditions: (1) when a music practitioner is playing background harp music, (2)&#xD;
      when a CD is playing exactly the same background harp music, or (3) when no background music&#xD;
      is being played.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESEARCH POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of Subjects. There will be a total number of 40 mothers participating in this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gender of Subjects. All subjects will be female. Men cannot express breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age of Subjects. Mothers will be between the ages of 18 and 45. Mothers under the age of&#xD;
           18 are excluded because they are minors. Ages 18 to 45 are the typical ages that women&#xD;
           give birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Racial and Ethnic Origin. The racial and ethnic distribution of the subjects are&#xD;
           expected to reflect the general population of mothers between the ages of 18 and 45 who&#xD;
           deliver preterm infants at Strong Memorial Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Inclusion Criteria. First time mothers between the ages of 18 and 45 who have had a&#xD;
           vaginal or caesarean delivery and are feeling well. First time mothers are used to avoid&#xD;
           confounding variables due to previous positive or negative experiences from expressing&#xD;
           milk. Their infant will have been born at less than 32.0 weeks of gestation. Mothers&#xD;
           will intend to breastfeed and are planning to pump milk on site in the NICU at least&#xD;
           once/day and will be recruited 7-10 days postpartum. Mothers who smoke, are taking&#xD;
           medication that may interfere with breastfeeding, and who have undergone prior breast&#xD;
           surgery will not be excluded since they are their own control. With regard to language,&#xD;
           mothers must be able to understand the directions and sign a consent form in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Exclusion Criteria. Mothers will not be recruited whose infant has a low likelihood of&#xD;
           survival as determined by the attending physician. Mothers who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
           mastitis will not be recruited for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Vulnerable Subjects. No vulnerable subjects will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. METHODS AND PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Methods and Procedures. : After a mother has agreed to participate, she will complete&#xD;
           the informed consent process and then complete the baseline questionnaire (pre-session&#xD;
           1).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Only one breast pumping session will be assessed on a given day. All remaining breast&#xD;
           pumping sessions on any given day conducted by the mother per her daily routine will not&#xD;
           be a part of the study and no data will be collected at those times.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Session 1 (Orientation): The mother will arrive at the pumping room and get&#xD;
           comfortably settled. The mother will be asked to turn off all electronic equipment (cell&#xD;
           phone, iPod). Reading material such as Good Housekeeping, Better Homes and Gardens, and&#xD;
           Parents magazines will be available for her use if she wishes. She will attach one or&#xD;
           both breasts to the Symphony Breast pump by Medela that is in standard usage in the&#xD;
           NICU. (Note: Mother will decide if she will pump one or both breasts at a time. Whatever&#xD;
           condition she chooses will remain the same throughout all study sessions.) Recorded&#xD;
           music will be played for this session. While the breast pump is being applied, a third&#xD;
           female person will enter the room and remain behind a privacy screen. This third person&#xD;
           will either be a research assistant, physician, or nurse who will be trained in patient&#xD;
           confidentiality and the rights of research subjects. When the breast pump is applied,&#xD;
           the third person will start the recorded music. She will have no communication with the&#xD;
           mother or the research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The mother will then pump her breast(s) into an 80 cc volufeed container. The research&#xD;
           assistant will sit behind the mother facing away from the mother while the mother is&#xD;
           pumping and will time the pumping for 15 minutes. The amount of milk produced during the&#xD;
           15 minute period will be measured and recorded by the research assistant. To ensure that&#xD;
           the mother can meet her baby's needs, a 2 cc aliquot will only be taken if 10 cc has&#xD;
           been produced in 15 minutes; and if including the current pumping session, there is&#xD;
           sufficient milk for 24 hours of infant feeding. If the previous two conditions are met,&#xD;
           a lactation consultant or the mother's nurse will remove a 2 cc aliquot at the end of&#xD;
           the session. The 2 cc aliquot will be frozen for future analysis. If the previous two&#xD;
           conditions are not met, a 2 cc aliquot will not be taken and this will be noted on the&#xD;
           data collection sheet. The remaining milk will be combined with any additional milk the&#xD;
           mother may produce during the remainder of the pumping session. She will label and store&#xD;
           the milk for later use by her infant according to her usual routine. When the mother&#xD;
           tells the research assistant that she has completed pumping, the third person will&#xD;
           quietly leave the room.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The mother will then be randomized to receive each of the three experimental conditions&#xD;
           (live music, recorded music, and no music) in random order over the course of three&#xD;
           pumping sessions. She will then experience all three conditions again in random order (a&#xD;
           three-block pattern randomized twice.) Study Sessions 2-7: The mother will arrive at the&#xD;
           pumping room and become comfortably settled. The mother will be asked to turn off all&#xD;
           electronic equipment (cell phone, iPod). Reading material such as Good Housekeeping,&#xD;
           Better Homes and Gardens, and Parents magazines will be available for her use if she&#xD;
           wishes. She will attach one or both breasts to the Symphony Breast pump by Medela that&#xD;
           is in standard use in the NICU. (Note: Mother will decide if she will pump one or both&#xD;
           breasts at a time. Whatever condition she chooses will remain the same throughout all&#xD;
           study sessions.) The mother will not be told whether live, recorded, or no music is&#xD;
           played during her session. While the breast pump is being applied, a third female person&#xD;
           will enter the room and remain behind a privacy screen. If live music is played, this&#xD;
           third person will be the musician. In order to provide the same conditions even when&#xD;
           music is not played, a third female will still enter the room and remain behind the&#xD;
           privacy screen. She will have no communication with the mother or the research&#xD;
           assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At that point, either live music, recorded music, or no music will be played. When music&#xD;
           is played, the same music will be played at each session. The mother will pump her&#xD;
           breast(s) into an 80 cc volufeed container. The research assistant will sit behind the&#xD;
           mother facing away from the mother while the mother is pumping and will time the pumping&#xD;
           for 15 minutes. The amount of milk produced during the 15-minute period will be measured&#xD;
           and recorded by the research assistant on a data collection sheet. To ensure that the&#xD;
           mother can meet her baby's needs, a 2 cc aliquot will be taken only if 10 cc has been&#xD;
           produced in 15 minutes; and if including the current pumping session, there is&#xD;
           sufficient milk for 24 hours of infant feeding . If the previous two conditions are met,&#xD;
           a lactation consultant or the mother's nurse will remove a 2 cc aliquot at the end of&#xD;
           the session. The 2 cc aliquot will be frozen for future analysis. If the previous two&#xD;
           conditions are not met, a 2cc aliquot will not be taken and this will be noted on the&#xD;
           data collection sheet. The remaining milk will be combined with any additional milk the&#xD;
           mother may produce during the remainder of the pumping session. She will label and store&#xD;
           the milk for later use by her infant according to her usual routine. When the mother&#xD;
           tells the research assistant that she has completed pumping, the third person will stop&#xD;
           playing, turn off the player, and/or simply quietly leave the room.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ASSESSMENTS (attached): Mothers will complete a Pre-session 1 (orientation)&#xD;
           questionnaire that will provide general demographic information as well as information&#xD;
           about mother's reasons for and plans for the duration of breastfeeding. The research&#xD;
           assistant will complete a questionnaire with the mother's assistance as appropriate&#xD;
           after each subsequent session (2-7). Assessments session 2-7 inquire about the session&#xD;
           as well as the mother's emotional state. The mother will complete a final questionnaire&#xD;
           after session 7 regarding her experiences with live music, recorded music, and quiet&#xD;
           while pumping her breasts. The fat content and sodium content of all breast milk samples&#xD;
           obtained during sessions 2-7 will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data Analysis and Monitoring. The mother will serve as her own control. Milk produced&#xD;
           over 15 minutes will be measured during each session and the amount of milk produced&#xD;
           during the two sessions under identical conditions will be averaged. The primary outcome&#xD;
           will be the differences in the amount of milk produced by the mother under each of the&#xD;
           three conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will use 40 subjects, with each subject being her own control. This sample size will&#xD;
           allow us to detect an effect size of 0.5, assuming a paired t-test and a&#xD;
           Bonferroni-corrected p value of 0.025 (to account for two primary comparisons). We will&#xD;
           use factorial repeated measures ANOVA - &quot;condition&quot; (live music, recorded music, no&#xD;
           music) as the main effect to be examined. We will run contrasts to examine the two&#xD;
           hypotheses. Since each mother will act as her own control, we will be examining&#xD;
           within-subject differences. Thus, infant age, weight, and medical condition will be&#xD;
           internally controlled and will not be included in the analyses. However, variables such&#xD;
           as the mother's emotional and physical condition and time since last pumping, which&#xD;
           could change day-to-day, could be included in our modeling, if there is significant&#xD;
           within-subject variance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sodium content of the milk will be measured using standard clinical laboratory&#xD;
           procedures. Lipid (fat) content of milk will be measured using the creamatocrit (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data Storage and Confidentiality. Data will be entered into a password-protected&#xD;
           encrypted electronic database accessible only to study personnel. All print/paper forms&#xD;
           will be kept in a locked filed in a locked office in a limited accessibility suite.&#xD;
