      Adequate exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA) is associated with better outcomes in kidney&#xD;
      transplantation. This study evaluated repeated, MPA pharmacokinetics (MPA-PK) according to&#xD;
      post-transplant time-points and concomitant CNIs. Fifty-two patients, 33 allocated to&#xD;
      tacrolimus (TCL) and 19 to CyA (all with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and steroids), had the&#xD;
      full MPA area under the time-concentration curve (AUC0-12hrs) repeatedly evaluated at days 7,&#xD;
      14, 30, 60 and 180 post-transplant. MMF daily dose was lower in TCL group as per protocol.&#xD;
      Dose-adjusted MPA-AUC0-12hrs progressively increased throughout the study period in both&#xD;
      groups but profiles were different according to the CNI regimen and time. The majority of&#xD;
      patients were underexposed to MPA on day 7 for both groups what reinforces the need of a&#xD;
      higher dose in the first week. Dose-adjusted MPA-AUC0-12hrs was higher in TCL group, after&#xD;
      day 7, due to both a diminished MPA clearance (for both groups) and higher AUC4-12hrs in the&#xD;
      TCL group. There was a progressive overexposure to MPA in order that at day 180, 21-30% of&#xD;
      the patients were overexposed to MPA what indicates a time for MPA monitoring and dose&#xD;
      correction for long-term follow-up. These PK data suggest that changes in MPA profile occur&#xD;
      according to time and CNIs used and suggests that MPA monitoring may be mandatory at specific&#xD;
      time-points.&#xD;
