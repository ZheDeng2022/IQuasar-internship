    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a leading cause of death in trauma patients. Based on&#xD;
      the EAST Management Guidelines for the prevention of VTE in trauma patients, a number of&#xD;
      research questions could be addressed by a thorough current literature review combined with a&#xD;
      multicenter concurrent analysis. This proposal seeks to create a data registry of trauma&#xD;
      patients from multiple trauma centers around the United States that will serve as a platform&#xD;
      for the study of VTE.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The VTE related research questions, identified by the EAST Management Guidelines as needing&#xD;
      further study, are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. While numerous risk factors for VTE have been identified and reported, there are only 2&#xD;
           that have Level 1 evidence to support them-spine fracture and spinal cord injury. Many&#xD;
           of the other reported risk factors were identified in studies that did not have&#xD;
           protocols for surveillance, reported only on patients with symptoms, or used data from&#xD;
           large administrative databases such as the National Trauma Data Bank4. It has also been&#xD;
           shown that the frequency of diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) increases when&#xD;
           more duplex imaging of the extremities is undertaken5. Thus, if an aggressive concurrent&#xD;
           surveillance program for DVT and aggressive work up of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE)&#xD;
           is undertaken:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Are there unknown or under-reported risk factors?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Is there a hierarchy of risk among the factors? For example, is a long bone&#xD;
                fracture associated with a higher incidence of VTE than a closed head injury?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Do all closed head injuries with an AIS&gt;3 have the same degree of risk or is an&#xD;
                epidural hematoma more risky than a subdural hematoma?&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. What constitutes high and very high risk?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the comparative efficacy and value6 of unfractionated heparin (UH), low&#xD;
           molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI) with or without&#xD;
           associated mechanical prophylaxis (MP) in preventing VTE in trauma patients? In&#xD;
           examining this question, the morbidity of these agents must be carefully determined,&#xD;
           particularly with respect to intracranial injury and intra-abdominal solid viscus&#xD;
           injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In trauma patients who develop VTE what is the best treatment and for how long?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Should all trauma patients who develop proximal deep venous thrombosis (pDVT) undergo a&#xD;
           workup for thrombophilia or should this be based up the degree of &quot;inverse risk&quot;&#xD;
           (inverse risk meaning a patient with a minor injury, who is thought to be at low risk,&#xD;
           who develops pDVT)? Similarly, should trauma patients who develop pulmonary embolism&#xD;
           (PE) undergo a workup for thrombophilia or should this be based up the degree of&#xD;
           &quot;inverse risk&quot; [question 4 adds importance to answering questions 1a and 1b]?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A recent meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that prophylactic inferior vena&#xD;
           cava filters (PICVF) significantly reduce the risk of PE (OR: 0.09-0.49)7. The authors&#xD;
           of the meta-analysis point out a number of methodological flaws with the studies&#xD;
           selected for the analysis. Most importantly, all were retrospective studies with&#xD;
           historical controls and the use of pharmacologic prophylaxis was not uniform among the&#xD;
           studies evaluated. Despite this report, there is continued significant practice&#xD;
           variation in the use of PIVCF and the role of PIVCF in the care of trauma patients&#xD;
           remains at question. Thus, if an aggressive concurrent surveillance program for DVT and&#xD;
           aggressive work up of suspected PE is undertaken:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Are all patients perceived to be at high risk for VTE who also have a relative or&#xD;
                absolute contraindication to pharmacologic prophylaxis receiving a PIVCF?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Do PIVCF reduce the risk of PE in trauma patients in whom risk adjustment has been&#xD;
                done?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Do PIVCF have value for the trauma patient at very high risk for VTE, the high risk&#xD;
                trauma patient or the moderate risk trauma patient? In examining this question, the&#xD;
                morbidity of PIVCF must be carefully determined, particularly with respect to their&#xD;
                placement (including local complications at the insertion site, their migration and&#xD;
                degree of tilt) and long-term complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Because most DVT is asymptomatic the clinical examination is extremely insensitive.&#xD;
           Therefore, surveillance of the lower extremity venous systems is necessary. However, the&#xD;
           use of routine surveillance is controversial. It is also known that venous duplex exams,&#xD;
           while very accurate in the symptomatic patient, can be quite insensitive in the&#xD;
           asymptomatic patient. In addition, surveillance scanning is hampered by external&#xD;
           fixators and wounds (as many as 30% of extremities cannot be scanned for this reason10.&#xD;
           Finally, it is not uncommon for trauma patients to have a PE (even a fatal PE) with&#xD;
           negative followup surveillance of the lower extremity (LE) and upper extremity (UE)&#xD;
           venous systems. This would suggest either that the surveillance duplex was inaccurate,&#xD;
           or the clot arose in a vein that could not be well interrogated by duplex (i.e., the&#xD;
           hypogastric), or that the clot arose de novo in the pulmonary artery11. Thus, if an&#xD;
           aggressive concurrent surveillance program for DVT and aggressive work up of suspected&#xD;
           PE is undertaken:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Does &quot;protocolized&quot; surveillance (surveillance of asymptomatic patients) have&#xD;
                value? In other words, does the quality of the outcome (determining the presence of&#xD;
                asymptomatic thrombus in the vein of an extremity) justify the cost?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. What constitutes the most effective protocol in terms of when the initial scan&#xD;
                should be done and the frequency of subsequent scans?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. What is the fate of peroneal vein and tibial vein clot? Does it vary depending on&#xD;
                the degree of risk (i.e., more likely to propagate in patients who are at the&#xD;
                highest risk compared to patients with lower risk)? The same question could be&#xD;
                posed with respect to soleal vein or gastrocnemius vein clot.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Does magnetic resonance venography have a role in high risk trauma patients as a&#xD;
                surveillance modality-particularly those with pelvic fractures or severe LE&#xD;
                fractures that cannot be reliably scanned?&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Does contrast venography have a role in high risk trauma patients as a surveillance&#xD;
                modality, particularly in patients who have had a PE and who have a negative&#xD;
                duplex?&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Since it has been shown by numerous authors that there is surveillance bias with&#xD;
                regard to the diagnosis of DVT (i.e., the diagnosis is more often reported at&#xD;
                hospitals doing more frequent scanning5, does the frequency of the diagnosis of PE&#xD;
                increase as the number of chest CT angiograms are performed?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Recent studies suggest an association between local14 or systemic11 inflammation and&#xD;
           pulmonary thrombosis (perhaps not embolism). Is there an increased risk of DVT or&#xD;
           primary pulmonary thrombosis for trauma patients who have an associated inflammatory&#xD;
           process such as sepsis, urinary tract infection (UTI) or pneumonia (PNA)? What&#xD;
           constellation of local injury puts a patient at risk for pulmonary thrombosis?&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are proposing to perform an extensive literature review on each of these questions to&#xD;
      produce a state of the art publication in follow-up of the EAST Management Guidelines and to&#xD;
      provide a platform for a multicenter study of each or all of these questions.&#xD;
