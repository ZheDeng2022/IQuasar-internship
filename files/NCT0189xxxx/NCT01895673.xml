  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of PET-MRI and to detect a&#xD;
      local site recurrence during the first year of follow-up after RFA or MWA of colorectal liver&#xD;
      metastases (CRLM) as compared with contrast enhanced (ce) CT and PET-CT. Standard reference&#xD;
      will be clear focal uptake in the rim of the lesion on PET-CT, possibly in combination with&#xD;
      histology (when available) or clinical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are the inter-observer variability, the ability to diagnose new&#xD;
      intrahepatic lesions and in what way PET-MRI is able to influence future treatment compared&#xD;
      to PET-CT and ceCT. The patients satisfaction concerning the PET-MRI will be examined with a&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All included patients will routinely undergo follow-up with 3 monthly ceCT of the liver and&#xD;
      PET-CT in the first year after RFA/MWA of CRLM according to standard of care in our hospital.&#xD;
      Patients are asked to undergo an additional PET-MRI of the liver on the same day in the first&#xD;
      year (in total 4 scans). The PET-MRI is obtained before the PET-CT. The&#xD;
      18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) used for PET-CT and PET-MRI are alike&#xD;
      and one injection is sufficient. The PET-CT has to be made within 150 minutes after FDG&#xD;
      injection. Anonymous PET-MRI results are independently reviewed by 2 experienced radiologists&#xD;
      and 2 nuclear medicine physicians twice, with a time-interval of at least two weeks between&#xD;
      the first and second review. Based on these results, treatment decisions will be compared for&#xD;
      any change in decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluate inter-observer variability we will ask the two nuclear medicine physicians and&#xD;
      two radiologist to assess all results and score local and intrahepatic tumor progression.&#xD;
      Results of the first and second evaluation will be compared to determine inter observer&#xD;
      agreement using Cohen's Kappa. Local recurrence and new lesions will be scored on a separate&#xD;
      form with standard criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reports on LSR will be scored as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal: when the reviewer is sure that no tumor recurrence is present in the ablation&#xD;
           zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Probably benign: FDG is enhanced, but compatible with post-ablation inflammation or&#xD;
           rim-like characteristics on MRI images (not focal!)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Equivocal: there is doubt whether the enhanced FDG, CT- or MRI features are due to tumor&#xD;
           recurrence or inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Probably malign: when the reviewer is sure about local recurrence in the ablation zone.&#xD;
           Size and location will also be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reports on new intrahepatic lesions will be scored as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal: no new intrahepatic disease outside 1cm of the ablation zone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Equivocal: doubt about the malignant origin of a lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Probably malign: new intrahepatic tumor not within 1cm of the ablation zone, including&#xD;
           size and location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of all scans by the reviewers, in the way as described above, will be compared to&#xD;
      each other to determine the inter-observer variability using Cohen's Kappa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire with 7 questions is completed at the end of one year follow-up to determine&#xD;
      patients experience with PET-MRI and PET-CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questions will be in Dutch, but are translated below for this purpose. Patients can&#xD;
      answer on a scale 1-5 and n/a.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The PET-MRI was less burdensome than PET-CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The PET-MRI was more bothersome than I expected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PET-MRI is more comfortable than PET-CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If I could choose, I would rather undergo PET-MRI than PET-CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The noise of the PET-MRI was annoying&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fact that PET-MRI takes longer than PET-CT isn't an issue for me&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I would rather undergo a PET-MRI than a PET-CT if results are proven to be equal&#xD;
