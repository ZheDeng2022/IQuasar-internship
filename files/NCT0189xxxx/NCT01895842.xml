    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of ruxolitinib&#xD;
      that can be given to patients with low or intermediate-1 risk MDS. The safety of this drug&#xD;
      will also be studied, and whether it can help to control the disease.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 4 groups of 3-6 participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      in Part 1 of the study, and up to 7 participants will be enrolled in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in Part 1, the dose of ruxolitinib you receive will depend on when you&#xD;
      joined this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose of&#xD;
      ruxolitinib. The second group of participants will receive the lowest dose of ruxolitinib for&#xD;
      1 cycle and if no intolerable side effects are seen, the dose will increase to the next&#xD;
      higher dose for Cycles 2 and beyond. The third group of participants will receive the higher&#xD;
      dose taken by the second group for 1 cycle and if no intolerable side effects are seen, the&#xD;
      dose will be increased for Cycles 2 and beyond. The fourth group of participants will take&#xD;
      the higher dose taken by the third group for 1 cycle and if no intolerable side effects are&#xD;
      seen, the dose will increase to the next higher dose for Cycles 2 and beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in Part 2, you will receive ruxolitinib at the highest dose that was&#xD;
      tolerated in Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take ruxolitinib by mouth 2 times a day (about 12 hours apart), with or without&#xD;
      food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time a week during Cycles 1 and 2 and then on Day 1 of Cycles 3 and beyond, blood&#xD;
      (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. On Day 28 of each cycle and Day 1 of&#xD;
      Cycles 3 and beyond, this blood may also be used for cytogenetic testing if your doctor&#xD;
      thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 28 of Cycles 1 and 2 and then every 3 cycles, you will have a bone marrow aspiration&#xD;
      to check the status of the disease and for cytogenetic testing, if your doctor thinks it is&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 28 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycles 3 and beyond, you will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed, urine will be collected on Day 1 of each cycle for routine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drug for up to 2 years. You will no longer be able to take&#xD;
      the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are&#xD;
      unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the end-of-dosing visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Dosing Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you are finished taking the study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This blood may also be used&#xD;
           for cytogenetic testing if your doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days after the End-of-Dosing visit, a member of the study team will contact you by&#xD;
      phone. You will be asked how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be&#xD;
      experiencing. This phone call should take 10-15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Ruxolitinib is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of myelofibrosis. Its use in this study is investigational. The study doctor&#xD;
      can explain how ruxolitinib is designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 31 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>Part 1: Dose of ruxolitinib received will depend when patient joined study. The first group of patients receive the lowest dose of ruxolitinib. Starting dose level for Part 1, 5 mg by mouth twice a day for a 28 day cycle. The second group of patients receive the lowest dose of ruxolitinib for 1 cycle and if no intolerable side effects are seen, the dose will increase to the next higher dose for Cycles 2 and beyond. The third group of patients receive the higher dose taken by the second group for 1 cycle and if no intolerable side effects are seen, the dose will be increased for Cycles 2 and beyond. The fourth group of patients take the higher dose taken by the third group for 1 cycle and if no intolerable side effects are seen, the dose will increase to the next higher dose for Cycles 2 and beyond.&#xD;
If patients enrolled in Part 2, they will receive ruxolitinib at the highest dose that was tolerated in Part 1.</description>
