    <description>The Vortx Rx is a portable ultrasound therapy device system that is intended for the treatment of BPH by using very intense, low duty-cycle ultrasound pulses to debulk prostatic tissue.</description>

    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Vortx Rx - Histotripsy BPH Device</intervention_name>
    <description>Non-invasive histotripsy treatment/therapy to be delivered by the surgeon using very low duty cycle ultrasound pulses from outside the patient's body. These pulses form a bubble cloud at the end of the focal area within the prostate which mechanically breaks up the cellular structure of the soft tissue. During treatment, a surgeon is able to direct the bubble cloud throughout the targeted volume using controls located on the device console and using the real-time ultrasound for visualization feedback and control of the bubble cloud location.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of BPH and eligible for endoscopic BPH surgery including TURP, PVP,&#xD;
             electrovaporization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prostate volumes 30 - 80 gm based on transrectal ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Men ≥ 50 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. IPSS symptom score ≥ 13 and IPSS bother score &gt; 2 (see Appendix B for IPSS&#xD;
             questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Baseline peak flow rate Qmax ≤ 15 cc/s with voided volume at least 125 cc&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of prostate or bladder cancer, pelvic radiation, untreated bladder stones,&#xD;
             urethral strictures/bladder neck contracture (BNC), renal insufficiency (i.e.&#xD;
             creatinine &gt; 1.4)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Neurogenic bladder, Parkinson's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior treatment for urinary incontinence&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Micturition frequency AND urgency. Micturition frequency defined as &gt; 8 micturitions&#xD;
             per 24 hours as assessed by a thorough subject history including the question: &quot;On&#xD;
             average, how many times do you void during a 24 hour period? // &lt; 4, 5-7, 8 or more.&quot;&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. History of known bleeding disorders (e.g. von Willebrand disease [VWD]) and subjects&#xD;
             determined to have a bleeding disorder by prothrombin time (PT) and partial&#xD;
             thromboplastin time (PTT) tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Prior BPH prostate procedures (e.g. TUMT, TUNA, water induced thermotherapy [WIT],&#xD;
             TURP, PVP)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Men with confirmed or suspected malignancy of the prostate based on a digital rectal&#xD;
             exam (DRE), prostate biopsy or PSA &gt; 10 ng/mL. Men with free PSA &lt; 25% and PSA between&#xD;
             2.5 and 10 ng/mL may only be enrolled after a negative biopsy. If a prior prostate&#xD;
             biopsy was performed within one year of enrollment and was negative for cancer, repeat&#xD;
             biopsy is not required if in the investigator's judgment there is no clinical evidence&#xD;
             to support biopsy reassessment. If a biopsy is required, the subject shall have a&#xD;
             six-week waiting period between the biopsy and histotripsy treatment, if he is&#xD;
             otherwise deemed eligible to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Men interested in future fertility&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Declines or unable to provide informed consent&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Life expectancy estimated to be less than one year&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Unable or unwilling to complete all required questionnaires and follow-up assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. In the opinion of the investigator, it is not in the subject's best interest to&#xD;
             participate in the study.&#xD;
