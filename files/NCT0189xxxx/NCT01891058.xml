  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are cardiac rhythm problems where there is&#xD;
      an irregular, rapid heart rate. Investigators plan to study Emergency Department (ED)&#xD;
      patients with recent-onset episodes of AF or AFL (RAFF) where rapid heart rate requires&#xD;
      urgent treatment to restore normal heart rhythm. RAFF is the most common rhythm disorder&#xD;
      managed in the ED. Investigators recently showed that doctors use a wide variety of treatment&#xD;
      approaches in Canadian EDs for RAFF. Also, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines&#xD;
      indicate that there have not been enough studies to know if the best treatment is to use an&#xD;
      electrical shock (Shock Only) or drugs followed by shock (Drug-Shock). Investigators believe&#xD;
      that Drug-Shock approach will be more effective and will help avoid an electric shock for&#xD;
      many patients. Investigators also do not know if electrical shocks should be given with the&#xD;
      electrode pads on the front (antero-lateral) or front and back (antero-posterior).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators intend to conduct 2 randomized protocols within one study (partial factorial&#xD;
      design) in order to answer these two questions. 1. Will initial drug treatment followed by&#xD;
      electrical shock if necessary (Drug-Shock) lead to more patients being converted to normal&#xD;
      heart rhythm than a strategy of only electrical shock (Shock Only)? 2. Will the&#xD;
      antero-posterior pad position be more effective than the antero-lateral position?&#xD;
      Investigators plan to enroll 468 RAFF patients at 8 large Canadian EDs. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 2 arms for each of the two protocols. Investigators primary outcome will&#xD;
      be conversion to normal heart rhythm. Other outcomes will include heart rhythm at discharge,&#xD;
      need for hospital admission, length of stay in ED, adverse events, patient satisfaction, and&#xD;
      14-day follow-up status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator results will add important information about the best and safest ways to treat&#xD;
      RAFF patients in Canadian EDs. Ultimately Investigators expect to see fewer patients admitted&#xD;
      to hospital and more patients rapidly and safely returned to their normal activities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by disorganized atrial electrical&#xD;
      depolarization leading to an irregular and rapid heart rate and is the most common arrhythmia&#xD;
      seen in the emergency department (ED). Atrial flutter (AFL) is a less common arrhythmia with&#xD;
      similar pathophysiology. Investigators will focus on recent-onset episodes of AF and AFL&#xD;
      (RAFF), which have usually been present less than 48 hours, are highly symptomatic, and may&#xD;
      be a first or recurrent event. There is a surprising lack of evidence regarding many&#xD;
      important ED RAFF management questions and the 2011 Canadian Cardiovascular Society AF&#xD;
      Guidelines indicate clinical equipoise for most facets of early care. In Canadian EDs, most&#xD;
      physicians use the rhythm control approach, where attempts are made to cardiovert patients to&#xD;
      sinus rhythm in the ED, either pharmacologically or electrically (DC cardioversion). Canadian&#xD;
      ED physicians seem equally divided between those who prefer to attempt rhythm control&#xD;
      initially with drugs and then move to DC cardioversion if necessary (Drug-Shock strategy) and&#xD;
      those who prefer to start immediately with DC cardioversion (Shock Only strategy).&#xD;
      Investigators recently completed a prospective cohort RAFF study (N=1,065, funded by the&#xD;
      Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario) at 6 Canadian EDs. 73.3% of all patients underwent ED&#xD;
      rhythm control with 34.4% receiving rhythm control drugs first and 38.9% receiving electrical&#xD;
      shock first. There is also much variation in whether the DC cardioversion electrodes are&#xD;
      placed in the front and back (antero-posterior) or front and side (antero-lateral) position&#xD;
      (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators believe that the Drug-Shock strategy has many advantages over a Shock Only&#xD;
      strategy. Most Canadian EDs have a single physician on duty, which is a barrier to safe&#xD;
      procedural sedation and DC cardioversion. Even in larger EDs, DC cardioversion requires 4&#xD;
      professional staff, has a risk associated with sedation, and can be frightening for patients.&#xD;
      Investigators expect that the Drug-Shock strategy will be more effective because procainamide&#xD;
      will facilitate DC cardioversion and prevent early return of AF. Even if the Drug-Shock&#xD;
      strategy is not more effective overall, its use can prevent the need for DC cardioversion in&#xD;
      50-60% of patients. Regarding DC cardioversion pad placement, no randomized trials have ever&#xD;
      been done with RAFF patients using modern biphasic devices at high energy levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives: Investigators primary aim is to compare conversion to sinus rhythm between&#xD;
      the strategies of i) attempted pharmacological cardioversion with intravenous procainamide&#xD;
      followed by DC cardioversion if necessary (Drug-Shock) and ii) DC cardioversion alone (Shock&#xD;
      Only). Investigators secondary aim is to compare the effectiveness of the i) antero-posterior&#xD;
      and ii) antero-lateral pad positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Design and Interventions: Investigators propose a partial factorial study design&#xD;
      with 2 protocols (Figure 2). All patients will participate in Protocol 1 (N=468) and most in&#xD;
      Protocol 2 (N=356). 1. Drug versus Shock Protocol. This will be a randomized, blinded,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled comparison of: i) attempted pharmacological cardioversion with intravenous&#xD;
      procainamide (15mg/kg over 30 minutes) followed by DC cardioversion (200 joules x 3) if&#xD;
      necessary (Drug-Shock), and ii) only DC cardioversion (Shock Only) (Hypothesis 1). 2. Pad&#xD;
      Position Protocol. For the subset of patients who undergo DC cardioversion, this will be a&#xD;
      randomized, open-label comparison of i) the antero-posterior pad position, and ii) the&#xD;
      antero-lateral pad position (Hypothesis 2). Management protocols will be standardized.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by site and by rhythm (AF or AFL). Setting: 8 EDs of large,&#xD;
      tertiary care Canadian hospitals. Subjects: Stable patients with primary diagnosis of RAFF&#xD;
      where acute rhythm control is a safe option. Investigators will obtain patient consent.&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcome measure will be conversion to sinus rhythm and maintenance of&#xD;
      sinus rhythm for at least 60 minutes; other outcomes will include sinus rhythm at discharge,&#xD;
      hospital admission, length of stay in ED, adverse events, patient satisfaction, and 14-day&#xD;
      follow-up status. Patients will be telephoned at 6 months and 1 year after the original ED&#xD;
      visit to determine stroke-free status and medication changes. Data Analysis: Primary analysis&#xD;
      will be intention-to-treat using chi-square testing. Sample Size: Investigators will require&#xD;
      213 evaluable patients per group to detect a minimal clinically important absolute difference&#xD;
      of 10% between groups. Allowing for 10% non-compliance, investigators plan to enroll 468&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance: This study will answer two important questions about the early management of ED&#xD;
      RAFF patients, leading to higher rhythm conversion rates and lower admission rates. The&#xD;
      results will inform future efforts to create effective, safe, and efficient pathways for RAFF&#xD;
      patient management in Canada.&#xD;
