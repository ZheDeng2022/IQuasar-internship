      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A small brain protein called the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) may&#xD;
      affect several brain diseases such as autism and depression. Researchers will use 2&#xD;
      radioactive chemicals ([11C]SP203 and [11C]FPEB) and a research drug (STX107) that can attach&#xD;
      to the receptor, to figure out the best way to use positron emission tomography (PET) to see&#xD;
      the mGluR5 receptor. They will use scans to monitor where the radioactivity goes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To find the best way to image the mGluR5 receptor in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers ages 18 to 55.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be screened with a medical exam at visit 1. In later visits, they&#xD;
           may have a PET scan, when two small tubes are placed under the skin and they lie down in&#xD;
           a scanner. They may have an MRI scan, when they lie down in a scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1 participants will have 2 more visits. They will have a PET brain scan using&#xD;
           [11C]FPEB and will have blood drawn. Then they will have an MRI brain scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2 participants will have 1 more visit, with a whole body PET scan using [11C]FPEB&#xD;
           and blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 3 participants will have 4 more visits, including 1 overnight stay at a hospital.&#xD;
           Over all the visits, they will have 4 PET scans and 1 MRI brain scan. They will receive&#xD;
           the research drug and injections of both chemicals. Blood will be drawn during the&#xD;
           scans.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple PET ligands exist for imaging metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5).&#xD;
      The selection of best PET ligand to image mGluR5 is necessary for a larger clinical study in&#xD;
      patient population but choosing such a ligand is likely difficult because the radioligands&#xD;
      are evaluated under different conditions and in different subject populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the best PET ligand for imaging mGluR5 receptors in&#xD;
      brain of healthy subjects. This will be accomplished by measuring mGluR5 receptor occupancy&#xD;
      in the same subject using two PET ligands having high affinity at mGluR5 [(11)C]SP203 and&#xD;
      [(11)C]FPEB, and using STX107, a negative allosteric modulator at mGluR5 receptors to block&#xD;
      the radioligand brain uptake. The two radioligands were chosen among many based on the&#xD;
      recommendation from the mGluR5 working group. Two serial PET scans using [(11)C]SP203 and&#xD;
      [(11)C]FPEB will be performed under baseline condition on one day and under receptor blocked&#xD;
      condition on another day. As [(11)C]FPEB has not been evaluated in humans before, we plan to&#xD;
      acquire brain and whole-body dosimetry scans before measuring receptor occupancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, we wish to compare FPEB labeled with (11)C and (18)F in the same subject -two&#xD;
      brain PET scans using [(11)C]FPEB and [(18)F]FPEB will be done serially in the same subject&#xD;
      on the same day. FPEB labeled with (11)C has the same structure as FPEB labeled with (18)F&#xD;
      and is therefore expected to yield similar binding measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      55 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize brain uptake and distribution of radioligand, an initial cohort of healthy&#xD;
      volunteers (n = up to 10) will undergo brain PET scans using [(11)C]FPEB. To estimate&#xD;
      radiation absorbed doses for [(11)C]FPEB, a cohort of healthy volunteers (n = up to 10) will&#xD;
      undergo whole-body PET or PET/CT scans. A subsequent cohort of healthy volunteers (n = up to&#xD;
      15) will have two scanning sessions: a) baseline i.e., medication-free and b) blocking i.e.&#xD;
      with medication. Each scanning session will be with two serial PET scans: [(11)C]FPEB and&#xD;
      [(11)C]SP203 in a day (scans in morning and afternoon). The blocking session will be after&#xD;
      administration of STX107, at which time we will also measure the concentration of STX107 in&#xD;
      plasma. Both scanning sessions would include an arterial line and measurement of the input&#xD;
      function of parent radioligand separated from radiometabolites as well as plasma free&#xD;
      fraction of radioligand. We plan to study up to two doses of STX107, with three to five&#xD;
      subjects at each dose. The blockade of brain uptake of [(11)C]FPEB and [(11)C]SP203 will be&#xD;
      plotted as a function of the plasma concentration of STX107. A further cohort of healthy&#xD;
      volunteers (n = up to 15) will undergo two serial brain PET scans with [(11)C]FPEB and&#xD;
      [(18)F]FPEB in the same day (one scan in the morning, and the other in the afternoon).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radioligands will be evaluated on three criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Peak brain uptake. Higher uptake is better, because it provides more robust signal that&#xD;
           can be imaged for a longer time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time-stability of distribution volume. If the measurement of receptor binding (i.e.,&#xD;
           distribution volume) is stable with increasing lengths of imaging, the result is good&#xD;
           and consistent with the lack of radiometabolites in brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ratio of specific to non-displaceable uptake in brain. The receptor occupancy study can&#xD;
           be analyzed with the so-called Lassen plot to calculate non-displaceable (free&#xD;
           radioligand plus non-specifically bound) uptake in brain. The better radioligand has the&#xD;
           better ratio of signal to noise , which in this case is the ratio of specific to&#xD;
           nondisplaceable uptake.&#xD;
