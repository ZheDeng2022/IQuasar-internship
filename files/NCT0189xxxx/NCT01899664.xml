      The goal of the investigators work is to establish how nerve transfers can be best used to&#xD;
      improve upper extremity function in patients with cervical level spinal cord injury (SCI).&#xD;
      The investigators' hypothesis is that nerve transfers are safe and effective and will improve&#xD;
      function and quality of life in patients with loss of upper function due to spinal cord&#xD;
      injury. The investigators plan on looking at upper limb function, and health-related quality&#xD;
      of life in patients before and after surgery to better understand how patients benefit from&#xD;
      these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nerve transfer procedure can be used to rewire the system to make some muscles work again&#xD;
      following SCI. The nerve transfer procedure (which is done in the arm and not at the level of&#xD;
      the spinal cord) can be used to bypass the damaged area and to deliver a signal from the&#xD;
      brain to a muscle that became disconnected following that injury. A donor nerve is taken from&#xD;
      another muscle whose use is not essential and then transferred to help in providing more a&#xD;
      more critical function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, one type of nerve transfer is done to restore the lost ability to pinch or grasp&#xD;
      small objects between the fingers that occurs in many patients with cervical SCI. In this&#xD;
      surgery, a donor nerve that normally helps flex the elbow. This nerve can be used because the&#xD;
      biceps muscle is also working to flex the elbow. This donor nerve is cut and re-attached to&#xD;
      the nerve going to muscles in the forearm that provide pinch by bending the tips of the thumb&#xD;
      and index finger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the nerve transfer procedure involves cutting and reattaching nerve and muscle&#xD;
      tissues, time is required to regenerate working connections between the nerves and muscle as&#xD;
      well as to allow the brain to relearn how to use and strengthen that muscle.&#xD;

      Background/Readiness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) is a life altering injury that results in profound loss of&#xD;
      upper limb function. Nerve transfer surgery has transformed the field of peripheral nerve&#xD;
      injury surgery, allowing remarkable restoration of upper limb motor function. The&#xD;
      investigators expanded use of nerve transfer surgery to cervical SCI patients and are the&#xD;
      first center to successfully restore volitional hand function in a patient with a C7 motor&#xD;
      level injury (now 3 years post-surgery). Results in 7 more patients show early functional&#xD;
      gains at 3-6 months post-surgery (most gains are expected at 12 months and these patients are&#xD;
      still early in their course). The proposed study will obtain formative outcomes data from a&#xD;
      pilot investigation of nerve transfer surgery to restore upper extremity function in patients&#xD;
      with cervical SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper extremity and hand function is essential to basic activities of daily living and&#xD;
      independence; patients with cervical SCI rate this as more important than walking and sexual&#xD;
      performance. Restoration of critical upper extremity and hand function requires the unique&#xD;
      expertise and technical skill of hand surgeons; traditionally tendon transfer/tenodesis are&#xD;
      used. Although studies report reasonable outcomes in SCI patients for this procedure, use is&#xD;
      limited particularly in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve transfers offer an alternative and promising approach. In peripheral nerve injury,&#xD;
      nerve transfers are well-established, safe and are often the treatment of choice. A nerve&#xD;
      transfer uses an expendable donor nerve and coapts this to a nonfunctional recipient nerve to&#xD;
      restore volitional motor function. Since a nerve transfer reinnervates the musculotendinous&#xD;
      unit responsible for the absent but desired function, this procedure: 1) does not have the&#xD;
      biomechanical limitations of tendon transfers; 2) can use expendable donor nerves whose&#xD;
      muscles cannot be used for tendon transfer (i.e. the brachialis); and 3) a single donor nerve&#xD;
      can provide more than one function via reinnervation of multiple muscles. Most importantly&#xD;
      for SCI patient acceptability, nerve transfers do not require prolonged periods of&#xD;
      immobilization; early resumption of activity is encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case reports offer early evidence that this novel application of nerve transfers may be a&#xD;
      better alternative to tendon transfers in SCI. Based on our extensive experience with nerve&#xD;
      transfers in peripheral nerve injury, we expect this approach will have a profound impact on&#xD;
      improving function, independence and health-related quality of life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to provide evidence on the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of&#xD;
      nerve transfers in SCI patients via systematically collected data and to evaluate patients'&#xD;
      perspective of the benefits and disadvantages of nerve transfers. These data are vital for&#xD;
      patient selection, patient and surgeon education, and adaptation of this well-established&#xD;
      technique to this unique and traditionally underserved patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and Approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Nerve transfers are safe, effective procedures that have a role in the treatment&#xD;
      armamentarium of cervical SCI associated upper extremity dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To document the safety, time course and improvement (potential for nerve transfers to&#xD;
      improve functional outcomes) by assessing pre and post-operative function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate the feasibility and suitability of nerve transfers through&#xD;
      multidisciplinary evaluation, electrodiagnostic testing, ultrasound, and nerve specimen&#xD;
      examination and correlation with the clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To assess patient satisfaction with and acceptability for this treatment by use of&#xD;
      semi-structured patient interviews.&#xD;
