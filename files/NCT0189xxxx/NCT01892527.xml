      This is a single-arm, Simon 2-stage, phase 2 clinical study conducted in subjects with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer who have previously received ≥ 1 prior line of&#xD;
      systemic therapies and are resistant to EGFR inhibitor (cetuximab or panitumumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be conducted to determine objective response rate (ORR), progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) and overall-survival (OS) of cetuximab plus tivantinib in patients with&#xD;
      wild-type KRAS CRC that is resistant to anti-EGFR antibody treatment (cetuximab or&#xD;
      panitumumab) and shows overexpression of cMET.&#xD;

      This is a single-arm, Simon 2-stage, phase 2 clinical study conducted in subjects with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer who have received ≥1 prior line of systemic&#xD;
      therapies and are resistant to EGFR inhibitor (cetuximab or panitumumab). Fresh tumor tissue&#xD;
      is needed for the MET testing, thus a biopsy will be required to participate in this trial.&#xD;
      In a minor percentage of subjects archival tumor tissue could be acceptable for this&#xD;
      analysis.Eligible subjects will be treated with tivantinib (ARQ 197) at a dose of 360 mg&#xD;
      twice daily (a total daily dose of 720 mg) orally in a continuous manner and cetuximab&#xD;
      (Erbitux) at a dose of 500 mg/mq i.v. every 2 weeks. The overall treatment period will be&#xD;
      divided into continuous 28 days cycles without treatment interruption. Disease status and&#xD;
      tumor response will be assessed per modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) criteria version 1.1 at screening (within 4 weeks before the first scheduled dose of&#xD;
      study drug), in 8 weeks intervals while the subjects are on treatment or as clinically&#xD;
      indicated until progression of disease, withdrawal of consent, death, or lost to follow-up.&#xD;
      Tumor measurement will also be performed during the end of treatment visit if not done within&#xD;
      the previous 8 weeks. Subjects with progressive disease at any time during the treatment&#xD;
      period will discontinue study treatment. Subjects with stable disease (SD), complete response&#xD;
      (CR) and partial response (PR) will stay on treatment until disease progression and/or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity and/or withdrawal of consent is documented. CR and PR must be confirmed&#xD;
      no sooner than 4 weeks after the initial observation. After discontinuation from study&#xD;
      treatment during the follow-up period, survival status will be obtained by phone every 3&#xD;
      months until the subject dies, withdraws consent from study, or is lost to follow-up, for a&#xD;
      maximum of 12 months.&#xD;
