  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves an emergency department (ED)-based intervention utilizing Motivational&#xD;
      Interviewing (MI) techniques and patient-centered eHealth materials (e.g., a tailored,&#xD;
      mobile-friendly website and text messages) to promote the correct and consistent use of&#xD;
      size-appropriate child passenger restraints (car seats, booster seats, and seat belts). This&#xD;
      study is designed as an adaptive randomized controlled trial, recruiting English and Spanish&#xD;
      speaking caregivers of children 6 months to 10 years old.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) remain the leading cause of unintentional injury deaths among&#xD;
      children in the United States (U.S.) and racial/ethnic minority children are&#xD;
      disproportionately impacted as suboptimal child passenger safety behaviors are more prevalent&#xD;
      in some communities. Existing universal approaches to promote child passenger safety have&#xD;
      fallen short of ensuring that all child passengers are correctly using size-appropriate child&#xD;
      passenger restraints according to guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics&#xD;
      and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Precision prevention programs are&#xD;
      urgently needed to improve child passenger safety behaviors among caregivers who have not&#xD;
      been responsive to guidelines, laws, and public education campaigns. The proposed research&#xD;
      will test the efficacy of Tiny Cargo, Big Deal/Abróchame Bien, Cuídame Bien (TCBD/ABCB), a&#xD;
      bilingual emergency department (ED)-based precision prevention intervention grounded in&#xD;
      Self-Determination Theory. TCBD/ABCB integrates personalized counseling based on principles&#xD;
      of motivational interviewing (MI) and eHealth components including a tailored educational&#xD;
      mobile-friendly website &quot;site&quot; and short message service (SMS) communications with the goal&#xD;
      of improving child passenger safety. We hypothesize that by providing tailored child&#xD;
      passenger safety education and personalized skills for restraint use in a manner that&#xD;
      supports autonomous motivation the TCBD/ABCB intervention will be more efficacious than&#xD;
      universal approaches (laws/guidelines) for realizing correct use of size-appropriate child&#xD;
      passenger restraints.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>After the baseline survey, all participants will be randomized into one of two groups: 1) basic intervention or 2) control group. Block randomization (block sizes from four to eight) will be applied to assign participants to intervention or control in a 3:1 ratio. Blocks will be stratified by child passenger safety recommendations for age (&lt;2 years, rear-facing; 2-4 years, forward-facing; 5+ years, booster seat) and reason for study eligibility (not consistently using the recommended restraint for age and size or planning a premature transition in the coming 6 months).&#xD;
After 6-month follow-up, participants in the intervention group only who continue suboptimal child passenger safety behaviors will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to basic or enhanced intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>This is a single-blinded study where a portion of the study will include blinding of study team members who are assessing outcomes. The blinding will not include the participants.&#xD;
The portion of the study that includes blinding is the review of the monthly photo submissions. Participants send us via text message over the course of 12 months. Each photograph is reviewed and scored by two team members. The first reviewer is blinded to study condition and saves the photographs with the child's face blurred. The second reviewer scores the photographs after the child's face has been blurred to verify findings of the first reviewer. The second reviewer is then unblinded to send feedback to the caregiver appropriate for their study condition.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Child Passenger Safety Guideline Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>At the 12-month follow-up assessment, conducted remotely or in-person, we will reassess the child's current passenger restraint use and safety behaviors. For this dichotomous outcome, caregivers will be considered guideline adherent if their child is using the recommended child restraint system for their weight and height AND is seated in the vehicle back seat.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Child Passenger Safety Score (CPaSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>At the 12-month follow-up assessment, we will obtain photographs from the caregiver remotely or by research staff in-person. Photographs will be reviewed using the Child Passenger Safety Score checklist. Points will be deducted from a perfect score of 100 based on observe errors and misuse.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CPaSS Trajectories</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>We will use latent growth curve models to identify characteristic trajectories for Child Passenger Safety Scores based on photographs of children as they typically travel obtained at baseline, months 1-4, 6-month assessment, months 8-11, and 12-month assessment.</description>
