  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of chronic pain conditions are characterized by imbalances in excitatory and/or&#xD;
      inhibitory mechanisms and these deficits appear correlated with the response to certain&#xD;
      treatments. Evaluating these mechanisms among people who suffer from chronic pain could allow&#xD;
      clinicians to adapt the treatment to each patient according to the deficits observed. To&#xD;
      evaluate excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms, a thermode (hot plate) and a cold water bath&#xD;
      can be used (standardized protocol). Unfortunately, these tools are expensive, time-consuming&#xD;
      and require complex equipment and software. As such, it is not realistic for clinicians to&#xD;
      use them for routine patient assessment. A potential alternative to study these mechanisms is&#xD;
      TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation). TENS is frequently used in rehabilitation&#xD;
      and unlike thermode and cold water bath, is affordable, easy to use and requires very little&#xD;
      time and equipment. The objective of this study are to determine if the TENS can replace the&#xD;
      thermode and cold water bath (standardized protocol) for the evaluation of excitatory and&#xD;
      inhibitory mechanisms. Also, to determine if there will be a correlation with the&#xD;
      standardized protocol. 50 healthy participants between 18 and 60 years old will participate&#xD;
      in this study. Each participant will attend two experimental sessions. In one of the two&#xD;
      sessions, the evaluation will be done with the TENS; in the other session, the evaluation&#xD;
      will be done with the standardized protocol (thermode and cold water bath).&#xD;

      To evaluate excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms, the investigators will used the modified&#xD;
      CPM testing procedure consisting of test stimulus (TS) administered before and after a&#xD;
      conditioning stimulus (CS). For the standardized protocol, the TS will consisted of a noxius&#xD;
      heat stimulus generated by a thermode (hot plate), applied for two minutes on the&#xD;
      non-dominant anterior forearm. The CS will consisted of a cold pressor test (CT), wherein&#xD;
      participants immersed their dominant forearm in a cold water bath for two minutes. For the&#xD;
      TENS protocol, the TS will consisted of a noxius electrical stimulus generated by TENS,&#xD;
      applied for 5 seconds on the non-dominant knee at a frequency of 1 Hz and 5 Hz. The CS will&#xD;
      consisted of a noxius electrical stimulus generated by TENS' applied for 120 seconds on the&#xD;
      non dominant knee and ankle at a frequency of 2 Hz.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will attended two experimental sessions at the Research Center on Aging of the Centre Intégré Universitaire de Santé et de Services Sociaux de l'Estrie, Sherbrooke, during which the efficacy of their excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms was assessed. In one session, this assessment was done using TENS protocol; in the other, using a standardized protocol (thermode and cold water bath). Session order was randomized between participants (randomization by block of 4 stratified by sex, using a random number table). The two sessions were separated by 24 to 72 hours and lasted approximately one hour each.</intervention_model_description>
