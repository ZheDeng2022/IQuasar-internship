  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection can be effectively controlled with antiretroviral therapy (ART). However,&#xD;
      children and adolescents living with HIV and receiving ART suffer high rates of treatment&#xD;
      failure, predominantly caused by suboptimal adherence to therapy and/or viral drug&#xD;
      resistance. While high-income countries routinely use genotypic resistance testing (GRT) to&#xD;
      determine which drug combinations are likely to be effective, this diagnostic tool is&#xD;
      relatively costly and labour-intensive and is not routinely available in most&#xD;
      resource-limited settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GIVE MOVE is a multi-country (Lesotho, Tanzania) randomised clinical trial assessing if rapid&#xD;
      GRT after detecting an unsuppressed viral load improves the clinical management and thus&#xD;
      health outcomes for children and adolescents living with HIV. Children and adolescents with&#xD;
      an unsuppressed viral load despite ART are enrolled and randomly allocated to a control or an&#xD;
      intervention arm (50% of participants in each arm). The control arm receives care according&#xD;
      to the current standard of care, consisting of three sessions of enhanced adherence&#xD;
      counselling at monthly intervals, followed by a second viral load test. If the viral load&#xD;
      remains high, the ART regimen is adjusted according to empirical guidelines; if not, the&#xD;
      participant remains on an unchanged ART regimen. The intervention arm receives GRT and&#xD;
      GRT-informed onward therapy; that is, in the case of drug resistance, the ART regimen is&#xD;
      adjusted as appropriate, whereas if no (relevant) drug resistance is detected, there is no&#xD;
      change of ART regimen. Participants in the intervention arm also receive three sessions of&#xD;
      enhanced adherence counselling, which is informed by GRT results (i.e., if no drug resistance&#xD;
      is detected, there is a high chance of suboptimal adherence to ART and this can be directly&#xD;
      addressed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will assess if the rapid provision of GRT improves participants' health outcomes&#xD;
      at 9 months after enrolment. A nested study will assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      GRT. Thus, this trial will provide evidence on whether the provision of GRT for children and&#xD;
      adolescents with HIV should be prioritised in resource-limited settings.&#xD;

      Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adolescents living with HIV and receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) suffer&#xD;
      high rates of treatment failure, predominantly caused by suboptimal adherence to therapy&#xD;
      and/or viral drug resistance. While high-income countries routinely use genotypic resistance&#xD;
      testing (GRT) to select an optimal ART regimen, this diagnostic tool is not routinely&#xD;
      available in many resource-limited settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GIVE MOVE trial assesses if rapid GRT after detection of an unsuppressed viral load in&#xD;
      children and adolescents on ART improves health outcomes when compared to the current&#xD;
      standard of care. Furthermore, a nested study will assess the cost-effectiveness of this&#xD;
      intervention. Combined, these results will provide evidence on whether GRT should be&#xD;
      prioritised for children and adolescents with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GIVE MOVE is a multi-centre (min. 4 centres in 2 countries, Lesotho and Tanzania),&#xD;
      parallel-group (1:1 allocation), open-label randomised clinical trial. Children and&#xD;
      adolescents living with HIV with a viral load ≥400 c/mL while on first-line ART are enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group is managed as per the current standard of care that follows the World&#xD;
      Health Organization guidelines, i.e. three sessions of enhanced adherence counselling at&#xD;
      monthly intervals, followed by a second viral load test. A sustained viral load ≥400 c/mL&#xD;
      triggers a switch to an empirically selected second-line ART regimen (according to national&#xD;
      clinical guidelines); if the second viral load is &lt;400 c/mL, the participant's ART regimen&#xD;
      remains unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention arm, participants receive GRT (Sanger sequencing) and GRT-informed onward&#xD;
      therapy, selecting the best locally available drugs according to the drug resistance profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GIVE MOVE trial will compare clinical outcomes (mortality, morbidity, viral suppression;&#xD;
      see the Primary Outcome section for the composite primary endpoint) at nine months. Assuming&#xD;
      that 20% vs 35% reach the primary endpoint in the intervention vs control arm, and at a&#xD;
      significance level of 5%, 276 participants (138 per arm) are required to reach 80% power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to clinical outcomes, the trial intends to assess the cost and cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of the intervention. The GIVE MOVE trial aims at informing future clinical guidelines on the&#xD;
      management of paediatric HIV.&#xD;

    <description>The viral load ≥400 c/mL before enrolment triggers genotypic resistance testing (GRT), followed by GRT-informed patient management and counselling.

    <description>Standard of care according to national guidelines and recommendations of the World Health Organization: The viral load ≥400 c/mL before enrolment is followed by 3 sessions of enhanced adherence counselling and a follow-up viral load test. If the viral load remains ≥400 c/mL, the participant is switched to a different regimen line with drug selection based on empiric guidelines; if the viral load drops to &lt;400 c/mL, the current drug regimen is maintained. The follow-up viral load test may be postponed in favour of additional counselling if there is clear evidence of poor adherence to therapy, defined as i) a pill count of &lt;90%, and/or ii) a self-reported period of no drug intake of ≥2 days in the last 4 weeks.</description>
