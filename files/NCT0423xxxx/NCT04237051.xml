      Ergonomic is the study of people and their working environment. Ergonomic consequently is the&#xD;
      science concerned with designing products and procedures to maximize efficiency and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The world health organization defines Musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) as &quot;a disorder of the&#xD;
      muscles Tendons, joints, intervertebral discs, Peripheral nerves, and vascular system''.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The musculoskeletal disorders are common among medical professionals, and especially dentists&#xD;
      and dental hygienists, because of the prevalence of different postures in dental procedures,&#xD;
      prolonged stature, unsupported sitting, griping smaller and thin instruments for a longer&#xD;
      time and limited access during dental procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) affect muscle, joints, tendons, ligaments, and nerves and&#xD;
      caused by work itself or by working environment. It has been reported that back pain is the&#xD;
      most common followed by neck pain and shoulder pain. If early signs and symptoms are noted,&#xD;
      with the understanding of mechanisms of progression of the disease, MSDs can be prevented at&#xD;
      earlier stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Gupta et al., 2014), state some signs and symptoms of MSD on dentists:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signs of MSDs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decreased range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss of normal sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decreased grip strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss of normal movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss of coordination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of MSDs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Excessive fatigue in the shoulders and neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tingling, burning or other pain in arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weak grip, cramping of hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Numbness in fingers and hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clumsiness and dropping of objects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypersensitivity in hands and fingers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals of Ergonomics according to (Pendyala and Karunakar, 2014) :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders and conditions which might lead to&#xD;
           it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increasing safety and productivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enhanced performance by eliminating unnecessary effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improving the standard of care to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So this study is conducted to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among&#xD;
      fifth-year undergraduate dental students, Cairo University towards Ergonomics&#xD;
