  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some smokers who try e-cigarettes transition completely from cigarettes to e-cigarettes, but&#xD;
      others continue to use both products, or abandon e-cigarettes and return completely to&#xD;
      cigarettes. One factor that likely impacts these tobacco use patterns is the e-cigarette&#xD;
      device used. The majority of e-cigarettes purchased today are one of two &quot;types:&quot;&#xD;
      customizable tanks or pods. These e-cigarette types differ from each other in critical ways,&#xD;
      like nicotine delivery and sensory characteristics, that are likely to impact use by&#xD;
      influencing the relative reinforcement value of the product. The present study will be a&#xD;
      randomized trial investigating the impact of e-cigarette device type on reinforcement value&#xD;
      and use among current smokers. Current smokers (n=100) will be randomly assigned to either a&#xD;
      control group that does not receive an e-cigarette or one of two e-cigarette types: a&#xD;
      customizable tank, or a pod. The impact of device type on relative reinforcement value will&#xD;
      be assessed using a choice task. Participants will also take home their assigned e-cigarette&#xD;
      for a three-week sampling period. Primary outcomes include relative reinforcement value&#xD;
      (choices to smoke in the lab-based choice task), cigarette smoking behavior (cigarettes&#xD;
      smoked per day during sampling), and uptake (e-cigarette puffing episodes per day during&#xD;
      sampling).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of e-cigarettes has risen dramatically in the United States, and the impact of&#xD;
      these products on public health remains controversial. Proponents of e-cigarettes argue that&#xD;
      because e-cigarettes deliver lower levels of toxicants than conventional cigarettes, they may&#xD;
      offer reduced health risks for current smokers who switch completely. However, while&#xD;
      e-cigarettes appear to offer a path away from smoking for a subset of smokers, a large&#xD;
      proportion of those who try e-cigarettes abandon them after a short trial period, or continue&#xD;
      to use both products (i.e., dual use). Complete switching from cigarettes to e-cigarettes&#xD;
      among those who try them is modest at best. Since the ultimate impact of e-cigarettes is&#xD;
      likely dependent on their ability to curb cigarette smoking, it is important to understand&#xD;
      the device characteristics (in addition to user characteristics: not studied here) that&#xD;
      contribute to their uptake. One major and perhaps most visible device factor that determines&#xD;
      uptake is the type of e-cigarette itself. The sheer volume of e-cigarette brands makes it&#xD;
      impossible to test the impact of each brand (over 400 estimated brands). However, most&#xD;
      e-cigarettes can be categorized into one of four broad types with distinct characteristics:&#xD;
      cig-a-likes, tanks, customizable tanks, and pods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is strong evidence that cig-a-likes deliver less nicotine, are less satisfying, and are&#xD;
      less likely to promote switching than other device types. Thus, these devices are not&#xD;
      included in the proposed project. Tank devices have a nicotine delivery profile differs&#xD;
      markedly from traditional cigarettes, and thus have also not been included here. The other&#xD;
      two types, customizable tanks and pods, corner significant portions of the e-cigarette market&#xD;
      and differ from each other in critical ways that would be expected to impact uptake, and thus&#xD;
      constitute our primary focus. Customizable tanks deliver nicotine in a profile that more&#xD;
      closely models the nicotine delivery of traditional cigarettes. These devices offer a high&#xD;
      level of customization that allows users to adjust the device until they reach their desired&#xD;
      sensory and nicotine delivery settings. However, the customization renders them relatively&#xD;
      complicated to learn to use. Pods (e.g., JUUL) are the newest type of e-cigarette on the&#xD;
      market. Pods utilize nicotine salts, rather than free-base nicotine, which the company claims&#xD;
      allows them to deliver high levels of nicotine in a profile that is comparable to traditional&#xD;
      cigarette. They offer no customization, making them easy to use. The combination of high&#xD;
      nicotine delivery with increased usability may increase the relative reinforcement value of&#xD;
      these products, resulting in greater uptake than other device types. There is almost no&#xD;
      existing research that directly compares these device types against each other. The goal of&#xD;
      this application is to provide a preliminary assessment comparing e-cigarette device types&#xD;
      (customizable tanks, pods) in a head-to-head design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a between-subjects design, adult daily smokers (n=75) who are interested in trying&#xD;
      e-cigarettes will be randomly assigned in 1:2:2 fashion to either a control group that&#xD;
      receives no product (n=15), or to receive one of two types of e-cigarettes to sample over a&#xD;
      three-week period: a) customizable tank, or b) pod, (n=30/group). The design is naturalistic&#xD;
      in that participants receiving an e-cigarette will be told to use the e-cigarette as much or&#xD;
      as little as they would like, allowing for assessment of self-determined uptake and&#xD;
      reinforcement. Methods include both ecological assessments (electronic daily diaries) and&#xD;
      experimental sessions (choice and purchase tasks). Biomarkers (expired carbon monoxide) will&#xD;
      corroborate self-reported indices of use.&#xD;
