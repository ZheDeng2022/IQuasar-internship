      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a single center, parallel arm, randomized, controlled trial done at Tribhuvan&#xD;
      University Teaching Hospital,Institute Of Medicine from May 2017 to April 2018. The&#xD;
      allocation ratio was 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: All patients undergoing Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor for&#xD;
      suspected bladder tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were: Consent withdrawal, bladder tumour other than in the lateral wall,&#xD;
      unfit for spinal anesthesia and need of general anesthesia or obturator nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients suspected to have bladder cancer were subjected to imaging or cystoscopy and&#xD;
      with confirmation of the diagnosis; they were randomized into two arms of TURBT. Spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia was used in all cases. To overcome the potential confounding effect on our primary&#xD;
      end point, obturator jerk, nerve block was not used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cystoscopy was done first and the findings were noted before proceeding to TURBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumors were resected in block from periphery to center with the stalk resected last. An&#xD;
      additional sample of deep muscle was obtained from the tumor base and sent for&#xD;
      histopathological examination in different containers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study variables were recorded in Per forma during the operation and in post operative&#xD;
      period. Hemoglobin and sodium level was determined in immediate post operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative irrigation was done with normal saline in both the resection groups and&#xD;
      continued till the urine was clear. The catheter was removed after 48 hours in uncomplicated&#xD;
      cases and patients were discharged. Patients were followed up in OPD at 2 weeks with the&#xD;

      All patients suspected to have bladder cancer were subjected to imaging or cystoscopy and&#xD;

      anesthesia was used in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome the potential confounding effect on our primary end point, obturator jerk, nerve&#xD;
      block was not used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cystoscopy was done first and the findings were noted before proceeding to TURBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monopolar resection was done using 1.5% Glycine solution at 110 watt cutting, and 70 watt&#xD;
      coagulation power (Covidien Valley-lab Force Fx TM) with Karl Storz 26f resectoscope and loop&#xD;
      (8mm width and 5mm depth) with 300 telescope. Bipolar resection was done with 0.9% Normal&#xD;
      Saline with digital impedence dependent cutting (power range 150-250 watt) and 80 watt&#xD;
      coagulation power (Bowa Arc 400) with Karl Storz 26f resectoscope and loop (6mm width and 5mm&#xD;
      depth) with 300 telescope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumors were resected in block from periphery to center with the stalk resected last. An&#xD;
      additional sample of deep muscle was obtained from the tumor base and sent for&#xD;
      histopathological examination in different containers. All study variables were recorded in&#xD;
      Per forma during the operation and in post operative period. Hemoglobin and sodium level was&#xD;
      determined in immediate post operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative irrigation was done with normal saline in both the resection groups and&#xD;
      continued till the urine was clear. The catheter was removed after 48 hours in uncomplicated&#xD;
      cases and patients were discharged. Patients were followed up in Out Patient Department at 2&#xD;
      weeks with the histopathological report for or when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of obturator jerk, bladder perforation, resection time, decrease in hemoglobin&#xD;
      and serum sodium, clot retention, need for blood transfusion, need for recoagulation and TUR&#xD;
      syndrome were recorded for the cases in both arms. All resected specimen were evaluated by&#xD;
      pathologist for quality by determining the presence of deep muscle in the sample and&#xD;
      comparing the degree of cautery artifact. Severe artifact was defined as more than 50%&#xD;
      cautery artifact in most chips.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size (n) was calculated using 80% power and a 95% significance level for obturator&#xD;
      jerk, assuming a 30% incidence for the monopolar system and a 5% incidence for the bipolar&#xD;
      system. These values were arrived at after a comprehensive literature review. The sample size&#xD;
      was determined with the formula n= K {P1(1-P1) x P2(1-P2)}/ )P1-P2)2, Where:&#xD;
&#xD;
      N= sample size P1= prevalence of obturator jerk in Monopolar TURBT P2= prevalence of&#xD;
      obturator jerk in Bipolar TURBT K= constant (7.9 for 80% power of study and 0.05 level of&#xD;
      significance)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 33 in each arm was calculated using above formula. Estimating a drop out of&#xD;
      10%, we decided to include at least 37 patients in each arm. A computer generated random&#xD;
      number was used to allocate eligible patients in to monopolar or bipolar resection arm. Data&#xD;
      analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.&#xD;
      Significance was determined using the independent sample t-test for quantitative variables&#xD;
      and the chi-square test for qualitative data. P value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
