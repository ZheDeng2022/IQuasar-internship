      Two methods allow to evaluate tear breakup time (BUT): without prior dye instillation (No Dye&#xD;
      BreakUp Time NDBUT) or after fluorescein instilation (FBUT). The interconnections between&#xD;
      those two values are unknown&#xD;

      To date, there are a limited numbers of tests available for screening ocular dryness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) assessement of tear production through Schirmer's test (paper strips are inserted into the&#xD;
      eye for 5 minutes to measure the production of tears: normal value is superior to 15 mm&#xD;
      wetting of the paper after 5 minutes, pathologic if inferior to 5-10 mm) ii) assessment of&#xD;
      the ocular surface damage after instillation of fluorescein (presence of punctuate&#xD;
      superficial lesions on the corneal and conjunctival epithelium) the with the slit lamp + blue&#xD;
      filter iii) assessment of the FBUT (measurement of the tear breakup time after fluorescein&#xD;
      dye instillation): normal value is superior to 15 seconds, pathologic value inf inferior to&#xD;
      5-10 seconds iv) assessment of the inflammation of eyelids (with the slit lamp). These&#xD;
      diagnostic tests are used in everyday clinical practice, but however the international&#xD;
      consensus conference (Dry Eye Workshop II, 2017) clearly recommended that, whenever&#xD;
      practicable, some other tests must be carried out to optimize the efficacy the diagnostic&#xD;
      procedure of dry eye disease. This is the case for the NDBUT (in opposition to the FBUT which&#xD;
      uses fluorescein), the tear meniscus height (TMH) which give an rapid hint on the quantity of&#xD;
      tears present on the ocular surface, the measure in real time of the tear osmolarity and, at&#xD;
      last, the analysis of the thickness of the tear's layer by interferometry (measurement of the&#xD;
      light fringes reflected by the tears when illuminated with polarized light, whereby the&#xD;
      complete layer or the lipid layer alone can be evaluated separately depending on the machines&#xD;
      used) and of the assessment of the quality of the Meibomian glands (non-contact imaging by&#xD;
      infrared illumination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these techniques are recommended for the detection and the analysis of the mechanism&#xD;
      inducing ocular dryness because they are non-invasive and painless. They also are recommended&#xD;
      to be carried out jointly because there is still no single objective criterion that is&#xD;
      sufficiently robust to be used alone to make this diagnosis, which is therefore ultimately&#xD;
      based on an overall analysis of these various parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the nature of the relationships between these different objective diagnostic&#xD;
      tests remains still poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the least well elucidated points in this respect is the relationship between the FBUT&#xD;
      and the NDBUT, the latter having the theoretical advantage of being less subjective (the&#xD;
      measurement is made by a medical device that detects the deformation time of a light test&#xD;
      pattern projected onto the tear film). This method therefore tends to measure rather the&#xD;
      moment when the film becomes thinner (generating the deformation of the test pattern),&#xD;
      whereas the measurement of FBUT (i.e. after instillation of fluorescein), is certainly&#xD;
      subjective but it measures the real tear break time, which corresponds physiologically to a&#xD;
      critical moment (regulated by the blink reflex when sensitivity is normal). A retrospective&#xD;
      study, carried out in patients known to suffer from dry eye disease and using many of the&#xD;
      same instruments as those to be used in the present study, suggested that the NDBUT is&#xD;
      generally longer than the FBUT (with an increasing difference with the values), which could&#xD;
      be considered paradoxical (the thinning being expected to precede the complete rupture). This&#xD;
      relationship must therefore be studied prospectively to analyze the nature of this difference&#xD;
      (correlation?) and its relationship with other markers of dry eye disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of subjective symptoms and the impact on the quality of life felt by the patient&#xD;
      will be recorded in order to explore whether the possible difference between NDBUT and FBUT&#xD;
      is correlated with the intensity and/or frequency of the symptoms felt.&#xD;
