  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a nonrandomized, fixed-sequence, open-label study to evaluate the effect of a single&#xD;
      dose of fedratinib on the PK, safety, and tolerability of single doses of digoxin,&#xD;
      rosuvastatin, and metformin in healthy subjects. The subjects will participate as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment phase (includes baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up telephone call Subjects will be screened for eligibility during the screening&#xD;
           phase. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will&#xD;
           return to the clinical site on Day -1 for protocol-specified assessments, and will be&#xD;
           domiciled at the clinical site from Day -1 through the morning of Day 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, blood samples will be collected at prespecified times for PK and PD. Urine&#xD;
      samples will be collected at prespecified times for urinary PK evaluation of metformin.&#xD;
      Subject safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;

             documentation required) at least 6 months before Screening, or postmenopausal (defined&#xD;
             as 24 consecutive months without menses before Screening, with a follicle-stimulating&#xD;
             hormone [FSH] level in the post-menopausal range according to the laboratory used at&#xD;
             Screening).&#xD;

          5. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP1) must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Have a negative pregnancy test as verified by the investigator at Screening and&#xD;
                  Baseline (prior to starting study treatment). She must agree to ongoing pregnancy&#xD;
                  testing during the course of the study, as applicable, and after end of study&#xD;
                  treatment. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence from&#xD;
                  heterosexual contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be&#xD;
                  reviewed on a monthly basis, as applicable, and source documented) or agree to&#xD;
                  use, and be able to comply with, any one of the following highly effective&#xD;
                  contraception methods without interruption, beginning at least 14 days prior to&#xD;

             recommended]) during sexual contact with a pregnant female or FCBP while receiving&#xD;
             study treatment, and for at least 30 days after the last dose of IP, even if he has&#xD;
             undergone a successful vasectomy.&#xD;

          7. Must have a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 33 kg/m2 at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Must be healthy, as determined by the Investigator on the basis of medical history,&#xD;

             upper limit of the reference range on or before check-in (Day -1). Other clinical&#xD;
             laboratory results must be either within normal range or deemed not clinically&#xD;
             significant by the Investigator. Any out of range lab tests may be repeated up to 1&#xD;
             time during Screening and up to 1 time at check-in per Investigator discretion to&#xD;
             confirm eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;

             and females must have a QTcF value ≤ 450 msec. An ECG may be repeated up to 2 times,&#xD;
             and the average of the QTcF values will be used to determine subject eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History (within 3 years prior to Screening) of any clinically significant&#xD;
             neurological, GI, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine,&#xD;
             hematological, dermatological, psychological, or other major disorders as determined&#xD;
             by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, that places the&#xD;
             subject at unacceptable risk if he or she were to participate in the study or&#xD;
             confounds the ability to interpret data from the study (congenital nonhemolytic&#xD;
             hyperbilirubinemia [eg, Gilbert's syndrome] is not acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has prior history of Wernicke's Encephalopathy (WE).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has signs or symptoms of WE (eg, ataxia, ocular paralysis, or cerebellar&#xD;
             signs) without documented exclusion of WE by thiamine level and brain magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has thiamine deficiency, defined as thiamine levels in whole blood below&#xD;
             normal range according to institutional standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of &lt;90 mL/min/1.73 m2 based&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Use of any prescribed systemic or topical medication, including vaccines, within 30&#xD;
             days of the first dose administration (with the exception of any palonosetron&#xD;
             administered for purposes of this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of any nonprescribed systemic or topical medication (including vitamin/mineral&#xD;
             supplements and herbal medicines) within 14 days of the first dose administration&#xD;
             (with the exception of acetaminophen up to 2 grams/day for no more than 3 consecutive&#xD;
             days to treat minor illness or headache [per Investigator judgment]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use of any metabolic enzyme or relevant transporter inhibitors or inducers that would&#xD;
             affect the relevant drugs within 30 days of the first dose administration unless&#xD;

             subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The Indiana University &quot;P450 Drug Interaction Table&quot; should be used to determine&#xD;
             inhibitors and/or inducers of metabolic enzymes&#xD;
             (http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table/aspx). The Sponsor should be contacted&#xD;

             necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Exposure to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days preceding the&#xD;
             first dose administration or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug, if known&#xD;
             (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Presence of any surgical or medical conditions possibly affecting drug absorption,&#xD;
             distribution, metabolism, and excretion (eg, bariatric procedure, cholecystectomy).&#xD;

             antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), or hepatitis C antibody (HCV&#xD;
             Ab); have a positive result to the test for hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus at&#xD;
             screening or have a positive result to the test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
             antibodies at screening. Subjects whose results are compatible with prior immunization&#xD;
             (including natural and vaccination) against hepatitis B may be included at the&#xD;
             discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject smokes &gt; 10 cigarettes per day, or equivalent in other tobacco products, more&#xD;

             serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors, or&#xD;
