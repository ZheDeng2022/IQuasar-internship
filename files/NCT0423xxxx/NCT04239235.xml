  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      INtegrated Support Persons Into Recovery (INSPIRE) is a 4-year research project that tests&#xD;
      whether integrating a patient's support person into a patient's treatment with&#xD;
      Buprenorphine/Naloxone can improve outcomes. The study will examine whether a counseling&#xD;
      program called CRAFT for a support person, such as a family member, spouse or friend, can&#xD;
      improve patient outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid use disorders (OUDs) have reached an all-time high and have devastating effects on the&#xD;
      individual, family, and community. While medication treatment for OUD saves lives, rates of&#xD;
      treatment drop out are very high. In addition, existing OUD treatments neglect the impact of&#xD;
      untreated OUD on the family, and ignore the potential role family members and support persons&#xD;
      (SPs) could have on encouraging long-term recovery. Incorporating the patient's support&#xD;
      system may be an important way to improve treatment retention. The proposed study evaluates a&#xD;
      counseling program for concerned family members, spouses, and friends called Community&#xD;
      Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT), which is successful at engaging and retaining&#xD;
      patients in substance use treatment. While promising, no studies have evaluated whether CRAFT&#xD;
      can help patients remain on medication treatment for OUD, provided by community health&#xD;
      clinics. If effective, this could save lives and help both patient and family member health&#xD;
      outcomes. Patient and SP pairs will be recruited from 17 community health clinics throughout&#xD;
      northern and southern California. Patients taking OUD medication treatment will be recruited&#xD;
      and randomly assign half of the SPs to receive CRAFT; the other half would receive&#xD;
      treatment-as-usual. Patients and SPs will be interviewed three and twelve months later to&#xD;
      evaluate whether patients with CRAFT SPs stay in OUD treatment longer, and whether patient&#xD;
      and SP health outcomes improve.&#xD;
