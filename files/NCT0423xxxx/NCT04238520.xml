      The specific aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Develop a staged and modifiable dyadic oral care intervention to provide&#xD;
      functionally-tailored oral care rehabilitation for community-dwelling persons with dementia&#xD;
      (PWD) and need-based skills training their family caregivers (CGs). Based on the literature&#xD;
      review and MCWB, a 4-week intervention with 8 modules, including universal modules (e.g.,&#xD;
      environmental changes), CG modules (e.g., cuing strategies) and modules for both PWD and CGs&#xD;
      (e.g., oral care techniques), will be developed addressing the relevant SCT constructs (e.g.,&#xD;
      functional deficits of PWD and caregiving needs of CGs). Guided by a validated, widely-used&#xD;
      theory of rehabilitation medicine, modules will be used alone or in combination to provide&#xD;
      personalized, hand-on, functionally-tailored oral care rehabilitation for PWD along with&#xD;
      skills training for CGs to match their caregiving needs. The training focus shifts from the&#xD;
      PWD to the CG, as the independence of the PWD decreases. Semi-structured interviews with&#xD;
      family CGs will then be conducted (until data saturation is reached) to understand their oral&#xD;
      care needs, desired intervention approaches, and the perceived feasibility and utility of the&#xD;
      intervention. The intervention will be revised and then pilot tested with 4 dyads, one per&#xD;
      each of the four functional levels of the DAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the intervention in home settings through a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trial with 40 pairs of PWD and their primary CGs, including immediate&#xD;
      post-intervention and 3-month follow-up. Dyads will be stratified into 4 functional levels&#xD;
      based on the PWD's DAT score and then randomly assigned to the intervention or control&#xD;
      (non-tailored usual care) group.&#xD;

      This study aims to develop and evaluate a functionally-tailored oral hygiene intervention to&#xD;
      improve oral health for community-dwelling persons with dementia, while also reducing&#xD;
      caregiver burden and improving the care partner relationship. The study consists of two&#xD;
      phases. First, we will develop a modularized, functionally-tailorable oral care intervention&#xD;
      based on caregiver qualitative interviews and existing literature. The second phase will then&#xD;
      examine the efficacy and feasibility of the intervention through a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (3 intervention: 1control ratio)with 40 Persons with Dementia/caregiver dyads. Control&#xD;
      participants will receive the standard oral hygiene education currently provided to persons&#xD;
      with Dementia during dental care. The Intervention group will receive 4-week, dyadic,&#xD;
      hands-on, functionally-tailored oral care intervention. We will collect data at baseline,&#xD;
      4-weeks, and 3 months post intervention. After data collection, the differences in the&#xD;
      control and intervention groups in regard to their oral hygiene, behavioral symptoms during&#xD;
      oral care, caregiver outcomes (burden, self-efficacy) and care partner relationship will be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;

      each of the four functional levels of the DAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the intervention in home settings through a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trial with 40 pairs of PWD and their primary CGs, including immediate&#xD;
      post-intervention and 3-month follow-up. Dyads will be stratified into 4 functional levels&#xD;
      based on the PWD's DAT score and then randomly assigned to the intervention or control&#xD;
      (non-tailored usual care) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Aim 2.1 Evaluate the feasibility of the intervention across four domains: acceptability,&#xD;
      demand, implementation, and practicality. We will interview the dyads and review their daily&#xD;
      oral care logs at both post-intervention and 3-month follow-up, assessing satisfaction with,&#xD;
      acceptability of, and actual use of the intervention. Oral care trainers will complete&#xD;
      intervention logs following each training session to document the extent of content delivery,&#xD;
      diversion from the protocol, resources used, and perceptions about intervention success. Exit&#xD;
      interviews with PWD (when possible), CGs, and trainers will be conducted to identify&#xD;
      potential barriers, facilitators, and needed changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Aim 2.2 Examine the efficacy of the intervention. We hypothesize that both PWD oral&#xD;
      hygiene and CG self-efficacy in providing oral care will show clinically significant&#xD;
      improvements for the intervention group compared to the control group. Secondary outcomes for&#xD;
      PWD (e.g., behavior symptoms during oral care), CGs (e.g., oral care related burden) and the&#xD;
      dyadic relationship (e.g., the Dyadic Relationship Scale) will also be explored.&#xD;
