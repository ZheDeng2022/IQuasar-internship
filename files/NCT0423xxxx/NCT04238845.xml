  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria and malnutrition represent major public health concerns worldwide especially in&#xD;
      Sub-Sahara Africa. Despite implementation of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprophylaxis (SMC), an&#xD;
      intervention aimed at reducing malaria prevalence among children aged 6- 59 months, the&#xD;
      burden of malaria and associated mortality among children below age 5 years remains high in&#xD;
      Burkina Faso. This raises the question of what hiding factors may negatively affect the&#xD;
      responsiveness of SMC intervention. Malnutrition, in particular micronutrient deficiency, is&#xD;
      one of these potential factors that can negatively affect the effectiveness of SMC. Treating&#xD;
      micronutrient deficiencies is known to reduce the prevalence of malaria mortality in highly&#xD;
      prevalent malaria zone such as rural settings. Therefore, the hypothesis that a combined&#xD;
      strategy of SMC together with a daily oral nutrients supplement (Vitamin A-Zinc OR fortified&#xD;
      peanut butter-like paste-Plumpy'Doz) will enhance the immune response and decrease the&#xD;
      incidence of malaria in this population and at the same time reduce the burden of&#xD;
      malnutrition among children under SMC coverage was postulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the SMC implementation by the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), children&#xD;
      under SMC coverage will be identified through the Health and Demographic Surveillance System&#xD;
      (HDSS). Children will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups (a) SMC + Vitamin A&#xD;
      alone, (b) SMC + Vitamin A+ Zinc, or (c) SMC+Vitamin A + Plumpy'Doz. After each SMC monthly&#xD;
      distribution, children will be visited at home to confirm drug administration and follow-up&#xD;
      for one year. Anthropometric indicators will be recorded at each visit. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected for thick and thin film and hemoglobin measurement and spotted onto filter paper&#xD;
      for further PCR analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will serve as a pilot of an integrated strategy in order to mutualize resources&#xD;
      for best impact. By relying on existing strategies, the policy implementation of this joint&#xD;
      intervention will be scalable at country and regional levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is hyper-endemic in Burkina Faso and many sub-Saharan Africa countries. According to&#xD;
      the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) approximately 11 915 816 malaria cases and 4 144&#xD;
      malaria-related deaths were reported in 2017 in Burkina Faso. Numerous malaria control&#xD;
      interventions have been implemented in Burkina Faso in order to achieve the 2030 Sustainable&#xD;
      Development Goal (SDG) 3. Seasonal malaria chemo-prevention (SMC) ranks among the largest and&#xD;
      reliable interventions for malaria control in countries with marked seasonality of malaria&#xD;
      transmission. This preventive measures involves administering antimalarial drugs&#xD;
      (Amodiaquine-Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine) to children aged 6- 59 months on a monthly basis&#xD;
      during the high transmission peak. In Burkina Faso, SMC is implemented from July/August to&#xD;
      October/November each year. SMC is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and is&#xD;
      known to reduce malaria morbidity by 30 to 80%. Despite the implementation of this strategy,&#xD;
      the burden of malaria and associated mortality is still very high in this population in&#xD;
      Burkina Faso. This raises questions about other hidden factors that can negatively affect the&#xD;
      effectiveness of SMC intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, malnutrition is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in low-&#xD;
      and middle-income countries such as Burkina Faso. Malnutrition can lower immune system&#xD;
      leading to increased severity of malaria in the population. The National Nutrition Program&#xD;
      (NPP), which is the agency established to address malnutrition problems in Burkina Faso,&#xD;
      currently aims to scale-up Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM). Both malaria&#xD;
      and malnutrition are highly prevalent in rural settings. Furthermore, malaria seasonal peak&#xD;
      coincides with period of food crisis in the country suggesting that malnutrition may&#xD;
      influence malaria incidence during that period. Children under five years again represent the&#xD;
      most vulnerable group. Importantly, treating micronutrient deficiencies is known to reduce&#xD;
      malaria morbidity and mortality. Plumpy'Doz is specifically formulated for prevention of&#xD;
      malnutrition in children from 6 months of age and adults. It has been recommended since 2007&#xD;
      by the WHO, UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), World Food Program (WFP), and the UN Standing&#xD;
      Committee on Nutrition in the joint declaration on community-based management of severe acute&#xD;
      malnutrition. Evidence also shows that Vitamin A-Zinc supplementation reduce malaria&#xD;
      morbidity. A reduction by 20-30% of malaria incidence through micronutrient supplementation&#xD;
      such as Vitamin A-Zinc has also been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These aspects underlie the idea of the SMC-Nutrition project. This combined strategy could&#xD;
      enhance the immune response and therefore decrease the severity of malaria in this population&#xD;
      and at the same time reduce the burden of malnutrition in children under SMC coverage. This&#xD;
      project will serve as a pilot integrated strategy in order to mutualize resources for best&#xD;
      impact. By relying on existing strategies, the policy implementation of this joint&#xD;
      intervention will be scalable at country and regional levels. If the pilot produces promising&#xD;
      results, a large-scale multi-centric assessment of the strategy will be performed in several&#xD;
      SMC countries (i.e. Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and objective(s) Aim 1: To assess the feasibility of combining two different&#xD;
      strategies led by different programs (malaria and nutrition) which affect the same target&#xD;
      population (children under five years). SMC is a larger community-based intervention at a&#xD;
      national level led by the NMCP. National Nutrition Program is trying to scale up the&#xD;
      Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM). This project will serve as a pilot of&#xD;
      integrated strategy in order to mutualize resources for best impact. By relying on existing&#xD;
      strategies, the policy implementation of this joint intervention will be scalable at country&#xD;
      and regional levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To boost the impact of SMC intervention in terms of reducing malaria morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality and reduce the burden of malnutrition and anaemia in children under five years&#xD;
      through supplementation with micronutrients and Vitamin A-Zinc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives 1: to assess in a randomized superiority trial whether SMC + Vitamin A+&#xD;
      Zinc or SMC+ Vitamin A+ Plumpy'Doz is more effective and safe in reducing uncomplicated&#xD;
      malaria incidence, severe malaria incidence and related mortality compared to the SMC+&#xD;
      Vitamin A alone Primary objectives 2: to investigate the impact of the combined strategy in&#xD;
      reducing the burden of malnutrition through reduction of anaemia incidence, mid-upper arm&#xD;
      circumference gain, and weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives 1: to assess the impact of each treatment arm on the circulation&#xD;
      parasite population through monitoring the temporal trend of antimalarial resistance&#xD;
      molecular markers pfcrt, pfmdr1, dhfr and dhps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives 2: to assess the coverage and compliance to SMC in the study area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives 3: to determine the overall risk of adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The target population is children under five years under SMC coverage and&#xD;
      living across HDSS area&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analysis Three subgroups will be defined: (i) SMC + Vitamin A alone (ii) SMC+&#xD;
      Vitamin A+ Zinc and (iii) SMC+ Vitamin A +Plumpy'Doz&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed sample size The overall sample size for the study was estimated at 882 (3Ã—294) to&#xD;
      detect a 10% difference in risk of malaria occurrence between SMC alone group and any of SMC+&#xD;
      supplement group. Further assuming that 20% of the individuals will be lost to follow-up, an&#xD;
      adjusted sample size of 353 children per arm was required. The final estimated sample size&#xD;
      for this study is thus 1,059 children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design This is post-marketing phase. All the products that will be used in this study&#xD;
      are recommended by WHO and are already used as part of routine management of acute&#xD;
      malnutrition in Burkina Faso. Eligible children will be assigned to one of the three study&#xD;
      arms: (i) SMC + Vitamin A alone (ii) SMC+ Vitamin A + Zinc and (iii) SMC+ Vitamin A +&#xD;
      Plumpy'Doz. Administration of Amodiaquine-Sulfadoxine Pyrimethamine (AQ-SP) will not be&#xD;
      performed by the study team but by the NMCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation method A computer-based randomization system will be used to assign the&#xD;
      included children. The allocation will be performed at a central level (pharmacie of the&#xD;
      CRUN) by the pharmacist phone call (pharmacist-field workers) following the inclusion number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protection against sources of bias This will be an open label study. No blinding is planned.&#xD;
      However, to avoid contamination, only one child per household will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration Enrolment of participants will be implemented in parallel with SMC&#xD;
      implementation by the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP). The randomized children will&#xD;
      be followed-up actively for 6 Months and passively for six months to fully cover the high and&#xD;
      low transmission periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product(s) to be tested All the products that will be used in this study are recommended by&#xD;
      WHO and are already used as part of routine management of acute malnutrition in Burkina Faso.&#xD;
      The study products include Vitamin A-Zinc and Plumpy'Doz. Administration of&#xD;
      Amodiaquine-Sulfadoxine Pyrimethamine (AQSP) will not be performed by the study team. SMC is&#xD;
      implemented by the NMCP and all children 6-59 months are expected to be covered. Vitamin A&#xD;
      supplemention will be performed by the Direction of Nutrition as a nationalwide campaign for&#xD;
      the prevention of malnutrition in children under five years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product supply The product will be supplied to the household fortnightly. The stock will be&#xD;
      ordered from accredited manufacturer according to the nutrition program of Burkina Faso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial site selection The study will take place in Nanoro,Burkina Faso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and retention Prior to SMC first Round, children under five years living across&#xD;
      HDSS area will be identified from the dataset of the last update round. Potential study&#xD;
      participants will be randomly drawn from this list of children. Home visit will be performed&#xD;
      to confirm the presence of the child, notify and inform parents of eligible participants&#xD;
      about study and where possible obtain informed consent. Absent children or children whose&#xD;
      parents are not willing to participate, will not be considered and will be replaced by other&#xD;
      eligible children from the list. Children will be included after confirmation of the&#xD;
      administration of the first dose of SMC Round 1 and after written consent is provided by the&#xD;
      parents or guardians. Included children will be randomly allocated to one of the three study&#xD;
      arms: (i) SMC + Vitamin A alone (ii) SMC+ Vitamin A+ Zinc and (iii) SMC+ Vitamin A +&#xD;
      Plumpy'Doz. In case of many eligible children within a household, only one child will be&#xD;
      included in order to avoid contamination between test and control groups. The randomized&#xD;
      children will be followed-up actively for six Months and passively for six the next six&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial subject safety All the products that will be used in this study are recommended by WHO&#xD;
      and are already used as part of routine management of acute malnutrition in Burkina Faso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health service research issues, health economics and/or quality of life measures The project&#xD;
      will promote economic development and welfare in Burkina Faso: the outcomes of this project&#xD;
      will contribute indirectly to the economic development by reducing the burden of malaria and&#xD;
      malnutrition, which constitute significant threats to economic development in the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and/or community involvement The project will involve key stakeholders (Household and&#xD;
      families of children, community health workers, health professionals, policy makers and&#xD;
      representative of local community) at all levels of the health system in Burkina Faso through&#xD;
      regular meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Steering Committee Prior to the study start, a trial steering committee will be set.&#xD;
      This committee will comprise five independent members: a pediatrician, a nutritionist, a&#xD;
      member of the Nanoro health district executive team, representatives of the national malaria&#xD;
      and nutrition programs. The committee will monitor the progress of the trial through regular&#xD;
      teleconferences and physical meetings (twice during the course of the intervention), advice&#xD;
      on the scientific credibility and on specific issues that may arise during the course of the&#xD;
      study. All decisions taken by this committee will be made by majority vote and will be&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Management Board (DSMB) There will be no DSMB. Regular feedback on the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of the combined intervention will be made available to local and&#xD;
      national drug regulatory authorities within the Nanoro site and at the country level. When&#xD;
      children under SMC coverage are missed, local health authorities will be informed&#xD;
      immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Monitoring IRSS will contract an independent monitor and ensure that the study is&#xD;
      adequately monitored. The monitor will verify the best conduct of the study through phone&#xD;
      calls with the principal investigator and other study staff. Two monitoring visits are&#xD;
      planned: an initiation visit before the enrolment of the first participant and a close-out&#xD;
      visit after the last patient has completed the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical and regulatory approval The study protocol will have the approval of the Ethics&#xD;
      Committees for Health Research in Burkina Faso prior to the start of the study.&#xD;
