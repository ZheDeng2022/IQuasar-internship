      BACKGROUND/RATIONALE: The paucity of biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients&#xD;
      affected by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is one of the greatest concerns in ALS&#xD;
      clinics and research. Phenotypic signs, electrophysiological test and clinical scales are&#xD;
      currently used for ALS diagnosis and follow up before and after treatments. Nowadays, the&#xD;
      diagnosis and differential diagnosis used to discriminate ALS from other comparable&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases, are time-consuming and complex processes that reduce the time for&#xD;
      a prompt intervention. Thus, the scientific community is asked to strive for new, measurable,&#xD;
      fast and objective biomarkers for the diagnosis and stratification of patients. Saliva is a&#xD;
      complex biofluid composed of bioactive molecules that can be collected by means of a&#xD;
      non-invasive procedure. The possibility to simultaneously monitor all the variations in the&#xD;
      endocrine, electrolytic and metabolic messengers in saliva has recently suggested its use for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of complex diseases, like neurodegenerative diseases, but only limited&#xD;
      information are available on the potential of saliva as alternative carrier of ALS&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present project is to optimize an innovative, non-invasive and&#xD;
      fast procedure for the ALS onset and for the stratification of ALS patients, taking advantage&#xD;
      of the sensitivity of Raman Spectroscopy (RS) and of accessible saliva. Fondazione Don&#xD;
      Gnocchi (FDG) preliminary results on a small cohort of subjects demonstrated the feasibility&#xD;
      of the methodology and the ability of LABION protocol to obtain a reproducible Raman&#xD;
      fingerprint of saliva that can be used for the discrimination of healthy subjects, ALS&#xD;
      patients and subjects affected by other types of neurological diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Starting from FDG preliminary results, the biochemical composition of saliva in&#xD;
      patients with diagnosed ALS will be evaluated and statistically compared with the one&#xD;
      obtained from age and sex-matched healthy subjects and from patients affected by other&#xD;
      neurological diseases (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases). Moreover, an intra-group ALS&#xD;
      clustering will be analysed in order to verify a different Raman fingerprint obtained from&#xD;
      ALS patients with a bulbar or spinal onset. The collected Raman data will be processed using&#xD;
      a multivariate analysis approach through Principal Component Analysis - Linear Discriminant&#xD;
      Analysis (PCA-LDA). The classification model will be created using cross-validation and&#xD;
      subset validation. Thanks to RS, the overall composition of saliva will be established with&#xD;
      minimal sample preparation, providing comprehensive biochemical fingerprint of the sample. In&#xD;
      parallel, routine salivary parameters will be measured including viscosity, pH, total protein&#xD;
      and carbohydrates concentration, amylase and pepsin, cortisol and Chromogranin A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS: By the end of this study, the investigators expected to verify the&#xD;
      possibility to use the Raman salivary pattern as new promising biomarker for ALS diagnosis&#xD;
      and progression to be related with clinical scales for the personalized and fine tuning of&#xD;
      the therapeutic approach. The intent of this project is to create a classification model able&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the ALS onset&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Discriminate the signal obtained from ALS patients from the one collected from other&#xD;
           neurodegenerative diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stratify ALS patients into bulbar and spinal onset&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Correlate the Raman data with clinical and paraclinical scales used nowadays for ALS&#xD;
           diagnosis and monitoring&#xD;

      SAMPLE COLLECTION: Saliva collection from all the selected subjects will be performed&#xD;
      following the Salivette (SARSTEDT) manufacturer's instructions. To limit variability in&#xD;
      salivary content not related to ALS, saliva will be obtained from all subjects at a fixed&#xD;
      time, after an appropriate lag time from feeding and teeth brushing. Pre-analytical&#xD;
      parameters (i.e. storage temperature and time between collection and processing), dietary and&#xD;
      smoking habit will be properly recorded. Briefly, the swab will be removed, placed in the&#xD;
      mouth and chewed for 60 seconds to stimulate salivation. Then the swab will be centrifuged&#xD;
      for 2 minutes at 1,000 g to remove cells fragments and food debris. Collected samples will be&#xD;
      stored at -80Â° C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE PROCESSING: Before the Raman acquisition, saliva samples will be filtered with&#xD;
      different cut-off ranges (3, 10 and 30 kDa), collecting and analysing by RS the eluted sample&#xD;
      and discarding the concentrated counterpart. For the Raman analysis, a drop of each sample&#xD;
      will be casted on an aluminium foil in order to achieve the Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering&#xD;
      (SERS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION: Raman and SERS spectra will be acquired using an Aramis Raman microscope&#xD;
      (Horiba Jobin-Yvon, France) equipped with a laser light source operating at 785 nm with laser&#xD;
      power ranging from 25-100% (Max power 512 mW). Acquisition time between 10-30 seconds will be&#xD;
      used. The instrument will be calibrated before each analysis using the reference band of&#xD;
      silicon at 520.7 cm-1. Raman spectra will be collected from 15 points following a line-map&#xD;
      from the edge to the centre of the drop. Spectra will be acquired in the region between 400&#xD;
      and 1800 cm-1 using a 50x objective (Olympus, Japan). Spectra resolution is about 1.2 cm-1.&#xD;
      The software package LabSpec 6 (Horiba Jobin-Yvon, France) will be used for map design and&#xD;
      the acquisition of spectra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA PROCESSING: All the acquired spectra will be fit with a fifth-degree polynomial baseline&#xD;
      and normalized by unit vector using the dedicated software LabSpec 6. The contribution of the&#xD;
      substrate will be removed from each spectra. The statistical analysis to validate the method,&#xD;
      will be performed using a multivariate analysis approach. Principal Component analysis (PCA)&#xD;
      will be performed in order to reduce data dimensions and to evidence major trends. The first&#xD;
      20 resultant Principal Components (PCs) will be used in a classification model, Linear&#xD;
      Discriminant Analysis (LDA), to discriminate the data maximizing the variance between the&#xD;
      selected groups. The smallest number of PCs will be selected to prevent data overfitting.&#xD;
      Leave-one-out cross-validation and confusion matrix test will be used to evaluate the method&#xD;
      sensitivity, precision and accuracy of the LDA model. Mann-Whitney will be performed on PCs&#xD;
      scores to verify the differences statistically relevant between the analysed groups.&#xD;
      Correlation and partial correlation analysis will be performed using the Spearman's test,&#xD;
      assuming as valid correlation only the coefficients with a p-value lower than 0.05. The&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be performed using Origin2018 (OriginLab, USA).&#xD;
