  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of an intensive somatosensory intervention&#xD;
      in the upper limb of children with hemiparesis regarding structure, function, activity and&#xD;
      participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive somatosensory activity based intervention is effective in upper limb and hand&#xD;
      ability in children with hemiparesis, specially regarding activity and participation&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Feasibility and longitudinal study with blinding of the evaluator and the person analyzing&#xD;
      the data. The study have 4 procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Assessment pre-intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Intervention: three weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Assessment post-intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Follow-up assessment (three months after intervention).&#xD;

    <description>The intensive somato-sensory intervention will take place during 3 weeks, 5 days per week, for 2 hours per day (30 hours of practice). During the week-ends, some somato-sensory written activities will be explained and handed to each family (6 hours of practice) Therapy sessions will be carried out in groups and each child will have his or her own therapist in charge of his or her treatment along the whole intervention. A daily check-list, design for that purpose, will be used by the therapist in order to register the gradually increased complexity of the activities and individual progression. The principal investigator will supervise all the interventions in order to assure their uniformity, adjusting the somato-sensory training protocol to the individual needs of each subject.</description>
