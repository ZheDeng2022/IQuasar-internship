      A clinical study of USASK AIRWAY - An Improved Oral Airway for Bag-mask Ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical study of MA AIRWAY - An Improved Oral Airway for Bag-mask Ventilation We report a&#xD;
      study with University Research Ethics Board approval of a new oral airway device, the McKay&#xD;
      Airway (MA), designed for easy maintenance of jaw-thrust (see illustration) for first&#xD;
      responders who may perform bag-mask venti-lation (BMV) infrequently, and who often do not&#xD;
      perform it well. Null hypothesis: naïve learners' time to achieve exhaled tidal volume (VE)&#xD;
      &gt;300ml will be no dif-ferent using MA than using a Guedel oropharyngeal airway (OPA) on&#xD;
      anesthetized patients. Design was a repeated-measures unblinded controlled trial with blinded&#xD;
      randomization of the order of airway use, comparing MA versus OPA conducted from July until&#xD;
      December 2019. Anesthesiologists' decision to intervene and comments were recorded.&#xD;
      Consenting learners included medical students, resi-dents from specialties other than&#xD;
      anesthesiology, operating room staff, or naïve learners in technical courses scheduled in the&#xD;
      operating rooms to be taught airway management. Patients were consenting adults booked for&#xD;
      elective surgery under general anesthesia (GA). Excepted patients were those with loose&#xD;
      incisors, tem-poromandibular joint disorders, reflux, those who did not wish to participate,&#xD;
      and those whom the attending anesthesiologist felt put them at any added risk by&#xD;
      par-ticipating. For patients with missing teeth, we padded the MA surface with 1cm thick&#xD;
      stick-on sponge (Reston™ Self-Adhering Foam Pads; 3M, Maplewood MN USA). Patients were under&#xD;
      the direct care of the consenting staff anesthesiologist for that OR. They were recruited in&#xD;
      Pre-Admission Clinic, the hospital wards, Same-Day and Day-Surgery units, and in the OR&#xD;
      holding area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental procedure included normal preoxygenation, induction of anesthesia, and BMV&#xD;
      by the attending anesthesiologist as needed to assure high oxygen saturation prior to opening&#xD;
      an opaque numbered envelope to randomly choose which airway to use first. We mimicked a&#xD;
      self-inflating BMV device with the anesthetic machine by setting the Adjustable Pressure&#xD;
      Limiting (APL) valve to &gt;30cm water pressure and using the oxygen flush to ensure that the&#xD;
      reservoir bag was filled between breath attempts. With the randomized airway in place,&#xD;
      learners applied the mask with their left hand, squeezing the bag with their right&#xD;
      approxi-mately every 3s. We timed from the first bag squeeze until VE exceeded 300ml, then&#xD;
      repeated the experiment with the other airway. We approached 56 patients, recruited 34 female&#xD;
      and 20 male, and obtained data for 51. One obese patient had severe succinylcholine&#xD;
      fasciculations with rapid profound desaturation and the an-esthesiologist took over&#xD;
      immediately, and for two the anesthesiologist misunder-stood the experiment. Time&#xD;
      measurements were analysed with Wilcoxon's Signed Rank test, incidences with Fisher's Exact&#xD;
      test or Chi Square. MA allowed faster adequate ventilation than OPA: Hodges-Lehmann median&#xD;
      difference: 6s [95% CI 5 to 6.3s]; quartiles: OPA 9.5 to 37s; MA 7 to 16s range: OPA 5 to&#xD;
      78s; MA 2 to 49s; p = 0.02. When used first, the MA was faster than the OPA 30% of times&#xD;
      compared to 11% when OPA was used first (p = 0.04), suggesting that MA may be easier to&#xD;
      learn. Comments: 16 preferred the MA, 2 the OPA, and 15 had no preference (p = 0.02 compared&#xD;
      to equal preferences). Further studies are warrant-ed.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION A newly invented airway device, the McKay Airway (MA) may improve ventilating a&#xD;
      patient with a mask and self-inflating bag attached to an oxygen source (bag-mask&#xD;
      ventilation: BMV), a common and often lifesaving step in anesthesia, intensive care, and&#xD;
      emergency practice. BMV has been shown to frequently provide no or inadequate ventilation in&#xD;
      the hands of beginners or those who practice it rarely; studies report successful BMV by&#xD;
      beginners of 43 to 85%, with the latter requiring an average time of 44s to achieve&#xD;
      successful ventilation. A study is proposed to assess the functionality of the device for BMV&#xD;
      comparing MA with the widely used Guedel oropharyngeal airway (OPA). The MA does not cause&#xD;
      gagging or vomiting in patients with a fluctuating level of consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: Naïve learners will perform BMV no better using the new MA device than using&#xD;
      a Guedel airway (current standard device in use for BMV) as measured by time to Vt &gt; 300ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Repeated-measures unblinded randomized controlled trial (RCT), with randomization of&#xD;
      the order of use, comparing BMV using a Guedel air or the MA device on the same participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Time from applying the mask to achieving ventilation with Vt &gt; 300ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: An anesthesiologist's decision to intervene will be noted and counted&#xD;
      should it occur. If there is adequate ventilation by 30s, the attempt will be considered a&#xD;
      success; otherwise a failure. Scores will be recorded on rating scales for each BMV method:&#xD;
      ease of insertion, ease of holding the mask properly, ease of obtaining a good seal, ease of&#xD;
      obtaining an open airway, and likelihood of employing the method in practice. Comments about&#xD;
      overall impression will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Participants are of three kinds: learners, patients, and anesthesiologists.&#xD;
      Learners will be consenting medical students, residents from specialties other than&#xD;
      anesthesiology, or naïve learners in the Respiratory Technician or Emergency Medical&#xD;
      Technician courses, all of whom are routinely rotated through the Saskatoon operating rooms&#xD;
      (ORs) to learn airway management. Excepted will be learners who do not wish to participate.&#xD;
      Patients will be consenting adult (age ≥ 18 years) patients booked into the operating rooms&#xD;
      of SHR for elective surgery under general anesthesia (GA). BMV is normal clinical practice&#xD;
      for all patients as part of the induction and emergence phases of GA. Excepted patients will&#xD;
      be those with temporomandibular joint disorders, those who do not wish to participate, those&#xD;
      whom the attending anesthesiologist feels puts them at any added risk by participating, and&#xD;
      those whose anesthetic plan is changed from GA to a regional anesthetic technique. They will&#xD;
      be under the direct constant care of the consenting staff anesthesiologist for that OR.&#xD;
      Excepted anesthesiologists will be those who do not wish to participate in the study in&#xD;
      general or for any particular patient or operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants: Sample size calculation for repeated measures t-test with effect size&#xD;
      0.33, alpha 0.05, power 0.8 is 59. We will recruit 65 to 80 for logistical OR exigencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent: With University of Saskatchewan Research Ethics Board approval, investigators, will&#xD;
      recruit learners, anesthesiologists, and patients. Patients will be recruited in&#xD;
      Pre-Admission Clinic (PAC), on the hospital wards, in Same-Day and Day-Surgery units, and in&#xD;
      the OR holding area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and privacy concerns will accord with University of Saskatchewan Ethics Committee&#xD;
      principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient safety: The experiment will be overseen by the attending specialist anesthesiologist&#xD;
      who will intervene immediately as needed and proceed as clinically indicated if even the&#xD;
      smallest issue of patient safety arises during learners' attempts at BMV. This is not&#xD;
      different from the normal clinical teaching situation. Risk to participating patients is&#xD;
      minimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Prior to their rotation in the ORs, consenting learners will watch teaching&#xD;
      videos to learn BMV using OPA and MA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Demographic data will be tabulated as observational. Time measurements&#xD;
      will be tested for normality by Shapiro-Wilk, and if passed, by paired t-test; otherwise by&#xD;
      Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. Incidence data will be compared by Fishers Exact test or&#xD;
      Chi-squared.&#xD;
