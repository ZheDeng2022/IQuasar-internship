  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and performance of a new robotic device in the treatment of&#xD;
      hepatic thermoablation in adults. The new robotic device will be used in all patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The device is a user controlled, stereotactic accessory intended to assist in the planning&#xD;
      and manual advancement of needle, as well as in verification of needle position during CT&#xD;
      guided percutaneous ablation procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After validation of the correct positioning of the needle, the tumor ablation procedure is&#xD;
      conducted with a device routinely used by the investigator. The Acquisition of a&#xD;
      post-interventional CT-guided image is realized to evaluate adverse events occurrence.&#xD;
