      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States. The way that doctors&#xD;
      remove tumors in bladder surgeries may leave some cancer . Also, many people have their&#xD;
      tumors return or progress after surgery. Researchers want to test a modified device. It might&#xD;
      tell doctors more about bladder tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if using a modified standard device with bladder surgery can provide better&#xD;
      information about tumors in bladder specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who need to have their bladder removed at the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and prior surgical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of existing MRI, x-ray, or CT scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of existing specimens and reports&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy test for women of childbearing age&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT or MRI: Participants will lie in a machine. The machine will take pictures of their body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have bladder surgery. This will occur in the same way as if they did not&#xD;
      take part in this study. A member of the research team will cut the removed bladder using the&#xD;
      modified device. This will most likely be done on a separate back table in the operating&#xD;
      room. The bladder and samples after cutting will be sent out for review. The will occur just&#xD;
      as it would if the participants were not in this study. The only difference is the way that&#xD;
      the specimen is prepared for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants follow-up care will occur per standard of care. Or it will occur as part of any&#xD;
      other study in which they might also be enrolled.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, disproportionately&#xD;
           affecting more men than women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The gold standard for the surgical treatment and diagnosis of non-muscle invasive&#xD;
           bladder cancer is transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TURBT requires the fragmentation of bladder tumors and piecemeal removal of these&#xD;
           tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TURBT leads to loss of histopathologic information - including tumor orientation, size,&#xD;
           and margin status - which may compromise outcomes and risk tumor seeding within the&#xD;
           bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Given these multiple problems with TURBT we are testing some modifications to the&#xD;
           current resectoscope device and the effect of these modifications on the quality of&#xD;
           TURBT specimens produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The redesigned resectoscope device will be tested ex-vivo on cystectomy specimens to&#xD;
           avoid risks to patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if resectoscope device modification can&#xD;
      provide improved pathologic standards for the TURBT procedure. An improvement in any of the&#xD;
      parameters outlined below will constitute a device improvement in the current resectoscope:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of three tissue layers within the tumor specimens containing bladder mucosa,&#xD;
           lamina propria, and portions of the muscularis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information regarding tumor margin, assessed as the ability to ascertain if tumor is&#xD;
           present at the margin of the resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical condition requiring surgical removal of the bladder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men and women, age &gt;= 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preclinical tissue acquisition trial, ex vivo, proof-of-concept.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following cystectomy, a modified resectoscope/redesigned resectoscope will be used to&#xD;
           resect areas of tumor from the cystectomy specimens. These resected tumors will be sent&#xD;
           with the cystectomy specimen for histopathology to assess the size of resection, depth&#xD;
           of resection, and ability to ascertain tumor orientation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The remainder of the cystectomy specimens will undergo traditional histopathology.&#xD;
           Histopathologic information from both specimens will be included in the final&#xD;
           histopathologic diagnosis to ensure accurate oncology staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will allow for about 2 years of accrual and the accrual ceiling will be set&#xD;
           at 25 subjects.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring surgical removal of the bladder at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Reasons for need for surgical removal of bladder include cancer or benign condition&#xD;
        for which a surgeon determined surgical removal of the bladder is recommended. Patient's&#xD;
        with invasive bladder cancer requiring cystectomy are eligible for enrollment. Bladder&#xD;
        cancer remains the most common reason for cystectomy. Patients with clinical advanced&#xD;
        disease and having other treatments/or participating in other trials remain eligible for&#xD;
        enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or less than 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Deemed clinically appropriate for the planned surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be asked to co-enroll in 15-C-0087, &quot;Care of the Urothelial Cancer&#xD;
             Patient and Prospective Collection of Biospecimens from Healthy Volunteers and&#xD;
             Urothelial Cancer Patients.&quot; NOTE: Most participants are expected to already be&#xD;
             enrolled in 15-C-0087 prior to entry in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Cystectomy during pregnancy would subject the fetus to significant risk of miscarriage or&#xD;
        premature labor. For this reason, pregnant women are ineligible for this study.&#xD;
