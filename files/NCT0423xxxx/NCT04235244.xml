      The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of three different cold application&#xD;
      methods on ecchymosis and pain in the injection site in patients who received DMAH injection&#xD;
      from the SC route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, the research universe will be composed of the&#xD;
      patients who underwent DMAH from the SC path in Internal Medicine Service at a State Hospital&#xD;
      under the Ministry of Health. The sample will consist of patients who meet the research&#xD;
      criteria, who are informed about the purpose of the research, and who are willing to&#xD;
      participate after obtaining the permission of the Ethics Committee and institution. The&#xD;
      sample will consist of patients who meet the research criteria, who are informed about the&#xD;
      purpose of the research, and who are willing to participate after obtaining the permission of&#xD;
      the Ethics Committee and institution. The sample size (d=0.785) was found by reference from&#xD;
      the article &quot;effect of ice application on ecchymosis formation in patients undergoing&#xD;
      subcutaneous anticoagulant therapy&quot; by Küçükgüçlü and Okumu (2010) and the sample size&#xD;
      required for 1-β=0.95 (power) in α=0.05 was n = 38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Data Sheet, SC Road injection tracking chart, Visual Analog scale, Opsite - Flexigrid&#xD;
      measurement tool, Mekano-analgesia (Buzzy) device, local coolant spray and acetate Pen will&#xD;
      be used for data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 25.0 software will be used for statistical&#xD;
      analysis of research data. If the data set matches the normal distribution, parametric&#xD;
      hypothesis tests will be used, and if the data set does not match the normal distribution,&#xD;
      nonparametric hypothesis tests will be used.&#xD;

      Thromboembolism is a frequently seen complication in patients who undergo long-term movement&#xD;
      restriction and undergo surgical intervention, causing serious consequences such as pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism . For this reason, heparin is frequently used for protective or therapeutic purposes&#xD;
      in clinical situations where there is a risk of venous thromboembolism or thromboembolytic&#xD;
      events . In the 1980s, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) preparations, often administered&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC), were developed in order to increase the desired effect and reduce the&#xD;
      side effects of heparin applications . It is stated in the literature that SC injection&#xD;
      applications can be safely injected into the outer-lateral side of the upper arm, anterior&#xD;
      aspect of the thigh, under the scapula and abdominal region . However, in the literature, it&#xD;
      is emphasized that ecchymosis and hematoma formation is more common in SC LMWH applications,&#xD;
      especially in the arm and thigh areas after SC injection. Therefore, in LMWH applications, it&#xD;
      is stated that abdominal region is the most reliable injection site because it has thicker SC&#xD;
      tissue compared to other parts of the body . In summary studies, it is recommended as the&#xD;
      preferred site for LMWH applications due to the excess of SC fat tissue in the abdominal&#xD;
      region, its width to allow rotation of the injection site and the lack of muscle activity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic and local complications may occur due to heparin injection by SC route. The most&#xD;
      important local complications are; ecchymosis at the injection site, hematoma formation and&#xD;
      local pain formation at the injection site . In this study, the frequency of ecchymosis; Kuz&#xD;
      and Uçar (2001) 11.4%, Dursun and Balcı Akpınar (2014) 28.7%, Küçükgüçlü and Okumuş (2010)&#xD;
      31%, Varghese et al. (2006) 36%, Palese (2013) 38%, Yildirim and Atalay (2005) 57%, Zaybak&#xD;
      and Khorshid (2008) reported as 64%. These treatment-related complications complicate the use&#xD;
      of the damaged area in subsequent injections, adversely affect drug absorption, and cause&#xD;
      physical trauma (ecchymosis, hematoma and pain) and changes in body image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is a subjective experience that can occur in very different qualities and severity. Pain&#xD;
      experienced due to injection is generally defined as a condition that occurs as a result of&#xD;
      mechanical trauma in the tissue and stimulates the nerve fiber ends with the entry of the&#xD;
      needle into the tissue. Due to the presence of pain receptors in SC tissue, patients often&#xD;
      experience discomfort and pain during and after LMWH applications. Pain during injection&#xD;
      significantly affects the patient's non-compliance to treatment and pain after injection&#xD;
      significantly affects the comfort and life activities of the patient by restricting the use&#xD;
      of the extremity . One of the methods used to prevent these negative complications is cold&#xD;
      applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local cold administration reduces blood flow through vasoconstriction of the arterioles,&#xD;
      controls bleeding and reduces ecchymosis and hematoma development . In addition, local cold&#xD;
      application provides vasoconstriction in the tissue to which it is applied, slows blood flow&#xD;
      and increases the viscosity of the blood, limits edema and inflammatory process, controls&#xD;
      bleeding by reducing capillary permability, and reduces pain perception . With this localized&#xD;
      sensory effect, attention is directed towards cold from pain, and thus pain is alleviated by&#xD;
      the anesthetic effect of cold . In the studies carried out on the subject; It has been&#xD;
      reported that 5 minutes of local humid cold application after SC injection results in a&#xD;
      reduction in the severity and pain rate of ecchymosis . Küçükgüçlü and Okumuş (2010); SC&#xD;
      indicated that two minutes of ice application to the heparin administration site before and&#xD;
      after administration was an effective method of reducing ecchymosis and hematoma. Avşar and&#xD;
      Kaşıkçı (2013); They found that two minutes of cold application to the SC injection site&#xD;
      reduced ecchymosis and pain. Şendir et al. (2015) SC injection time of 30 seconds and 5&#xD;
      minutes before and after the injection of local ice application, effective in reducing the&#xD;
      intensity of pain and ecchymosis was reported to be effective. Similarly, Korkmazcan (2016)&#xD;
      emphasizes that application of local ice to the skin is effective for reducing ecchymosis,&#xD;
      hematoma and pain in SC LMWH injections. In addition, it is reported that pre-injection&#xD;
      coolant spray and thermo-mechanical analgesia method reduce pain intensity in LMWH&#xD;
      applications via SC .&#xD;
&#xD;
      SC injection applications are an important part of drug applications and are frequently&#xD;
      performed by nurses in clinical practice. Complications resulting from these applications&#xD;
      cause physical and mental trauma in patients, they are reluctant to make the next injection,&#xD;
      and for nurses, ecchymosis, hematoma and pain occurring at the injection site play a&#xD;
      restrictive role in the selection of the site. This is an important problem for patients&#xD;
      receiving heparin treatment for a long time; It is seen that different cold application&#xD;
      methods such as ice application, cooling spray and thermo-mechanical analgesia techniques are&#xD;
      used in heparin injections by SC route. However, there is no study on which these methods are&#xD;
      used together and the effects of these methods are compared. This work; The aim of this study&#xD;
      was to investigate the effect of three different cold application methods on ecchymosis and&#xD;
      pain formation at the injection site in patients undergoing LMWH injection via SC.&#xD;
