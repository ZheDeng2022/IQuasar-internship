  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, healthy adult volunteers will undergo two positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      scans using the radiotracer [11C]PBR28 which binds to the 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO).&#xD;
      Approximately 3 hours prior to the second [11C]PBR28 PET scan, lipopolysaccharide (LPS;&#xD;
      endotoxin) will be administered to evoke a robust neuroimmune response. Subjects will also&#xD;
      undergo behavioral and cognitive testing. Vital signs, subjective response, and peripheral&#xD;
      cytokine levels will be assayed periodically throughout the experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims: Quantify the magnitude of neuroimmune response after a classical immune&#xD;
      stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims: Quantify changes in cognitive function after a classical immune stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Individuals will exhibit a robust whole-brain neuroimmune response and impaired&#xD;
      cognitive function after LPS.&#xD;
