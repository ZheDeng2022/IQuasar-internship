  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the advent of multiple novel medications, many patients with Crohn's disease (CD)&#xD;
      fail to achieve mucosal healing (MH). Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has been shown to&#xD;
      induce clinical remission accompanied by MH in many of CD patients. The aim of this proposal&#xD;
      is to explore the effectiveness of the &quot;Tasty&amp;Healthy&quot; dietary approach based on avoiding&#xD;
      &quot;pro-inflammatory&quot; and processed ingredients, for inducing and maintaining remission and MH&#xD;
      in children and young adults. This approach is based on the previously published charity&#xD;
      cook-book &quot;Tasty&amp;Healthy&quot; and might be more feasible than currently available nutritional&#xD;
      treatments in CD. It does not offer a rigid diet with specific nutrients and does not require&#xD;
      concurrent use of a formula feed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a flexible dietary intervention of excluding processed and&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory ingredients will improve the rate of clinical remission and MH without the&#xD;
      need for liquid formula or structured rigid diet which are more difficult to adhere to. The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize that home kits of Fecal calprotectin (FC), can personalize the&#xD;
      diet thereby increasing feasibility for maintenance therapy in some patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to conduct a set of three studies: Two randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      (RCT) both including the Tasty&amp;Healthy dietary intervention for 8 weeks in CD patients aged&#xD;
      6-24 years vs. 1) EEN in mild-moderate CD, and the other RCT vs. 2) a control group&#xD;
      continuing their habitual diet in those with mucosal inflammation despite stable medical&#xD;
      treatment, but who are in clinical remission or have only minimal symptoms not requiring&#xD;
      immediate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a third study, responders from both trials will be offered to participate in an open label&#xD;
      extension personalized-diet study of further 16 weeks (total 24 weeks), in which gluten and&#xD;
      dairy will be gradually re-introduced based on repeated monthly home assays of FC while&#xD;
      otherwise following the Tasty&amp;Healthy dietary intervention in a treat-to-target management&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated at baseline, week 4 and week 8 with additional weekly phone visits&#xD;
      to ensure adherence with the diets and address questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extension study will include two clinic visits at weeks 16 and 24 and a monthly call to&#xD;
      ensure adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to establish a dietary-approach which is simpler to implement than&#xD;
      current nutritional alternatives. It will enable high flexibility in the allowed foods and&#xD;
      does not require liquid formula. In turn, this could position Tasty&amp;Healthy, not merely for&#xD;
      inducing remission, but also as a feasible maintenance strategy in selected patients.&#xD;

    <description>Percent of patients tolerating the diet. Tolerance is defined as the absence of all of the three following items:&#xD;
Intolerance: cessation of dietary therapy because of patient's refusal to continue diet (based on reporting and the 24 hour recall);&#xD;
Poor adherence based on the modified Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) questionnaire; The modified MARS questionnaire rates How closely patients adhere to the diet. This is a self-report measure of adherence. It can be used to determine patients' willingness and ability to comply with the diet daily. A score of 1-5 indicates that the patient is not adherent; a score of 6-9 indicates that the patient is adherent.&#xD;
Poor adherence based on direct questioning (any answer other than &quot;adheres to diet very often/always&quot; will be considered poor compliant).</description>
