  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to assess the safety, and performance of the LapBox in patients in terms of duration of&#xD;
      deployment, organ insertion into the &quot;LapBox&quot; bag, ease of use, success of containment and&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LapBox is intended for use as a laparoscopic instrument port and tissue containment&#xD;
      system that creates a working space allowing for visualization during power or manual&#xD;
      morcellation procedure following a laparoscopic procedure for the excision of benign&#xD;
      gynecologic tissue that is not suspected to contain malignancy Ten (10) adult female&#xD;
      patients, scheduled for the laparoscopic gynecological procedure, with up to 700gr mass to be&#xD;
      removed and with no suspicion of malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic hysterectomy, myomectomy or removal of an&#xD;
      adnexal mass where either manual morcellation or power morcellation is needed for tissue will&#xD;
      be enrolled. Each patient will be required to participate in 3 visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Screening and Enrollment, as part of the pre-operative visit and confirmation of&#xD;
      compliance. Such a visit can be more than 1 day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Laparoscopic organ removal procedure- morcellation utilizing LapBox containment&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3:up appointment up to 7 weeks (7 days) post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During visit 2 (laparoscopic organ removal procedure), the following steps will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following tissue harvest and prior to morcellation, a peritoneal wash sample will be&#xD;
           obtained for a cytology evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The LapBox will then be inserted to the patient abdomen through the abdominal wall and&#xD;
           deployed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The harvested tissue will be inserted into the LapBox using standard technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The LapBox opening will be extracted outside the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depending on the type of morcellation (power or mechanical), the incision may be&#xD;
           extended as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The appropriate type of port will be placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power morcellation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The morcellator will be inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The laparoscope will be placed inside the bag and provide visualization of the&#xD;
           procedure. Alternatively, direct visualization may be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The morcellator will be operated in a standardized fashion. Manual morcellation will be&#xD;
           performed as per standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The LapBox will be removed through the abdominal opening. A second peritoneal wash&#xD;
           sample will be obtained for a cytology evaluation in order to compare pre and post&#xD;
           morcellation findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the procedure, tissue weight will be recorded, and leakage testing will be&#xD;
      performed on used devices.&#xD;
