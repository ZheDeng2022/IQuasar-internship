    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, two-arm randomized controlled trial. 100 patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      resistant depression in psychiatric care clinic in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of two conditions: (1) enrolment in rTMS sessions alone (2) enrolment in&#xD;
      the rTMS sessions plus iCBT. Patients in each group will complete evaluation measures (eg,&#xD;
      recovery, general symptomatology and functional outcomes) at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and&#xD;
      6 months. The primary outcome measure would be changes to scores on the Hamilton Depression&#xD;
      Rating Scale. Patient service utilization data and clinician-rated measures will also be used&#xD;
      to gauge patient progress. Patient data will be analyzed with descriptive statistics,&#xD;
      repeated measures and correlational analyses.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major depression is a severe, disabling, and potentially lethal clinical disorder. While&#xD;
      there are a wide variety of pharmaceutical agents available as treatments for major&#xD;
      depression, only about half of patients respond to an initial course of antidepressant&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy, It has been conservatively estimated that at least 15% of all patients with&#xD;
      major depressive disorder remain refractory to any treatment intervention. While a complex&#xD;
      relationship exists between disease chronicity and ineffective treatment, clinical evidence&#xD;
      suggests that the greater the number of treatment failures, the less likelihood of a good&#xD;
      treatment response to subsequent interventions. The reported results of the STAR*D study are&#xD;
      the most vivid example of this clinical phenomenon. In that work, there was a progressive&#xD;
      likelihood of poorer response with each successive treatment failure. For example, after the&#xD;
      first treatment attempt, about 30% of patients remitted. By the time that a patient had&#xD;
      experienced definitive treatment failures, the likelihood of achieving remission with the&#xD;
      fourth treatment option offered fell below 10%. Taken together, these facts underline the&#xD;
      clinical urgency for physicians to identify treatment resistant patients as early as possible&#xD;
      so that alternative treatments with proven efficacies may be offered sooner. In turn, this&#xD;
      will result in superior treatment outcomes for these treatment resistant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technology and the Internet have dramatically changed medicine. According to Statistics&#xD;
      Canada, 83% of Canadians had Internet access in 2012, and more than 70% use the Internet&#xD;
      daily; 62% were smartphone users. E-Mental health refers to the use of computers, Internet,&#xD;
      and mobile devices for mental health information and care. E-Mental health applications are&#xD;
      now widely available for information, screening, assessment and monitoring, interactive&#xD;
      self-management, psychotherapy, and social support. Clinicians should be aware that there are&#xD;
      benefits and potential harms to using and recommending e-Mental health applications and that&#xD;
      few have good-quality evidence to support effectiveness. Meta-analyses and reviews of&#xD;
      computer-based psychological treatment for the treatment of MDD, whether delivered over the&#xD;
      Internet or as a stand-alone program, demonstrate convincing support for these treatment&#xD;
      modalities. Internet- and computer-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT) can also be&#xD;
      helpful in relapse prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2009, the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT), a not-for-profit&#xD;
      scientific and educational organization, published a revision of evidence-based clinical&#xD;
      guidelines for the treatment of depressive disorders. CANMAT has updated these guidelines in&#xD;
      2016 to reflect new evidence in the field. Neurostimulation, or neuromodulation, is an&#xD;
      expanding area of research and clinical interest, driven in part by the increasing knowledge&#xD;
      base on the neurocircuitry of depression. Most of these neurostimulation treatments have been&#xD;
      studied and are used in patients with TRD who have failed to respond to standard treatments.&#xD;
      However, there is no previous study which has examined the effect of rTMS plus iCBT in&#xD;
      comparison to rTMS alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS):&#xD;
&#xD;
      rTMS uses powerful (1.0-2.5 Tesla), focused magnetic field pulses to induce electrical&#xD;
      currents in neural tissue noninvasively, via an inductor coil placed against the scalp.&#xD;
      Therapeutic rTMS is usually delivered by a trained technician or nurse, under physician&#xD;
      supervision. Unlike Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), no anesthesia is required. The&#xD;
      therapeutic mechanism of rTMS is still under investigation, with mechanisms proposed at both&#xD;
      cell-molecular and network levels. Repeated rTMS sessions can exert therapeutic effects&#xD;
      lasting several months. Clinical trials and naturalistic studies have found maximal effects&#xD;
      at 26 to 28 sessions. Clinical experience concurs in suggesting 20 sessions before declaring&#xD;
      treatment failure, with extension to 25 to 30 sessions if improvements occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 30 systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been conducted on rTMS in depression,&#xD;
      with most studies involving patients with some degree of treatment resistance (i.e., having&#xD;
      failed at least 1 or 2 antidepressant trials). Overall, rTMS is considered a first-line&#xD;
      treatment for MDD for patients who have failed at least 1 antidepressant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) Psychotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based, structured, intensive, time-limited,&#xD;
      symptom-focused form of psychotherapy recommended for the treatment of major depression and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders. Internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) is structured CBT delivered via the&#xD;
      internet. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps people become aware of how certain negative&#xD;
      automatic thoughts, attitudes, expectations, and beliefs contribute to feelings of sadness&#xD;
      and anxiety. People undergoing CBT learn how their thinking patterns, which may have&#xD;
      developed in the past to deal with difficult or painful experiences, can be identified and&#xD;
      changed to reduce unhappiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barriers to face-to-face conventional ways for treatment include stigmas around people&#xD;
      seeking help in person, geography (distance from health care professional), time, and cost.&#xD;
      Increasingly, there is a desire to pursue internet delivery as an option to increase access&#xD;
      to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) consists of structured modules with clearly defined goals, and&#xD;
      is delivered via the internet. Although there are many types of iCBT programs, each are&#xD;
      goal-oriented sessions that typically consist of 8 to 12 modules and can be guided or&#xD;
      unguided. Internet-delivered CBT programs are made available by computer, smartphone, or&#xD;
      tablet, for a fee. With unguided iCBT, patients are informed of a website through which they&#xD;
      can participate in an online self-directed program. Guided iCBT involves support from a&#xD;
      regulated health professional (e.g., social worker, psychologist, psychotherapist,&#xD;
      occupational therapist, nurse, or physician). In guided iCBT, people complete modules and&#xD;
      communicate (via email, text messages, or telephone calls) their progress to a regulated&#xD;
      health professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES A goal of the project is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing rTMS plus&#xD;
      iCBT for treatment of patients diagnosed with TRD. Another goal of the project is to assess&#xD;
      the initial comparative clinical effectiveness of rTMS treatments when used with and without&#xD;
      iCBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the limited availability of data in this specific area, another goal of the study&#xD;
      is to generate effect size data for these interventions which will help in sample size and&#xD;
      power calculations for a full randomized clinical trial. The patient's outcomes are organized&#xD;
      according to: recovery variables (eg, recovery and stigma), functional variables (quality of&#xD;
      life and employment), symptom variables (psychological symptoms and general outcomes) and&#xD;
      other outcomes will be service variables (eg, heath service utilization, cost and&#xD;
      satisfaction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a prospective, parallel design, two-arm, rater-blinded Randomized&#xD;
      Controlled Trial (RCT) with a recruitment period of 12 months and applying active treatment&#xD;
      for 6 weeks and an observation period of 6 months for each participant. The research will be&#xD;
      carried out in an Addiction and Mental Health clinic in a large, socio-demographically&#xD;
      diverse city in Western Canada (Edmonton, Alberta).&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS Patients would be randomly assigned to receive either rTMS alone or rTMSplus&#xD;
      iCBT Patients in both arms of the study will be assigned to an introductory visit to&#xD;
      introduce the rTMS system to them and explain the procedure which will be carried out in each&#xD;
      visit. All patients will be scheduled to receive 30 sessions of rTMS treatments over a&#xD;
      six-week period as pre-determined by Alberta Health Services' Strategic Clinical Network for&#xD;
      Addiction and Mental Health. In addition, patients in the rTMS plus iCBT arm of the study,&#xD;
      would be assisted to register on the iCBT program (MoodGym) to receive unique login&#xD;
      information. To reduce in-person contact due to COVID-19 protocols, patients would be&#xD;
      remotely assisted via phone to participate in 12 one-hour sessions of iCBT at the clinic&#xD;
      prior to receiving rTMS treatments. These iCBT sessions would be scheduled in about three&#xD;
      days intervals (ideally Tuesdays and Thursdays) so that patients receive two iCBT sessions&#xD;
      each week. Patients would also be encouraged to continue with iCBT treatments beyond the&#xD;
      scheduled sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up for 6 months and would be encouraged to continue to receive&#xD;
      whatever community clinic/ program treatments or supports are part of their usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS The investigators hypothesize that patients enrolled in the rTMS plus iCBT&#xD;
      treatment arm of the study will achieve superior outcomes compared with patients enrolled in&#xD;
      the rTMS alone arm of the study on each outcome measure used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE The study will therefore be limited to a sample size of 100, with about 50&#xD;
      patients recruited into each arm of the study. Patients transitioning from resistance of the&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment are vulnerable to severe depressive attacks, and it can reasonably&#xD;
      be expected that only a small number of eligible participants will enroll in and complete the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING Randomization will be stratified by using permuted blocks to&#xD;
      ensure balance (1:1) between the two follow-up treatment groups. The randomization codes will&#xD;
      be transmitted by an independent statistician via text message directly to a researcher's&#xD;
      password-protected phone line with a secure online backup. This will commence as soon as&#xD;
      participants sign the consent forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because it will not be possible for participants to be blinded, treatment allocation will be&#xD;
      made explicit to them as soon as randomization is concluded. Primary outcome assessors will&#xD;
      be blinded to treatment group allocation by not involving them in discussions about study&#xD;
      participants and not granting them access to the database which contains the randomization&#xD;
      code. After data collection is complete, all data will undergo a blind review for the&#xD;
      purposes of finalizing the planned analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT At 1, 3 and 6 months, a blinded researcher will contact all study&#xD;
      participants and assist them to complete a range of assessment tools relating to the primary&#xD;
      and secondary outcome measures. They will be offered the opportunity to complete the&#xD;
      assessments face to face or over the phone. At 6 months, data related to each person's&#xD;
      clinic/ programme attendance rates and utilization of health services will be compiled from&#xD;
      administrative records by the blinded researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT This study was designed to address the clinical urgency to&#xD;
      identify and respond to early evidence of treatment resistance using treatments that have&#xD;
      proven efficacy in these more difficult-to-treat psychiatric patients. The study is designed&#xD;
      as patient-oriented research with the active involvement of a patient representative who will&#xD;
      be a coauthor of the study protocol. The randomized trial offers patients the opportunity to&#xD;
      provide feedback regarding the burden of the intervention through a focused group workshop&#xD;
      involving a cross section of patients in the two arms of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki (Hong Kong Amendment) and Good Clinical Practice (Canadian Guidelines). Written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from each participant. The study results, expected 18&#xD;
      months after commencement of recruitment, will be disseminated at several levels, including&#xD;
      patients, practitioners, academics/researchers, and healthcare organizations.&#xD;

    <measure>Young Mania Rating Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess mania as a symptom variable.There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients. There are well described anchor points for each grade of severity. The authors encourage the use of whole or half point ratings once experience with the scale is acquired. Typical YMRS baseline scores can vary a lot. They depend on the patients' clinical features such as mania (YMRS = 12), depression (YMRS = 3), or euthymia (YMRS = 2). Sometimes a clinical study entry requirement of YMRS &gt; 20 generates a mean YMRS baseline of about 30. Strengths of the YMRS include its brevity, widely accepted use, and ease of administration. The usefulness of the scale is limited in populations with diagnoses other than mania.</description>
