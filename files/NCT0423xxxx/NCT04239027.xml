  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is characterized by the presence of&#xD;
      choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Choroidal neovascularization consists of abnormal blood&#xD;
      vessels originating from the choroid and can lead to hemorrhage, fluid exudation, and&#xD;
      fibrosis, resulting in photoreceptor damage and vision loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy of brolucizumab has been demonstrated in 2 randomized, multicenter,&#xD;
      double-masked, active controlled Phase 3 studies in nAMD patients (RTH258-C001 and&#xD;
      RTH258-C002). Anatomical changes were evaluated in these studies using spectral domain&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), which relied on indirect parameters for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of active CNV. The OCT-angiography (OCT A) that directly visualize retinal circulation and&#xD;
      image CNV and vascular diseases of the retina was not included in previous brolcuizumab&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-arm, open-label, multicenter study is being performed to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of brolucizumab 6 mg in patients with nAMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT-A will be used in this study to assess the morphological response of patients to&#xD;
      brolucizumab in terms of percentage change in CNV lesion area in the short term (i.e. at Week&#xD;
      12) and in the long term (i.e. at Week 48), as well as changes in other OCT-A features up to&#xD;
      Week 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 428 adult patients will be screened and included in approximately 75 centers in&#xD;
      France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum study duration for 1 patient is 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be required to attend 6 mandatory study visits: Screening/Baseline Visit (Day&#xD;
      1), Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 and Week 48 visits. The timing of the interim visits&#xD;
      between Week 16 and Week 48 will depend on the patient's injection regimen, i.e. every 8&#xD;
      weeks or every 12 weeks according to disease activity assessed by the investigator.&#xD;

             (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks&#xD;
