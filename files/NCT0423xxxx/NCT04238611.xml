  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lactate is a compound produced as a by-product of glycolysis. The increase in lactate&#xD;
      concentration can result from a variety of causes, such as during anaerobic metabolism in&#xD;
      exercise or haemodynamic shock in conditions such as sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will aim to validate a novel microneedle-based minimally invasive device for the&#xD;
      continuous measurement of lactate during exercise.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lactate is a compound produced as a by-product of glycolysis. The increase in lactate&#xD;
      concentration can result from a variety of causes, such as during anaerobic metabolism in&#xD;
      exercise. The measurement of blood lactate during exercise has been routinely used to&#xD;
      determine individual anaerobic thresholds, and optimise training in athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of the lactate trend requires multiple blood tests, and this can be&#xD;
      uncomfortable. The need for repeated procedures may therefore restrict the full utility of&#xD;
      the biomarker. Although point-of-care lactate measurements are possible, the barriers to&#xD;
      initiating testing may also limit its role in clinical decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is the validation of the microneedle-based lactate biosensor for&#xD;
      real-time continuous lactate measurement in healthy volunteers during exercise as&#xD;
      proof-of-concept.&#xD;
