    <textblock>
      The study drug Technetium [99mTc] Hydrazinonicotinamide PEGylated Bicyclic RGD Peptide&#xD;
      Injection（99mTc-3PRGD2） of this study is a novel radioactive diagnostic preparation for&#xD;
      clinical use as a nuclear medicine molecular probe for tumor SPECT/CT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 99mTc-3PRGD2 is injected into the body, it is specifically taken up by integrin&#xD;
      receptor-positive tumor tissue, and the image of tumor tissue can be obtained by SPECT/CT,&#xD;
      This can be used for molecular imaging diagnosis and individualized treatment of common&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 99mTc-3PRGD2 for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in lung tumors. The minor objective was to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of 99mTc-3PRGD2 in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant lung tumors&#xD;
      and the safety of 99mTc-3PRGD2 in vivo of humans.&#xD;

      This study strictly obeyed to the result by pathological diagnoses standard. The evaluation&#xD;
      of the efficacy of 99mTc-3PRGD2 in the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis of lung tumors is&#xD;
      based on a multi-center, open, self-controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves 10 research sites and a total of about 400 qualified patients who met the&#xD;
      protocol requirements in China, besides, they were previously diagnosed by 18F FDG PET / CT&#xD;
      with positive results in pulmonary occupying and lymph nodes (hilar or mediastinum) uptake.&#xD;
      At least 270 participants' surgical pathology report were required. After screening the&#xD;
      patients, the intravenous injection of 99mTc-3PRGD2 with a dose of 0.3 mCi / kg was&#xD;
      performed, followed by SPECT / CT plain scan and chest tomography scan. The doctors are&#xD;
      responsible for patients about whether they should take lymphadenectomy and obtain the&#xD;
      surgical pathology reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, the safety of 99mTc-3PRGD2 injection in human body was evaluated. This&#xD;
      study strictly obeyed to the result by pathological diagnoses standard which uses the&#xD;
      four-grid table to calculate the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 99mTc-3PRGD2&#xD;
      SPECT/CT diagnosis. Besides, the diagnostic results of 18F-FDG Positron Emission computed&#xD;
      Tomography/Chest Tomography (PET/CT) were compared to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      99mTc-3PRGD2 SPECT/CT in the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis and differential diagnosis of&#xD;
      benign and malignant lung tumors as well as evaluate the safety of 99mTc-3PRGD2 injection in&#xD;
      vivo of humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study invited an independent imaging evaluation committee to evaluate images obtained&#xD;
      with 18F-FDG PET/CT, 99mTc-3PRGD2 SPECT/CT and enhanced CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: The start of the study is defined as the date on which the first participant&#xD;
      signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF); the End Of the Study (EOS) was defined as the end of&#xD;
      the collection of the final participant safety assessment data.&#xD;
