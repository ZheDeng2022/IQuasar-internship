  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to evaluate the potential effectiveness of the implementation&#xD;
      strategy and intervention delivery model of a community paramedic coaching program for&#xD;
      caregivers of persons with dementia, in direct coordination with the participant and&#xD;
      caregiver's primary health care team. Specifically, the acceptability, appropriateness, and&#xD;
      feasibility of the program will be assessed, collecting data from all implementation&#xD;
      stakeholders at baseline, 13 weeks, 25 weeks, and post-intervention (~50 weeks) using&#xD;
      quantitative survey instruments and qualitative interviews.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention is an adaptation of the evidence-based REACH program (Resources Enhancing&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Caregiver Health), designed for and validated in multiple settings to give&#xD;
      education, tools, and support to informal caregivers of people with dementia, delivered&#xD;
      through a series of at-home visits (minimum of 9 in-person and 3 phone sessions) conducted by&#xD;
      trained and certified coaches over 6-12 months. The content of the coaching visits will&#xD;
      follow the REACH program protocol, with materials customized with information about local&#xD;
      community resources (e.g., Dane County).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coach/administrator training for delivery of the REACH intervention will be conducted by&#xD;
      master trainers from the Rosalynn Carter Institute (RCI) for Caregiving, a department of&#xD;
      Georgia Southwestern State University, who administers, certifies, and provides oversight for&#xD;
      REACH sites nationally (https://www.rosalynncarter.org/programs/rci-reach/). For the purposes&#xD;
      of this pilot study, the investigators have coordinated with RCI to extend delivery of REACH&#xD;
      content over a 12-month period, with home visits occurring more frequently at the beginning&#xD;
      and spreading further apart towards the end, and additional phone &quot;REVIEW&quot; sessions between&#xD;
      home-visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each home visit covers specific coaching content, building on strategies and behaviors&#xD;
      covered in prior sessions. The program includes flexibility to allow coaches to adapt the&#xD;
      timing/delivery of content to attend to the needs of the caregiver (e.g., answering questions&#xD;
      about previously-covered topics, covering topics from a future visit to help coach a&#xD;
      caregiver through an emergent dementia-related issue). Sessions typically last 1-2 hours.&#xD;
      Following each visit, the coach completes a fidelity checklist and writes client progress&#xD;
      notes as per the REACH protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot adapts prior REACH implementations in two main ways: (1) intervention coaches will&#xD;
      be community paramedics with advanced medical training, rather than social workers (or other&#xD;
      non-medical social service personnel), and (2) the program will be formally coordinated with&#xD;
      the participant and caregiver's primary care practice, allowing for care coordination and&#xD;
      information sharing between participants, coaches, and clinic staff/providers. Participants&#xD;
      will also have the ability to share information about their use of community dementia care&#xD;
      resources (e.g., social services, transportation, senior center case management, dementia&#xD;
      caregiver support groups, dementia-related educational programming, respite) with coaches so&#xD;
      they can communicate necessary information to the clinic for possible inclusion in the&#xD;
      participant's Electronic Health Record (EHR) (as per the clinic's determination), facilitate&#xD;
      care coordination, and help keep the participant's care plan up to date. Paramedic coaches&#xD;
      will be utilizing their medical knowledge, but not providing any direct medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study also differs from prior REACH trials in that outcome measures include health&#xD;
      care and emergency services utilization, particularly related to the occurrence of acute&#xD;
      medical and behavioral problems, as well as perceptions of health care quality, in addition&#xD;
      to caregiver psycho-socio-emotional measures (already included in the standard REACH&#xD;
      assessment package).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will employ a stepped design using a rapid-cycle evaluation approach. Three cohorts&#xD;
      of 4-5 patient-caregiver dyads each will start the intervention at staggered intervals.&#xD;
      Within each cohort, a new dyad will begin the program approximately every two weeks, with an&#xD;
      approximate four week gap between each cohort for feedback collection and program iteration.&#xD;
      Real-time feedback obtained from multiple intervention stakeholders (caregivers, persons with&#xD;
      dementia, coaches, clinical staff/providers - up to 10 enrolled) will be used to iteratively&#xD;
      improve intervention delivery and program implementation for the next, all while the first&#xD;
      group continues the pilot. In this way, problems can be identified and solutions generated,&#xD;
      with enough time to adapt the program and evaluate revisions. Staggering participant start&#xD;
      dates allows for multiple rapid-cycle iterations within a single pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: While COVID-19 restrictions are in place, all feedback interviews will take place by&#xD;
      telephone or WebEx videoconferencing, beginning 17 March 2020.&#xD;
