      This is a randomized, double-blind (with respect to Tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide&#xD;
      [TBPM-PI-HBr]/placebo only), placebo- and active-control, single-dose, 4-way crossover study&#xD;
      that will enroll 24 healthy adult male and female subjects. There will be a washout period of&#xD;
      at least 7 days between dosing in each period and each subject will receive all 4 treatments&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind (with respect to TBPM-PI-HBr / placebo only), placebo- and&#xD;
      active-control, single-dose, 4-way crossover study. Twenty-four (24) healthy, adult, male and&#xD;
      female subjects will be enrolled. Screening of subjects will occur within 28 days prior to&#xD;
      the first dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive a single dose of 4 different study treatments over 4 separate&#xD;
      treatment periods, each separated by a 7-day washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Period 1, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 12 treatment sequences. Sentinel&#xD;
      group: In Period 1 only, 4 subjects will be dosed 24 hours prior to the remaining 20&#xD;
      subjects. Each of the 4 subjects from the sentinel group will receive a different treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each period, subjects will receive a single oral therapeutic dose of TBPM-PI-HBr&#xD;
      (Treatment A), supratherapeutic dose of TBPM-PI-HBr (Treatment B), placebo (Treatment C), or&#xD;
      moxifloxacin (Treatment D) according to the randomization scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each period, cardiodynamic ECGs and PK blood samples will be collected pre-dose and for 24&#xD;
      hours post-dose. Safety will be monitored throughout the study by repeated clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinued subjects who have received study drug will not be replaced.&#xD;

    <masking_description>A computerized randomization scheme will be created by a CRO-statistician and it shall be considered blinded (as per the following).&#xD;
The randomization is available only to the pharmacy staff that is preparing the drug who will not be involved in any other aspect of the study including administration of the drug. The randomization will also be available to the bioanalytical laboratory as sample analyses will be treatment-dependent. It will not be made available to the Sponsor, subjects, or members of the staff responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of safety assessments.&#xD;
On Day 1 of each period, subjects will receive a single oral therapeutic dose of TBPM-PI-HBr (Treatment A), supratherapeutic dose of TBPM-PI-HBr (Treatment B), placebo (Treatment C), or moxifloxacin (Treatment D) according to the randomization scheme.</masking_description>
