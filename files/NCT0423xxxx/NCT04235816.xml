  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infectious diseases are among the most common causes of mortality in the over 2.5 million&#xD;
      children under 5 years of age (U5) who died in 2018 in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). New&#xD;
      approaches to treatment and prevention of these diseases are needed to increase child&#xD;
      survival. Sierra Leone has one of the highest rates of under-five child mortality in the&#xD;
      world. It is estimated that 32,000 children die each year, the leading causes being neonatal&#xD;
      conditions, malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea. In Sierra Leone, the available information on&#xD;
      malaria indicates that it accounts for 38% of deaths among under-five children. Reducing the&#xD;
      prevalence and impact of the disease among the general population is a major priority of the&#xD;
      Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS) of Sierra Leone .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent Preventative Treatment in infants (IPTi) - the administration of a full course&#xD;
      antimalarial treatment to infants at individual timepoints regardless of infection status-&#xD;
      has been shown to reduce clinical malaria and anemia in infants in the first year of life .&#xD;
      When delivered alongside the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), IPTi with&#xD;
      Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is a highly cost-effective intervention. . Sierra Leone is&#xD;
      currently the only country that implements nationwide the World Health Organization's (WHO)&#xD;
      IPTi guideline, which is administered within the first year of life. However, its benefit&#xD;
      when expanded into the second year of life remains unknown. Taking the advantage of the&#xD;
      inclusion in the EPI program of a booster dose of measles vaccine at 15 months of age, the&#xD;
      ICARIA trial will also assess the efficacy of adding a dose of IPTi-SP at this age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies show that azithromycin (AZi) - a macrolide antibiotic with some antimalarial&#xD;
      effect- is associated with a significant reduction in childhood mortality when used in mass&#xD;
      drug administration (MDA) for trachoma elimination in areas of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with&#xD;
      child mortality rates far beyond Sustainable Development Goals , . However, despite the&#xD;
      potential benefit of the intervention several fundamental scientific questions need to be&#xD;
      answered before it can be recommended for large-scale implementation.&#xD;

      In order to generate the conclusive evidence needed to inform policy and accelerate the&#xD;
      implementation of this intervention, we propose to carry out a large-scale clinical trial on&#xD;
      the impact on all-cause mortality up to 18 months of age of AZi administration through EPI.&#xD;
      The potential development of antibiotic and SP resistance, AZi and SP interactions with&#xD;
      routine immunizations, as well as the safety and the impact on the health system will be all&#xD;
      assessed in the ICARIA trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide the evidence needed to inform policy and practice and to accelerate the&#xD;
      implementation of this intervention, a large-scale clinical trial on the impact on all-cause&#xD;
      mortality up to 18 months of age of AZi administration through the World Health Organisation&#xD;
      Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI) will be carried out in Sierra Leone. The clinical&#xD;
      trial will be individually randomised, placebo-controlled with a factorial design whereby AZi&#xD;
      will be administered alongside routine preventive health interventions of the EPI, such as&#xD;
      immunisations and Intermittent Preventive Treatment in infants (IPTi), which is recommended&#xD;
      by the WHO for malaria prevention in this age group. The potential development of antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance, the interactions with routine immunisations, the safety and the impact on the&#xD;
      health system of AZi administration will be all assessed in this trial.&#xD;
