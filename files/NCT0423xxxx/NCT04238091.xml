  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine fecal transfer as a potential treatment for Alopecia&#xD;
      Areata (AA). This trial will attempt to discover if fecal transfer can treat immune-related&#xD;
      hair loss.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune condition resulting in chronic and relapsing hair loss.&#xD;
      AA patchy is associated with well-circumscribed patches of hair loss, commonly on the scalp&#xD;
      or face, while alopecia totalis (AT) and alopecia universalis (AU) are two severe types of AA&#xD;
      characterized by 95% or more hair loss on the scalp (AT) or body (AU). Although the exact&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms that cause AA are unknown, T lymphocyte cells are implicated, as they&#xD;
      release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines around the hair follicles, triggering a&#xD;
      cascade and ultimately resulting in hair loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) involves the transfer of stool (feces) from a healthy donor&#xD;
      to an AA recipient. Research suggests that changing the type of bacteria in an individual's&#xD;
      intestine may carry the potential to alter (increase or decrease) the recipient's potential&#xD;
      for certain conditions, even autoimmune conditions.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Fecal material transfer therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Fecal microbiota transplants will be performed as follows:&#xD;
FMP Retention Enema: (FMP 250 mL) Dosage Form: Screened human donor stool, suspended in diluent of 12.5% glycerol and sterile normal saline buffer (0.9% NaCl) standardized to a 5X concentration (1g stool : 5mL diluent ratio), homogenized, filtered to 330 microns and aliquoted to sterile 250mL vessels.&#xD;
Route of Administration: Fecal transplant will be performed under medical supervision. Lubricated enema tube will be inserted into rectum and contents expelled into the distal colon with the subject requested to retain material for a target dwell time of 3 to 24 hours with a mean target of 10 hours. Participants will lie in the left lateral decubitus position but if mobility permits will rotate to supine and right lateral decubitus position.&#xD;
One half of study subjects will receive a 3 day course of antibiotics prior to fecal transplant, while the other half will not.</description>

    <intervention_name>4mm Punch Biopsy of Scalp</intervention_name>
    <description>For the skin biopsy, the doctor will select an appropriate area on the scalp (or skin) as the biopsy site. The area will then be numbed (anesthetized). The study doctor or his/hers designee will then use a cylindrical instrument with a sharp edge (similar to a small cookie-cutter) to remove a 4mm cylinder of skin (smaller than the size of a pencil eraser). After the skin is removed, the biopsy site will be closed with absorbable stitches when appropriate. Approximately 2 to 4 stitches may be placed at the wound site to improve healing. Multiple skin punch biopsies may be taken throughout the entire length of the study</description>

    <description>Blood will be collected by a standard venipuncture procedure. 60-80cc of blood will be drawn from a patient per blood draw occurrence. Blood samples will be transferred to the research facility. Samples will be used to either stained with cell surface antibodies for fluorescence acquisition cell sorting (FACS) analysis (FACS experiments will allow for assessment of the subset and activation status of immune cells involved in AA or other cutaneous disorder pathology) or to extract DNA for the purposes of exome or genomic sequencing or genotyping of disease associated genes</description>

    <intervention_name>Skin Microbiome sampling</intervention_name>
    <description>Skin microbiome will be collected using skin swabs at the time of recruitment according to established protocols outlined by the Human Microbiome Project. Sterile (germ-free) techniques will be used for collection of all specimens, with careful avoidance of contamination of collection area by gloved hands. The sites that will be sampled are (in sequence): Lesional AA skin, non-lesional scalp skin, retro-auricular crease, ante-cubital fossa, and anterior nares. Skin surface specimens will be collected with a Catch-All Sample Collection Swab swab that looks similar to a q-tip and is, moistened with sterile solution. Skin will be swabbed approximately 50 times along the scalp, behind your ear and on your arm, and twisted 2 times around the front of the nose.</description>

    <intervention_name>Hair Microbiome Sampling</intervention_name>
    <description>Hair follicle microbiome (bacteria that live in the hair follicle) will be collected as follows: several hairs will be plucked from the scalp at a time using tweezers, once plucked the bulbs of the hairs will be cut using sterile surgical scissors and processed. Approximately 10-15 hairs will be plucked for processing. The number of hairs plucked may be increased depending on the number of hairs containing bulbs. Up to 50 hairs may be plucked, as long as the subject is able to tolerate it. Only several hairs will be plucked at a time in order to minimize pain and discomfort of the procedure.</description>

    <intervention_name>Pre-FMT Antibiotic Cocktail</intervention_name>
    <description>For three days prior to the transplant, one half (20) of the subjects enrolled will be treated with antibiotics to reduce the burden of the existing microbiome. The antibiotic regimen will consist of: oral vancomycin 250 mg qid, ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid, and metronidazole 500 mg tid. For subjects who have antibiotic allergies, appropriate antibiotic substitutions will be made. Subjects will stop the antibiotics 48 hours before the fecal transplant.</description>

    <description>The night before the transplant, all enrolled subjects will take 20 mg of bisacodyl and a large volume bowel preparation (GoLyteley 4000cc). Fecal transplant will be performed under medical supervision. After the transplant, subjects will take 4 mg of loperamide to increase transplant retention.</description>
