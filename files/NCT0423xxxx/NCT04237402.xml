  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigator will try to highlight the presence of carbonyl compounds in&#xD;
      the hair follicles of postpartum women by comparing these compounds before and after&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the cutaneous level, oxidative stress induces the formation of carbonyl compounds which,&#xD;
      by binding to proteins, produce non-functional adducts inducing cutaneous aging. This&#xD;
      mechanism is called &quot;carbonyl stress&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During pregnancy, estrogen increases massively, stimulates the whole body and prolongs the&#xD;
      life of the hair (slower passage in telogen phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After delivery, estrogen levels drop, resulting in a massive and simultaneous hair loss that&#xD;
      should have &quot;naturally&quot; fallen earlier. In addition, birth is a stressful stage for most&#xD;
      moms. This stress and excessive fatigue and possibly a return to work may also be responsible&#xD;
      for hair loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is the carbonyl stress also present in the scalp and can it be one of the mechanisms involved&#xD;
      in the occurrence of postpartum hair loss? To demonstrate this, samples of hair follicles are&#xD;
      taken. The proteins are extracted from the samples and then assayed. The oxidized (carbonyl)&#xD;
      proteins are labeled with specific fluorescent probes&#xD;
