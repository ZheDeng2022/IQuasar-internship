      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genitourinary cancers are some of the most common types of cancer. They are lethal when they&#xD;
      spread. The drug M7824 blocks the paths that cancer cells use to stop the immune system from&#xD;
      fighting cancer. The drug M9241 triggers the immune system to fight cancer. Researchers want&#xD;
      to learn if these drugs can help fight these cancers when given with and without Stereotactic&#xD;
      Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if M7824 and M9241, with or without SBRT, can help the immune system to fight cancer&#xD;
      better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 and older with cancer that started in the bladder, kidneys, or other genitourinary&#xD;
      organs (but not the prostate) and has spread to other parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      ability to do their normal activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      body scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give a tumor sample or have a tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening tests will be repeated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get M9241. It is injected under the skin every 4 weeks. They will also get&#xD;
      M7824 through an intravenous (IV) infusion every 2 weeks. For this, a small plastic tube is&#xD;
      put into a vein in the arm. They will get these drugs in 28-day cycles until they leave the&#xD;
      study. They may have SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give tissue and saliva samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit 30 days after treatment ends. Then they will get&#xD;
      phone calls or emails every 12 weeks indefinitely.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and other non-prostate genitourinary cancers&#xD;
           are lethal in the metastatic state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have greatly changed&#xD;
           clinical management of metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) and metastatic renal cell&#xD;
           carcinoma (mRCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Several PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are FDA-approved for non-prostate genitourinary cancers&#xD;
           including five agents for second-line mUC, two agents for first-line&#xD;
           cisplatin-ineligible mUC and one approval for second-line mRCC. However, response rates&#xD;
           are modest (approximately 25% in mRCC and 15-21% in mUC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therefore, novel combination strategies are needed to extend benefit of immunotherapy to&#xD;
           the remaining approximate 75% of non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bintrafusp alfa (M7824) is a novel first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein composed&#xD;
           of a monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 fused to the extracellular domain of human&#xD;
           TGF-beta receptor II (TGF beta RII), which effectively functions to sequester or trap&#xD;
           all three TGF- beta isoforms. A phase I study of M7824 (NCT02517398) demonstrated a&#xD;
           manageable safety profile and clinical efficacy among patients with heavily pre-treated&#xD;
           advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NHS-IL12 (M9241) is an immunocytokine composed of two IL-12 heterodimers, each fused to&#xD;
           the H-chain of the NHS76 antibody. The NHS76 IgG1 antibody has affinity for both single-&#xD;
           and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) allowing for targeted delivery of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
           cytokine, IL-12, to necrotic portions of tumor at sites of DNA exposure to promote local&#xD;
           immunomodulation. M9241has demonstrated promising pre-clinical activity (including&#xD;
           durable responses) as well as an encouraging safety and anti-tumor activity in an&#xD;
           ongoing phase Ib clinical trial in combination with an anti-PD-L1 agent (NCT02994953).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently, no clinical data exists for the combination of M7824 plus M9241. Preclinical&#xD;
           data suggest synergy between these agents and the available clinical data suggest that&#xD;
           the combination of M7824 plus M9421 is likely to be well-tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that stereotactic body radiation therapy&#xD;
           (SBRT), which delivers highly conformal high-dose radiation, can promote anti-tumor&#xD;
           immune responses both locally and systemically as well as synergize with immune&#xD;
           checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SBRT-induced dsDNA breaks are tumoricidal and may promote immunogenicity. SBRT also&#xD;
           upregulates PD-L1 expression and leads to activation of TGF-beta. SBRT may enhance&#xD;
           intratumoral binding of DNA-damage localizing agent, M9241. Preclinical models have&#xD;
           demonstrated impressive synergy with radiation plus M7824 and radiation plus M9241.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that an immune-intensification approach involving M7824 plus M9241&#xD;
           combined with SBRT will enhance therapeutic efficacy and clinical benefit in patients&#xD;
           with metastatic non-prostate genitourinary cancers with an acceptable safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The combination of M7824 with M9241 with or without administration of SBRT (sequential&#xD;
           or concurrent) will aid evaluation of safety signals contributed by each agent and will&#xD;
           provide insight into a currently unanswered question regarding the optimal timing and&#xD;
           sequencing of SBRT and immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Determine the safety and tolerated doses of M9241 and M7824 alone or in combination with&#xD;
      SBRT (Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy) administered sequentially or concurrently in&#xD;
      participants with metastatic non-prostate genitourinary cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic non-prostate&#xD;
           genitourinary cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must have metastatic disease defined as new or progressive lesions on&#xD;
           cross-sectional imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must have at least:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  One site of disease that is amenable to irradiation (a maximum of four sites may be&#xD;
                irradiated) (in arm 2 and 3 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  One measurable site of disease (according to RECIST criteria) that will not be&#xD;
                irradiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -This is an open label, non-randomized, three-stage phase I trial of M7824 and M9241 or&#xD;
&#xD;
      M7824 and M9241 in combination with either sequential or concurrent SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -M7824 (intravenous 1200 mg) and SBRT (8 Gy x 3 fractions) are planned with de-escalating&#xD;
&#xD;
      dose schedule for M9241. Dose de-escalation of M9241 will be done if toxicities&#xD;
&#xD;
      start at dose 16.8 mcg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The accrual ceiling has been set at 66 participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive treatment in cycles consisting of 4 weeks.&#xD;

             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with M7824 and/or M9241, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with any active or recent history of a known or suspected autoimmune&#xD;
             disease or recent history of a syndrome that required treatment with either systemic&#xD;
