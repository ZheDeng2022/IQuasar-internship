  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnoea is one of the most important determinants of quality of life and often limits the&#xD;
      activities of daily life, in subjects suffering from moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD). Pharmachological treatment of dyspnoea is affected by several side&#xD;
      effects and, in long-lasting treatments, a reduction of clinical efficacy may occur. Previous&#xD;
      studies showed a reduction of perceived dyspnoea after trials of acupuncture or&#xD;
      Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation over acupoints (Acu-TENS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study will be investigated the effect of Acu-TENS on lung function and dyspnoea in&#xD;
      patients with moderate-to-severe COPD (Cronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to verify the effectiveness of treatment with Acu-TENS to reduce&#xD;
      perceived dyspnoea in patients suffering from moderate-to severe COPD. Secondary aims are to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of the above treatments on quality of life, exercise capacity,&#xD;
      pulmonary lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty consecutive patients, admitted to Auxilium Vitae Rehabilitation Centre for intensive&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programme, suffering from moderate-to-severe COPD, will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Subjects will be randomly assigned to two groups with different treatments (n=15&#xD;
      group 1: experimental subjects - PR+Acu-TENS and n=15 group 2: control subjects - PR only) by&#xD;
      sequential block randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intensive inpatient PR programme will be applied to all participants. The programme will&#xD;
      include the optimisation of drug therapy and daily sessions of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Supervised incremental exercises on a treadmill, a cycle,and an arm ergometer according&#xD;
           to the protocol suggested by Maltais et al. until the achievement of 30 min of&#xD;
           continuous exercise at an intensity that elicited dyspnoea at level 5 on a modified Borg&#xD;
           scale starting from a workload corresponding to 50% of maximal workload achieved during&#xD;
           an initial incremental test;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Abdominal, upper- and lower-limb muscle activities involving lifting of progressively&#xD;
           increasing light weight and shoulder and full-arm circling;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Education;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Nutritional programs and psychosocial counselling, when appropriate. A multidisciplinary&#xD;
           team of chest physicians, nurses, physical therapists, a dietician, and a psychologist&#xD;
           offered care.&#xD;
