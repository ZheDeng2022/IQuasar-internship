    <description>The differences in changes of the bronchiolitis score are to be evaluated between AK0529 and placebo arms after treatment. The total score is reported with a range from 0 to 12. The minimum and maximum values of 0 and 3 separately are defined for each scoring item. A decreasing value of total score represents clinical improvement. Subscales are not applicable in this scoring system.</description>
