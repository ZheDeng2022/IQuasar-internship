  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Black men face a shorter life expectancy than white men due to poorer health outcomes&#xD;
      associated with many chronic diseases, most notably hypertension and its cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications. A lack of access to healthcare resources and poor engagement with healthcare&#xD;
      providers drive these inequities. A seminal trial conducted in the Metro Los Angeles area&#xD;
      demonstrated the effectiveness of using collaborative care partnerships between black-owned&#xD;
      barbershops and pharmacists to reduce blood pressure in black men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and success of implementing a&#xD;
      single-arm, smaller-scale version of the Los Angeles study in the Nashville area to provide&#xD;
      additional empiric support for collaborative care partnerships to treat hypertension in other&#xD;
      geographic locations.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) is a significant risk factor for mortality among non-Hispanic&#xD;
      black men, and black men have the highest incidence of death from HTN of any race, ethnic, or&#xD;
      gender group in the United States. Sustained, trusting interactions with healthcare&#xD;
      professionals and a lack of access to healthcare resources are both significant drivers of&#xD;
      these disparities. A cluster, randomized controlled trial in the Metro Los Angeles area&#xD;
      demonstrated that health promotion by black barbers resulted in greater reductions in blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP) when combined with medication management by specialty-trained pharmacists, as&#xD;
      compared to health promotion by barbers alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this single arm, pre-test/post-test study are to a) establish an effective&#xD;
      network of barbershop research hubs in Nashville, b) test the feasibility of engaging with a&#xD;
      specialty-trained pharmacist in collaboration with a barbershop to treat blood pressure in&#xD;
      black men, and c) create a local registry of potential subjects as a platform for enrolling&#xD;
      black men in future studies. There is no central hypothesis in this pilot implementation&#xD;
      study, but the study will evaluate the ability of the barbershop-based research methodology&#xD;
      to recruit and retain black men in a study; the fidelity to the intervention by barbers, the&#xD;
      pharmacist, and the hypertensive male participants; and the effectiveness of the intervention&#xD;
      on systolic blood pressure reduction and patient satisfaction. All participants will also be&#xD;
      offered the opportunity to participate in a separate research registry for recruitment into&#xD;
      future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff will offer free BP screening to all adult black men entering each shop for&#xD;
      approximately 4 weeks, or until recruitment targets have been met. Patrons with a systolic BP&#xD;
      &gt; 140 mm Hg on two separate occasions will be eligible to participate. The patrons' existing&#xD;
      physician or the lead physician or a study physician will sign a collaborative practice&#xD;
      agreement for a specialty-trained pharmacist to provide care and prescribe BP medications&#xD;
      within the study protocol. All participants in this study will execute a visit with the study&#xD;
      physician for an evaluation to establish care, supported by the funding for this proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barbers will participate in training related to skills on BP measurement and counseling&#xD;
      performed by either collaborating researchers from the University of California, Los&#xD;
      Angeles-Cedars Sinai or from local study personnel. Barbers will frequently check and&#xD;
      transmit the BP readings of their enrolled patrons and motivate them to work with the&#xD;
      clinical pharmacist, who will meet them in their barbershops to optimize BP medication. The&#xD;
      pharmacist will promote patient activation, intensify drug therapy under a collaborative&#xD;
      practice agreement as permitted by Tennessee state law, send progress notes to the&#xD;
      participant's physicians, and ensure appropriate safety monitoring after each medication&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
