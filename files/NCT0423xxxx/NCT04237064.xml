    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Stenotic carotid arteries can lead&#xD;
      to stroke if the cause of the stenosis is a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. Recent studies&#xD;
      reveal that if a patient has a plaque in the carotid artery it is highly probable that he/she&#xD;
      will develop plaques in other superficial arteries like the femoral artery. Currently, duplex&#xD;
      ultrasound is used to determine the grade of stenosis and is the main criterion for&#xD;
      intervention (endarterectomy) planning. However, the stability, or instability of the plaque&#xD;
      cannot be determined non-invasively. Photoacoustics is a novel, non-invasive imaging modality&#xD;
      that uses pulsed laser light to generate laser induced ultrasound in the absorbing region of&#xD;
      the tissue. Photoacoustic imaging provides optical contrast of biological tissue chromophores&#xD;
      with an acoustic resolution and imaging depth, which is promising for visualization of plaque&#xD;
      composition. The advantage of photoacoustics is the use of multiple wavelengths, since&#xD;
      different tissues respond differently to different wavelengths. Hence, non-invasive, in vivo,&#xD;
      morphology assessment is a future application of this new modality that would improve&#xD;
      diagnosis and clinical decision making. The drawback is the limited penetration depth of the&#xD;
      laser light and the signals generated by surrounding tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new, integrated photoacoustic device has been developed that meets all safety requirements&#xD;
      and has an improved penetration depth, suitable for imaging of carotid arteries with the aim&#xD;
      to distinguish between plaques with different morphology.&#xD;

      Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of atherosclerotic plaque&#xD;
      imaging using multispectral photoacoustic imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a pilot study where 60 patients with a plaque in one of the carotids,&#xD;
      scheduled for an endarterectomy procedure, will be included. Each subject will get a&#xD;
      multi-wavelength photoacoustic examination of the carotid plaque. In one group (N = 30),&#xD;
      photoacoustic imaging will be performed noninvasively at the TU/e laser lab, which is&#xD;
      compliant with laser safety standards, to verify non-invasive, multi-angle, multi-wavelength&#xD;
      photoacoustic imaging (Study A). In the second group (N = 30), photoacoustic imaging will be&#xD;
      performed pre- and per-operatively (Study B) prior to plaque removal. Here, to ensure a 100%&#xD;
      (laser) safe environment, all acquisitions will be performed in the operating theatre. The&#xD;
      latter group will be subjected to additional Magnetic Resonance Imaging for validation. After&#xD;
      carotid endarterectomie the plaque sample of each patient (Study A and B) will be transported&#xD;
      to TU/e for in vitro PA scanning and histology analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: A total of 60 patients with carotid artery disease scheduled for&#xD;
      endarterectomy (stenosis grade of &gt; 70% and &lt; 99%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): endarterectomy (following normal procedure), with an additional&#xD;
      photoacoustic image acquisition after incision, before removal of the plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The acoustic (i.e., echographic) and photoacoustic images&#xD;
      will be analyzed to determine the ability of distinguishing between different plaque&#xD;
      components (intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid pool, vessel wall), examine penetration depth,&#xD;
      resolution, and contrast.&#xD;
