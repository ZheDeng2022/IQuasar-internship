  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients are at high risk of undernutrition, which is generally more pronounced for&#xD;
      solid tumours (upper digestive tract, Ear Nose and Throat (ENT), bronchial tubes). This&#xD;
      undernutrition leads to major weight loss and cachexia, and may represent the first sign of a&#xD;
      call for a diagnosis of cancer. Cancer-related undernutrition is multi-factorial origins and&#xD;
      has multiple consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy treatments can induce various adverse effects in patients, including sensory&#xD;
      disturbances at the beginning of treatment in addition to disturbances that may already be&#xD;
      present before any treatment. The alteration of taste and odour, observed in 86% of patients,&#xD;
      can induce a change in food preferences, promote the development of aversions, and therefore,&#xD;
      lead to a significant reduction in the pleasure of eating. Loss of appetite, decreased food&#xD;
      intake and the development of aversions to certain foods are situations experienced by a&#xD;
      large proportion of patients treated with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of taste disorders in patients treated with chemotherapy is established&#xD;
      through the use of questionnaires, interviews and taste tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the perception and identification of salty, sweet, bitter and sour flavours are&#xD;
      common in patients treated with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As regards food products, patients report developing olfactory hypersensitivity mainly for&#xD;
      food of animal origin, in particular for odours of fish, frying, cheese and eggs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CANUT project aims to study the effect of pathology and chemotherapy on gustatory and&#xD;
      olfactory mechanisms, and in particular on interindividual differences in the perception and&#xD;
      appreciation of food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to monitor the evolution of patients' eating habits over time, the diet-related&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaire (CANUT-QVA) was constructed from items selected from the&#xD;
      Well-being related to Food questionnaire (WELLBFQ) after eliminating questions that were too&#xD;
      general or expressed in terms of importance to use perception-related responses as a&#xD;
      priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this part, an evaluation of the 9 dimensions of the CANUT-QVA questionnaire will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;

    <description>Evaluation of the contribution of a new questionnaire by patients with solid or hematological cancer according to 9 dimensions:&#xD;
Making food&#xD;
Place where the meals are eaten&#xD;
Eating and drinking: Nutrition&#xD;
Eating and drinking: The pleasure of tasting, chewing&#xD;
Eating and drinking: Satiated, well being&#xD;
Food preparation: Supply, choice, presentation&#xD;
Eating and drinking: Feelings&#xD;
After eating: heaviness, discomfort, hunger&#xD;
Taste/Odour Problems to confirm the number and structure of factors obtained at the end of the pre-study and to remove redundant questions.</description>
