                  the study, the vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;

                  system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable&#xD;
                  efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal&#xD;
                  hormone contraception. In case of use of oral contraception women should have&#xD;
                  been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before enrolment into this&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12&#xD;

        (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks&#xD;
        ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
        been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing&#xD;
        potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        11. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta-human&#xD;
        chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of registration 12.&#xD;

        refrain from sperm donation, from registration on the study until 30 days after the last&#xD;
        dose of ibrutinib or 12 months after Tisagenlecleucel infusion and until Tisagenlecleucel&#xD;
