      Executive Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertrophic scars are irregular, raised scars that can cause debilitating symptoms including&#xD;
      pain, pruritus, and restricted movement in nearby joints. There are also often significant&#xD;
      psychosocial elements with these scars that are especially significant in the vulnerable&#xD;
      pediatric population and their parents. Current scar treatment modalities are limited. In&#xD;
      recent years, the advent of ablative fractional laser (AFL) resurfacing technology has shown&#xD;
      great promise but there remains a need to expand high-level evidence and develop optimal&#xD;
      laser treatment parameters for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of ablative fractional CO2&#xD;
      laser treatment of hypertrophic scars in children and define a set of laser treatment&#xD;
      parameters to develop a treatment protocol that maximizes the safety and efficacy of AFL&#xD;
      therapy in the pediatric population. This will be a prospective split-scar clinical trial at&#xD;
      Alberta Children's Hospital. A sample size of 44 scars will be sufficient to detect a&#xD;
      clinically significant improvement in total POSAS score, our primary outcome measure.&#xD;
      Children (age 1- 17) who present with hypertrophic scarring following an acute injury or burn&#xD;
      may be included in the study. All patients will receive standard scar treatment modalities&#xD;
      and will be followed by our plastic surgery team and rehabilitation team. Each scar being&#xD;
      studied will be split into two halves which will be assigned a unique &quot;Site ID&quot; that will be&#xD;
      recorded in a data collection sheet and used to identify scars for assessment. All laser&#xD;
      treatments will be performed by a single surgeon using the UltraPulse CO2 Laser (Lumenis,&#xD;
      Israel) and will be done at the Alberta Children's Hospital in the main operating room under&#xD;
      a general anesthetic. Patients will receive laser treatments at 4 to 8-week intervals for a&#xD;
      total of 3 sessions. A combination of the SCAAR FX and Deep FX treatment modes, with or&#xD;
      without Active FX treatment mode, will be used according to individual patient and scar&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection includes demographic data and original burn data. Assessment tools including&#xD;
      the POSAS and SCAR-Q questionnaires, clinical photographs, and cutometer will be used at&#xD;
      various time points to document changes in scar appearance and pathology over the study&#xD;
      period. Mean values for the cutometer measurements as well as the POSAS and SCAR-Q&#xD;
      questionnaires will be compared between laser-treated and control scar sites. Each of these&#xD;
      datasets will be tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Non-parametric data will&#xD;
      be compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test and parametric data will be compared using&#xD;
      Student's t-tests.&#xD;

      RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major strides in surgical care for traumatic injuries and burns over recent decades have&#xD;
      enabled survival for wounds that would have previously been fatal. In the wake of these&#xD;
      advancements, new challenges have emerged in managing the chronic aspects of these injuries.&#xD;
      Among these, hypertrophic scarring remains one of our greatest unmet challenges. Hypertrophic&#xD;
      scars are a type of pathological scar commonly formed after a traumatic injury, characterized&#xD;
      by excessive collagen deposition during the wound-healing process that results in the&#xD;
      appearance of an irregular, raised scar. These scars are the most common scar type formed&#xD;
      after burn injuries with a reported incidence as high as 70%. In addition to their unpleasant&#xD;
      appearance, hypertrophic scars can exhibit debilitating symptoms including pain, pruritus,&#xD;
      and restricted movement in nearby joints. These symptoms often persist long after the initial&#xD;
      wound has healed, with profound and lasting effects on patient quality of life.&#xD;
      Stigmatization surrounding the appearance of hypertrophic scars further compounds their&#xD;
      physical effects with psychosocial elements that are especially significant in the vulnerable&#xD;
      pediatric population. A majority of affected children are subjected to bullying as a result&#xD;
      of their scars and many experience increased rates of anxiety, depression, traumatic stress,&#xD;
      and behavioral problems. Parents of affected children also experience elevated stress,&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, and guilt. The profound, multidimensional impact of hypertrophic&#xD;
      scarring necessitates improved treatment methods to preserve patient quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current scar treatment modalities are limited, especially when it comes to improving the&#xD;
      appearance of hypertrophic scars. This deficiency highlights a need to develop safe and&#xD;
      effective new approaches that bridge the gap between conservative methods with limited&#xD;
      efficacy and invasive measures with increased risk to patients such as surgery, laser&#xD;
      treatment and corticosteroid injection. In recent years, the advent of ablative fractional&#xD;
      laser (AFL) resurfacing technology has shown great promise in meeting this need with its&#xD;
      unique combination of safety and efficacy. AFL technology fills the void between milder&#xD;
      non-ablative lasers, which leave skin intact, and more aggressive fully ablative lasers which&#xD;
      remove the epidermis of the entire treated surface area. While fully-ablative lasers can&#xD;
      produce dramatic results, the large area of ablation leads to extended recovery times and&#xD;
      increased risk of complications such as dyschromia, infection and scarring. By contrast, AFLs&#xD;
      split the laser beam to target a dispersed pattern of the skin's surface, vaporizing precise&#xD;
      discontinuous columns of tissue within numerous smaller areas referred to as microscopic&#xD;
      treatment zones (MTZs). By injuring only a &quot;fraction&quot; of the skin, the healthy tissue&#xD;
      surrounding the MTZs quickly regenerates and replaces the damaged tissue. Modern AFLs with&#xD;
      ultra-pulsing technology achieve even greater efficacy by emitting the laser in rapid&#xD;
      high-energy pulses to limit heating of adjacent tissue. By confining the treatment area to&#xD;
      precise zones, AFLs can achieve much deeper tissue ablation than fully ablative lasers while&#xD;
      minimizing collateral damage to surrounding tissue to maximize therapeutic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies involving AFLs have reported a significantly diminished overall incidence of&#xD;
      complications including those commonly associated with non-fractionated laser ablation:&#xD;
      dyschromia, infection, and scarring. Dyschromia in the form of hyper- or hypopigmentation of&#xD;
      the laser-treated skin is perhaps the most common side-effect that has been observed,&#xD;
      especially in patients with darker skin types. Remarkably, using fractional ablation, the&#xD;
      incidence of dyschromia is virtually avoided. , In addition to a reduction in overall&#xD;
      complication rates, post-operative pain associated with AFL therapy is generally mild and&#xD;
      well-managed even with non-opioid analgesics. General anesthesia remains the clinical&#xD;
      consensus for avoiding intraoperative pain and thus will be implemented in this trial.&#xD;
      Overall, AFLs are a powerful tool that can achieve a much more robust dermal remodeling&#xD;
      response than non-ablative lasers while greatly reducing the risk of adverse effects and&#xD;
      delayed healing seen with fully-ablative lasers and other more-invasive scar treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have examined the potential use of AFLs to treat hypertrophic scars with very&#xD;
      promising results, documenting marked improvements in multiple aspects of scar pathology. In&#xD;
      a large before-after cohort study, treatment of hypertrophic scars using an AFL resulted in&#xD;
      substantial improvement of pigmentation, erythema, pliability, and thickness as measured by&#xD;
      the gold standard Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). The authors of this study reported a&#xD;
      considerable reduction from 10.4 to 5.2 on the VSS within a diverse cohort of pediatric and&#xD;
      adult patients. A more recent study that focused solely on treating pediatric burn scars with&#xD;
      AFL also reported significant improvement with a 23% reduction in score from 89.6 to 69.2 on&#xD;
      the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). POSAS is similar to VSS but uniquely&#xD;
      complements observer assessment of scars with patient-reported assessment including&#xD;
      unprecedented assessment of pain and pruritus. The investigators will be using POSAS&#xD;
      alongside SCAR-Q, a novel scar scale that was recently developed to provide more detailed&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes and unique assessment of the psychosocial impact of scars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demonstrated safety and efficacy of AFL resurfacing is especially attractive for&#xD;
      application within the pediatric population. Despite promising initial reports, there remains&#xD;
      a need to expand high-level evidence and develop optimal laser treatment parameters for&#xD;
      patients. Existing studies rely primarily on subjective scar assessment scales for evaluating&#xD;
      patient outcomes and few have included true objective measurements to complement their&#xD;
      subjective data. While scar assessment scales are popular and widely accepted in both&#xD;
      research and clinical practice, inherent subjectivity limits their reliability and&#xD;
      significance without objective data. As such, there is a distinct need to incorporate more&#xD;
      objective measurements into future studies. This proposed study aims to address this need by&#xD;
      employing validated objective measurement devices in conjunction with a range of subjective&#xD;
      measures to better evaluate the efficacy of AFLs in the treatment of pediatric hypertrophic&#xD;
      scars. Objective measurement devices have been demonstrated to produce far better inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability than subjective scar scales, providing essential data to more precisely examine&#xD;
      changes in scars over the study period and substantiate subjective findings. In this study,&#xD;
      the investigators will be using a device called a Cutometer to measure the viscoelastic&#xD;
      properties of scars (elasticity and firmness). With more comprehensive data, our intent is to&#xD;
      integrate and build upon recent efforts to inform further developments and facilitate the&#xD;
      integration of AFL into the modern scar treatment paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY AIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of ablative fractional CO2&#xD;
      laser treatment of hypertrophic scars in children and define a set of laser treatment&#xD;
      parameters to develop a treatment protocol that maximizes the safety and efficacy of AFL&#xD;
      therapy in the pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if ablative fractional CO2 laser treatment is effective in reducing pathologic&#xD;
           symptoms and signs of hypertrophic scars including itchiness, pain, scar stiffness, and&#xD;
           limited range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if ablative fractional CO2 laser treatment is effective in improving the&#xD;
           appearance of hypertrophic scars.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Develop a set of recommended parameters for use of ablative fractional CO2 laser&#xD;
           treatment including timing of treatment and amount of improvement related to number of&#xD;
           treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population The investigators propose to conduct a prospective split-scar clinical trial&#xD;
      at Alberta Children's Hospital. A sample size of 44 scars will be sufficient to detect a&#xD;
      clinically significant improvement in total POSAS score between the treatment and control&#xD;
      groups of 14 points (10%) with a power of 90% and an alpha of 0.05 (Appendix). The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit patients presenting to the outpatient burn and plastic surgery&#xD;
      clinics at Alberta Children's Hospital over two years until reaching a sample size of 44&#xD;
      scars. Children (age 1- 17) who present with hypertrophic scarring following an acute injury&#xD;
      or burn may be included in the study. To ensure the safety of participants and consistency of&#xD;
      our data the investigators will only include patients with stable closed scars at least 3&#xD;
      months post wound closure. For the purposes of the study, the investigators will define wound&#xD;
      closure as the point at which skin has been re-epithelialized and no longer requires&#xD;
      dressings. To provide insight regarding the efficacy of early versus late laser treatment of&#xD;
      scars, and to facilitate comparison with prior studies, the investigators will also record&#xD;
      the age of scars being studied within two categories: scars less than 2 years post closure&#xD;
      and scars greater than 2 years post closure. Multiple scars may be treated and studied for a&#xD;
      single patient. Patients will be excluded from the study if they have any contraindications&#xD;
      to general anesthesia or to receiving laser treatment such as open areas in the scar or an&#xD;
      active infection. The investigators will also exclude patients who previously received CO2&#xD;
      laser therapy to the area of interest and any patients with an underlying skin disorder such&#xD;
      as psoriasis which may influence wound healing or scar formation. Parents and patients will&#xD;
      be consented in advance of the procedure. A document will be provided to potential&#xD;
      participants outlining the proposal including the risks of the general anesthetic and of the&#xD;
      laser treatment. Patients and parents will not be blinded to the treatment areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design All patients will receive standard scar treatment modalities and will be&#xD;
      followed by our plastic surgery team and rehabilitation team. Each scar being studied will be&#xD;
      split into two halves which will be assigned a unique &quot;Site ID&quot; that will be recorded in a&#xD;
      data collection sheet and used to identify scars for assessment. Careful initial splitting of&#xD;
      scars should result in two regions with similar size and appearance as well as similar&#xD;
      initial ratings on the scar scales and Cutometer measurements (described below). One half of&#xD;
      the scar will receive standard treatment only and will be designated as the &quot;control&quot; area.&#xD;
      The other half will be treated with an AFL in addition to receiving standard treatment and&#xD;
      will be designated as the &quot;treatment&quot; area. The treatment area will be randomized between&#xD;
      patients. For example, forearm scars may have the half near the elbow treated with laser in&#xD;
      one patient but if another patient has a forearm scar, the half near the elbow in this&#xD;
      patient may receive standard treatment only. This randomization will enable blinding of the&#xD;
      three burn experts when reviewing the clinical photographs and help mitigate bias from&#xD;
      scar-splitting. A transparency map will be created for each patient to map scars and&#xD;
      measurement sites to facilitate consistency of assessments over the study period. All laser&#xD;
      treatments will be performed by a single surgeon, Dr. Fraulin, using the UltraPulse CO2 Laser&#xD;
      (Lumenis, Israel). Dr. Fraulin has been trained in the use of the UltraPulse CO2 laser and&#xD;
      has used it previously in clinical practice. All laser procedures will be done at the Alberta&#xD;
      Children's Hospital in the main operating room under a general anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Parameters Patients will receive laser treatments at 4 to 8-week intervals for a&#xD;
      total of 3 sessions. A combination of the SCAAR FX and Deep FX treatment modes, with or&#xD;
      without Active FX treatment mode, will be used according to individual patient and scar&#xD;
      characteristics. &quot;SCAAR&quot; stands for Synergistic Coagulation and Ablation for Advanced&#xD;
      Resurfacing. The initial pass of the laser will be performed in the SCAAR FX treatment mode.&#xD;
      In this mode, the laser beam penetrates skin up to a depth of 4mm to target the deeper layers&#xD;
      of scars. For SCAAR FX, the settings include energy (70-150mJ), density (1-5%), and frequency&#xD;
      (150-250Hz). The second pass will be done using Deep FX to treat more superficial layers of&#xD;
      scars up to a depth of 1mm. For Deep FX, the settings include energy (12.5-22.5mJ), density&#xD;
      (5-15%) and frequency (300-600Hz). A third mode, Active FX, is used for superficial ablation&#xD;
      to smooth out irregular areas. It will only be used in patients with superficial&#xD;
      irregularities in contour and dyschromia and would be used after the other two modalities as&#xD;
      a single pass. For Active FX, the settings include energy (80-125mJ), density (2-3%) and&#xD;
      frequency (100-150Hz).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operatively patients will be instructed to take acetaminophen for pain control and to&#xD;
      treat the laser areas with topical petroleum jelly. They will be given instructions to&#xD;
      contact the surgeon (Dr. Fraulin) in case of any problems such as fever, increased pain,&#xD;
      spreading redness or persistent open areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Analysis Information will be collected on each study participant&#xD;
      including demographic data: age, sex, and Fitzpatrick skin type. Burn data will be recorded&#xD;
      including: date of burn, anatomic location, type of burn (scald, contact, flame, flash,&#xD;
      chemical, friction, electrical), depth of burn at treatment site and control site, time to&#xD;
      original healing, and previous treatment of area including skin grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment tools including the POSAS and SCAR-Q questionnaires, clinical photographs, and&#xD;
      Cutometer will be used at various time points to document changes in scar appearance and&#xD;
      pathology over the study period. POSAS and Cutometer data will be collected prior to the&#xD;
      initial treatment, just before the second treatment, and again 4-8 weeks after the last&#xD;
      treatment. The SCAR-Q assessment and clinical photographs will only be completed at the&#xD;
      beginning and end of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total POSAS score will be our primary outcome for the study due to its rising prevalence in&#xD;
      recent literature as a more reliable and comprehensive alternative to the prevailing&#xD;
      Vancouver Scar Scale. The POSAS scar scale will be used to assess changes in scar symptoms&#xD;
      and pathology as reported by the clinical observer and patient. POSAS will be completed twice&#xD;
      for each scar site to independently assess both the treatment and control areas. As an&#xD;
      additional measure, the newly-developed SCAR-Q questionnaire will be administered to provide&#xD;
      more detailed assessment of patient-reported outcomes and unique insight regarding the&#xD;
      psychosocial impact of scars.14 Clinical photographs of the scars will be taken before the&#xD;
      first laser treatment and after the final laser treatment to document changes in the&#xD;
      appearance of scars. These photographs will be reviewed by three members of the plastic&#xD;
      surgery team with experience in burn and scar management. They will be blinded to the&#xD;
      treatment and control areas of the scar and asked to compare and evaluate the laser-treated&#xD;
      and control areas using photos taken at the beginning and end of the study period. Patients&#xD;
      will not be identifiable from these photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To complement the above data with objective measurements, the investigators will be using the&#xD;
      MPA 580 Cutometer (Courage + Khazaka electronic GmbH, Germany) to assess the mechanical&#xD;
      properties of the skin. This device applies light suction (450mbar) on a small area of the&#xD;
      skin and measures the resulting deformation with a reflected light sensor. The exact&#xD;
      parameters may be set by the user; however, the investigators will use consistent settings&#xD;
      for a total measurement cycle of 4 seconds with 3 repetitions including 2 seconds of suction&#xD;
      followed by 2 seconds for release. The Cutometer will be applied in 3 adjacent areas to&#xD;
      record mean values for both the control and laser-treated sites of the scar as well as a&#xD;
      separate scar-free control (either contralateral or adjacent), if available. Measurement&#xD;
      sites will be marked on the transparency maps created for each scar to maintain the&#xD;
      consistency of measurements. The non-invasive nature of the Cutometer and minute application&#xD;
      pressure required means there is no pain or risk to the patient. The Cutometer software&#xD;
      records 10 values (R0-R9) reflecting various aspects of the skin's mechanical properties. The&#xD;
      investigators will be recording and comparing values for R0 (firmness), R1 and R2&#xD;
      (elasticity). Cutometer data will be recorded using the manufacturer's software (Cutometer&#xD;
      Dual version 2.2.2.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean values for the Cutometer measurements as well as the POSAS and SCAR-Q questionnaires&#xD;
      will be compared between laser-treated and control scar sites. Each of these datasets will be&#xD;
      tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Non-parametric data will be compared using&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed-rank test and parametric data will be compared using Student's t-tests.&#xD;
      Inter-rater reliability for the assessment of the clinical photographs will be determined&#xD;
      using intraclass correlation. Correlation between assessments will be determined using&#xD;
      Pearson correlation. Differences will be considered statistically significant when p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
