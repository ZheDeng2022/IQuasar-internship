  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized trial that will compare two techniques of abdominal&#xD;
      paracentesis in patients with suspected peritoneal carcinomatosis. The patients will undergo&#xD;
      abdominal paracentesis by the standard technique and a rollover technique. In the standard&#xD;
      technique, the patients will lie flat for 10 minutes and abdominal paracentesis will be taken&#xD;
      for ascitic fluid cytology. In the rollover group, patients with suspected peritoneal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis will be rolled over thrice laterally on each side by 90 degrees and sample&#xD;
      will then be obtained for ascitic fluid cytology. both the samples will be processed by&#xD;
      blinded cytopathologist for tumour cellularity and diagnostic yield.&#xD;

      Trial Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized comparison between two methods of abdominal paracentesis with&#xD;
      a cross-over design and each participant will also serve as a control (standard&#xD;
      paracentesis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be done on the patients who will visit Outpatient departments or admitted as&#xD;
      an inpatient in the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening population: All patients with ascites&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria as per screening will be subjected to&#xD;
      baseline investigation in the form of hemogram, biochemistries, coagulogram, ascitic fluid&#xD;
      evaluation as per predesigned proforma. All patients in the study group will be subjected to&#xD;
      imaging and an attempt will be made to establish the primary site of malignancy based on&#xD;
      histopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo randomization into two&#xD;
      groups. One group will be the standard paracentesis group (SPG) and the other will be the&#xD;
      rollover group (ROG). Randomization will be done using an opaque sealed envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo abdominal paracentesis&#xD;
      twice in one of the following ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard paracentesis group (SPG):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked to lie supine for 10 minutes and no changes in posture will be&#xD;
      allowed for this period. Abdominal paracentesis will be done either by blind technique (in&#xD;
      case the ascites is clinically detectable) or ultrasonography-guided (in cases the ascites is&#xD;
      not clinically detectable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rollover group (ROG):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with ascites will be rolled over thrice in bed laterally up to 90 degrees on either&#xD;
      side and the ascitic fluid sample is drawn within 1 minute of the last rollover. There will&#xD;
      be four steps to this i.e roll over to one side at 90 degrees and then 180 degrees to the&#xD;
      other side and so on to complete three complete turns. This will be done after the&#xD;
      disinfection and cleaning of the anterior abdominal wall have been done and the personnel&#xD;
      involved in the procedure are ready for the paracentesis. The ascitic paracentesis will be&#xD;
      initiated within one minute of the completion of the turn. One assistant will maintain a&#xD;
      stopwatch during this period to ensure compliance with this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of ascitic paracentesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will undergo abdominal paracentesis twice in the order as allocated randomly. The&#xD;
      patients will be asked to empty his bladder prior to the procedure. The anterior abdominal&#xD;
      wall will be cleaned with a Povidone-iodine solution followed by isopropyl alcohol/&#xD;
      chlorhexidine. The site of the paracentesis will be the peritoneal space in the left lower&#xD;
      quadrant between the umbilicus and the anterior superior iliac spine or the patient's flank,&#xD;
      depending on the location of the fluid as determined by percussion of the fluid wave.&#xD;
      Alternatively, in midline 3 to 4 cm below the umbilicus, halfway between the symphysis pubis&#xD;
      and the umbilicus. On both occasions, 20 ml of the ascitic sample will be collected in clean&#xD;
      dry containers with appropriate labeling of name and hospital registration number. 20 ml of&#xD;
      the sample obtained on each of these occasions will be sent for cytological analysis. To&#xD;
      ensure that both the groups are treated similarly the paracentesis will be done using a 20 ml&#xD;
      syringe using 21 Gauge 1 1/2&quot; hypodermic needle. It will be ensured to avoid old surgical&#xD;
      scars since the bowel may be adherent to the abdominal wall. The site of the paracentesis&#xD;
      will be closed with tincture benzoin. The ascitic fluid sample for malignant cytology will be&#xD;
      transported to the laboratory within one hour of paracentesis.&#xD;
