  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The value of lung ultrasound in the work up of pleural effusion (fluid in between the thin&#xD;
      doublet layered film surrounding the lungs) is unknown. The researchers will perform a&#xD;
      systematic lung ultrasound scan including a scan for extra thoracic metastasis (spread of&#xD;
      cancer to other organs) in the lymphnodes of the neck and metastasis lever in 56 patients&#xD;
      one-sided pleural effusion. The researchers will measure if the interventions change the&#xD;
      diagnostic plan for the patient and leads to faster diagnostics of the underlying course.&#xD;
