  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare cook catheter placement for 6 vs. 12 hours to see if&#xD;
      there is faster time to delivery for people admitted to labor and delivery undergoing&#xD;
      induction of labor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon presentation to labor and delivery the participant will have a cook catheter inserted&#xD;
      digitally or by direct visualization with a speculum. The uterine component of the balloon&#xD;
      will be inflated to maximum 60mL. The catheter will be taped to the inner thigh with gentle&#xD;
      traction. In both groups participants will be started on hospital-based oxytocin protocol.&#xD;
      This protocol beings with 2 milliunits/min of oxytocin, increasing by 2 milliunits every 15&#xD;
      minutes until regular uterine contractions occur. The maximum dose of oxytocin is considered&#xD;
      to be 30 milliunits. The cook catheter will then be removed at 6 vs. 12 hours based on&#xD;
      randomization. At that point health care providers will manage active labor. Health care&#xD;
      providers many perform amniotomy at any point during the induction process with&#xD;
      recommendation for amniotomy with cervix more than 4cm dilated. Labor interventions are at&#xD;
      the discretion of the healthcare provider. The participants will have continuous fetal&#xD;
      monitoring throughout their induction, labor and delivery. Need for operative delivery or&#xD;
      cesarean section will be at the discretion of the health provider.&#xD;
