    <textblock>
      This is a randomized placebo controlled study in children diagnosed with autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorder (ASD), to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Slenyto® to alleviate Sleep&#xD;
      Disturbances in these children. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to compare treatment effect of Slenyto® 2 mg or 5 mg to that of placebo&#xD;
      on sleep duration (total sleep time [TST]) as assessed by the Sleep and Nap Diary after 3&#xD;
      weeks of double blind treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized placebo controlled study in children diagnosed with autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorder (ASD). Children will have a documented history of this disorder, as confirmed or&#xD;
      consistent with the International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10) or Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (Text Revision; DSM 5) criteria, having&#xD;
      DSM-5 criteria based sleep disturbances at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children will undergo 4 weeks of basic sleep hygiene and behavioral intervention, which&#xD;
      will serve as a wash out period from any hypnotics and prohibited medications; Children with&#xD;
      a documented history of sleep hygiene and behavioral intervention who are taking a prohibited&#xD;
      medication will not require additional training and will undergo a 2-week wash out period&#xD;
      before Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children who are still found to be eligible for the study after the 4 week, basic sleep&#xD;
      hygiene and behavioral intervention wash out period, will continue in a 2 week single blind&#xD;
      (SB) placebo run in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . After the 2 week SB placebo run in period (Visit 2; Week 2), children who are still found&#xD;
      eligible for study participation will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Slenyto®&#xD;
      (1 or 5 mg prolonged release melatonin tablets) or placebo for 3 weeks double-blind treatment&#xD;
      period. The starting dose will be 2X1mg Slenyto® or matching placebo. During these 3 weeks&#xD;
      parents will complete the electronic sleep and nap diary every morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one week of double-blind treatment, on the last day of Week 3 ±3 days (Visit 3), sleep&#xD;
      variables will be assessed to determine if dose modification (increase to 1X5 mg Slenyto® or&#xD;
      matching placebo) is required. Children will then continue on 2 or 5 mg of Slenyto® or&#xD;
      matching placebo to the end of the double blind period (End-of Study Visit 4; Week 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration will be either 5, 7, or 9 weeks, including the optional 2-weeks medication&#xD;
      wash out and 4 weeks sleep hygiene and behavioral intervention periods (overlapping).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to compare treatment effect of Slenyto® 2 mg or 5 mg to that of placebo&#xD;
      on sleep duration (total sleep time [TST]) as assessed by the Sleep and Nap Diary after 3&#xD;
      weeks of double blind treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key secondary endpoints are SL and LSE. Safety will also be assessed by Adverse events,&#xD;
      vital signs and physical examination.&#xD;
