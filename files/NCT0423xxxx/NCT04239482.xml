  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive disease and early intervention and&#xD;
      prevention strategies are therefore very important. An important early hallmark in the&#xD;
      development of T2DM is insulin resistance. Since the majority of postprandial glucose&#xD;
      disposal occurs in skeletal muscle, improving muscle insulin sensitivity will thus have a&#xD;
      major impact on disease prevention. Abdominally obese men and women have an increased risk to&#xD;
      develop T2DM, and are also characterized by an impaired vascular function. This may hamper&#xD;
      proper delivery of insulin, glucose and oxygen to muscles, thereby contributing to - and&#xD;
      possibly causing - muscle insulin resistance. Earlier it has been shown that supplementation&#xD;
      with L- arginine improves vascular function by improving nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability.&#xD;
      These NO- mediated beneficial effects on vascular function may improve delivery of insulin,&#xD;
      glucose and oxygen to the muscle tissue, thereby improving muscle insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      mitochondrial function. However, the doses needed of this amino acid cannot be provided by&#xD;
      regular diets or supplements, also due to the bitter taste of L-arginine. Alternatively,&#xD;
      smaller amounts of L- arginine with a specific combination of other nutritional components&#xD;
      (i.e. nitrate and nitrite), which are already part of the regular diet and support&#xD;
      alternative pathways to improve NO- mediated vascular function, may also induce beneficial&#xD;
      effects. The investigators now hypothesize that in abdominally obese adults with impaired&#xD;
      fasting glucose concentrations L-arginine combined with nitrate/nitrite increases muscle&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
