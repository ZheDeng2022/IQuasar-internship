      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperventilation has been used for intraoperative brain relaxation for decades,&#xD;
      Interestingly, this common practice is not based on robust evidence .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of brain relaxation secondary to hyperventilation is attributed to the&#xD;
      hypocapnia induced cerebral vasoconstriction and the subsequent reduction of cerebral blood&#xD;
      volume (CBV) and intracranial volume. The CBV reduction is accompanied by the reduction in&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow that could render the brain at ischemic risk, if the cerebral metabolic&#xD;
      activity remains the same before and after hyperventilation. So, it is possible that&#xD;
      inadvertent cerebral ischemia may outweigh the benefits of hyperventilation and should be&#xD;
      subjected for further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a useful non-invasive tool for regional&#xD;
      cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) monitoring, which provides continuous, real time&#xD;
      information on the balance between cerebral oxygen delivery and consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral oximetry monitoring had the ability to detect clinically silent episodes of cerebral&#xD;
      ischemia in a variety of clinical settings which could be an important safeguard for cerebral&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperventilation had been shown to significantly reduce cerebral oxygenation using&#xD;
      near-infrared spectroscopy in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have shown that prolonged hyperventilation correlated with poor outcome&#xD;
      especially in brain injured patients. 5,6 However, there is still a lack of evidence on the&#xD;
      relationship between hyperventilation and neurological outcome in patients having craniotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, to the best of the investigator's knowledge no previous randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      had studied the effect of hyperventilation versus normo-ventilation on cerebral oximetry in&#xD;
      pediatrics undergoing posterior fossa tumor surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial with a two-period crossover design so that&#xD;
      the patient can act as a control to himself. Enrolled patients are children (1-6 years old)&#xD;
      undergoing posterior fossa tumor resection. Prior to anesthetic induction, the two sensors&#xD;
      (SAFB-SM, Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) for near-infrared spectroscopy (INVOS 5100C, Covidien,&#xD;
      Dublin, Ireland) will be applied on the left and right sides of the forehead with the caudal&#xD;
      border approximately 1 cm above the eyebrows to measure regional oxygen saturation (rSO2). A&#xD;
      bispectral index (BIS) sensor will also be fixed on the left forehead (Model QUATRO,&#xD;
      Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) to monitor the depth of anesthesia. Both sensors will be fixed to&#xD;
      their positions using adhesive pads to avoid removal during positioning and soaking with&#xD;
      betadine solution. Baseline values for cerebral oxygen saturation will be obtained using NIRS&#xD;
      monitor, Standard monitors (electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximeter)&#xD;
      will be applied to all patients. The anesthetic management will be standardized for all&#xD;
      patients as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia will be induced by inhalational agent 'sevoflurane' until intravenous line&#xD;
      is secured then Fentanyl (1-2 µg/kg), Propofol (1-2 mg/Kg) will be given intravenously.&#xD;
      Intubation will be facilitated by Atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) and confirmed by capnography.&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal temperature probe will be inserted for monitoring of core body temperature&#xD;
      which will be kept between 36.5-37 C using warming blankets. A 22 G arterial cannula will be&#xD;
      placed in the left radial artery and baseline ABG will be obtained to correlate value of&#xD;
      Etco2 and Paco2. Anesthesia will be maintained with isoflurane in oxygen 40% and will be&#xD;
      adjusted to maintain BIS between 40 and 60 and Atracurium infusion (0.5 mg/kg/hr). Central&#xD;
      venous line will be inserted in the right internal jugular vein under complete aseptic&#xD;
      condition under ultrasound guidance, wide bore peripheral cannula will be inserted for fluid&#xD;
      management and a Foley's catheter will be inserted in the urinary bladder for urine output&#xD;
      monitoring. Patients will be positioned in the prone position with the arms positioned and&#xD;
      secured at the patient's side and after careful padding of the pressure points; the patient&#xD;
      head will be supported on the forehead using a horseshoe adapter. Slight neck flection will&#xD;
      be permitted till the anesthetist can pass two fingers easily between the chin and the chest&#xD;
      to allow for optimum surgical exposure. Patients will be randomly assigned using concealed&#xD;
      envelopes, according to a computer-generated random number to one of the following two&#xD;
      treatment sequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: hyperventilation (ETco2 25-30 mm Hg) for 20 minutes that will start immediately&#xD;
           after skin incision followed by normoventilation (ETco2 31-35 mm Hg) for another 20&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: normoventilation (ETco2 31-35 mm Hg) for 20 minutes immediately after skin&#xD;
           incision followed by hyperventilation (ETco2 25-30 mm Hg) for another 20 minutes. The&#xD;
           ventilation strategies will be achieved using volume-controlled mode with a tidal volume&#xD;
           of 8 ml/kg, I/E ratio:1/2 and ETco2 will be maintained at the desired range by adjusting&#xD;
           the respiratory rate. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) will not be applied. After&#xD;
           removal of the bone flap and exposure of the dura matter, a 20-gauge plastic cannula&#xD;
           will be inserted into the subdural space along the surface of the brain. This will be&#xD;
           connected to a calibrated pressure transducer via a length of polyethylene high pressure&#xD;
           tubing filled with normal saline. The transducer will be zeroed at ear level. During the&#xD;
           study period, the mean subdural pressure will be recorded at 2 minutes intervals at the&#xD;
           end expiratory phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment phase 1: An arterial blood sample will be obtained immediately after skin incision&#xD;
      for blood gas analysis to determine the difference between arterial and end-tidal carbon&#xD;
      dioxide tension (Pa-ETCO2). Ventilation and ETCO2 will be kept constant for at least 20 min,&#xD;
      which is long enough for stabilization of any vascular responses to the change in Paco2. At&#xD;
      the end of the equilibration period (20 minutes), another arterial blood sample will be&#xD;
      obtained to confirm that the targeted Paco2 (was achieved. The neurosurgeon, unaware of the&#xD;
      anesthetic and ventilatory management provided, will be then asked to score the brain bulk&#xD;
      according to a four-point scale as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Excellent with no swelling&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Minimal swelling, acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Swollen but no treatment required&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Swollen, needing treatment. After this assessment, ventilation will be changed&#xD;
           immediately according to group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment phase 2: Another 20 min of equilibration will be allowed and measurements will be&#xD;
      repeated as previously described. During the whole period of study (40 minutes), the cerebral&#xD;
      oximetry will be recorded at 5 minutes intervals. During this period factors that may affect&#xD;
      cerebral oximeter will be controlled by maintaining position of the patient head,&#xD;
      (normothermia with temperature at 36.5-37 C), within 20% of the base line blood pressure&#xD;
      using increments of ringer solution and ephedrine boluses as appropriate, maintain PH&#xD;
      7.35-7.45, Hb level around 10 gm/dl guided by blood loss and repeated measurements of Hb in&#xD;
      ABG and blood glucose level between 80-180 mg/dl. The study will be ended at this point, the&#xD;
      subdural cannula will be removed, and surgery will proceed as normal. Specific or routine&#xD;
      interventions for brain swelling such as a change in body position or diuretic therapy with&#xD;
      mannitol or furosemide will not be administered until the study had ended. However, for&#xD;
      ethical reasons, interventions will be made if requested by the surgeon and the patient will&#xD;
      be then withdrawn from the study. Data will be collected by an independent blinded&#xD;
      anesthesiologist using a data collection form.&#xD;
