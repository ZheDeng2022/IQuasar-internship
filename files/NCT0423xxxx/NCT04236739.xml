  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Articular cartilage defects in the knee have poor intrinsic healing capacity and may lead to&#xD;
      functional disability and osteoarthritis. Cartilage cell therapy using autologous chondrocyte&#xD;
      implantation has been established as the first advanced treatment therapy medicinal product.&#xD;
      Although this technique has achieved good mid-term results, it is a costly and extensive&#xD;
      two-stage procedure. 'Instant MSC Product accompanying Autologous Chondron Transplantation'&#xD;
      (IMPACT) combines autologous recycled chondrons (chondrocytes surrounded by pericellular&#xD;
      matrix) with MSCs for one-stage treatment of cartilage defects. IMPACT was successfully&#xD;
      executed in a first-in-man phase I/II clinical trial in which 35 participants with cartilage&#xD;
      defects were treated. The results showed a good safety profile, proper feasibility and good&#xD;
      initial clinical efficacy at 18 months follow-up. Also good outcome at 24 and 36 months was&#xD;
      shown in ongoing post study surveying of the participants. Consequently a new study with&#xD;
      IMPACT was designed; IMPACT2. The objective of IMPACT2 is to compare clinical outcomes of 30&#xD;
      individual participants with cartilage defects treated with IMPACT to 30 participants treated&#xD;
      with standard care for 9 months (consisting of optional physical therapy and pain&#xD;
      medication). Participants should be aged 18-45 years with a symptomatic Modified Outerbridge&#xD;
      Grade III or IV cartilage lesion of the knee ranging in size 2-8 cm^2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrolment, participants will be allocated (randomized) to either group A in which case&#xD;
      they receive IMPACT-treatment, or group B that will receive standard care. Standard care&#xD;
      consists of optional physical therapy and pain medication. After 9 months, participants in&#xD;
      group B can receive the IMPACT-procedure as well.&#xD;

      IMPACT is designed as a one-stage cell-based regenerative therapy for isolated articular&#xD;
      cartilage lesions. The investigational product consists of two cell types. Firstly,&#xD;
      allogeneic MSCs, which are an &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; ATMP and also being used in a clinical trial&#xD;
      for the treatment of steroid-resistant Graft versus Host Disease. Secondly, defect derived&#xD;
      autologous chondrons that are reinserted into the defect in combination with MSCs within one&#xD;
      procedure. During surgery, the autologous defect derived chondrons will be combined with&#xD;
      allogeneic cryopreserved and thawed MSCs to enhance cartilage formation. Cells will be&#xD;
      combined at a ratio of 10% chondrons and 90% MSCs and mixed in Tisseel® which will act as a&#xD;
      cell carrier scaffold. In the phase I-II trial we showed no significant differences in&#xD;
      clinical outcome between these dosages. Tisseel® is a registered widely used two-component&#xD;
      adhesive containing fibrinogen and thrombin concentrate. When mixed, these components mimic&#xD;
      the final steps of blood coagulation and form a stable physiological fibrin clot. The ATMP&#xD;
      will be applied to the cartilage defect in a concentration of approximately 2 million cells&#xD;
      per ml of fibrin glue, 0,5 to 0,7 ml per cm^2 will be administered. The amount of MSCs and&#xD;
      chondrons is thus dependant of the size of the lesion. The cells will be applied in a ratio&#xD;
      of 10:90 autologous chondrons: allogeneic MSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the clinical status/ improvement of the participants treated with the IMPACT&#xD;
      therapy, the included participants will be asked to complete the Knee injury and&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Scoring (KOOS) and the EuroQoL 5-Dimension Health Questionnaire (EQ5D)&#xD;
      at baseline (before IMPACT therapy) and at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate work leave and medical consumption a modified version iMTA Productivity cost&#xD;
      questionnaire and iMTA Medical Consumption Questionnaire will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed to evaluate the extent to which IMPACT&#xD;
      therapy affects costs compared to current treatment techniques. The costs of the procedures&#xD;
      that are performed (i.e. IMPACT or current practice), as well as the costs of the product&#xD;
      that is used (materials, operation theatre etc.), and the duration of the accompanying&#xD;
      hospitalization episode, will be determined using the UMC Utrecht administrative data and&#xD;
      study budget. In addition, the results of the iMTA Medical Consumption Questionnaire and the&#xD;
      iMTA Productivity cost questionnaire will be used to collect data on respectively resource&#xD;
      use and productivity loss during the rehabilitation period. All resource use will be&#xD;
      multiplied with cost prizes, which will be obtained from the Dutch Healthcare Authority or&#xD;
      from the Dutch manual for performing health economic evaluations, to calculate total societal&#xD;
      costs. These costs will be combined with the QoL outcome measures (as described previously),&#xD;
      to obtain an estimate of the cost-effectiveness of IMPACT as compared to current practice.&#xD;
