      An observational study on the insulin resistance in sepsis and septic shock patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This observational study is inspired by the short-term insulin resistance and hyperglycemia&#xD;
      that have been demonstrated in post-operative patients in response to tissue injury by Van&#xD;
      den Berghe et al 2001. This short-term insulin resistance and hyperglycemia have also been&#xD;
      observed in acutely ill patients (Van den Berghe et al 2006). The underlying mechanism for&#xD;
      why acute ill patients have short-term insulin resistance is still unclear, but it is&#xD;
      believed that the basic mechanism is increased glucose regeneration and gluconeogenesis,&#xD;
      which is the consequence of stress metabolism. Hyperglycemia can occur as a result of insulin&#xD;
      resistance and is associated with an increased risk of multiple complications, which is why&#xD;
      it is important to detect and treat (Van den Berghe et al 2001). This also means that the&#xD;
      more insulin-resistant the patient has been prior to the acute condition, the greater the&#xD;
      risk of elevated blood glucose concentrations. PRS Review Comments identify apparent errors,&#xD;
      deficiencies, or inconsistencies in the submitted information. Any comments provided should&#xD;
      not be considered comprehensive. Advisory comments noted in a previous version of a study&#xD;
      record may apply to subsequent versions, even if not repeated. It is the responsibility of&#xD;
      the data provider to ensure that the record is consistent with the ClinicalTrials.gov Review&#xD;
      Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to clarify the degree of insulin resistance in medical patients who&#xD;
      are not diagnosed with diabetes. Further it will be clarified how long these patients remain&#xD;
      insulin resistant after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acute medical patients diagnosed with sepsis or septic shock will be observed during&#xD;
      hospitalization and after discharge. Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction&#xD;
      caused by dysregulated host response to infection. Because the entire body is affected by an&#xD;
      infection, it is expected that this group of patients have a high level of stress metabolism,&#xD;
      insulin resistance and increased gluconeogenesis. The hypothesis is that acute medical&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with sepsis or septic shock have a level of insulin resistance (days to&#xD;
      weeks) and thus an increased risk of hyperglycemia. Insulin resistance is expected to&#xD;
      decrease as the patient's condition improves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with elevated infection levels (CRP and leukocyte count) who are simultaneously&#xD;
      diagnosed with sepsis, has peripheral insulin resistance due to stress metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pancreas will try to compensate for the peripheral insulin resistance by increasing its&#xD;
      secretion of insulin to the bloodstream. C-peptide is excreted in equimolar amounts to&#xD;
      insulin, thereby C-peptide becomes an expression of peripheral insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is assumed that the insulin resistance gradually decreases after discharge and further as&#xD;
      the patient's condition improves (CRP and leukocyte counts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a prospective follow-up study. The difference in C-peptide will be&#xD;
      observed over a time period of 28 days as an expression of the participant's insulin&#xD;
      secretion. Futher, the participants' blood glucose will also be observed continuously to find&#xD;
      the correlation between the degree of insulin resistance and glucose concentration. In&#xD;
      addition, measure the correlation between the degree of infection and the increase in&#xD;
      C-peptide concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the change in C-peptide (the difference between the maximum&#xD;
      concentration and the concentration after 28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The area under the curve for blood glucose level measured over 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of infection level (CRP/leukocyte count) and increase in C-peptide&#xD;
           concentration (dose-response).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation between infection rate and insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to the hospital with sepsis or septic shock can be recruited. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed for 28 days from admission. The patients will be applied to a continuous flash&#xD;
      glucose monitor (FGM) on the first day. Follow-up will be performed by blood sampling of&#xD;
      C-peptide, leukocyte count, and CRP. HbA1c will also be measured for the exclusion of&#xD;
      diabetes. Blood sampling will be taken both during hospitalization and after discharge.&#xD;
      C-peptide will be measured every second day during hospitalization and leukocyte count and&#xD;
      CRP will be measured every day during hospitalization. Reading of FGM will be performed on&#xD;
      the 14. and on the 28. day where blood sampling of C-peptide, leukocyte count, and CRP also&#xD;
      will be measured.&#xD;
