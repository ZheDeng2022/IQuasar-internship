  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) who are undergoing endoscopic surveillance&#xD;
      will be given Encapsulated Rapamycin (eRapa) at one of three escalating doses/schedules for&#xD;
      12 months with the aim of reducing polyp burden.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with FAP who are undergoing endoscopic surveillance will be given eRapa at one of&#xD;
      three escalating doses/ schedules (0.5mg every other day, 0.5mg daily every other week, or&#xD;
      0.5mg daily) for 12 months with the aim of reducing polyp burden. Patients will serve as&#xD;
      their own controls. Patients will be assessed with surveillance endoscopy at baseline, 6&#xD;
      months, and 12 months for change in polyp burden. Correlation between immune markers and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase IIa trial which will enroll at approximately 6-8 sites within the United&#xD;
      States that have specialty expertise in FAP treatment and surveillance. The trial is&#xD;
      anticipated to last approximately 24 months for treatment and follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will enroll 30 patients with the genetic or clinical diagnosis of FAP. The clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis includes individuals with 100 or more cumulative tubular adenomas throughout the&#xD;
      colorectum. Patients must be undergoing surveillance for known FAP and can include those with&#xD;
      intact colons as well as those who have undergone surgical therapy. For those patients who&#xD;
      have undergone partial or total colectomy, they must have documented residual polyps in their&#xD;
      rectum for which they are receiving active surveillance.&#xD;
