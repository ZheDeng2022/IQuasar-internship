  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of implementing best practices into current&#xD;
      stroke rehabilitation physical therapy on walking outcomes. Participants will also be&#xD;
      provided an activity monitor to help them track and target their walking practice to&#xD;
      determine if this can improve walking ability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This multi-site study will have each site start in usual care with participants consented to&#xD;
      collecting outcome measures. Each site will randomly switch over to Enhanced Usual Care (best&#xD;
      practice implementation) where all physical therapists at the site will be educated on&#xD;
      delivery of best practice for locomotor retraining. The specific therapy activities are at&#xD;
      the discretion of the physical therapist; however, physical therapists must work towards&#xD;
      thirty minutes of weight-bearing/stepping activity at greater than forty percent heart rate&#xD;
      reserve. Participants will continue to be consented to collecting outcome measures.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will be given and trained to use activity watches to monitor their&#xD;
      own progress.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This clinical trial uses a stepped-wedge design. Unlike typical studies where participants are randomized to two different interventions, this design has all sites start in the Usual Care period, and then switch-over to Enhanced Care at predetermined times, which will then be the new Usual Care (termed &quot;Enhanced Usual Care&quot;).</intervention_model_description>
