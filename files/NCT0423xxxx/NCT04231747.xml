    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, multicenter study of CC-97540, CD19-targeted&#xD;
      NEX-T chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, in subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 2 parts: dose-escalation (Part A) and dose-expansion (Part B). The&#xD;
      dose-escalation part (Part A) of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      increasing dose levels of CC-97540 to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D); and the&#xD;
      dose-expansion part (Part B) of the study is to further evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of CC-97540 at the RP2D.&#xD;
