      This research study is studying to evaluate sacituzumab govitecan for individuals with&#xD;
      localized triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sacituzumab govitecan (SG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab (combination therapy with SG)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves an experimental study treatment. The names of the study drugs&#xD;
      involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sacituzumab govitecan (SG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab (combination therapy with SG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a umbrella study multi-arm phase II study of neoadjuvant SG-based therapy in&#xD;
      patients with localized BC. The first cohort involves SG monotherapy. After the monotherapy&#xD;
      cohort completes enrollment, the combination therapy cohort (SG with pembrolizumab) for&#xD;
      patients with localized BC will open.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future planned arms include SG with/without pembrolizumab for patients with Hormone Receptor&#xD;
      positive (HR+) breast cancer and inflammatory breast cancer (IBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will receive Sacituzumab govitecan for up to 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This can be followed by standard chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
           physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that about 50 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Sacituzumab govitecan as a&#xD;
      treatment for patients with metastatic TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is an antibody-drug conjugate which means it's made up of an&#xD;
      antibody attached to an anticancer drug. An antibody is a protein normally made the immune&#xD;
      system. Sacituzumab govitecan is believed to work by binding the antibody portion of the drug&#xD;
      in the tumor(s) while the anticancer drug portion works to prevent cancer cells from&#xD;
      growing/spreading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the SG monotherapy cohort completes enrollment, the combination therapy cohort (SG with&#xD;
      immunotherapy) will open.&#xD;
