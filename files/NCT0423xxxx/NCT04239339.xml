      The aim of this project is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To apply a pharmacological tool of selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT&#xD;
           system) reuptake inhibition in healthy humans. Specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate how sub-chronic administration of 20 mg of escitalopram affects cognitive&#xD;
           performance ('cold' cognition) and social-emotional functioning ('hot' cognition)&#xD;
           compared with placebo; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate how sub-chronic administration of 20 mg of escitalopram affects&#xD;
           functional brain activation during a paradigm of reinforcement learning following drug&#xD;
           administration compared with placebo, and how activation relates to cognitive&#xD;
           performance and social-emotional functioning.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Serotonin is a monoamine neurotransmitter implicated in diverse cognitive and affective brain&#xD;
      functions. Serotonin has a significant role in the regulation of cognition and mood,&#xD;
      including emotional appraisal, perception and flexible behaviour, with 5-HT receptors found&#xD;
      in the cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. The investigators have previously shown that in&#xD;
      healthy human experimental studies, acute dietary tryptophan depletion induces 'waiting'&#xD;
      impulsivity and impulsive behaviours, impairs goal-directed behaviour and shifts behavioural&#xD;
      control toward habitual responding when appetitive, but goal-directed when aversive. Reduced&#xD;
      availability of forebrain serotonin has also shown to impair a range of cognitive processes,&#xD;
      such as psychomotor processing, episodic memory, attention and executive function. Recently,&#xD;
      the research team have shown that using an acute and clinically relevant dose (20 mg) of&#xD;
      escitalopram impaired learning and cognitive flexibility, but improved response inhibition in&#xD;
      healthy humans, suggesting a dissociation of effects possibly mediated by differential&#xD;
      modulation of brain serotonin levels in distinct functional neural circuits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators now aim to investigate the effects of sub-chronic administration of 20 mg&#xD;
      of escitalopram (i.e. three weeks) in healthy volunteers using sophisticated&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery and EMOTICOM)&#xD;
      and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Whereas 'cold' cognition refers to the use&#xD;
      of non-emotional processing (e.g. episodic memory; spatial working memory), 'hot' cognition&#xD;
      is emotion-laden and used in response to stimuli with affective salience (e.g.&#xD;
      decision-making under high levels of risk of uncertainty). It has been suggested that&#xD;
      cognitive-emotional effects, such as the re-appraisal and re-evaluation of emotions&#xD;
      underlying learning mechanisms, may mediate improvements in mood associated with SSRI&#xD;
      treatment. This project will help further the understanding of the role of serotonin in the&#xD;
      regulation of cognitive and emotional processes, as well the neural correlates underlying&#xD;
      reinforcement learning, in healthy humans.&#xD;
