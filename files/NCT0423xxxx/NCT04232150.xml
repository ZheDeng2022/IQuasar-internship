      Spinal anesthesia is one of the commonest choices of anesthesia for infraumbilical&#xD;
      surgeries.The use of sedation has markedly increased patients' comfort and acceptance towards&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia. The aim of this study is to investigate visual, recall, auditory recall,&#xD;
      and sedation scores among patients receiving Midazolam for sedation during spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      in patients undergoing orthopedic surgeries.&#xD;

      Spinal anesthesia is one of the commonest choices of anesthesia for infraumbilical&#xD;
      surgeries.The use of sedation has markedly increased patients' comfort and acceptance towards&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia. The main goals of sedation for surgeries under spinal anesthesia are&#xD;
      patient comfort, preservation of protective airway reflexes, and the help in the maintenance&#xD;
      of hemodynamic stability during the surgical procedure. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate visual, recall, auditory recall, and sedation scores among patients receiving&#xD;
      Midazolam for sedation during spinal anesthesia in patients undergoing orthopedic surgeries.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Overall, 116 patients were enrolled, out of which 20 were excluded before start of study for the following reasons: contraindication for spinal anesthesia (n=10), preoperative administration of sedative agent (n=3), refusal to be enrolled in study (n=4), a patient with neurological disorder (Schizophrenia), a blind patient, and a deaf patient. Of the 96 patients included, 33 were enrolled in group C, 32 in group S; however, 2 patients requested a deeper level of sedation so an added dose of midazolam and fentanyl were given thus excluding them from study, and 31 patients in group R.</intervention_model_description>
