&#xD;
          -  Pathological (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of BRAF-V600E mutant&#xD;
             ATC (a diagnosis that is noted to be consistent with ATC is acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Either Metastatic disease or locoregional disease that is considered not resectable&#xD;
             for cure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ideally a surgeon should determine that the disease is not resectable for cure, but&#xD;
             this can also be done by any investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, defined as at&#xD;
             least 1 lesion that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest&#xD;
             diameter to be recorded for nonnodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;/=&#xD;
             20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;/= 10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or&#xD;
             calipers by clinical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;/= 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;/= (or Karnofsky&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Serum bilirubin &lt;/=1.5x institutional ULN (unless the patient has GIlbert's&#xD;
                  Disease, in which case total bilirubin &lt;/=3x institutional ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST and ALT &lt;/=2.5x institutional ULN (&lt;/=5x institutional ULN if there is liver&#xD;
                  metastasis)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine &lt;/=1.5mg/dL or calculated creatinined clearance (Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
                  formula) &gt;/=50 mL/min or 24-h urine creatinine clearance &gt;/=50 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to instutional lower&#xD;
                  limit of normal (LLN) by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 14 days of registration for women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
             before study entry and for the duration of study participation. Men treated or&#xD;
             enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception before the&#xD;
             study, for the duration of study participation, and for 4 months after completion of&#xD;
             trametinib administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must agree to allow 2-4 separate biopsies of any malignant lesion. For patients whose&#xD;
             biopsies (initial) are deemed as unsafe or contraindicated, they will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;

             institution outside of MSK are eligible or (2) with the consent of the PI (Sherman).&#xD;
             However, this exception is limited to 8 subjects.&#xD;

             of chronic or cleared HBV and HCV infection, which will be allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the&#xD;
        potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with trametinib. In addition, these patients are&#xD;
        at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would limit compliance with study requirement.&#xD;
