  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop insulin delivery system has the potential to improve the condition of many poorly&#xD;
      controlled insulin-treated T2D patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wide acceptance of the AP usage in T2D care will strongly depend on the identification of&#xD;
      subpopulations and care settings where the AP could significantly improve the risk- and&#xD;
      cost-benefit balances of T2D management as compared to established practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this interventional study, therefore, is to investigate whether a therapeutic&#xD;
      solution combining an automated insulin delivery AP system with a tailored HHP service can&#xD;
      improve blood glucose control, reduce the rate of acute metabolic complications&#xD;
      (hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia), improve both the patients quality of life and experience,&#xD;
      and reduce the healthcare related costs in patients with uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes needing&#xD;
      home nursing care for their daily insulin treatment versus usual care.&#xD;

             within the last 3 months before selection, 5. Patient with a current minimum of 2&#xD;
             daily insulin injections and who would benefit of an optimisation, 6. Patient&#xD;
             requiring long term family nurse's daily assistance at home for performing insulin&#xD;
             injections and/or glucose monitoring, 7. Total daily insulin dose &lt; 1.5U/kg, 8.&#xD;
             Patient willing and able to complete the requirements of the study, 9. Recent fundus&#xD;
