  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current first-line treatment for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) in Canada is&#xD;
      buprenorphine/naloxone (bup/nx). The standard induction method of bup/nx requires patients to&#xD;
      be abstinent from opioids and thereby experience withdrawal symptoms prior to induction,&#xD;
      which can be a major barrier in starting treatment. Rapid micro-induction (micro-dosing)&#xD;
      involves the administration of small, frequent does of bup/nx and removes the need for a&#xD;
      period of withdrawal prior to the start of treatment. This study aims to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of rapid micro-induction versus standard induction of bup/nx in&#xD;
      patients with OUD.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label superiority trial involving 50 individuals with&#xD;
      OUD. Participants will be randomized into two arms: rapid micro-induction and standard&#xD;
      induction (based on the American Society of Addiction Medicine Practice Guidelines and&#xD;
      product monograph) of bup/nx.&#xD;

    <description>On Day 1, participants will receive 0.5mg bup/nx sublingually (SL) every 3 hours (Q3H) - total daily dose of 4mg. On Day 2, they will receive 1mg bup/nx SL Q3H - total daily dose of 8mg. On Day 3, they will receive 12mg bup/nx SL once and 1-4mg bup/nx SL Q3H as needed (PRN) - maximum daily dose of 24mg. On Day 4, their day 3 total dose will be consolidated to once daily dosing - maximum daily dose of 24mg. On Days 1 and 2, participants will concurrently receive 1-16mg hydromorphone orally, intravenously, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly (PO/IV/SC/IM) every 1-3 hours (Q1-3H) PRN to meet their opioid requirements, titrated to effect - maximum daily dose of 96mg. For the 1st dose of hydromorphone on Day 1, a maximum 8mg PO or 4mg SC/IV/IM dose will be given. Hydromorphone will be discontinued on Days 3 and 4.</description>

    <description>Day 1 is initiated when participants score 11 or above on the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), and when they have been abstinent from short-acting opioids for at least 6-12 hours or from long-acting opioids for 24-72 hours. On Day 1, participants will start with 2-4mg bup/nx SL. If they do not experience withdrawal symptoms 60-90 minutes after this dose, additional dosing can be done in increments of 2-4mg bup/nx SL. The suggested total dose target for Day 1 is 8-12mg. On Day 2, participants will start with a dose equal to the total amount of bup/nx SL administered on Day 1. The dose will be then titrated in increments or decrements of 2-8mg bup/nx SL to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal. On Day 3, their day 2 total dose will be consolidated to once daily dosing. For both Days 2 and 3, the suggested total daily dose is at least 8mg, recommended 12-16mg, maximum daily dose of 24mg.</description>
