    <textblock>
      Calcific aortic stenosis (AS) (formerly &quot;senile&quot; or &quot;degenerative&quot;) is a frequent disease of&#xD;
      heart valves and is characterized by a thickness and calcification of leaflets with a&#xD;
      significant increase of the pressure gradient, defined as an aortic jet velocity of &gt; 2 m/s.&#xD;
      Whenever the aortic jet velocity is &gt; 4 m/s, in association with an aortic valve area of &lt; 1&#xD;
      cm2, the disease is classified as severe and cardiac outflow obstruction develops. AS affects&#xD;
      1-2% of population aged of &gt; 65 years and 12% of those aged &gt; 75 years. Among those aged &gt; 75&#xD;
      years, it is estimated that 3.5% has severe AS. With the aging of population, the prevalence&#xD;
      of AS is expected to increase in the forthcoming years. Transcatheter Aortic Valve&#xD;
      Implantation (TAVI) has been introduced in 2004 and consists in percutaneous replacement of&#xD;
      the aortic valve. It is indicated in those patients with severe AS who cannot undergo&#xD;
      surgical replacement because of high surgical risk. TAVI seems to be a good alternative to&#xD;
      surgical intervention also for patients deemed at intermediate risk, especially if they are&#xD;
      frail or aged. Ballistocardiography (BCG) consists of the measurement of the body's&#xD;
      accelerations as a consequence of the recoil forces generated by the blood mass ejection at&#xD;
      each cardiac contraction and recorded on the body's surface close to the subject's center of&#xD;
      mass. Seismocardiography (SCG) records the heart-induced accelerations generated at each&#xD;
      cardiac contraction and transmitted to the local chest surface. Thanks to specific algorithms&#xD;
      applied to the SCG and BCG waves, it is possible to compute the kinetic energy (KE) and Power&#xD;
      (P) of a single cardiac contractile cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of our study are to demonstrate that: LVOT Vmax and LVOT VTI changes obtained with&#xD;
      echocardiography can be estimated reliably throught BCG and SCG signals, before and after&#xD;
      TAVI procedure; Pmax and KE computed from the BCG and SCG signals could predict the severity&#xD;
      of the AS before the TAVI procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KE and P computed from non invasively recorded BCG and SCG waves may prove useful in the&#xD;
      evaluation of AS severity and its evolution before and after TAVI procedure, respectively.&#xD;

        Patient population studied: patients with aortic stenosis planned to undergo TAVI&#xD;
        procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Number of patients planned: since this is a pilot study, no formal simple size calculation&#xD;
        can be done. The Cardiology department of the Erasme hospital perform an average of 3 TAVI&#xD;
        procedure a month. Since the enrollment will take place from January to September 2023, a&#xD;
        total of 135 patients will be enrolled. Because of a complication rate of 10% linked to the&#xD;
        invasive procedure, we expect 100 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
