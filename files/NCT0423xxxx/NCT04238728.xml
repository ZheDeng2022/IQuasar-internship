    <measure>mean radiation induced skin reaction assessment scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scoring system contains both a healthcare professions assessment scale and a patient symptom scale. The healthcare professional assessment scale individually scores the extent and severity of erythema, dry desquamation, moist desquamation, and necrosis using a 5-point scale from 0 to 4. Erythema is rated based on the degree of color change. Dry desquamation, moist desquamation, and necrosis are rated based on the percentage of the treatment area affected by that particular reaction. The patient component focuses on skin tenderness, itching, burning, and functional activity using a 4-point scale from 1 to 4. The Healthcare Professional Assessment Scale scores and the Patient Symptom Scale scores are added together for a total skin reaction score. The higher the score, the worse the skin reaction.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females, 22 years of age or older, with diagnosis of primary breast cancer (excluding&#xD;
             inflammatory and medullary breast cancers).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Scheduled to receive short-course external beam radiation therapy (i.e., 2.0-3.0 Gy&#xD;
             for 15-20 fractions) or conventional external beam radiation therapy (i.e., 1.8-2.0 Gy&#xD;
             for 25-40 fractions), with or without boost dose, to the whole breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not receiving concurrent chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject may have had chemotherapy prior to radiation. A minimum of two weeks is&#xD;
             required between the end of chemotherapy and start of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of previous breast or chest radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject may or may not have had surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) prior to RT. (Note:&#xD;
             Surgery is not required for eligibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may be currently prescribed hormone treatment or Herceptin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to read, speak, and understand English language (all study forms&#xD;
             are in English).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to have photographs taken of radiation-induced skin changes&#xD;
             in the radiation treatment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to wear Silverlon dressing and undergarment (i.e., bra) at&#xD;
             all times, except when bathing/showering and during their radiation therapy session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to complete a Silverlon Compliance Log to document the date&#xD;
             and time that Silverlon was removed and applied each day during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of medullary or inflammatory breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of tumors of the breast other than primary breast cancer (skin cancers,&#xD;
             lymphomas, or metastatic cancers from other primary sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Partial breast irradiation (PBI) treatment technique is not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Pregnant females are ineligible because&#xD;
             pregnancy is a contraindication for RT. All subjects of childbearing potential will be&#xD;
             asked if they are pregnant or could be pregnant. The subject must respond &quot;no&quot; to&#xD;
             continue with radiation and to participate in this clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous radiation to the chest or breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation being given for palliative purposes.&#xD;

             area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of breast infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects currently on anti-EGFR (human epidermal growth factor receptor) therapy, such&#xD;
             as Iressa (gefitinib) or Erbitux (cetuximab, C225).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous diagnosis of autoimmune disease, connective tissue disease, or&#xD;
             radiosensitivity disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any active dermatological issues in radiation treatment area (i.e., fungal&#xD;
             skin infection, dermatitis, psoriasis plaques, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic skin disease of the breast, previous breast trauma or scarring of the breast&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with known sensitivity to silver or nylon.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects unable or unwilling to wear Silverlon dressings and undergarment (i.e., bra)&#xD;
             at all times, except while bathing/showering and during their radiation therapy&#xD;
             session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects unable to speak, read, or understand English language (all study forms are in&#xD;
             English).&#xD;

    </criteria>
    <gender>Female</gender>
    <gender_based>Yes</gender_based>
    <gender_description>Subjects must be female. Approximately 99% of breast cancer diagnoses occur in adult women. Since too few men are diagnosed with the disease to allow meaningful sub-group analyses, subject accrual will only be women (≥ 18 years of age) with breast cancer. Additionally, men are unlikely to wear a bra and the dressing would have to be held in place using another method, which is not the purpose of this study.</gender_description>
