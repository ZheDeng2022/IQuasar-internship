  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We wish to clarify whether we can demonstrate a correlation between scores in Brief-IPQ and&#xD;
      the effect of treatment in patients referred to our department, Interdisciplinary Pain Center&#xD;
      Zealand University Hospital Koege, Denmark. The purpose is to outline whether we can use&#xD;
      Brief-IPQ with Chronic Pain disorders and thereby detect those of our referred patients who&#xD;
      are at risk for poor treatment response in an early state. In these cases, we can offer&#xD;
      psychological intervention at the beginning of the course of treatment, in order to optimize&#xD;
      the conditions for patients and achieve an optimal treatment effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain conditions are frequent in the danish population. More than 1.2 million Danes&#xD;
      over the age of 16 are living with chronic pain. Chronic pain affects the health-related&#xD;
      quality of life and functioning and is associated with reduced work ability, lost earnings&#xD;
      and disability. At the Interdisciplinary Pain Center Zealand University Hospital Koege,&#xD;
      Denmark, patients with chronic pain are received and treated based on the Bio-Psycho-Social&#xD;
      Pain Model. The treatment of patients with complex chronic non-malignant pain can be&#xD;
      complicated by psychological and / or social factors. The need for a screening of&#xD;
      psychological factors in connection with the examination and planning of the pain management&#xD;
      in the Interdisciplinary Pain Center is obvious as the patient's perception of illness and&#xD;
      expectation of treatment have been shown to play a role in the treatment response. The Brief&#xD;
      Illness Perception Questionnaire (Brief-IPQ) provides a quick assessment of the patient's&#xD;
      disease perception and expectation of treatment and has proved useful in clinical practice.&#xD;
      In this study, a Danish version of Brief-IPQ is used, which initially was taken from&#xD;
      https://www.uib.no. Items as stated in research by L. van Oort et al (2011) have been adapted&#xD;
      to the Danish version. A copy of the latest version can be obtained from Interdisciplinary&#xD;
      Pain Center Zealand University Hospital Koege, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a prospective observational study of the correlation between&#xD;
      Brief-IPQ and pain-related and demographic data in patients referred to Interdisciplinary&#xD;
      Pain Center Zealand University Hospital KÃ¸ge, Denmark. Brief IPQ and PainData (which is a&#xD;
      database which records the well-being of Danish pain patients and operated by &quot;Danske&#xD;
      Regioner&quot; and Odense University Hospital) is measured at the start of treatment and after 6&#xD;
      months. They will consists of items such as; Married or cohabitant, Vocational training,&#xD;
      Educational length, Occupational status. There will furthermore be an assessment of pain type&#xD;
      such as; nociceptive / neurogenic / generalized / visceral / other as well as the duration of&#xD;
      symptoms and treatment with opioids: +/-, equipotent daily doses. Additionally we focus on&#xD;
      Pain intensity (NRS) from Paindata, Psychological profile (from Paindata): anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, stress, fear-avoidance, self-efficacy and the following changes before and after&#xD;
      six months of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients referred to Interdisciplinary Pain Center Zealand University Hospital Koege,&#xD;
      Denmark and start the treatment from the start date of the study can be included in the study&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Patients who do not have sufficient cognitive skills to complete the form (Brief-IPQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who cannot cooperate to complete the form (Brief-IPQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who submit invalid or illegible answers (Brief-IPQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients needed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients with complete data or number included as of May 1, 2020. Time schedule:&#xD;
      Collection of data: start February 1.2020 End: when complete data has been obtained from 60&#xD;
      patients, or no later than 1.12.2020&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information will be treated confidentially and all data will be anonymized by a&#xD;
      secretary. The Investigator will keep an identification list of all patients who have been&#xD;
      included. This list will include the patient's full name and CPR number. Collected data will&#xD;
      be recorded in a Case Report Form. The results will be stored and analyzed using a computer&#xD;
      and the anonymity of the patients will be preserved and local data law will be observed. Data&#xD;
      will be stored in accordance with existing regulations. Data is stored in anonymized form and&#xD;
      correlation and regression analysis will be performed after 6 months. The study is conducted&#xD;
      in accordance with applicable clinical trial rules. Investigators are responsible for the&#xD;
      handling and archiving of data in accordance with applicable rules in addition to the Act on&#xD;
      the Processing of Personal Data and the Health Act. Data belong to the investigators. The&#xD;
