  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study investigating the role of nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, in the treatment&#xD;
      of advanced stage or relapsed/refractory NKTL. Patients who have received PD-1 inhibitors&#xD;
      will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have a complete response or good partial response to nivolumab during initial&#xD;
      phase will continue to be treated with nivolumab. Patients who have a partial response,&#xD;
      stable disease, and progressive disease to nivolumab during initial phase will be treated&#xD;
      with the combination of nivolumab and GDP/L-asparaginase.&#xD;
