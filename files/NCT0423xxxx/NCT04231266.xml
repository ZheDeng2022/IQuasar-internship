  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GNE myopathy is a rare genetic muscle disease characterized by progressive muscle atrophy and&#xD;
      weakness. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the enzyme that&#xD;
      initiates and regulates N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) biosynthesis and glycan sialylation.&#xD;
      Currently, there is no therapy available for this disease. N-Acetylmannosamine (ManNAc), an&#xD;
      orphan drug in development for GNE myopathy, is an uncharged monosaccharide and the first&#xD;
      committed precursor in Neu5Ac biosynthesis. In this randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial the efficacy and long-term safety of ManNAc will be evaluated in&#xD;
      subjects with GNE myopathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center study to evaluate the&#xD;
      long-term safety and clinical efficacy of ManNAc in subjects with GNE myopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 51 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either ManNAc at&#xD;
      4 g three times daily (total of 12 g/day) or placebo. Subjects will have follow-up visits&#xD;
      every 6 months (±7 days) and take study drug for a minimum of 24 months, until their final&#xD;
      study visit . The final on-site study visit for a subject is the last expected 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up visit that occurs prior to the time the last randomized subject is expected to&#xD;
      reach 24 months (extended follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo screening and baseline evaluations that include clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests, Quantitative Muscle Assessment (QMA), the Inclusion Body Functional Myositis Rating&#xD;
      Scale (IBMFRS), and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and rehabilitation medicine&#xD;
      functional assessments. Follow-up evaluations will occur every six months following baseline,&#xD;
      until 24 months after randomization of the last subject. Phone follow-up will occur every&#xD;
      month without a clinic visit for the duration of the trial, and the last visit for each&#xD;
      subject will be followed by phone follow-up 1 month after the final study visit.&#xD;
