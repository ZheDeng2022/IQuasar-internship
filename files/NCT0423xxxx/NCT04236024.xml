    <textblock>
      Background: Maintaining patient safety is one of the primary tasks of a professional nurse.&#xD;
      Correct identification of medicine, understanding of pharmacological mechanisms and side&#xD;
      effects are the basic academic knowledge that each nurse must possess. Therefore, it is an&#xD;
      important duty for nursing teachers to teach students the knowledge of drugs and use them&#xD;
      correctly in clinical practice. In this way, the safety of patients can be guaranteed and the&#xD;
      quality of care can be improved. Board games have been used for study in different subjects,&#xD;
      and they all have visible effects. Their competitive and entertaining qualities make learning&#xD;
      more interesting and allow students to learn in a pleasant atmosphere. Therefore, the purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to examine the effectiveness of using board games to teach medication&#xD;
      knowledge to nursing students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This is a randomized controlled trial study. Convenience sampling will be&#xD;
      applied in one university in Northern Taiwan.It is expected that 60-100 participants will be&#xD;
      recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental group and comparison group by computer.&#xD;
      The experimental group will use board game to learn medication, while the comparison group&#xD;
      will be taught in a traditional way. The questionnaires will be conducted before the&#xD;
      intervention, after the intervention, and one month later. The time for completing&#xD;
      questionnaire is about 5~15 minutes. The questionnaires include demographic information,&#xD;
      medication knowledge questionnaire, and learning satisfaction questionnaire. This study will&#xD;
      use SPSS 22.0 software for data analysis, including frequency, percentage, mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, t-test, chi-square, and generalized estimation equation (GEE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: This study will be able to understand the effects of board games in&#xD;
      learning medication among nursing students.&#xD;

    <description>This self-developed questionnaire which was validated by 5 experts will be used to understand students' medication knowledge level. The questionnaire includes 20 questions, 1 point for correct answers, 0 points for incorrect answers or not knowing, the total score is between 0 and 20 points, the higher the score represent the higher understanding of medical knowledge.</description>
