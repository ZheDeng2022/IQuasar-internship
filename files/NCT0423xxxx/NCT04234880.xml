  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we aim to develop and validate a noninvasive approach for quantifying and&#xD;
      imaging energy metabolism, without contrast agents, on widely available clinical MRI&#xD;
      scanners. Briefly, this technique allows specific and selective imaging of the energy&#xD;
      metabolite phosphocreatine (PCr), in vivo and non-invasively. PCr is one of the predominant&#xD;
      high-energy phosphates present in brain and muscle and one that is altered by common&#xD;
      diseases. Although energy metabolism and PCr play a vital role in cellular homeostasis, there&#xD;
      currently are no routine diagnostic tests to noninvasively quantify or map the distribution&#xD;
      of PCr with clinically acceptable spatial resolution or/and scan time. Here, we demonstrate&#xD;
      that the exchangeable guanidinium protons of millimolar concentration PCr can be exploited to&#xD;
      detect it via the water signal in MRI with greatly enhanced sensitivity (molar signal) using&#xD;
      chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI, and its concentration can be quantified&#xD;
      using an artificial neural network (ANN). This new technique, dubbed ANNCEST, allowed us to&#xD;
      obtain a high-resolution PCr map on human skeletal muscle within 1.5 min, on a 3T clinical&#xD;
      MRI scanner equipped with just the standard MRI setup. To put this in a larger perspective,&#xD;
      energy metabolism is critical for cell viability and is altered by many common acquired and&#xD;
      inherited diseases. ANNCEST is arguably the first to use widely available MRI scanners to&#xD;
      noninvasively image tissue energy metabolism of PCr, and thus would have appeal to a broad&#xD;
      readership of scientists and clinicians interested in neurology, muscular dystrophies and&#xD;
      myopathies as well as cardiology, to name a few.&#xD;
