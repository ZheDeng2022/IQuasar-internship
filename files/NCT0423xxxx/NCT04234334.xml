  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to demonstrate that the inclusion of eggs to a plant-based&#xD;
      diet will not increase the risk for heart disease but will increase the concentration of&#xD;
      lutein and zeaxanthin, two important antioxidants and will also increase choline, an&#xD;
      important component of membrane phospholipids.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Results from studies involving cells, animal models and clinical trials have demonstrated&#xD;
      that lutein and zeaxanthin potentially protect against chronic diseases, including&#xD;
      age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, coronary heart disease and stroke. Plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin are closely associated with their antioxidant&#xD;
      properties and with their protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choline is recognized as an essential nutrient for health because of its many functions in&#xD;
      growth and development, as well as neurological function and formation of membrane&#xD;
      phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the objective of this study is to demonstrate that inclusion of eggs in a&#xD;
      plant-based diet will potentiate the benefits of this healthy diet by increasing plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of lutein, zexanthin and choline presents in egg yolks and theoretically&#xD;
      increase the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of these components. This would be&#xD;
      potentially more important in those individuals with metabolic syndrome, which is the target&#xD;
      population of this intervention.&#xD;
