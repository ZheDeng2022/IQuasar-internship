  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed project is to compare the efficacy of two fully developed&#xD;
      physical therapy interventions in 8-24 months olds with or at high risk of having Cerebral&#xD;
      Palsy (CP). Sitting Together And Reaching To Play (START-Play) targets sitting, reaching and&#xD;
      motor-based problem solving in infancy to improve global development. Usual Care Physical&#xD;
      Therapy (UCPT) focuses on advancing motor skills and preventing impairments.&#xD;

      The purpose of the proposed project is to compare the efficacy of two fully developed&#xD;
      physical therapy interventions in 8-24 months olds with or at high risk of having Cerebral&#xD;
      Palsy (CP). Sitting Together And Reaching To Play (START-Play) targets sitting, reaching and&#xD;
      motor-based problem solving in infancy to improve global development. Usual Care Physical&#xD;
      Therapy (UCPT) focuses on advancing motor skills and preventing impairments. The project&#xD;
      builds on a nearly complete clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of the START-Play&#xD;
      intervention compared to a non-dose matched comparison group. The proposed study directly&#xD;
      addressed the need for a dose-matched clinical trial to consider the impact of dose of&#xD;
      intervention on efficacy. A direct comparison of START-Play with the dose matched (24 visits&#xD;
      in 3 months) UCPT provided in the same environment (homes) and provided by licensed physical&#xD;
      therapists will allow for a direct comparison of the efficacy of interventions based on two&#xD;
      different set of key principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      START-Play is based on developmental and basic science, motor learning, and neuroplasticity,&#xD;
      in addition to our extensive preliminary efficacy data. START-Play has been fully described&#xD;
      with a protocol manual, training documents, and fidelity measures. The UCPT intervention is&#xD;
      based on videotaped session of the comparison group community based intervention sessions and&#xD;
      parent report for the ongoing clinical trial. A fidelity measure used the previous research&#xD;
      quantifies differences in the focus of these interventions and will be used to maintain&#xD;
      adherence to both intervention groups. Three sites in different regions of the United States&#xD;
      will recruit from local intervention and medical centers for a total of 150 infants with or&#xD;
      at high risk of having cerebral palsy between ages 4-24 months of age, when they show&#xD;
      readiness skills for early sitting and reaching. Risk for CP will be based on the early&#xD;
      detection guidelines and all outcome measures are included in the NIH supported Common Data&#xD;
      Elements for Cerebral Palsy. Each infant will be randomized into a group and will receive the&#xD;
      START-Play or the UCPT intervention for 3 months, with follow up extending for 12 months from&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives examine change over time in sitting gross motor and cognitive&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in outcomes between the two intervention groups will be examined. In addition, we&#xD;
      will begin to identify predictors of response to developmental motor interventions by&#xD;
      evaluating the relationship between intervention outcomes and 1) infant and family&#xD;
      characteristics, 2) presence of white matter, cerebellar, basal ganglion, or gray matter&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
