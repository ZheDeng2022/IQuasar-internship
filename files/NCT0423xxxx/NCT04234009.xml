  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive performance is negatively related to an impaired glucose metabolism, possibly due&#xD;
      to impairments in brain vascular function. Supported by the statement from the American Heart&#xD;
      and Stroke Association that a healthy lifestyle is one of the most effective strategies to&#xD;
      protect against cognitive decline, the investigators now hypothesise that healthy lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention-induced changes in glucose metabolism cause beneficial effects on brain vascular&#xD;
      function thereby improving cognitive performance. The primary objective of this intervention&#xD;
      study is thus to evaluate in sedentary older men and women the effect of a 16-week&#xD;
      aerobic-based exercise program on cerebral blood flow, as quantified by the non-invasive gold&#xD;
      standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) perfusion method Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL).&#xD;
      Cerebral blood flow is a robust and sensitive physiological marker of brain vascular&#xD;
      function. Secondary objectives are to examine effects on glucose metabolism using the&#xD;
      homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-ir) and cognitive performance as&#xD;
      assessed with a neurophysiological test battery.&#xD;

    <description>The physical activity guidelines for older consist of 150 minutes per week moderate-to-high intensity exercise, two times per week muscle and bone strengthening exercises, which are combined with balance exercises. Additional health benefits can be achieved with a longer exercise duration, frequency and/or intensity. Furthermore, the amount of time sitting should be minimised. The dietary guidelines are described in detail in the so-called &quot;The Wheel of Five&quot;. In brief, the circle is divided into four food groups and one beverage group. More than half of the circle is covered by fruits, vegetables, whole grain (containing) breads, cereals and potatoes. A much smaller part is compromised by animal source foods, spreads and cooking fats. Water, tea and coffee without sugar complete the circle.</description>
