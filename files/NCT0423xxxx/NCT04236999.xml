  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substance use and drug related disorders are important public health problems. Alcohol and&#xD;
      illicit drug use account for 5.4% of the total burden of disease and the peak has been found&#xD;
      in early adulthood (between ages 20 and 30 years). Substance use is one of the leading&#xD;
      problems among Chilean adolescents. One out of four 8 th to 12 th graders have smoked&#xD;
      cigarettes in the last month. A 35.6% of students (37%, girls; 34.2%, boys) between Year 8&#xD;
      and Year 12 have reported any alcohol use during the last month. It is worrying that a third&#xD;
      of 14 years old students report using alcohol in the last month in Chile. Furthermore, two&#xD;
      out of three who are using alcohol, report regularly using 5 or more drinks in a row during&#xD;
      the last month. Cannabis use among young Chileans has increased in recent years. Today, one&#xD;
      out of five students between Year 8 and Year 12 referred cannabis use during the last 30&#xD;
      days. Almost a 20% of students in Year 8 have used cannabis in the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, is urgent to provide evidence-based drug preventive interventions to the Chilean&#xD;
      population, specifically to school students, to tackle this problem and reduce the risk for a&#xD;
      more dramatic future health scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to develop a culturally appropriate version of the Unplugged program&#xD;
      to the Chilean culture, and to test its effectiveness among early adolescents in low-income&#xD;
      primary schools in Santiago, Chile. This project involves two stages: first, formative work,&#xD;
      where the research team will review, adapt and pilot the Spanish version of the program to&#xD;
      Chile; and second, the culturally adapted version of Unplugged program will be tested in a&#xD;
      single-blind two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the intervention, investigators expect that students in schools receiving the&#xD;
      Chilean version of Unplugged will have a lower proportion of substance use and a lower&#xD;
      proportion of students passing from experimental use to regular use of tobacco, alcohol, and&#xD;
      cannabis, than in control schools.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Substance use and drug related disorders are important public health problems. Alcohol and&#xD;
      illicit drug use account for 5.4% of the total burden of disease and the peak has been found&#xD;
      in early adulthood (between ages 20 and 30 years). Most of substance use disorders start&#xD;
      during adolescence, and it is well known that the earlier the use of any substance of abuse,&#xD;
      the higher the risk for drug dependence later in life. For example, if alcohol use starts at&#xD;
      14 or earlier, the risk for alcohol dependence during adulthood is five or more times when&#xD;
      compared to those individuals who start using alcohol after 21 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substance use is one of the leading problems among Chilean adolescents. One out of four 8 th&#xD;
      to 12 th graders have smoked cigarettes in the last month. A 35.6% of students (37%, girls;&#xD;
      34.2%, boys) between Year 8 and Year 12 have reported any alcohol use during the last month.&#xD;
      It is worrying that a third of 14 years old students report using alcohol in the last month&#xD;
      in Chile. Furthermore, two out of three who are using alcohol, report regularly using 5 or&#xD;
      more drinks in a row during the last month. Cannabis use among young Chileans has increased&#xD;
      in recent years. Today, one out of five students between Year 8 and Year 12 referred cannabis&#xD;
      use during the last 30 days. Almost a 20% of students in Year 8 have used cannabis in the&#xD;
      last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though the great effort made by the Government of Chile during many years, offering&#xD;
      several universal and targeted school-based interventions, the results are somehow&#xD;
      frustrating. For example, the Chilean National Strategic Plan for Drugs 2003-2009 had the&#xD;
      goal of reducing drug use in school-age population. However, during the same period cannabis&#xD;
      and other illegal drugs use increased. Later, the Chilean National Plan for Drugs and Alcohol&#xD;
      2011-2014, had the goals, among school-age population, of reducing the annual prevalence of&#xD;
      cannabis and alcohol use by 15%, and the annual prevalence of cocaine use by 10%. However,&#xD;
      annual prevalence of cannabis use dramatically increased from 19.5% in 2011 to 34.2% in 2015;&#xD;
      and the annual prevalence of alcohol increased from 59.3% in 2011 to 63.0% in 2015. Similar&#xD;
      trend is seen in the annual prevalence of cocaine use, increasing from 3.2% in 2011 to 4.2%&#xD;
      in 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, is urgent to provide evidence-based drug preventive interventions to the Chilean&#xD;
      population, specifically to school students, to tackle this problem and reduce the risk for a&#xD;
      more dramatic future health scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent systematic review found that the &quot;Unplugged&quot; program appears to have the best&#xD;
      evidence of effectiveness, tested in several European countries. This universal school-based&#xD;
      program targets students aged 12-14 years and aims to prevent all substance of abuse with&#xD;
      special focus on tobacco, alcohol and marijuana. It is delivered by trained teachers in 12&#xD;
      sessions or units over a period of one academic year and includes teaching factual knowledge&#xD;
      and attitudes regarding drug use (4 sessions), and training in interpersonal skills (4&#xD;
      sessions), and intrapersonal skills (4 sessions). No previous evaluation of this program has&#xD;
      been carried out in Chile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to develop a culturally appropriate version of the Unplugged program&#xD;
      to the Chilean culture, and to test its effectiveness among early adolescents in low-income&#xD;
      primary schools in Santiago, Chile. This project involves two stages: first, formative work,&#xD;
      where the research team will review, adapt and pilot the Spanish version of the program to&#xD;
      Chile; and second, the culturally adapted version of Unplugged program will be tested in a&#xD;
      single-blind two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial. This design is the most stringent&#xD;
      design to test the effectiveness of an intervention. Investigators plan to include 37&#xD;
      mixed-sex schools, with a vulnerability index (School Vulnerability Index - National System&#xD;
      of Equality Allocation (IVESINAE)) ≥ 50%, with at least two classes per Year 6 and Year 7, in&#xD;
      each arm (Intervention vs. Control) (n=4440 students per arm). The control schools will&#xD;
      receive the usual teaching and practice in drug prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the intervention, investigators expect that students in schools receiving the&#xD;
      Chilean version of Unplugged will have a lower proportion of substance use and a lower&#xD;
      proportion of students passing from experimental use to regular use of tobacco, alcohol, and&#xD;
      cannabis, than in control schools.&#xD;

The prevention program is called Unplugged in its original name, but the adaptation made by the research team for Chile is called &quot;Yo Sé Lo Que Quiero&quot; (YSLQQ). 12 one-hour sessions taught once a week by class teachers, previously trained in a 3-day course. Each session will be delivered during the time of &quot;Orientation&quot; lessons.</description>

    <description>This program is organized in 12 sessions around three themes:&#xD;
Knowledge and attitudes (sessions 1, 3, 5 and 9): Students reflect on their knowledge of legal and illegal drugs, using critical thinking to obtain an objective assessment of this knowledge.&#xD;
Intrapersonal skills (sessions 4, 6, 8, 10. 11. and 12): Activities are carried out where students can put themselves in everyday situations and develop skills such as assertiveness, problem solving, among others.&#xD;
Interpersonal skills (sessions 2 and 7): Students are instructed to practice refusal skills, assertiveness, and analyze coping strategies.</description>
