      Compassionate use access to fostemsavir (GSK3684934, formerly BMS-663068) for the treatment&#xD;
      of HIV infection in individuals with multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection who are experiencing&#xD;
      virologic failure and are unable to comprise a suppressive regimen with currently available&#xD;
      antiretrovirals.&#xD;

      Fostemsavir (FTR) is the prodrug of temsavir (TMR), which is a novel, first-in-class&#xD;
      attachment inhibitor being developed as a potential treatment of HIV-1 infection.&#xD;
      Investigational FTR is being made available on a compassionate use named patient basis for&#xD;
      the treatment of HIV infection in individuals with multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection who&#xD;
      are experiencing virologic failure (confirmed HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 c/mL) and are unable to&#xD;
      comprise a suppressive regimen with currently available antiretrovirals. Such patients, who&#xD;
      are often heavily treatment experienced (HTE), represent a small and highly vulnerable&#xD;
      subgroup within the overall HIV patient population. The care of HTE patients is difficult and&#xD;
      often complicated by the presence of complex comorbidities, extensive concomitant medication&#xD;
      profiles, and advanced HIV disease.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has given consent for treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is male or non-pregnant female, age 18 years and older. NOTE: there may be&#xD;
             allowance for a lower minimum age if dictated by local regulatory and/or legal&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has chronic HIV-1 infection and is heavily treatment experienced&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient is experiencing virologic failure (confirmed HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 c/mL) on a&#xD;
             current antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen and:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. is unable to comprise a suppressive regimen without fostemsavir due to documented&#xD;
                  multi-drug resistance test results and/or intolerance and/or contraindication AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. has no more than 2 fully active ART agents (0, 1, or 2 ART agents) which can be&#xD;
                  paired with fostemsavir as part of a viable combination ART regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient meets the following reproductive status criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Women must not be breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
                  pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the start of fostemsavir and must agree&#xD;
                  to periodic pregnancy testing (as per local standard of care) for the duration of&#xD;
                  treatment with fostemsavir.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. WOCBP must agree to use at least 1 method of effective contraception for the&#xD;
                  duration of treatment with fostemsavir and 60 hours after fostemsavir drug&#xD;
                  exposure. Males must inform their female partners who are WOCBP of the&#xD;
                  contraceptive requirements of the NPP to which they too are expected to adhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must use condoms for the duration of&#xD;
                  treatment with fostemsavir and 60 hours after last dose. In addition, males must&#xD;
                  be willing to refrain from sperm donation during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from&#xD;
                  contraceptive requirements but must comply with the pregnancy testing schedule as&#xD;
                  outlined in inclusion criterion 5b.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Physicians shall counsel WOCBP and males who are sexually active with WOCBP on the&#xD;
        importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy. At a&#xD;
        minimum, contraceptive counselling should be provided at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

        criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is eligible to access commercial fostemsavir or investigational fostemsavir by&#xD;
             means other than the named patient program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is taking one or more prohibited medications including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. strong CYP3A inducers including, but not limited to: carbamazepine, phenytoin&#xD;

                  inhibitor), rifampicin (antimycobacterial) and St John's wort (Hypericum&#xD;
                  perforatum, herbal supplement),&#xD;
&#xD;
