  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Working with a health system, the investigators will recruit practices to participate in the&#xD;
      pilot study, consent and enroll patients with major depressive disorder, and collect the&#xD;
      PHQ-9 from those patients at three timepoints (baseline, 6 months post-enrollment, and 12&#xD;
      months post-enrollment). The PHQ-9 will be captured either at an office visit or directly&#xD;
      from patients. The investigators will build and implement an open-source SMART on FHIR app to&#xD;
      collect key data from the EHR, combine that data with the PHQ-9 results, and present the&#xD;
      measurements back to the clinicians. The investigators will then obtain feedback from&#xD;
      clinicians on the value and usefulness of the app.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a longitudinal, observational pilot study that will assess the utility and value&#xD;
      displaying the harmonized outcomes data to clinicians in the clinical workflow using an&#xD;
      open-source, SMART on FHIR app. The app will connect with the site EHR, aggregate EHR and PRO&#xD;
      data, calculate the outcome measure results, and return the results to the EHR so that they&#xD;
      are viewable within the clinician workflow. Baseline data on patient characteristics,&#xD;
      treatments, and symptoms will be combined with longitudinal data on outcomes during the study&#xD;
      timeframe. All data will be collected from institution electronic medical records (EMRs), PRO&#xD;
      portals, and other existing data sources, as needed.&#xD;
