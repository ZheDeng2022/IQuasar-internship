  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SirPAD trial is an academic, investigator-initiated, single-center, randomized,&#xD;
      non-inferiority, open-label clinical trial investigating whether the use of sirolimus-coated&#xD;
      balloon catheters in patients with peripheral artery disease of the femoro-popliteal or&#xD;
      below-the-knee segment is not inferior to that of uncoated balloon catheters for major&#xD;
      clinical outcomes (unplanned major amputation, target limb re-vascularization) and may&#xD;
      provide advantages concerning important secondary outcomes, which will be evaluated using a&#xD;
      pre-specified hierarchical order as part of the primary analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a progressive atherosclerotic disease with symptoms&#xD;
      ranging from intermittent claudication (IC) to critical limb ischemia (CLI). The majority of&#xD;
      symptomatic PAD patients present with atherosclerotic lesions located in the femoro-popliteal&#xD;
      arteries and endovascular therapy is the primary choice if the stenosis/occlusions involve&#xD;
      &lt;25 cm of the vessel. A minority of symptomatic PAD patients would present with&#xD;
      infra-popliteal (distal or below-the-knee) lesions: in these patients, the endovascular&#xD;
      treatment is challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug-coated balloons (DCB) and drug-eluting stents (DES) were developed to prevent&#xD;
      neo-intimal proliferation and restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA),&#xD;
      an objective which had been achieved by the local application of either cytostatic (e.g.&#xD;
      paclitaxel - a cytoskeletal disruptor) or immunosuppressive (e.g. sirolimus/everolimus - both&#xD;
      mTOR inhibitors) substances on the vessel wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decade, a few randomized controlled trials (RCT) compared the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of drug-coated (mainly paclitaxel-coated) devices vs. that of uncoated ones, and&#xD;
      demonstrated a significant reduction in restenosis rates, late lumen loss, and incidence of&#xD;
      target lesion re-vascularization. However, the size of these trials was often too small to&#xD;
      draw firm conclusions concerning major clinical outcomes. Moreover, substantial heterogeneity&#xD;
      of the study populations and too restrictive eligibility criteria limited their external&#xD;
      validity, leading to a difficult interpretation of the results of later meta-analyses.&#xD;
      Indeed, these trials adopted as the primary outcome surrogate (and rather subjective)&#xD;
      outcomes, such as vessel patency and target limb re-vascularization, which may be difficult&#xD;
      to objectively adjudicate in the setting of an open-label trial, rather than ´hard´ objective&#xD;
      clinical endpoints, such as major amputation or urgent revascularization due to critical limb&#xD;
      ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, despite the short-term effects appeared promising based on imaging outcome, tthe&#xD;
      results of a recent meta-analysis of 28 trials showed an increased two-year mortality in the&#xD;
      group of patients treated with paclitaxel-coated balloons. Based on these results, and after&#xD;
      analysis of follow-up data from the trials that led to the approval of these products, a Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) panel concluded that, despite the short-term benefits with&#xD;
      paclitaxel-based devices, safety concerns may exist for mid-term mortality risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative drug candidates to paclitaxel-coated balloon catheters are the so-called&#xD;
      limus-based analogs, which own cytostatic properties and are characterized by a wider&#xD;
      therapeutic window. Recently, a novel balloon catheter has been CE-certified: it encapsulates&#xD;
      sirolimus in phospholipid drug nanocarriers to improve adhesion properties of sirolimus and&#xD;
      to provide better bioavailability. Similarly to paclitaxel-coated and uncoated devices,&#xD;
      sirolimus-coated devices are currently approved for routine use in PAD and reimbursed in&#xD;
      Switzerland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present trial is to compare the efficacy, as defined by a composite of&#xD;
      clinically relevant non-subjective ´hard´ outcomes (major amputation and target lesion&#xD;
      re-vascularization for critical limb ischemia), of sirolimus-coated vs. uncoated balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty for peripheral artery disease in patients scheduled for infra-inguinal&#xD;
      re-vascularization and selected based on a very limited number of inclusion criteria (all&#xD;
      comers) aiming at maximization of external validity.&#xD;
