  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study series consists of four related studies and aims to explore and describe many&#xD;
      important elements of alopecia areata over three key areas: (1) the current epidemiology of&#xD;
      alopecia areata, (2) the prevalence and incidence of psychiatric co-morbidities in people&#xD;
      with alopecia areata, (3) the prevalence and incidence of autoimmune and atopic conditions in&#xD;
      people with alopecia areata, and (4) the incidence of common infections in people with&#xD;
      alopecia areata.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      The overall purpose of the first study (Study 1) is to describe the epidemiology of Alopecia&#xD;
      areata (AA) and to assess the current level of primary care service utilisation and&#xD;
      management patterns associated with patients diagnosed with AA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of the second study (study 2) is to assess the prevalence and incidence&#xD;
      of mental health conditions (depressive episodes, recurrent depressive disorder and anxiety&#xD;
      disorder) in adult patients diagnosed with AA relative to a control population of patients&#xD;
      without a diagnosis of AA. In addition, the study will determine both the treatment, 'sick&#xD;
      day' and unemployment burden. Treatment burden comprises that of medications and&#xD;
      psychological interventions used to treat mental health conditions in adult patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with Alopecia areata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of the third study (Study 3) is to assess the prevalence and incidence of&#xD;
      atopic and autoimmune conditions in adult patients diagnosed with AA relative to a control&#xD;
      population of patients without AA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of the fourth study (Study 4) is to assess the incidence of common&#xD;
      infections in adult patients diagnosed with AA relative to a control population of patients&#xD;
      without AA.&#xD;
