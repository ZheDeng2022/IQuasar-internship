      This clinical trial is a prospective, multicentre, randomized, controlled study of high&#xD;
      intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment of benign thyroid nodules. this study will&#xD;
      include 240 patients with benign thyroid nodules that meet all ths the inclusion / exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and will be randomly divided into two groups at 1: 1 ratio. Patients in the test&#xD;
      group will be treated with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), while patients in the&#xD;
      control group will be actively observed and followed up by ultrasound examination. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the test device in&#xD;
      the treatment of benign thyroid nodules, and the secondary objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety of the test device in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules and the improvement of&#xD;
      symptoms assessed by VAS score.&#xD;

    <description>High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive, non-invasive treatment method. The principle is to focus high-intensity ultrasound on the target area. Energy is absorbed by the target tissue and converted into thermal energy. The local temperature quickly reaches a maximum of 85 ° C. It induces coagulative necrosis of focus tissue cells, but does not damage the tissues surrounding the treatment targ</description>
