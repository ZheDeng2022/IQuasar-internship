  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The chronic phase of the study will evaluate the effects of pre-exercise and post-exercise&#xD;
      ingestion of a multi-ingredient supplement on adaptations to a 6-week exercise program&#xD;
      consisting of both resistance training and high intensity aerobic exercise, using a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Participants will complete an&#xD;
      enrollment/familiarization visit, a baseline testing session, followed by a 6-week supervised&#xD;
      exercise intervention, and post-testing session identical to baseline testing. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized during the baseline session to groups receiving either 1) Active Treatment&#xD;
      (pre-post supplementation), 2) placebo (noncaloric beverage), or 3) control, not&#xD;
      participating in exercise or consuming a treatment. During the supervised 6-week resistance&#xD;
      training program, participants will complete a moderate-intensity warm-up, a full-body&#xD;
      resistance training workout (2 x per week) and an interval training session (1 x per week).&#xD;
      Thirty-minutes prior to each training session, and within 15 minutes post-exercise,&#xD;
      participants will consume their randomly assigned treatment beverage. Body composition, blood&#xD;
      markers of muscle damage/recovery, strength, and performance tests will be measured before&#xD;
      (baseline) and after training (Post) to evaluate the effects of supplementation. All data&#xD;
      collection will be conducted by the Principal Investigator and Research Assistants. All&#xD;
      subjects will report to the Applied Physiology Laboratory and Human Performance Center in&#xD;
      Fetzer Hall for all testing and training sessions, which will span approximately 8 weeks.&#xD;
