      The investigators propose to apply neuroplasticity-based computerized cognitive remediation&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advances in cancer treatment are producing a growing number of cancer survivors; therefore,&#xD;
      issues surrounding quality of life during and following cancer treatment have become&#xD;
      increasingly important. Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is one such quality&#xD;
      of life issue that is commonly reported following chemotherapy treatment in adults. Although&#xD;
      studies reporting cognitive impairments associated with chemotherapy have been reported since&#xD;
      the 1980s, the phenomenon commonly referred to as 'chemo brain' or 'chemo fog' is poorly&#xD;
      understood, and for some patients becomes the most distressful survivorship issue faced.&#xD;
      Studies suggest that while up to up to 75% exhibit cognitive decline during treatment, many&#xD;
      patients will return to their pre-chemo level of functioning 1 year after completing&#xD;
      treatment. However, for 30-35% of cancer patients, their cognitive issues persist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies suggest that this persistent chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (pCRCI) can&#xD;
      remain for months to years after completing treatment, which may have implications for the&#xD;
      trajectory of how both normal cognitive aging occurs, but also the risk of cognitive&#xD;
      disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, for the growing number of long-term cancer survivors.&#xD;
      These concerns are particularly relevant for older individuals as risk for not only cancer,&#xD;
      but cognitive impairment (such as dementia) increases with age. As of January 2016, 62% of&#xD;
      cancer survivors (9.61 million) are currently 65 years or older, and this number is expected&#xD;
      to increase dramatically over the coming decades. Therefore, as the number of older cancer&#xD;
      survivors who have will have to cope with pCRCI is likely to increase, it is crucial that The&#xD;
      investigators understand the cognitive impairments, the impact on survivors' functioning, and&#xD;
      develop treatments for pCRCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to target cognitive deficit in CRCI using a novel cognitive&#xD;
      enhancement strategy. Our choice of cognitive focus is informed by clinical, behavioral and&#xD;
      neurobiological data suggesting a reliable association between cognitive control deficits&#xD;
      (CCD), damage to the cognitive control network (CCN), and decline in cognitive functioning.&#xD;
      The CCN is a neural network that supports important cognitive control functions such as&#xD;
      alerting and orienting attention, response selection, cognitive flexibility, strategy&#xD;
      generation, and inhibition of prepotent responses. The investigators propose to apply&#xD;
      neuroplasticity-based computerized cognitive remediation (nCCR) to the treatment of CRCI as&#xD;
      it has demonstrated training and transfer effects of enhanced CCN function in a similar,&#xD;
      abnormally aging population. The theory guiding neuroplasticity-based cognitive interventions&#xD;
      is that network abnormalities associated with negative disease-specific clinical outcomes can&#xD;
      be altered through the induction of neuroplasticity (even in the aging brain) resulting in&#xD;
      enhanced functioning of the target network, and symptomatic improvements.&#xD;

    <description>The nCCR has two major components: Bottom up and Top down training. &quot;Bottom up&quot; training: The training includes selected tasks from &quot;Brain HQ&quot;, a program designed for older adults, that enhances basic processing of sensory stimuli with the goal to improve fidelity of auditory and visual encoding.&#xD;
&quot;Top down training&quot;: We designed programs to target cognitive control functions associated with poor treatment response, i.e., initiation and use of verbal strategy and susceptibility to interference. These &quot;Top Down&quot; Programs include a visual attention program, either Catch the Ball or Neurogrow, and a semantic strategy program, Semantic Organization.</description>
