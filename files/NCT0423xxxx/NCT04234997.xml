    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of suvorexant on established measures of&#xD;
      smoking relapse risk (craving,withdrawal, stress reactivity, latency to self-administration)&#xD;
      and to validate the somnolent effect of suvorexant on sleep metrics in a sample of&#xD;
      individuals with tobacco use disorder&#xD;
