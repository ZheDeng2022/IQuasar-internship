  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a open-label, single-arm study to investigate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      consolidative chemotherapy with camrelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody drug following short&#xD;
      course radiotherapy and subsequent surgical therapy in patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      resectable rectal cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (cT3-4 or N+) are assigned to receive&#xD;
      preoperative 5 × 5 Gy irradiation over 5 days with consolidation chemotherapy consisting two&#xD;
      cycles of CAPOX chemotherapy and camrelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody drug for two cycles.&#xD;
      Subsequent surgical therapy is performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy.&#xD;
