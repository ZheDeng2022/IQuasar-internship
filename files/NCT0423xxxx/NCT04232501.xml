  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new leg compression device in&#xD;
      preventing post-surgical deep vein thrombosis (blood clot) that can occur after major and&#xD;
      complex spine surgery. The investigators aim to show that this new compression device is no&#xD;
      worse than the standard sequential compression device (SCD) at preventing DVT and may be able&#xD;
      to detect deep vein thrombosis in patients who are not typically screened for this diagnosis&#xD;
      after surgery. This new device may be able to capture an important post-surgical complication&#xD;
      while providing a more comfortable treatment option.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Compression therapy of the leg is a proven and well-established modality to prevent deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis in immobilized and post-surgical patients. The investigators aim to compare a new&#xD;
      sequential compression for the leg that utilizes a servo motor for compression as opposed to&#xD;
      a traditional pneumatic motor that is typically used in the hospital and after surgery.&#xD;
      Pneumatic sequential compression devices are cumbersome, expensive and not mobile. This new&#xD;
      compression device was developed to provide a cheaper, mobile device that can be worn by the&#xD;
      patient after surgery and while at home during ambulation. The addition of the servo motor&#xD;
      and fine sensors may also be able to detect sub-clinical DVT's that contribute to&#xD;
      post-surgical pulmonary embolus and post-surgical complications. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      learn how this new device performs in the subset of patients undergoing complex spine&#xD;
      surgery, the incidence of post-surgical DVT with this new device compared to traditional SCD&#xD;
      and if this new device is capable of detecting sub-clinical post-surgical DVT.&#xD;
