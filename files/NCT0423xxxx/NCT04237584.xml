  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, Phase III study of radium-223 plus&#xD;
      enzalutamide or darolutamide compared to enzalutamide or darolutamide treatment plus placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis investigators will test in this study is whether layering radium-223 following&#xD;
      16 weeks of enzalutamide or darolutamide exposure in patients demonstrating a biochemical&#xD;
      response improves disease outcomes. By adding radium-223 following a potential bone flare&#xD;
      phenomenon [after first 12-14 weeks of therapy with an androgen receptor blocker (ARB)],&#xD;
      including patients expected to have durable response to systemic therapy, and mandating the&#xD;
      use of bone protective agents during treatment, the investigators aim to demonstrate an&#xD;
      optimal time to add radium-223 in the mCRPC landscape.&#xD;

&#xD;
             Subjects must meet the remaining inclusion criteria in order to be qualified for the&#xD;
             second randomization (R2). Only subjects that complete the initial 12 weeks of run-in&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Patients must have a documented ≥ 30% decline of PSA at any time during the 12 weeks&#xD;
             of RT1.&#xD;

             metastases, or leptomeningeal tumor spread as demonstrated via CT/MRI of chest,&#xD;
             abdomen, pelvis, and CNS (if needed). CT/MRI of the CNS only performed if suspicion of&#xD;
             CNS metastases or leptomeningeal tumor spread. Nodules &lt; 1 cm alone will not be&#xD;
             considered visceral metastases. Renal masses &lt; 3 cm will not be considered&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Presence of other active cancers, or history of treatment for invasive cancer ≤2 years&#xD;
             of R1. Patients with Stage I/II cancer who have received definitive local treatment&#xD;
             and are considered unlikely to recur are eligible. All patients with previously&#xD;
             treated in situ carcinoma (i.e., non-invasive) and superficial bladder cancer are&#xD;
             eligible, as are patients with history of non-melanoma skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Any other serious or unstable illness, or medical, social, or psychological condition,&#xD;
             that could jeopardize the safety of the subject and/or his/her compliance with study&#xD;
             procedures, or may interfere with the subject's participation in the study or&#xD;
             evaluation of the study results.&quot;&#xD;
