  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microbial keratitis is a common and serious eye disease in Edinburgh. Prompt treatment with&#xD;
      antibiotics can prevent sight loss, and identification of the micro-organism and its&#xD;
      antibiotic sensitivities are key to appropriate management. Standard practice of collecting&#xD;
      infected material from the cornea using a blade can be distressing and time-consuming.&#xD;
      Corneal impression membranes (CIM) have recently been introduced to another National Health&#xD;
      Service (NHS) eye unit (St Paul's Eye Unit, Liverpool) as they detect more micro-organisms&#xD;
      and are more patient-friendly than corneal scrape. The aim of this study is to compare CIM&#xD;
      with reference to current standard practice of corneal scrape. If CIM have greater&#xD;
      sensitivity and fewer adverse events than scrape then the investigators will consider using&#xD;
      CIM instead of scrape in routine clinical care. The investigators will also collect&#xD;
      additional CIM to help develop new microbiological tests being developed at the University of&#xD;
      Edinburgh, which if successful could be applied to CIM at the bedside to further improve the&#xD;
      speed of diagnosis in the future. Development of the new microbiological tests is facilitated&#xD;
      by having samples of germs from eye infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: cross-sectional study comparing diagnostic techniques Participants: recruited&#xD;
      from the Acute referral clinic at the Princess Alexandra Eye Pavilion, or emergency on-call&#xD;
      ophthalmology service What is involved: subjects with microbial keratitis will have standard&#xD;
      investigations to identify the germ causing the infection. In addition the investigators will&#xD;
      capture germs using CIM, and will compare CIM with the standard test to see which is better.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Microbial keratitis is a common serious eye disease in Edinburgh. Prompt treatment with&#xD;
      antibiotics can prevent sight loss, and identification of the micro-organism and its&#xD;
      sensitivities are key to appropriate management. It is standard practice to collect multiple&#xD;
      samples from the cornea using a needle or blade and plate material from an ulcer onto culture&#xD;
      media. However this can be distressing to the patient, and the procedure can be especially&#xD;
      difficult in those who are not co-operative or where there is a risk of corneal perforation.&#xD;
      Corneal scrapes are also time consuming to prepare and perform. Corneal impression membranes&#xD;
      (CIM) have recently been introduced to clinical practice in St Paul's Eye Unit in Liverpool,&#xD;
      after a study found significantly higher isolation of micro-organisms from CIM compared to&#xD;
      corneal scrape (40.8% vs 26.9% in n=130 eyes). However, CIM are not currently used in&#xD;
      clinical practice in Scotland, and the results from Liverpool have not yet been replicated in&#xD;
      a second study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What questions does the study aim to answer?&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is CIM better at capturing the germ causing corneal infection than corneal scrape in&#xD;
           Edinburgh?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is CIM acceptable in terms of side effects, compared to corneal scrape?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Can new diagnostic techniques be used on CIM to detect micro-organisms?&#xD;
&#xD;
      What new information will the research provide? Whether or not CIM are clinically useful in&#xD;
      Edinburgh. It is possible that this study will find a higher frequency of contaminants with&#xD;
      CIM, and the investigators will record the specific organism as well as the frequency for&#xD;
      analysis. The project will also determine if new diagnostic techniques being developed in the&#xD;
      University of Edinburgh can be used on CIM from patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional study aiming to compare the diagnostic accuracy of corneal&#xD;
      impression membrane (CIM) against a clinical reference standard of corneal scrape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the CIM is better at picking up germs from the eye than the&#xD;
      traditional corneal scrape. A second hypothesis is that CIM is more acceptable for the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study follows the methods of a previous study in Liverpool, and will recruit a&#xD;
      consecutive series of patients with bacterial, fungal, or acanthamoeba microbial keratitis.&#xD;
      Patients seen in the Princess Alexandra Eye Pavilion Acute Referral Clinic, or in evenings or&#xD;
      weekends on-call, will be invited to take part. The study aims to recruit 120 eyes (to detect&#xD;
      a difference of 0.15 between the discordant proportions (80% power, 2-sided significance 5%;&#xD;
      McNemar's test; based on the results of the Liverpool study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent a doctor will anaesthetise the cornea and collect corneal material&#xD;
      from the ulcer using surgical blades. Corneal scrape will be done once for each plate of&#xD;
      culture media, once for a Gram stain smear, and once for acanthamoeba (if indicated), per&#xD;
      eye. This is standard clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this, a series of four CIM will be applied to the ulcer, while the eye is still&#xD;
      anaesthetised. The CIM is a circle of filter paper on a plastic applicator. It is touched to&#xD;
      the ulcer for 3-5 seconds, and then placed in a sterile container with broth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples from the cornea will be sent to microbiology for processing, according to standard&#xD;
      clinical practice, along with one CIM for comparison. Three further CIM will be sent to the&#xD;
      University of Edinburgh for analysis using new microbiological tests. Patients will be&#xD;
      treated empirically according to current local standard practice while awaiting microbiology&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How is keratitis diagnosed? A doctor can tell if there is an infection of the cornea (i.e.&#xD;
      diagnose microbial keratitis) simply by examining the eye. However, in order to find out&#xD;
      which germ is causing the infection samples of the ulcer must be sent to the microbiology&#xD;
      lab. Traditionally this is done by scraping the cornea with a blade or needle, but this is&#xD;
      unpleasant and doesn't always pick up germs from the eye. The investigators think that the&#xD;
      CIM will pick up more germs and be less unpleasant for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What will the new microbiological tests at the University involve? CIM sent to the University&#xD;
      will be tested in a lab using new methods currently under development. These use special&#xD;
      probes to detect bacteria. The investigators will determine whether optical Smart Probes,&#xD;
      which are able to detect Gram positive or Gram negative bacteria or fungi in real-time&#xD;
      (developed within the Proteus group (proteus.ac.uk) at the University of Edinburgh) are able&#xD;
      to identify the infective pathogen on the CIM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How and where will patients be recruited? Patients presenting to the Princess Alexandra Eye&#xD;
      Pavilion will be invited to take part if they have symptoms and signs that are typical of&#xD;
      microbial keratitis. These patients will be recruited from the Acute Referral Clinic, or the&#xD;
      on-call service out of hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How long will visits take? A normal visit to the Acute Referral Clinic or on-call eye doctor&#xD;
      for microbial keratitis can take up to an hour. The extra work of consenting the patient and&#xD;
      applying CIM is unlikely to add a significant amount of time to the visit. The investigators&#xD;
      estimate an addition of less than 30min in most cases. Although patients can take longer to&#xD;
      decide to take part, the process of applying the CIM is itself very quick (approximately 5min&#xD;
      overall, the CIM are only on the eye for 3-5 seconds each).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are there any follow up visits? Patients will be followed up as part of standard care, but&#xD;
      this project does not involve any follow up for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How are participants treated? Standard care for microbial keratitis is broad spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotic eye drops. These are given straight away after the corneal scrape. Antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment is changed later if the lab test results show this is necessary. The investigators&#xD;
      will treat according to standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do ophthalmologists require special training to apply the CIM? The investigators will give&#xD;
      the doctors one training session on correct procedures for scrape and CIM. In addition there&#xD;
      will be instructions for how to apply the CIM in a bag with the CIM to be used for each&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is an ulcer in both eyes will you sample both? Yes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will the participant have had any treatment before recruitment? Possibly. Sometimes patients&#xD;
      with microbial keratitis have been treated by their optician or General Practitioner (GP)&#xD;
      before being sent to the Eye Pavilion. This will not affect eligibility for the study, but&#xD;
      the investigators will record which antibiotics have been used before recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How are CIM prepared? CIM are supplied from Merck in sterile packaging. They are ready to&#xD;
      use. There is no further processing.&#xD;
