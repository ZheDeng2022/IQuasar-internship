  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective for Part A of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      evinacumab in pediatric patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective for Part B of the study is to demonstrate a reduction of low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by evinacumab in pediatric (5 to 11 years of age) patients&#xD;
      with HoFH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective for Part A of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      evinacumab administered intravenous (IV) in pediatric patients with HoFH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives for Part B of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of evinacumab on other lipid parameters (ie, apolipoprotein B&#xD;
           (Apo B), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC),&#xD;
           lipoprotein a [Lp(a)]) in pediatric patients with HoFH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of evinacumab administered IV in pediatric&#xD;
           patients with HoFH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the PK of evinacumab in pediatric patients with HoFH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immunogenicity of evinacumab in pediatric patients with HoFH over time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate patient efficacy by mutation status&#xD;
