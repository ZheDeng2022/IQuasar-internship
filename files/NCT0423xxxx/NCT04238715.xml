    <description>The ORR will be assessed by IIR based on RECIST version 1.1. ORR is defined as a percentage of participants with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). CR: disappearance of all (targeted and non-target [NT]) lesions. PR: For PR, longest diameter will be used for non-lymph target lesions but short axis is measured for lymph lesions. PR: greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference baseline, associated to non-progressive disease (non-PD) response for (NT) lesions.</description>

    <description>PFS will be assessed by IIR based on RECIST version 1.1. PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first. PD per RECIST 1.1 is defined as at least a 20% relative increase and 5 mm absolute increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum on study) recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>

The BOR of SD has to be observed greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 7 weeks from the date of first study dose. CR: disappearance of all lesions.
