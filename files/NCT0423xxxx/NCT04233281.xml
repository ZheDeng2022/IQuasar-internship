    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, cross-over, double blind, controlled trial in which study&#xD;
      participants will visit the research facility on two occasions under fasting conditions with&#xD;
      a minimum of 1 week between visits. During each visit, participants will receive a&#xD;
      carbohydrate rich test-meal with Kori-tofu (protein) or whey protein. The two meals will be&#xD;
      given in randomized order and blood will be collected via a catheter before and up to 3 hours&#xD;
      after consumption of the test-meal. Study participants will also wear continuous glucose&#xD;
      meters during the trial. They will receive a standardized evening meal prior to each study&#xD;
      day and are asked not to drink alcohol or perform heavy exercise the day before. After each&#xD;
      test day participants are offered a meal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several types of tofu, an example of a specific type of tofu is called Kori-tofu.&#xD;
      Kori-tofu literally means frozen tofu. The production process of Kori-tofu leads to the&#xD;
      formation of a higher high molecular weight fraction (HMF) content of the soy proteins.&#xD;
      Several clinical studies describe the effects of Kofi-tofu on health. In this study, the aim&#xD;
      is to investigate whether Kori-tofu protein affects postprandial blood glucose concentrations&#xD;
      in participants with an impaired glucose tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to investigate whether Kori-tofu protein affects postprandial blood&#xD;
      glucose concentrations, when administered as a part of an ordinary high carbohydrate meal.&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to investigate whether Kori-tofu protein affects postprandial&#xD;
      insulin concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized, cross-over, double blind, controlled trial in which study&#xD;
      participants will visit the research facility on two occasions under fasting conditions.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive two different carbohydrate-rich meals, either with added Kori-tofu or&#xD;
      whey protein, with a washout period of one week. Blood will be collected via a catheter&#xD;
      before and up-to 3 hours after consumption of the test-meal.&#xD;
