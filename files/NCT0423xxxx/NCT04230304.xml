  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well daratumumab and ibrutinib work in treating patients with&#xD;
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has come back (relapsed) or has not responded to previous&#xD;
      treatment (refractory). Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody which works with the body's&#xD;
      immune system to destroy cancer cells. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving daratumumab and ibrutinib may&#xD;
      work better in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia compared to ibrutinib&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the overall response rate after 6 cycles of treatment with daratumumab in&#xD;
      combination with ibrutinib in patients who are on /or are previously treated with ibrutinib.&#xD;
      (Cohort 1) II. Determine the overall response rate after 6 cycles of treatment with&#xD;
      daratumumab in combination with ibrutinib in patients who are naive to ibrutinib treatment.&#xD;
      (Cohort 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the best overall response rate to treatment with daratumumab plus ibrutinib at&#xD;
      any time during the course of the therapy. (Cohort 1) II. The overall incidence of MRD&#xD;
      (minimal residual disease) negative state and the time to achieving MRD negativity at any&#xD;
      time during this therapy. (Cohort 1) III. Progression free survival (as determined by the&#xD;
      International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia [IWCLL] criteria) among all patients.&#xD;
      (Cohort 1) IV. The overall toxicity profile of daratumumab/ibrutinib treatment in this group&#xD;
      of patients. (Cohort 1) V. Determine the best overall response rate to treatment with&#xD;
      daratumumab plus ibrutinib at any time during the course of the therapy. (Cohort 2) VI. The&#xD;
      overall incidence of MRD (minimal residual disease) negative state and the time to achieving&#xD;
      MRD negativity at any time during this therapy. (Cohort 2) VII. The overall toxicity profile&#xD;
      of daratumumab/ibrutinib treatment in this group of patients. (Cohort 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycles 1-2, on&#xD;
      days 1 and 15 of cycles 3-6, and then on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Beginning in cycle 2,&#xD;
      patients also receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study registration, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

    <description>Will be evaluated in each cohort independently. A response is defined as an objective status of complete response (CR), CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi), complete clinical response (CCR), nodular partial response (nPR), or PR after 6 cycles of combination treatment. In each cohort, the proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Ninety-five percent exact binomial confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated.</description>

    <description>Will be evaluated in each cohort independently. Will be estimated by the number of patients who achieve MRD negative response in both blood and bone marrow at any time during combination treatment divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true success rate will be calculated. In patients who achieve MRD negative response, time to achieve MRD negative response will be summarized descriptively (median, range). Time to achieve MRD negative response is defined as time from registration to the earliest date of documentation of MRD negative response in both blood and bone marrow.</description>
