    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this pilot study (R21) is to address the urgent need for theoretically&#xD;
      and empirically informed interventions that prevent poor female youth's rural-to-urban&#xD;
      migration for child labor in low and middle-income countries. The study will address the&#xD;
      following specific aims: Aim 1: Pilot test the (i) feasibility and acceptability of ANZANSI;&#xD;
      and (ii) preliminary impact of ANZANSI by comparing the control arm to the treatment arm on&#xD;
      specific child development outcomes; Aim 2: Explore multi- level factors (individual, family,&#xD;
      and programmatic) impacting participation in and experiences with the ANZANSI.&#xD;

      The primary goal of this pilot study (R21) is to address the urgent need for theoretically&#xD;
      and empirically informed interventions that prevent poor female youth's rural-to-urban&#xD;
      migration for child labor in low and middle-income countries. The International Labor&#xD;
      Organization (ILO) estimates that 11% of children (ages 5 to 17) worldwide are child&#xD;
      laborers. ILO recently drew attention to migrant child laborers as an underreported, but more&#xD;
      vulnerable group to adverse outcomes relative to children working locally. Sub-Saharan Africa&#xD;
      (SSA) continues to be the continent with the highest rates of child labor, with Ghana&#xD;
      registering one of the highest incidence rates at 22%, including unaccompanied child migrants&#xD;
      engaged in labor. Adolescent girls make up the majority of unaccompanied rural-to-urban&#xD;
      migrants in search of better economic opportunities. Studies document the myriad of serious&#xD;
      threats to health and emotional well-being experienced by female adolescent migrants engaged&#xD;
      in child labor. These threats underline the urgent need for theoretically-informed preventive&#xD;
      interventions, specifically tailored to address the root causes of female child migrant labor&#xD;
      and the needs of girls from economically insecure families and communities. Hence, this&#xD;
      application titled ANZANSI Family Program focuses on girls before they drop out of school,&#xD;
      but as they begin exhibiting possibility of dropping out. Specifically, ANZANSI is an&#xD;
      innovative combination intervention program, combining an evidence-informed family-level&#xD;
      economic empowerment (EE) aimed at creating and strengthening financial stability through the&#xD;
      use of matched children savings accounts (CSA) and microfinance in poor households with a&#xD;
      multiple family group (MFG) intervention addressing family functioning and parental beliefs&#xD;
      around gender and child labor/ education. Informed by asset theory, parental ethnotheories&#xD;
      framework; and the investigative team's research in SSA on child-wellbeing and poverty, the&#xD;
      study uses a cluster randomized control design (N=10 schools; n=100 girls ages 11-14 at risk&#xD;
      of dropping out of school and their caregivers), assigned to two study conditions (N= 5&#xD;
      schools; n=50 children at risk of dropping out of school and their caregivers in each&#xD;
      condition). The control group will receive bolstered usual care, including books and school&#xD;
      lunch and treatment group will receive a combination intervention (Family EE+MFG) called&#xD;
      ANZANSI, to address the following specific aims: Aim 1: Pilot test the (i) feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of ANZANSI; and (ii) preliminary impact of ANZANSI by comparing the control arm&#xD;
      to the treatment arm on specific child development outcomes; Aim 2: Explore multi- level&#xD;
      factors (individual, family, and programmatic) impacting participation in and experiences&#xD;
      with the ANZANSI. This study is aligned with NICHD's mission to support research relevant to&#xD;
      the psychological, behavioral, and educational development and health of children worldwide.&#xD;
      Ultimately, our findings may guide approaches to address youth's unaccompanied rural-to-urban&#xD;
      migration and involvement in child labor in SSA, and the associated negative consequences.&#xD;

    <description>Female adolescents in the bolstered care will receive services/education as usual in their respective schools. The usual care will be bolstered by providing school notebooks and lunch in the control arm (bolstered care will also be provided to treatment arm). Primary school education is universal and free in Ghana. Yet notebooks and lunch are costly expenses for families that create a barrier to school attendance. Hence, these will be provided to participants in all study schools.</description>

    <description>the ANZANSI that combines Family Economic Empowerment (EE) with Multiple Family Groups (MFG). Family EE includes: 1) Workshops on asset building, future planning, and protection from risks; 2) Child Development Account (CDA); and 3) Family income-generating/microenterprise promotion (IGA) component:&#xD;
MFG a family-centered, group-delivered, evidence-informed intervention designed for children and adolescents whose families struggle with poverty and associated stressors. The MFG is based on building family support through opportunities for parents and children to communicate in a safe setting with other families who have shared experiences, and allow each family to learn from one another. MFG builds protective factors for healthy parent-child relationships while addressing familial, social and community stressors and barriers to adolescent girls' well-being.</description>
