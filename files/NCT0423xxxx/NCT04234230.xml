  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of patients with end-stage heart disease requiring the implantation of ventricular&#xD;
      assist devices (VAD) is steadily increasing. Living with a VAD exposes the patients to&#xD;
      multiple challenges and the need to learn complex self-management skills. Inadequate&#xD;
      self-management can lead to serious complications (e.g. bleeding or wound infections) and&#xD;
      impair the psychosocial outcome. This study aims to provide multi-centered actual analysis of&#xD;
      self-management capabilities as well as analyzing moderating predictors in VAD patients&#xD;
      through standardized prevalence assessment. Using a cross-sectional design, this prevalence&#xD;
      study will be conducted at four established German heartcenters (Freiburg, Berlin, Bad&#xD;
      Oeynhausen, Leipzig). VAD-patients are questioned about their self-management skills using&#xD;
      standardized Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Secondary PRO measures include&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, symptoms of anxiety and depression, post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      symptoms, social support, and changed body-image. Relevant complications (bleeding, wound&#xD;
      infections, thromboembolic neurological events) are taken from the patient records. Based on&#xD;
      a conservative sample size estimation inclusion of 450 patients is envisioned. The expected&#xD;
      results may contribute to an improved assessment of the current situation in terms of&#xD;
      self-management skills and needs for curricular training concepts and psychosocial&#xD;
      concomitant therapy. Long-term, the study results contribute to improve the health care for&#xD;
      long-term VAD patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of patients with end-stage heart disease requiring the implantation of ventricular&#xD;
      assist devices (VAD) is steadily increasing. Due to advanced compensatory technological&#xD;
      developments, VAD support has been established as a recognized therapy concept for the&#xD;
      long-term care of those affected. Indications include a multi-year bridging therapy (up to 10&#xD;
      years) and increasingly a destination therapy. The Euromacs Register published the second&#xD;
      report in 2018 and reported 2,947 registered VAD implantations in 2016 (+257 percent).&#xD;
      Euromacs further points to a rising trend and demand for the use of VAD systems. In Germany,&#xD;
      an increase of VAD implantation by 36.6 percent has been reported since 2011. The position&#xD;
      paper of the German Society of Cardiology (2016) points to the fact that the range of&#xD;
      indications for VAD implantation for patients with chronic heart disease will continue to&#xD;
      change. The ISHLT Guideline (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation),&#xD;
      published in 2018, calls for psychosocial care and standardized self-management skills for&#xD;
      patients before, during, and in the long-term after VAD implantation. This is currently being&#xD;
      implemented inconsistently in terms of structure and quality in German cardiac centers. After&#xD;
      VAD implantation, patients and their relatives must be able to follow a complex therapeutic&#xD;
      regimen. They need comprehensive knowledge as well as self-management skills for the safe&#xD;
      management of everyday life in a domestic setting. These self-management capabilities include&#xD;
      the so-called device handling (for example dealing with the technical equipment including&#xD;
      battery replacement and controller monitoring), to perform the wound care of the driveline,&#xD;
      to carry out anticoagulation measurements and adapted revenues of oral anticoagulant, to take&#xD;
      further medication, to monitor vital signs (for example blood pressure, temperature) and, in&#xD;
      the case of symptoms, to take adequate measures to prevent further complications (for example&#xD;
      prompt information from the heart center on the onset of symptoms). In addition, lifestyle&#xD;
      changes are an essential part of the success of long-term therapy. This requires a sufficient&#xD;
      degree of self-management ability and mental stability. In addition, it is important to&#xD;
      emotionally accept the dependence of a device on the heart, the changed body image, to cope&#xD;
      with fears of (real potential) malfunctions and complications and to build up a subjective&#xD;
      quality of life with a constant, visible and tangible companion at heart. The mental health&#xD;
      of all those affected is considered to be in need of observation, although there is currently&#xD;
      no reliable prevalence data on mental disorders. In a first survey in 2006, 64% had at least&#xD;
      one psychologically / psychiatric treatment requiring diagnosis. All this shows, the&#xD;
      challenges VAD patients have to face are complex. Thus, this study aims to provide&#xD;
      multi-centered actual analysis of self-management capabilities as well as analyzing&#xD;
      moderating predictors in VAD patients through standardized PRO prevalence assessment. The&#xD;
      prevalence survey should be conducted in all outpatients (at least 3 months up to a maximum&#xD;
      of 3 years at the VAD) in four established German cardiac centers (Freiburg, Berlin, Bad&#xD;
      Oeynhausen, Leipzig). The study focuses on those involved in outpatient care, as they had to&#xD;
      integrate the VAD into their daily lives after implantation and are able to report deficits,&#xD;
      resources and needs on the basis of their experience of self-management. As an assessment&#xD;
      instrument a standardized PRO measure was chosen to identify self-management skills and&#xD;
      needs. Secondary PRO measures include health-related quality of life, symptoms of anxiety,&#xD;
      depression and post-traumatic stress, as well as social support. Relevant complications&#xD;
      (bleeding, wound infections, thromboembolic neurological events) are taken from the patient&#xD;
      records. Based on a conservative sample size estimation inclusion of 450 patients is&#xD;
      envisioned. The expected results may contribute to an improved assessment of the current&#xD;
      situation in terms of self-management skills and needs for curricular training concepts and&#xD;
      psychosocial concomitant therapy. Long-term, the study results contribute to improve the&#xD;
      health care for long-term VAD patients. The study is planned to continue in a second and&#xD;
      third phase to develop and test a standardized self-management care for VAD patients in&#xD;
      Germany.&#xD;
