  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adopting a healthy eating pattern is important for meeting dietary recommendations and weight&#xD;
      management. Although less clear, it seems reasonable to assume that the eating patterns we&#xD;
      typically follow can also affect our psychological wellbeing. As such, healthy eating&#xD;
      patterns are often adapted to suit one's personal preference. For example, many people choose&#xD;
      to follow a vegetarian-style eating pattern whereby meat, poultry, and seafood are excluded&#xD;
      from the diet. However, current research suggests that vegetarian eating patterns may result&#xD;
      in decreased synthesis of new muscle proteins when compared to the typical meat-based&#xD;
      US-style diet. This ultimately leads to reduced muscle quality and mass which increases the&#xD;
      risk of dependence and mobility limitations later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another important factor to consider when adapting a healthy eating pattern is the frequency&#xD;
      and distribution of meals throughout the day. In the US, protein intake is typically skewed&#xD;
      throughout the day such that people consume more protein at dinner when compared to&#xD;
      breakfast. This skewed distribution combined with a low meal frequency (3 meals per day) can&#xD;
      also sacrifice the rate of muscle protein synthesis. As such, it is important to investigate&#xD;
      the interaction between food choices, meal frequency, and protein distribution to promote&#xD;
      muscle health and prevent development of disease and disability. In addition, it is also&#xD;
      important to understand how these eating patterns affect enjoyment and pleasure following&#xD;
      meals. This work will help to determine healthy eating patterns that promote muscle health&#xD;
      and psychological wellbeing.&#xD;
