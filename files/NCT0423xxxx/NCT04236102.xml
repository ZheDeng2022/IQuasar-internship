      Use of the Biocartis Idylla ™ platform for the detection of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor,&#xD;
      B-RAF and K-RAS proto-oncogene mutations in liquid based cytology specimens and blood plasma&#xD;
      samples from patients with non small cell lung carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advances in medicine have resulted in the development of specific drugs to treat cancers that&#xD;
      express certain mutations. The detection of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), BRAF and&#xD;
      KRAS mutations (10-30%, 1-2%, 25% respectively) in lung cancers and KRAS mutations in 94% of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancers allows these patients to be treated with a wider cohort of drugs,&#xD;
      potentially resulting in progression free, prolonged survival, with a more favourable&#xD;
      tolerability and less adverse effects compared with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NHS England has a test directory which lists the molecular tests that trusts should provide&#xD;
      for cancer patients. EGRF, KRAS and BRAF are listed in this directory. Verification of the&#xD;
      use of the Idylla would enable this trust to provide all of these molecular tests&#xD;
      effectively. Lung and pancreatic cancers both present at advanced disease states and&#xD;
      therefore a rapid turnaround of test results is vital. Currently laboratories rely on the use&#xD;
      of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples for EGFR testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clots are produced in the laboratory to congeal all of the tissue fragments and cells into&#xD;
      one solid mass. The clotted sample is then fixed in formalin and processed. The current&#xD;
      processing and reporting time is 5 days. Liquid based cytology (LBC) specimens obtained&#xD;
      through the same sampling procedures are also prepared in the laboratory and fixed using a&#xD;
      methanol based fixative called Preservcyt. Previous research has been conducted to determine&#xD;
      whether LBC samples can be used instead of FFPE samples for mutation detection with&#xD;
      favourable results. A switch to the use of LBC samples for mutation analysis on the Idylla&#xD;
      would remove multiple processing steps and make use of residual samples that are currently&#xD;
      discarded, which optimises the amount of testing that we can run on small cytology samples,&#xD;
      reducing the likelihood of repeat procedures for patients. Alcohol fixation is regarded as a&#xD;
      superior method of DNA and RNA preservation, therefore better molecular results will be seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of circulating tumour cell mutations could in the future negate the need for&#xD;
      invasive procedures, with patients requiring a simple blood test for diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine whether LBC samples are a feasible and reliable&#xD;
      alternative to FFPE samples for detecting mutations in LBC samples and blood using the Idylla&#xD;
      platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: EFGR, KRAS and BRAF mutations identified using FFPE samples will be detected in&#xD;
      LBC and blood plasma samples using the Biocartis Idylla ™ platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study: (extension of previous research project - IRAS Number: 261622) Will use&#xD;
      residual material from existing LBC cytology samples sent to the laboratory. Routine testing&#xD;
      will take priority. Cases identified as non small cell lung carcinoma will have the residual&#xD;
      LBC sample tested on the Idylla platform for EGFR, KRAS and BRAF. The EGFR, KRAS and BRAF&#xD;
      mutation results obtained using the routine diagnostic procedure (FFPE samples) will be&#xD;
      compared to those produced using the LBC samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will involve testing archived FFPE clot samples from confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      patients since 2014 (Approximately 20 cases per year). KRAS testing will be performed using&#xD;
      the Idylla platform to establish if there is a KRAS codon 12 mutation present in 94% percent&#xD;
      of the cases reported at RCHT. Patients will have consented to the use of their tissue at the&#xD;
      time of procedure. Prospectively new patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma will&#xD;
      have KRAS testing on the FFPE clot made as part of the routine diagnostic work up and KRAS&#xD;
      testing on the LBC sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3 of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will involve a blood sample being taken at the time of the procedure from patients that have&#xD;
      a clinical suspicion of having lung or pancreatic cancer. The single blood sample will be&#xD;
      taken from the cannula inserted for the procedure. The blood sample will be processed using&#xD;
      the Biocartis Idylla ™ circulating tumour cell cartridges (EFGR, KRAS and BRAF for lung and&#xD;
      KRAS for pancreas).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples for inclusion in the study will be identified by a (member of direct care team)&#xD;
      working in the cytology department who will perform a computerised search every week and&#xD;
      identify patients who have been diagnosed with non small cell lung carcinoma or pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma. The patient's original laboratory number will be entered into a secure,&#xD;
      password protected database and the patient will then be assigned with a new study number.&#xD;
      This database, and patient information, will only be accessible by the senior biomedical&#xD;
      scientist and will be stored in a secure electronic file in compliance with information&#xD;
      governance and patient confidentiality. Patient samples will be labelled with the study&#xD;
      number and the original laboratory number and all patient information will be covered. The&#xD;
      researcher will not have access to any patient information and will not be able to identify&#xD;
      any patients. The senior biomedical scientist will store the anonymised results of the study&#xD;
      into the database. The study duration will be 24 months. In which time it is estimated that&#xD;
      the following number of patients will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 patients for non small cell lung carcinoma 60 retrospective pancreatic adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      samples 40 prospective pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attending for EUS (Endoscopic ultrasound) or EBUS (Endobronchial ultrasound) guided&#xD;
      fine needle aspirations with a clinical suspicion of non-small cell lung carcinoma or&#xD;
      pancreatic carcinoma by multi-disciplinary team. Samples for inclusion in the study will be&#xD;
      identified by a senior biomedical scientist (member of direct care team) working in the&#xD;
      cytology department who will perform a computerised search every week and identify patients&#xD;
      who have been diagnosed with lung non-small cell carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The&#xD;
      patient's original laboratory number will be entered into a secure, password protected&#xD;
      database and the patient will then be assigned with a new study number. This database, and&#xD;
      patient information, will only be accessible by the senior biomedical scientist and will be&#xD;
      stored in a secure file in compliance with information governance and patient&#xD;
      confidentiality. Patient samples will be labelled with the study number and the original&#xD;
      laboratory number and all patient information will be covered. The researcher will not have&#xD;
      access to any patient information and will not be able to identify any patients. Samples that&#xD;
      do not meet the study criteria will be discarded in accordance with laboratory protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient data (including tissue samples and associated reports) will be anonymised prior&#xD;
      to being released to the primary researcher. The identifiable data is linked by a laboratory&#xD;
      number. This information is stored in a secure database accessible only by a member of the&#xD;
      direct care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information is stored and backed up on secure servers at the Royal Cornwall Hospital. All&#xD;
      databases relevant to the research will be password protected and this is monitored by the&#xD;
      RCHT IT department. The location of the databases themselves will only be accessible to&#xD;
      authorised users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No further patient intervention is required for this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If liquid based cytology (LBC) samples are found to be a feasible alternative for EGFR, KRAS&#xD;
      and BRAF mutation testing this has the potential to result in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quicker turnaround time of results in cases of unequivocal adenocarcinoma. This would&#xD;
           provide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Earlier access to treatment allowing for optimal patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expands the range of molecular testing provided in house as recommended by the NHS test&#xD;
           library.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Easier sample preparation within the laboratory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase in efficient use of material could also prevent repeat sampling procedures on&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of LBC samples may allow for better results from molecular testing (methanol&#xD;
           superior fixative to formalin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supports of the use of blood sample testing for circulating tumour cells (less invasive&#xD;
           sampling). This may identify at what disease staging circulating tumour cells can be&#xD;
           detected in blood plasma, which would make it a potential future diagnostic triaging and&#xD;
           follow up tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supports KRAS mutation testing for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and future development of&#xD;
           target therapies specific to the codon 12 mutation&#xD;
