  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will focus on the relapse of arch width in two types of retention regimes, which&#xD;
      are modified vacuum-formed retainers and Hawley type retainers in patients after fixed&#xD;
      appliance treatment. This will subsequently be of valuable information for clinicians in&#xD;
      choosing the appropriate type of retainers after removal of their fixed appliances. This is&#xD;
      because the modified vacuum-formed retainers will be significantly cheaper, quicker and&#xD;
      easier to fabricate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relapse is inevitable in orthodontic treatment. Teeth will want to return to their original&#xD;
      position after fixed appliances are removed. Regardless with or without fixed appliances,&#xD;
      changes and physiological relapse will still occur due to time and age changes. This is why&#xD;
      retention is a crucial part of orthodontic treatment, where it would aim to maintain the&#xD;
      corrections achieved after orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature regarding retainers is quite substantial, where a recent Cochrane review was&#xD;
      published comparing the different types of retainers. However, the evidence is lacking in&#xD;
      terms of comparison of arch width relapse between modified vacuum-formed retainers and Hawley&#xD;
      retainers specifically in expansion cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare the relapse in arch width in expansion cases with modified&#xD;
      vacuum-formed retainers with palatal coverage versus Hawley type retainers in Unit Ortodontik&#xD;
      Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), Klinik Pakar Ortodontik Klinik Kesihatan Bandar Botanik&#xD;
      and Unit Pakar Ortodontik Klinik Pergigian Sungai Chua patients. Although other types of&#xD;
      modified vacuum-formed retainers effective for maintaining palatal expansion have been&#xD;
      described, these retainers require a wire outlining the Cementoenamel junction of the teeth&#xD;
      palatally. This technique requires the experience of the technician, is at a higher cost and&#xD;
      requires more lab time. The modified retainer that investigators described in this study&#xD;
      would be as efficient and as quick as the normal vacuum-formed retainers, which would usually&#xD;
      take a couple of hours to make (same day or next day fit). The present practice at all 3&#xD;
      locations constructs Hawley and normal VFR retainers for all orthodontic patients. There are&#xD;
      technicians and laboratory facilities to construct normal VFR as well as Hawley retainer. The&#xD;
      only difference between modified and normal vacuum formed retainer is the outline of the&#xD;
      retainers where the technician would trim the retainer, where it would cover the hard palate.&#xD;
      Therefore it is only the location of trimming that is different using the same special&#xD;
      trimming appliances for normal VFRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of subjects who fulfil the criteria will be invited to participate in this study.&#xD;
      The study will involve arch width analysis using study models pre, post-debond, 3 months&#xD;
      review post-debond, and 6 months review post-debond. All data will be analyses using&#xD;
      Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The arch width of subjects post-fixed&#xD;
      appliances will be compared. Most studies compare the arch width, as well as lower incisor&#xD;
      irregularity in evaluating relapse in different groups of retainers. However, there are&#xD;
      currently no randomized control trials comparing expansion cases of Hawley vs vacuum-formed&#xD;
      retainers, hence why this study will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to see no difference between the modified vacuum formed retainer and&#xD;
      Hawley retainer in terms of maintaining arch expansion post-orthodontic treatment. This&#xD;
      would, therefore, mean that there would be a simpler method and would be a suitable more&#xD;
      cost-effective alternative as compared to constructing Hawley retainers or adding a palatal&#xD;
      wire on the vacuum-formed retainers.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are at least 13 years old at time of debond.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Treatment plan of extraction or non-extraction followed by straight wire appliances in&#xD;
             the upper arch only or both arches&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Undergone more than 3mm of maxillary dentoalveolar expansion. Initially, the amount of&#xD;
             arch width expansion was measured intraorally at debond and compared to their&#xD;
             respective pre-treatment dental casts. To ensure accuracy, the measurements were&#xD;
             repeated on debond and pre-treatment dental casts. The following linear arch width&#xD;
             measurements were made: intercanine width (ICW - the distance between the canine cusp&#xD;
             tips), interpremolar width (IPMW - the distance between the premolar cusp tips),&#xD;
             interfirst molar width 1 (IFMW1 - the distance between the mesiobuccal cusp), and&#xD;
             interfirst molar width 2 (IFMW2 - the distance between the distobuccal cusp). At least&#xD;
             two or more points were expanded (&gt; 3mm) to be included in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No chronic medical conditions&#xD;
