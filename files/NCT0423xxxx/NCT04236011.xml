    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center prospective study to determine the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of GC012F CAR-T cells in patients diagnosed with BCMA+ refractory/relapsed multiple&#xD;
      myeloma (r/r MM).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of GC012F in r/r MM. GC012F&#xD;
      is an autologous dual chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy that targets B-cell&#xD;
      maturation antigen (BCMA) and CD19. This study comprises of a Screening Phase (less than or&#xD;
      equal to [&lt;=] 28 days prior to apheresis) followed by Apheresis (will occur upon enrollment);&#xD;
      Treatment Phase including a conditioning regimen followed by infusion of GC012F and&#xD;
      post-infusion assessments from Day 1 to Day 84; and a Post-treatment Phase (Day 85 and up to&#xD;
      end of the study). Efficacy will be explored to assessed and safety will be closely monitored&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
