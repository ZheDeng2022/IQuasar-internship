  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm feasibility study to evaluate adherence to a ketogenic diet in patients&#xD;
      with low tumor burden, treatment-naïve mantle cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated for eligibility and baseline assessments prior to initiating the&#xD;
      ketogenic diet during the screening period and/or prior to initiating the ketogenic diet on&#xD;
      Day 1. Eligible subjects will receive study treatment which will consist of a daily ketogenic&#xD;
      diet for up to 12 weeks (Day 1 through Day 84). Subjects will be monitored with weekly&#xD;
      assessments of adherence to diet and effects on serum metabolic markers, tumor specimens, and&#xD;
      body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discontinuing the ketogenic diet, subjects will be followed for 28 days.&#xD;
