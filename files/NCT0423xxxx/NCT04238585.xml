    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled intervention evaluates the effect of a mobile health behavioral&#xD;
      intervention to test messages to reduce sugar-sweetened beverage intake during pregnancy and&#xD;
      infancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will perform a prospective, longitudinal, interventional, randomized control&#xD;
      trial by recruiting 300 WIC families during the first 1,000 days of life (pregnancy through&#xD;
      infant age 2 months) at consecutive Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) visits to test two&#xD;
      interventions compared to a control group. The study team will implement a mobile-based&#xD;
      messaging intervention allocate participants to one of 3 arms for a 1 month period: 1)&#xD;
      negative message frames, 2) positive message frames, and 3) attention control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity prevalence soared over the past four decades with a 10-fold increase&#xD;
      globally from 1975-2015 and Healthy People 2020 has declared obesity a national health&#xD;
      priority. Socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in obesity exist and may be widening.&#xD;
      These disparities are apparent by age 2 years with recent national data showing that Hispanic&#xD;
      children continue to have highest obesity prevalence (15.6%) and on-Hispanic black children&#xD;
      have 2-fold higher obesity prevalence (10.4%) compared to non-Hispanic white (5.2%)&#xD;
      counterparts. The first 1,000 days describes the period from pregnancy through child age 2&#xD;
      years, and is increasingly recognized as a critical period for development of childhood&#xD;
      obesity and its adverse consequences. Several risk factors are consistently associated with&#xD;
      later childhood obesity during the first 1,000 days and are more prevalent among low&#xD;
      socioeconomic groups and racial/ethnic minorities. These modifiable risk factors mediate the&#xD;
      development of racial/ethnic disparities in later childhood obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption during the first 1,000 days is a risk factor for&#xD;
      childhood overweight/obesity, and has been linked to dental caries, lower child cognition,&#xD;
      and the adverse child health consequences. Recent evidence shows that maternal SSB&#xD;
      consumption during pregnancy and infant SSB consumption in the first year of life are&#xD;
      associated with childhood obesity later in life. Thus, interventions to curb SSB consumption&#xD;
      and promote healthy beverage intake in urban, low-income Hispanic/Latino families must start&#xD;
      early in life, yet few SSB-specific interventions have ventured to do so.&#xD;
