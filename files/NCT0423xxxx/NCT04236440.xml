  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers in this study want to learn how drug BAY2586116 works in patients with&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is a sleep disorder marked by breathing pauses during&#xD;
      sleep due to repetitive obstructions of the upper airway. BAY2586116 is a new drug under&#xD;
      development for the treatment of OSA. It blocks protein channels expressed on the surface of&#xD;
      the upper airways in small mechanoreceptors (a type of molecule that sense and pass stimulus&#xD;
      outside a cell on to the inside of the cell through mechanical gate on the surface of the&#xD;
      cell). Thus, the negative pressure reflex alerting the brain of inspiration is triggered more&#xD;
      easily leading to a stronger activation of throat muscles. This prevents narrowing or&#xD;
      collapse of the upper airways during sleep which is one of the pathological key factors in&#xD;
      OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will study the effects of different routes of administration (drops into the&#xD;
      nose, spray into the nose or throat or spray into the throat by endoscopy). Endoscopy allows&#xD;
      the doctor to look at areas in the throat that cannot be seen with a mirror: a thin tube-like&#xD;
      instrument is inserted through the nose to check and give the medication. Different doses of&#xD;
      the test drug will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They also want to find out if participants experience any medical problems during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in this study will undergo three study parts. After completing Part A&#xD;
      and Part B, participants will be asked to join Part C. In Part A, participants will receive&#xD;
      both the test drug and placebo (a placebo looks like the test drug but does not have any&#xD;
      medicine in it); in Part B, participants will receive the test drug twice via different&#xD;
      routes of administration (drops in nose and spray in nose or throat) and in Part C, the&#xD;
      participants would receive the test drug once via spray in throat by endoscopy. The sleep of&#xD;
      the participants will be monitored by medical equipment. Participants will be asked to visit&#xD;
      the clinic 7 times in 14 weeks in total.&#xD;
