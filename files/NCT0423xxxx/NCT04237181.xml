  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute diarrhea and acute colitis of infectious origin are common reasons for consultation at&#xD;
      the emergency department. The current etiological diagnostic approach is limited to the&#xD;
      determination of markers of inflammation, such as CRP and blood leukocytes, which lack&#xD;
      specificity and sensitivity for bacterial infection. The stool culture can detect bacterial&#xD;
      pathogens in the stool with a result at least 48 hours later and a positivity rate &lt;50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will describe the procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations (a biomarker of bacterial&#xD;
      infection) in this population to evaluate its usefulness depending on the viral or bacterial&#xD;
      etiology identified by stool multiplex gastro-intestinal PCR panel (GI panel) and stool&#xD;
      culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that PCT levels will be higher if the GI panel or the stool&#xD;
      culture identifies a bacteria or a parasite, as it is the case in respiratory tract&#xD;
      infections. If there is a detection of a virus by the GI panel or both the stool culture and&#xD;
      the GI panel are negative, the investigators expect that PCT values will be lower or&#xD;
      negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators will include the patients admitted to the ED with a suspicion of infectious&#xD;
      diarrhea or acute colitis in order to have a large representative panel of infectious&#xD;
      diarrhea etiologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only the patients having a blood sample prescribed as the routine care will be included. The&#xD;
      blood sample is useful for dosing CRP and whole blood cell count (WBC), which are part of&#xD;
      current biologic analyses performed in this context. After getting the patient's consent, the&#xD;
      investigator will add the PCT dosage in blood sampling and will ask the patient to provide a&#xD;
      stool sample, in order to have a stool culture and to perform an extended investigation for&#xD;
      the pathogens through multiplex PCR technology (Filmarray ®GI panel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physician will be asked if all these results (the ones ordered currently together with&#xD;
      the dosage of PCT and the GI panel) will change his/her decision to start an antibiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a phone call at day 15 after their initial admission in the emergency&#xD;
      department and will be asked if he/she has consulted a new physician or if a new treatment by&#xD;
      antibiotics was started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedures: Data from the medical file will be collected by the investigators&#xD;
      and the emergency department clinical research assistant. All the data will be pseudonymized.&#xD;
      The collection will be done at the day of admission in the emergency department and after the&#xD;
      phone interview at Day15.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Statistical justification for sample size: This will be a pilot study to describe the results&#xD;
      of PCT concentration and multiplex GI panel. As to our knowledge, there is no published study&#xD;
      reporting PCT concentrations in this population. This preclude a sample, size calculation.&#xD;
      The investigators will include as much patients as possible during one year in order to cover&#xD;
      the epidemiological seasonal variations and to obtain a convenient sample of at least 100&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods description: Clinical and biological data will be reported as median and&#xD;
      interquartile range or mean +/- SD. PCT values will be reported as median and IQR,&#xD;
      respectively if a there is a viral infection, a documented infection (bacterium or parasite)&#xD;
      or no pathogen identified by GI panel and/or stool culture (bacteria). Patient's&#xD;
      characteristics and PCT results will be compared in all groups, using as a reference, the&#xD;
      group where no pathogen is observed. A sub-group analysis will be performed on colitis and&#xD;
      acute diarrhea respectively, to find out if there is any difference with the variables&#xD;
      analyzed as both pathologies are not managed in the same way.&#xD;
