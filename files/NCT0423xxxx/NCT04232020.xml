      To compare the Idylla microsatellite instability test versus mismatch repair&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) in gastric adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric adenocarcinoma is a common form of cancer which is associated with a poor prognosis.&#xD;
      Up to 22% of gastric adenocarcinomas arise via the microsatellite instability (MSI) /&#xD;
      mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. These cases can be detected either by mismatch repair&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) or microsatellite instability testing. Detection of mismatch&#xD;
      repair deficiency or microsatellite instability is important because patients with this type&#xD;
      of gastric adenocarcinoma are shown to benefit from a different therapeutic approach. High&#xD;
      concordance between mismatch repair immunohistochemistry and microsatellite instability&#xD;
      testing has already been demonstrated. The implementation of either method is largely based&#xD;
      on local availability. The Idylla MSI test presents a novel method of establishing MSI status&#xD;
      in comparison to pre-existing MSI testing platforms. The Idylla MSI tests uses a fully&#xD;
      automated, ultra-rapid system that can work on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue with&#xD;
      no need for preceding DNA extraction. Implementation of the Idylla MSI test could reduce&#xD;
      reporting turnaround times and requires less technical expertise to perform in comparison to&#xD;
      other platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators department does not currently have the facilities to perform MSI testing on&#xD;
      any platform, so the advantages of introducing the Idylla MSI test would also include the&#xD;
      generic advantages of MSI testing. These advantages include: the ability to quickly check&#xD;
      cases shown to have possible MMR loss on IHC (i.e. equivocal cases) with MSI testing; and&#xD;
      providing an alternative to MMR IHC for screening of Lynch syndrome, reducing the burden on&#xD;
      reporting pathologists and reduce the inter-observer variability associated with IHC&#xD;
      interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Idylla MSI test already demonstrates high concordance with other MSI testing platforms&#xD;
      but has yet to be compared to the department's accepted standard of MMR IHC. This project&#xD;
      aims to compare the Idylla MSI test to in-house MMR IHC to establish whether the two methods&#xD;
      are concordant in reporting MMR / MSI status in gastric adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
