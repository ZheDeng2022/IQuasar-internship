      The purpose of this study evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop&#xD;
      (AHCL) system in sub-optimally controlled patients with T1D, in comparison with Multiple&#xD;
      Daily Injection (MDI) therapy with Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) or Continuous Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring (CGM). Patient with a diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes currently under MDI+ FGM or&#xD;
      MDI+ CGM therapy will be enrolled.&#xD;

      This study is a pre-market, multi-center, prospective, open label, adaptative, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in insulin-requiring adult subjects with type 1 diabetes on MDI therapy. The&#xD;
      study will have three period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Run-in Phase: The Run-in period is of 4 weeks (and can be extended for 2 additional&#xD;
           ones) during which time a blinded CGM sensor will be worn for two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Phase: There will be a 6 months randomized study period with two arms: Treatment&#xD;
           Arm (AHCL) and the Control Arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Continuation Phase: There will be a 6 months continuation phase during which time all&#xD;
           the subjects will use the AHCL system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 124 subjects will be enrolled in the study up to 20 investigational centers in&#xD;
      EMEA.&#xD;
