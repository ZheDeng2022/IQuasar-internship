  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This preliminary study is designed to evaluate mechanisms by which excitatory dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) (vs. sham) and&#xD;
      pharmacological stress (vs. placebo) alter behavior in non-treatment seeking individuals with&#xD;
      opioid use disorder (OUD). Specific Aims are to (1) Evaluate how stress impacts domains of&#xD;
      behavior including (1a) executive function and (1b) opioid-seeking behavior; and (2)&#xD;
      Determine whether rTMS stimulation attenuates (2a) executive dysfunction, (2b)&#xD;
      stress-reactivity, and (2c) opioid-seeking in individuals with OUD not receiving treatment.&#xD;

      This study will use a double-blind, 10Hz left dlPFC rTMS (vs. sham) and pharmacological&#xD;
      stressor ([yohimbine + hydrocortisone] vs. placebo) within-subject, randomized crossover&#xD;
      design. Each participant will complete 4 sessions (stressor vs. placebo, crossed with rTMS&#xD;
      vs. sham), each separated by at least 1 week. Participants will complete these 4 (2x2 within&#xD;
      subject) test conditions in randomized order: sham rTMS/placebo stress, sham rTMS/active&#xD;
      stress, active rTMS/ placebo stress, and active rTMS/active stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI will perform randomization using a Latin Square and will assign participants to&#xD;
      conditions and prepare medication (stressor or placebo) for each participant's sessions. The&#xD;
      PI will keep others blinded and will not be involved in study assessments.&#xD;
