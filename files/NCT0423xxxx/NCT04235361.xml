    <textblock>
      A mobile suitcase laboratory for EBOV point-of-care (POC) detection at Ebola treatment&#xD;
      centers was successfully implemented in Guinea during the large Ebola virus disease (EVD)&#xD;
      outbreak in West-Africa 2014-2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was shown that isothermal amplification (Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA)) could&#xD;
      be efficiently used to test suspect EVD cases and local teams were trained in and&#xD;
      successfully deployed with this fast method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the frame of this project we want to train teams in DRC and expand RPA testing capacity to&#xD;
      the differentials recommended by the WHO. Existing RPA assays for all parameters will be&#xD;
      included into a multistrip for simultaneous use. This will be integrated with a simple&#xD;
      biosafe extraction method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementing this approach and testing in the ongoing EVD outbreak will provide teams in DRC&#xD;
      with response capacity for future EVD outbreaks.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the Ebola outbreak in Guinea up to 90% of patients tested negative but were rarely&#xD;
      diagnosed for differentials and Malaria and other diseases went under-diagnosed, which most&#xD;
      likely lead to more deaths from these infectious agents. Another important aspect is that,&#xD;
      the fear of the patients of having Ebola, while they are suffering from other disease must be&#xD;
      overcome by providing the correct diagnosis of the type of the pathogen timely. [Dunbar NK et&#xD;
      al.].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RPA assay is six times faster than conventional real-time PCR while yielding the same&#xD;
      analytical sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the RPA format (equipment size,&#xD;
      cold-chain independent reagents) makes rapid on-site testing feasible and affordable. We&#xD;
      developed a mobile laboratory, which consists of a hard plastic glovebox a&#xD;
      Diagnostics-in-a-Suitcase (DiaS), and a solar panel and power pack set. The disassembled&#xD;
      glovebox is kept in a metal box (80 × 60 × 41 cm) with other necessary materials&#xD;
      (disinfectant solution, extraction kits, filter tips, racks, vortex, heat block, autoclavable&#xD;
      plastic bags and personal protective equipment (PPE). The total weight is 28 kg for the box&#xD;
      and 16 kg for the DiaS. Sample inactivation and RNA extraction using the SE kit so far were&#xD;
      done in the glovebox. This allowed handling of hazard group 4 samples. The RT-RPA assay was&#xD;
      performed in the DiaS containing the ESEQuant TS2 device with integrated touchscreen to&#xD;
      operate the device and display the results without the need of a laptop, which is not easy to&#xD;
      disinfect (Figure 1).The mobile lab was successfully deployed in Conakry when an increasing&#xD;
      number of cases, due mainly to non-reporting, reticence, and infection transmission chains&#xD;
      during burials developed towards the end of 2014. To provide quick results for the safe and&#xD;
      dignified burial (SDB) programme two mobile laboratories were set up in the Matoto Gbessia&#xD;
      Port II district. Altogether 928 post-mortem swab samples were tested. Overall, 120 samples&#xD;
      (12.9%) scored positive. Positive results were obtained within 30-40 min and reported&#xD;
      directly to the SDB teams [Faye O et al.].&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPROACH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the performances and operational characteristics of the differential RPA we will&#xD;
      use i) a panel of well characterized EBOV sera from samples collected in Guinea and DRC ii)&#xD;
      sera from EVD suspect cases, and iii) sera from routine diagnostics at IPD and NIBR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out on material from EVD suspected persons, archived and&#xD;
      prospective EBOV negative samples and selected routine diagnostic samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria: All subjects (male, female, adults and children) meeting&#xD;
      the WHO case definition of &quot;suspected&quot; and &quot;probable&quot; EVD case eligible for real time RT-PCR&#xD;
      assay, according to the currently used case definition in DRC. For the prospective&#xD;
      evaluation, oral informed consent from the patient/legal guardian will be requested for&#xD;
      eligibility to participate in the study and exclusion criteria will be inability to provide&#xD;
      consent, samples or condition that could jeopardize the subject's safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A panel of 50-100 RT-PCR positive samples for each differential pathogen, and 50-100 RT-PCR&#xD;
      negative samples will be assembled and used. With an expected RPA assay sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of 98% (confidence interval of 95%), a minimum of 30 positive and negative cases&#xD;
      for each parameter shall be included in the study. Based on our experience in Guinea, 10% of&#xD;
      RT-PCR tests on samples from suspect cases are EBOV positive. Consequently 300 suspected EVD&#xD;
      cases need to be screened to obtain at least 30 EVD positive samples. A prevalence gradient&#xD;
      of P. falciparum &gt; S.typhi &gt; DENV &gt; YFV would be expected in the remaining 270 samples. The&#xD;
      minimum number of positives and negatives to be tested for each parameter will be calculated&#xD;
      according to their prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples collection and processing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the prospective study in febrile patients and potential new EVD outbreaks, saliva and&#xD;
      serum will be collected via oral swabbing and venepuncture as per SOP performed in the EVD&#xD;
      outbreak in Guinea harmonized with SOPs used in DRC for patients with EVD symptoms complying&#xD;
      to the protocol inclusion criteria. EBOV-RPA and real time RT-PCR will be performed and&#xD;
      results will be classified as concordant negative or positive or discordant. Patients with&#xD;
      EBOV negative and positive results will respectively be discharged or hospitalized according&#xD;
      to criteria established locally. Discordant results will be retested on the same sample and a&#xD;
      supplemental one collected 24 hours later. If discrepancy cannot be resolved, results will be&#xD;
      discussed with the clinician to take the best decision for the patient and communities&#xD;
      regarding the context. Archived samples will be tested directly from aliquots stored in the&#xD;
      freezer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample extraction protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially all collected sample will be subjected to inactivation step using lysis buffer in&#xD;
      BSL-3 portable Glove box (Figure 2). Two rapid extraction protocols will be validated and&#xD;
      compared for their suitability for field use, (i) a NaoH based alkaline lysis protocol&#xD;
      provided by TwistDX which can be used directly on whole blood and serum [Osmundson TW et&#xD;
      al.], (ii) a filter paper based nucleic acid extraction method allowing total nucleic acid&#xD;
      extraction from crude samples [Zou Y et al.].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both protocols require a maximum 10 minutes. Extracts will be sent to the BSL-4 laboratory in&#xD;
      Winnipeg, Canada (NML), to confirm inactivation of Ebola virus in the sample extract by&#xD;
      inoculation on cell culture. The RPA will be operated from the suitcase laboratory, which&#xD;
      contains all equipment and reagents needed (Figure 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and storage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data and results will be recorded via an existing questionnaire used in Guinea,&#xD;
      harmonized to procedures in DRC and entered into a database. Data include but are not limited&#xD;
      to age, sex, date of admission, date of onset, date of sampling, detailed symptoms, results&#xD;
      of testing, final classification of the patient, disease outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate quality control measures will be implemented to monitor the reliability of the&#xD;
      process for data collection, entry general management compliance, and for the quality of data&#xD;
      generated. At the end of the study all data collected, will be controlled for quality and&#xD;
      locked for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard operating procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOPs of all applicable research processes will be made available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be analysed to give an accurate description of the study population. Each&#xD;
      collected variable will be described using statistical indicators such as mean, median,&#xD;
      standard deviation for quantitative variables and frequencies for qualitative variables. The&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals will be provided as well as significance tests (such as Xi-square)&#xD;
      for comparison between analytical and clinical performance of the EVD diagnostic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test accuracy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postive ref Negative ref tests result tests result Positive test result TP FP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Negative test result FN TN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity: Proportion of true positives samples. (TP/TP+FN) Specificity: Proportion of true&#xD;
      negative samples. (TN/TN+FP) The sensitivity and the specificity will be combined in a kappa&#xD;
      value to estimate the overall performance of the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test usefulness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A scoring system will be developed to assess the user friendliness&#xD;
