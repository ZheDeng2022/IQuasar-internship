      This phase 1 study aims to assess the safety and tolerability of monoclonal antibody (mAb)&#xD;
      TB31F administered intravenously or subcutaneously in healthy, malaria naïve, adults at the&#xD;
      Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc). Five groups will receive a single dose of mAb&#xD;
      TB31F. Group 1 (n=5) will receive 0.1 mg/kg TB31F, Group 2 (n=5) will receive 1 mg/kg TB31F,&#xD;
      group 3 (n=5) will receive 3 mg/kg TB31F, and group 4 (n=5) will receive 10 mg/kg mAb TB31F&#xD;
      intravenously. Group 5 will receive 100mg TB31F subcutaneously. Twenty-five (n=25) subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled, as well as 1 reserve subject per group. Safety follow-up will be done at&#xD;
      following times: baseline, end of infusion (EOI), 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours and 2, 7, 14, 21, 28,&#xD;
      56 and 84 days after administration. Extra follow-up visits at 4 and 10 days after&#xD;
      administration for collection of serum/plasma for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      measurements will be performed in group 5.&#xD;
