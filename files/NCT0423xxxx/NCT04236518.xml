  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dietary shift from animal to plant protein sources is one of the key aspects of the&#xD;
      nutritional transition towards more sustainable food system and diets. However the metabolic&#xD;
      implication of this shift in protein sources are still poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to characterize and understand the metabolic orientations specifically&#xD;
      induced by animal and vegetable dietary proteins, in order to better analyze the metabolic&#xD;
      reorientations that would result from the expected increase in the share of plant proteins in&#xD;
      different dietary contexts, especially those of the Western type, often associated with the&#xD;
      development of metabolic deregulations (obesity and cardiometabolic risk).&#xD;

      The main objectives of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the metabolic adaptations induced by animal or plant protein diets and&#xD;
           their repercussions in terms of physiology and health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the medium-term metabolomic signatures induced by this shift in dietary&#xD;
           protein sources&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validate, in a human population, biomarkers of dietary animal or plant proteins,&#xD;
           previously identified in pre-clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is open, monocentric, controlled, randomized, with a cross experimental&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 men or postmenopausal women will follow for 4 weeks a controlled diet with a protein&#xD;
      fraction constituted mainly from animal or vegetal sources. After a 2-week washout&#xD;
      period(+21D/-7D), they will follow another 4 week of controlled diet with predominantly&#xD;
      animal or plant protein depending on 1st intervention period diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each intervention period, a post-prandial exploration will be conducted with&#xD;
      the administration of a high-fat, high-sugar meal and subsequent blood and urine sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order in which participants will received the two diets will be randomized.&#xD;
