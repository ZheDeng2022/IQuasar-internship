      This phase I trial studies the side effects of polatuzumab vedotin when given with&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with untreated large B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      that grows and spreads quickly and has severe symptoms (aggressive). Polatuzumab vedotin is a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody, polatuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called vedotin. Polatuzumab&#xD;
      attaches to CD79B positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them.&#xD;
      Drugs used in combination chemotherapy such as etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as prednisone, lower the body's immune response and are used&#xD;
      with other drugs in the treatment of some types of cancer. Giving polatuzumab vedotin in&#xD;
      addition to etoposide, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and rituximab may help treat&#xD;
      patients with aggressive large B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1, polatuzumab vedotin IV on day 1,&#xD;
      prednisone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5, etoposide IV on days 1-4, doxorubicin&#xD;
      IV on days 1-4, and cyclophosphamide IV on day 5. Patients also receive filgrastim&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) 24-72 hours after the last dose of each treatment cycle. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

             of anticoagulants, or subject is shown to have an antiphospholipid antibody on workup&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate&#xD;
             of =&lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 12 months after the&#xD;
             last dose of study treatment. Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same&#xD;
             period. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is&#xD;
             post-menarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (=&lt;12 continuous months of&#xD;
             amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone&#xD;
             surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). The definition of&#xD;
             childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or&#xD;
             requirements. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of =&lt;1% per year&#xD;
             include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that&#xD;
             inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine&#xD;
             devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
             duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.&#xD;
             Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation&#xD;
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of childbearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test result during&#xD;
             screening period. Women who are considered not to be of childbearing potential are not&#xD;
             required to have a pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
             a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below: With female&#xD;
             partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men must remain&#xD;
             abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after&#xD;
             the last treatment. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period. The&#xD;
             reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of&#xD;
             the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and&#xD;
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of preventing drug exposure. Male patients&#xD;
             considering preservation of fertility should bank sperm before study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to any of the individual components of EPCH-R, including prior&#xD;
             receipt of anthracyclines, or history of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to&#xD;

             products&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic treatment for lymphoma with the exception of corticosteroids. Prior&#xD;
             radiotherapy is allowed provided that this site is not used as a measurable site to&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Richter's transformation from chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma&#xD;
             is not allowed. Transformation from follicular lymphoma is allowed provided that the&#xD;

             component meets one of the criteria listed in inclusion criterion 1&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Prior therapy for large B-cell lymphoma except for patients who require lymphoma&#xD;
             symptom control during screening may receive steroids in the following manner: Up to&#xD;

             screening, including prior to finalization of staging (not included as part of&#xD;
             pre-phase treatment) If glucocorticoid treatment is urgently required at higher doses&#xD;
             for lymphoma symptom control prior to the start of study treatment, tumor assessments&#xD;
             must be completed prior to initiation of &gt; 30-100 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent.&#xD;
             Prednisone &gt; 30-100 mg/day or equivalent may be given for a maximum of 7 days as a&#xD;
             pre-phase treatment.&#xD;

             compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, including significant&#xD;
             cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac&#xD;

             unstable angina) or pulmonary disease (including obstructive pulmonary disease and&#xD;
             history of bronchospasm)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent major surgery (within 4 weeks prior to the start of cycle 1), other than for&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic, or other infection&#xD;
             (excluding fungal infections of nail beds) which requires systemic treatment. Patients&#xD;

&#xD;
             * Patients with occult or prior hepatitis B infection (defined as positive total&#xD;
             hepatitis B core antibody and negative HBsAg) may be included if hepatitis B virus&#xD;
             (HBV) DNA is undetectable at the time of screening. These patients must be willing to&#xD;

             institutional standard&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive test results for hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody serology&#xD;
