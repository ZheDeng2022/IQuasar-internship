  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to confirm safety and efficacy of BioPearl™&#xD;
      microspheres loaded with doxorubicin in the treatment of patients with unresectable&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, multi-centre, post-market study to further assess safety&#xD;
      and efficacy in 20 unresectable HCC patients treated with Doxorubicin loaded BioPearl™&#xD;
      microspheres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the treatment procedure, all patients will undergo clinical follow-up until disease&#xD;
      progression and/or next treatment option after which patients will be followed for survival.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up to a maximum of 3 years.&#xD;

    <description>First, an angiography of the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery and hepatic artery will be obtained by using a peripheral arterial approach.&#xD;
Arterial embolization will be performed through catheterization of intrahepatic arteries, as selectively as possible (tumor feeders, subsegmental, segmental). The size of the microcatheter must be consistent with the size of BioPearl™ microspheres used. Microspheres of 200 µm will be be used. They will be loaded with the appropriate dose of doxorubicin injectable solution, mixed with the contrast media and distributed according to the location of the HCC lesions. The endpoint of the procedure will be achieved end when stasis of the feeders is achieved.</description>

             study endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Trials requiring extended follow-up for products that were investigational, but&#xD;
             have become commercially available since then, are not considered investigational&#xD;
             trials.&#xD;
