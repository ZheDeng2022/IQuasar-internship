  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative Neuromonitoring (IONM) was started to be used by surgeons to help prevent&#xD;
      laryngeal nerve (RLN) damage during thyroid and parathyroid operations. IONM can be used to&#xD;
      localize and identify RLN intraoperatively, to evaluate vocal function after thyroid&#xD;
      resection, and to explain the mechanism of RLN injury. However, an important problem in the&#xD;
      routine use of IONM is the effect of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs). The use of NMBAs&#xD;
      in general anesthesia is essential to provide clinically acceptable tracheal intubation&#xD;
      conditions and to prevent laryngeal trauma. However, NMBAs may be the potential cause of a&#xD;
      false-negative response during the IONM. Randolph et al. proposed short-acting 1-2 mg/kg&#xD;
      succinylcholine for enough relaxation and the ease of electromyographic (EMG) endotracheal&#xD;
      tube intubation during the IONM. However, succinylcholine, a depolarizing NMBA, is associated&#xD;
      with various adverse effects such as cardiac arrhythmia, hyperkalemia, and malignant&#xD;
      hyperthermia. Nondepolarizing NMBAs are widely used by most anesthesiologists due to their&#xD;
      safe effects, but to the best our knowledge, there is no very short-acting nondepolarizing&#xD;
      NMBA. This deficiency creates a problem because the dose and the time point of nerve&#xD;
      stimulation are critical for a successful IONM. However, some studies have reported the&#xD;
      feasibility of IONM following the administration of nondepolarizing NMBAs during a thyroid&#xD;
      operation. Rocuronium is a short-acting and nondepolarizing NMBA type which is widely used&#xD;
      for induction in general anesthesia. Although 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium is recommended for&#xD;
      standard intubation dose, the ease of intubation can also be provided with 0.3 mg/kg&#xD;
      rocuronium or 1.5 mg/kg succinylcholine. Therefore, the present study was designed to compare&#xD;
      the effects of IONM with low and standard rocuronium doses in the induction of general&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;

      The present study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. A written informed&#xD;
      consent form was obtained from each patient. Patients were informed on the purpose of using&#xD;
      the INOM system to potentially assist in the localization and identification of RLNS during&#xD;
      the operation as well as to evaluate their functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes patients between the ages of 18-65 who were implemented total&#xD;
      thyroidectomy, those with ASA I-III, patients who were approved by the otolaryngologist to&#xD;
      have a normal cord examination before and after surgery and patients operated by 2 surgeons&#xD;
      who were general surgery specialists and accepted as endocrine surgery consultants and&#xD;
      anesthetized by the only anesthesiologist who was included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria were determined as predicted difficult intubation, severe liver or&#xD;
      renal dysfunction, asthma, drug abuse, morbid obesity, and the presence of drug use that may&#xD;
      affect neuromuscular diseases or neuromuscular transmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was designed as a prospective randomized controlled and double-blind study.&#xD;
      Accidental numbers were produced in order to prevent selection bias. In the numbers produced,&#xD;
      1: 0,3 mg/kg rocuronium, 2: 0,6 mg/kg rocuronium group was predefined and patients were&#xD;
      assigned to groups in this direction. Random numbers made MedCalc 18.2.1. The double-blind&#xD;
      study was designed in a way that the anesthesia technician who gave the rocuronium to the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist knew, and the anesthesiologist and surgeon who intubated and carried out the&#xD;
      TOF and INOM follow-up didn't know the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group 1 patients were determined as those who were administered 0.3 mg/kg rocuronium, and&#xD;
      the group 2 patients as those who were administered 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the patients who were taken to the operation table, EKG, SPO2, TA, TOF monitorization&#xD;
      will be performed and the values will be recorded during the operation. The anesthesia&#xD;
      induction of both groups will be done with 3 mg/kg propofol, 2 mg/kg fentanyl and rocuronium&#xD;
      bromide according to the relevant group and an intubation tube with the appropriate number&#xD;
      and having the IONM electrode will be used as intubation tube for each patient (NIM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neuromuscular blockade was followed up quantitatively with an acceleromiograph (TOF&#xD;
      Guard; Organon Teknika NV, Turnhout, Belgium). The stimulation of the ulnar nerve and&#xD;
      acceleration measurements for the adductor pollicis muscle were used for the&#xD;
      acceleromiography. Electrodes were placed on the ulnar nerve at the volar surface of the&#xD;
      wrist. The distal electrode was placed at the point where the proximal bending line passed to&#xD;
      the radial side of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proximal electrode was placed 2 or 3 cm proximally on the distal electrode. The converter&#xD;
      (TOF-Watch Handadapter; Organon) was positioned in a way that the largest flat surface&#xD;
      corresponds to the thumb. The converting cable was placed so that no traction was applied to&#xD;
      the converter and the movement of the thumb was not restricted in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the anesthesia induction, rocuronium was administered to the group at an&#xD;
      appropriate dosage and the patients who had a TOF value below 90% were intubated. The EMG&#xD;
      endotracheal tube (Nerve Integrity Monitor [NIM]; Medtronic Xomed, Jacksonville, FL) was&#xD;
      placed directly by an anesthesiologist with laryngoscopy. The position of the electrodes was&#xD;
      checked by a laryngoscopic examination after the patient's neck was placed in the full&#xD;
      extension position according to our standard IONM procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesia maintenance after induction was achieved with 2-3% severane and 0.05-0.2 micgr&#xD;
      / kg remifentanil. A 40 mg-propofol was added as the recovery dose during the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vagal stimulation is the routine procedure prior to the definition of RLN during thyroid&#xD;
      operation. This step is important to ensure that the monitoring system is working correctly&#xD;
      and that the RLN remains on a normal path. The vagus nerve was found first when the skin flap&#xD;
      was removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nerve was then stimulated every 5 min after 30 to 70 minutes following the administration&#xD;
      of the rocuronium. 8 EMG signals were measured at 30th, 35th, 40th, 45th, 50th, 55th, 60th,&#xD;
      and 70th minutes, respectively. To obtain an EMG response, the vagus nerve was directly&#xD;
      touched with a 2 mA monopolar nerve stimulus bar (Prass; Medtronic Xomed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Helbo-Hansen score (Steyn's modification, Table1) was used to evaluate the ease of&#xD;
      intubation. The sum of the scores of these five individual variables was calculated as the&#xD;
      Helbo-Hansen score (Steyn's modification, Table 1). A total score of 5 points was considered&#xD;
      to be excellent, 6-10 points to be good, 11-15 points to be bad, and 16-20 points to be too&#xD;
      bad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis of continuous variables between groups was compared using 2 samples&#xD;
      t-tests. The intra-group statistical analyses of continuous variables were compared by using&#xD;
      the paired t-test. The categorical nominal variables were analyzed by the chi-square test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test. All statistical tests were 2-tailed and the probability of p&lt;0.05 was&#xD;
      considered as statistically significant. All data were expressed as mean Â± standard&#xD;
      deviation.&#xD;
