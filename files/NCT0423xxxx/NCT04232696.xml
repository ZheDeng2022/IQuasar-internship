    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-center, single-arm, seamless phase-pivotal study conducted in participants&#xD;
      diagnosed with UUI who have failed or could not tolerate more conservative treatment. The&#xD;
      trial will be conducted in two phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of Phase I: To assess the utilization of the system during the Sacral Nerve&#xD;
      Stimulation (SNS) trial period and to help inform the length of hours of daily stimulation to&#xD;
      be used in Phase II of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of Phase II: To assess the safety and efficacy of the Neuspera SNS System at&#xD;
      6-months for the primary efficacy endpoint and at 12 months for secondary safety and efficacy&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neuspera's Implantable Sacral Nerve Stimulation (SNS) System is indicated to treat&#xD;
      participants with UUI who have failed or could not tolerate more conservative treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two phases: Phase I of the study will be conducted at up to 9&#xD;
      clinical study sites in the US and Europe. Phase II of the study will be conducted in up to&#xD;
      25 clinical sites in the US and Europe, inclusive of the Phase I centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, multi-center, single-arm, seamless phase-pivotal study. Objective of Phase I: To&#xD;
      assess the utilization of the system during the Sacral Nerve Stimulation (SNS) trial period&#xD;
      and to help inform the length of hours of daily stimulation to be used in Phase II of the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of Phase II: To assess the safety and efficacy of the Neuspera SNS System at&#xD;
      6-months for the primary efficacy endpoint and at 12 months for secondary safety and efficacy&#xD;
      endpoints. All participants will receive the same length of device stimulation as determined&#xD;
      in Phase I testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I will enroll up to 55 participants. Phase II will enroll up to 255 participants.&#xD;
