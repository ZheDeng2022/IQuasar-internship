  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well infigratinib works in treating solid tumors that have&#xD;
      spread to other places in the body (advanced or metastatic) in patients with FGFR gene&#xD;
      mutations such as FGFR1-3 gene fusions or other FGFR genetic alterations. Mutations are any&#xD;
      changes in the genetic material (DNA) of a cell. FGFR proteins are involved in cell division,&#xD;
      cell maturation, formation of new blood vessels, wound healing, and bone growth, development,&#xD;
      and maintenance. FGFR mutations can cause the FGFR protein to become over-active in diseases&#xD;
      such as cancer. Infigratinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking FGFR proteins in&#xD;
      these tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of single agent infigratinib in patients with advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors of any histologic classification with FGFR1-3 gene&#xD;
      fusions/translocations or other FGFR genetic alterations (with and without prior therapy with&#xD;
      different FGFR inhibitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To understand response rate and potential for infigratinib to benefit patients who have&#xD;
      FGFR alterations including point mutations, insertions/deletions and amplifications in&#xD;
      different solid tumor types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To further evaluate the efficacy of single agent infigratinib. II. To characterize the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of single agent infigratinib. II. To evaluate benefit of infigratinib&#xD;
      in patients who have received one prior FGFR inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To detect biomarkers of resistance to infigratinib treatment through tumor sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To develop a circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) or liquid biopsy assay&#xD;
      optimized for monitoring response to infigratinib and detecting emerging resistance mutations&#xD;
      to infigratinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive infigratinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who complete study treatment for any reason other than disease progression are&#xD;
      followed for 30 days, every 8 weeks until disease progression, and then every 4 months for 1&#xD;
      year. All other patients are followed for 30 days, and then every 4 months for 1 year.&#xD;
