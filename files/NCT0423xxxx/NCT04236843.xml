  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two hundrad patients are randomized to either 90 g transplant, 90 g transplant twice with&#xD;
      1week interval into the distal small intestine via working channel of a gastroscope, or to 90&#xD;
      g transplant into the coecum of the colon via working channel of a colonoscope. The patients&#xD;
      shall complete 5 questionnaires measuring symptoms, fatigue and quality of life and collect a&#xD;
      feces sample at 0, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. Dysbiosis and fecal bacterial are&#xD;
      determined by using 16S rRNA gene.&#xD;

      Patients Two hundrad patients who fulfil Rome IV criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)&#xD;
      shall be included in the study. All the IBS subtypes shall be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor Investigators are going to use the same super-donor they used in their previous&#xD;
      randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The donor is athletic Caucasian man aging&#xD;
      36 years. He is non-smoker and is completely healthy without any medication and with a BMI of&#xD;
      23.5. He is not relative to any of the patients in the trial. He was borne by vaginal&#xD;
      delivery and breastfeed. He was treated 3 times with antibiotics during his life. He trains 5&#xD;
      times weekly an hour each time. He took regularly dietary supplements rich in proteins,&#xD;
      vitamins, fibres and minerals that made his diet richer than average in these substances. He&#xD;
      was screened according to the guidelines for donors for FMT. Before he was accepted as a&#xD;
      donor the microbiota was analysed in a faecal sample using GA-map Dysbiosis test. The&#xD;
      analysis revealed a dysbiosis index (DI)= 1, indicating normobiosysis. In addition, he had&#xD;
      excess of bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes. His faeces shall be tested every third moth&#xD;
      during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are randomized to either 90 g transplant, 90 g transplant twice with 1week&#xD;
      interval into the distal small intestine, or to 90 g transplant into the coecum of the colon.&#xD;
      The patients shall complete 5 5 questionnaires and deliver fecal samples at the baseline, 2&#xD;
      weeks, 1 month and 3 month after FMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faeces collection, preparation and administration Faeces from both the donor and patients&#xD;
      shall be collected and stored at - 80•. Frozen faeces shall be thawed and each 30 g is&#xD;
      dissolved in 30 mL of 0.9% sterile saline. The dissolved stool administrated to the patients,&#xD;
      after overnight fast, through working channel of gastroduodeno-scope in pars descendent&#xD;
      duodenum distal to the papilla of Vater or to the coecum through working channel of a&#xD;
      colonoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. IBS symptom severity Scale (IBS-SSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Birmingham Symptom scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. IBS-quality of life (IBSQo) Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Short form of Nepean Dyspepsia Index (SF-NDI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiome analysis Gut microbiota analysis is performed using the Genetic analysis-mapTM&#xD;
      Dysbiosis test (Genetic Analysis AS, Oslo, Norway) by algorithmically assessing faecal&#xD;
      bacterial abundance and profile (dysbiosis index, DI), and potential deviation in the&#xD;
      microbiome from normobiosis. GA-map test is based on faecal homogenization, mechanical&#xD;
      bacterial cell disruption and automated total bacterial genomic DNA extraction using magnetic&#xD;
      beads. DI is based on 54 DNA probes targeting more than 300 bacterial strains based on their&#xD;
      16S rRNA sequence in seven variable regions (V3-V9). Twenty-six bacteria probes are species&#xD;
      specific, 19 detect bacteria on genus level, and 9 probes detect bacteria at higher taxonomic&#xD;
      levels. Probe labelling is by single nucleotide extension and hybridization to complementary&#xD;
      probes coupled to magnetic beads, and signal detection by using BioCode 1000A 128-Plex&#xD;
      Analyser (Applied BioCode, Santa Fe Springs, CA, USA). A DI above 2 shows a microbiota&#xD;
      profile that differs from that of the normobiotic reference collection (DI 1-2:&#xD;
      non-dysbiosis, DI: moderate, DI 4-5: severe dysbiosis).&#xD;
