      This is a single arm, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation, phase I study to determine&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of CNCT19 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse&#xD;
      Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The study will have the following sequential phases: Screening,&#xD;
      Pre-Treatment (Cell Product Preparation &amp; Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy), Treatment and&#xD;
      Follow-up, and Survival Follow-up. The total duration of the study is 2 years from CNCT19&#xD;
