  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      major CHD (Congenital Heart Disease) screening by POX (pulse oximetry) in sea-level areas is&#xD;
      not fit for low, medium and high altitude areas, but the normal range of pulse oximetry at&#xD;
      different altitude areas has not been studied before, so the current screening technology can&#xD;
      only be used in sea-level areas, but not for newborns in low, medium and high altitude areas.&#xD;
      We need to carry out a research to clarify the range of POX and make sure the threshold of&#xD;
      POX in major CHD screening in different altitude areas of China.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, the application of POX (pulse oximetry) in screening major CHD (congenital heart&#xD;
      disease ) has been legislated in the United States. In China, the two indicators of POX plus&#xD;
      auscultation of heart murmur for screening major CHD have also been promoted as national&#xD;
      standards. There are differences in the POX range of newborns at different altitude areas, so&#xD;
      the threshold of POX screening based on sea-level areas is not applicable to low, medium and&#xD;
      high altitude areas. While the normal range of POX at different altitude areas has not been&#xD;
      studied in detail, so the current screening strategy can only be used in sea-level areas, but&#xD;
      not benefit newborns in low, medium and high altitude areas. In order to apply major CHD&#xD;
      screening strategy better to cover the newborns all over the country, we need to clarify the&#xD;
      range of POX at different altitude areas of China and make sure the threshold of POX in major&#xD;
      CHD screening. We plan to carry out a multicenter study on the normal POX value range of&#xD;
      healthy and asymptomatic term newborns 6-72 hours after delivery in medical centers with&#xD;
      altitude of 500-1000; 1000-2000; 2000-3000; 3000-4000 and above 4000 meters. And compare the&#xD;
      POX value at different altitude areas with that of newborns delivered in the maternity&#xD;
      hospitals at sea level. And measure the POX value of newborns with major CHD in the same way.&#xD;
      POX screening thresholds will be obtained at different altitude areas. We will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that POX of healthy newborns at different altitude areas is lower than that of&#xD;
      healthy newborns at sea level, and POX threshold of major CHD screening is lower than that of&#xD;
      sea level.&#xD;
