      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are numerous causes of facial palsy (FP), though hemifacial weakness is often generally&#xD;
      termed Bell's palsy, named after the Scottish neurologist Charles Bell, who described sudden&#xD;
      onset unilateral facial paralysis in 1821.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virally triggered, acute FP, to which the term Bell's palsy (BP) refers, is one of the most&#xD;
      common, and fortunately the most likely condition to result in eventual return to premorbid&#xD;
      status; 70% to 90% of patients recover spontaneously. Other causes of FP routinely result in&#xD;
      poorer recovery, and the clinician must discern among these to formulate a treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In facial palsy, paralysis of muscles on the affected side of the face results in loss of&#xD;
      forehead creases, loss of the nasolabial fold, lagophthalmos, brow droop, and drooping of the&#xD;
      corner of the mouth. In contrast, muscles on the unaffected side of the face no longer have&#xD;
      opposing forces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This may cause difficulty in articulation, eating, drinking, and is often cosmetically&#xD;
      unacceptable to patients because of asymmetry, especially when speaking, smiling, and&#xD;
      laughing. There are significant psychological effects as patients lack the confidence to&#xD;
      carry out many daily activities in public, such as appearing in photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although management is difficult, there are a range of reanimation options available. These&#xD;
      include nerve grafts, muscle transfers, myofunctional approaches, and microsurgical patches&#xD;
      usually for the more severe facial palsies (House-Brackmann grades 4 to 6). However, despite&#xD;
      these procedures, facial symmetry may not improve.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Refractory Facial Palsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facial paralysis is a rare disorder, but it has significant effects on an individual, both&#xD;
      physical and emotional. While most patients fully recover from acute facial paralysis, a&#xD;
      small population is left with chronic lingering symptoms. Refractory patients are those who&#xD;
      had the maximum benefit of a performed procedure and need some fine touches and also those&#xD;
      who did not recover well of the initial condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the Work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is aimed to evaluate the outcome of ancillary procedures in refractory cases of&#xD;
      facial palsy and to introduce both simple and sophisticated techniques to those patients&#xD;
      presented to the investigator's department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with refractory Facial Palsy who did not respond well to other concerned&#xD;
      interferences and those who presented the maximum benefit possible of a performed procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients &amp; Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted on 20 patients attendance outpatient clinic of plastic surgery&#xD;
      department - Assiut University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients could be divided into three groups according to the anatomical site of&#xD;
      interferences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Upper third interferences&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Mid third interferences&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: Lower third interferences Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Botulinum toxin A (BTXA) has been used since the 1970s to treat a variety of conditions&#xD;
           resulting in abnormal muscle contraction or spasm. It works by preventing the release of&#xD;
           acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction thereby inhibiting muscle contraction.2&#xD;
           Its benefits in synkinesis in facial palsy (aberrant neural regeneration of the&#xD;
           paralysed muscles) are well recognized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BTXA was injected into the contralateral lower facial muscles complex to weaken the unopposed&#xD;
      normal muscles to improve symmetry, both active and passive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Gold/Platinum weight implants Implantable devices have been used to restore dynamic lid&#xD;
      closure in cases of severe, symptomatic lagophthalmos. These procedures are best for patients&#xD;
      with poor Bell phenomenon and decreased corneal sensation. Gold or platinum weights, a&#xD;
      weight-adjustable magnet, or palpebral springs can be inserted into the eyelids. Pretarsal&#xD;
      gold-weight implantation is most commonly performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implants are inert and composed of 99.99% pure gold or platinum. Sizes range from 0.6-1.8&#xD;
      g. The weight allows the upper eyelid to close with gravity when the levator palpebrae are&#xD;
      relaxed. Therefore, patients must sleep with their head slightly elevated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implants are easily removed if nerve function returns. Complications include migration of&#xD;
      the implant, inflammation, allergic reaction, and extrusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Tarsorrhaphy Tarsorrhaphy decreases horizontal lid opening by fusing the eyelid margins&#xD;
      together, increasing support of the precorneal lack of tears and improving coverage of the&#xD;
      eye during sleep. The procedure can be done in the office and is particularly suitable for&#xD;
      patients who are unable or unwilling to undergo other surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tarsorrhaphy can be performed laterally, centrally, or medially. The lateral procedure is the&#xD;
      most common; however, it can restrict the monocular temporal visual field.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brow lifting Brow ptosis is repaired with a direct brow lift. Care should be taken in&#xD;
           the presence of corneal decompensation because lifting the brow can cause worsening of&#xD;
           lagophthalmos, especially if lid closure is poor. A gold-weight implant can be placed or&#xD;
           lower-lid resuspension can be performed simultaneously to prevent this complication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suspension suture Static facial suspension procedures stabilise the muscles of mid-face&#xD;
           paralysis and provide facial symmetry, a better aesthetic appearance, improved chewing&#xD;
           and speech production in patients with facial paralysis. The new generation of&#xD;
           Silhouette wires for tissue suspension is a significant improvement with respect to gold&#xD;
           threads or Russian threads. They provide a new method of anchoring since they are made&#xD;
           of polypropylene with absorbable cones of polylactic acid and glycolic acid. This suture&#xD;
           allows tissue growth in and around the cones and therefore a strangerhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They were approved by the FDA in November 2006 and by the EEC in March 2007. They have been&#xD;
      used in over 6,000 mid-face facial aesthetic surgery interventions in the U.S. and Europe and&#xD;
      have recently begun to be used to treat facial paralysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fat injection Fat transfer to the face uses the patient's own adipose tissue (collected&#xD;
           with a minor liposuction procedure from the belly or back), which gives volume and shape&#xD;
           to the affected parts of the face, as well as impart glow and sheen to the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lateral Canthoplasty:&#xD;
&#xD;
      canthoplasty may be considered as one of the most valuable oculoplastic surgical procedures&#xD;
      to correct lid abnormalities. The indications include ectropion, entropion, lateral canthal&#xD;
      dystopia, horizontal lid laxity, lid margin eversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Subjective:- 3 Plastic surgeon will be commenting on the pre and post photography regarding&#xD;
      to normal side .&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Objective:- measurement between normal and effected side of the position eye brow ,Palpebral&#xD;
      fissure, and angle of the mouth&#xD;
