      Men age ≥ 18 years with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic PSqCC stage 4 (i.e. T4 or&#xD;
      N3 or M1) that are presenting with radiologic progression of disease (PD) following or not&#xD;
      standard treatment with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the ICF and confirmed eligibility, patients will receive INCMGA00012 500 mg by&#xD;
      intravenous infusion on Day1 of each cycle, once every four weeks for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or&#xD;
      discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients discontinuing the study treatment period will enter a post-treatment follow-up&#xD;
      period during which survival and new anti-cancer therapy information will be collected every&#xD;
      3 months (± 14 days) from the last dose of investigational product until the end of study&#xD;
      (EoS).&#xD;
