  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 Diabetes is characterized by an absolute lack of insulin caused by autoimmune ß-cell&#xD;
      destruction. Looking for different therapeutic approaches, beyond the administration of&#xD;
      Insulin SGLT-Inhibitors (SGLT=sodium-glucose cotransporter) like Dapagliflozin look like a&#xD;
      promising option to avoid hyperglycaemic excursions which are a reason for glycaemic&#xD;
      variability by renal excretion of excessive glucose without administration of extra insulin.&#xD;
      But also euglycemic DKA has been reported during SGLT2 add-on therapy to insulin in T1D and&#xD;
      mechanistic studies have been called for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of Dapagliflozin-induced hyperglucagonemia and stress/infection precipitating&#xD;
      euglycemic DKA in this situation is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the purpose of this pilot study is to collect clinical data on the development of DKA&#xD;
      after insulin-withdrawal with Dapagliflozin compared to placebo and the added effect of a&#xD;
      single dose of 4mg/kg i.v. ACTH as mediator of stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective is to investigate the time to DKA (defined as Bicarbonate &lt;19 mmol/l)&#xD;
      after insulin withdrawal during treatment with a stable 5 day single daily dose of 10mg&#xD;
      Dapagliflozin in patients with type 1 Diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition it should be evaluate the additional effect of stress, modelled by a single&#xD;
      injection of ACTH on DKA development during Dapagliflozin Treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also want to know if Dapagliflozin influences glucagon levels during insulin withdrawal&#xD;
      and how this is associated with the time course of DKA development.&#xD;

      The purpose of the Dapastress trial is, to evaluate if some metabolic parameters can be&#xD;
      identified as an early marker or contributor in development of ketonic metabolic imbalance.&#xD;
      As the hormonal &quot;background&quot; is completely different in pubertal adolescents compared to&#xD;
      adults (especially contra-insulin hormones as growth hormone, glucagon).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 20 subjects 18-45 years will be screened in order to randomize 16 patients,&#xD;
      where stress and Dapagliflozin (or corresponding placebo) will be administered independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of 14 visits: a screening visit (Visit 1), 4 overnight visits&#xD;
      complexes (Visit 2 to Visit 13), including phone visits and a follow-up visit (Visit 14).&#xD;
      Furthermore, an information visit will take place prior to the screening visit in order to&#xD;
      obtain patient's informed consent. Screening will take place 2-21 days prior to Visit 2. The&#xD;
      follow-up visit will take place 5-21 days after the end of Visit 13. The overnight visits&#xD;
      will be separated by a wash-out period (5-30 days between the end of each visit complex and&#xD;
      start of next complex) during which the subjects will resume their normal insulin treatment.&#xD;
      Each phone visit will take place 3-5 days after the end of overnight Visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned total duration of the trial is 58-100 days per subject (rescheduled visits&#xD;
      excluded). Each subject will be randomised to a unique treatment sequence (1:1:1:1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seq 1: A D B C Seq 2: B A C D Seq 3: C B D A Seq 4: D C A B (e.g. A Dapa-Stress, B&#xD;
      Dapa-Placebo Stress , C Placebo- Stress, D Placebo-Placebo Stress)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization patients will receive Dapagliflozin/placebo for 5 single daily Dosis.&#xD;
      During the overnight visits the metabolic control will be achieved by a variable i.v.&#xD;
      Infusion of human Insulin by an Infusion pump. The procedure will be used in order to aim and&#xD;
      maintain blood glucose levels between 70 and 180 mg/dl. The fluid Infusion and Insulin dosing&#xD;
      scheme will depend on Body weight and blood glucose levels. At approximately 03:00 hours in&#xD;
      the morning the blood glucose should be within target range. Then insulin infusion will be&#xD;
      suspended. In the morning the last dose of actual study medication (Dapagliflozin/ Placebo)&#xD;
      and the single dose of stress (ACTH or placebo) will be administered. During now started&#xD;
      stress phase blood samples for determination of metabolic Panels,blood gas analysis, Glucose&#xD;
      and ketone will be taken hourly and vital signs tested. 12 hours after administration of&#xD;
      stress (ACTH or placebo) the patients will resume their CSII and will be discharged when&#xD;
      being well on investigator's judgement.&#xD;
