  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During exercise in conditions of low oxygen (termed hypoxia), such as mountaineering at high&#xD;
      altitudes, the lung blood vessels constrict in an attempt to protect the body from the&#xD;
      negative effects of hypoxia. It appears that this blood vessel constriction may limit the&#xD;
      heart to pump blood during heavy exercise, leading to reductions in exercise performance.&#xD;
      Inhaled nitric oxide is a drug that is known to relax the lung blood vessels. Inhaled nitric&#xD;
      oxide has been used to relax lung blood vessels and improve exercise capacity in patients&#xD;
      with chronic disease. It is unknown if similar improvements would be observed during exercise&#xD;
      in healthy individuals when exposed to low levels of oxygen. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if inhaled nitric oxide can relax the lung blood vessels and improve the heart's&#xD;
      pumping ability during exercise in low oxygen conditions. Further, the investigators will&#xD;
      determine if these improvements in lung blood vessel and heart function increase exercise&#xD;
      performance. Participants will complete 6 sessions over a three week period where they will&#xD;
      perform exercise challenges while breathing low levels of oxygen with and without inhaled&#xD;
      nitric oxide. The low oxygen conditions will be comparable to being at an altitude of&#xD;
      14,000-17,000 feet. 17,000 feet would be equivalent to standing on the summit of King Peak in&#xD;
      the Yukon (the 4th tallest mountain in Canada).&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      During exercise in hypoxic conditions, maximal exercise capacity, as determined by maximal&#xD;
      oxygen uptake (V̇O2max), is reduced progressively as inspired oxygen tension falls. It is&#xD;
      generally assumed that this reduction in V̇O2max results entirely from a reduction in&#xD;
      arterial oxygen content. However, previous work in severe cases of hypoxia have demonstrated&#xD;
      a larger than expected reduction in V̇O2max. Further, the hypoxia-induced impairment in&#xD;
      V̇O2max could not be explained entirely by the reduced inspired O2 tension and suggest that&#xD;
      other mechanisms contribute to the drop in V̇O2max. Previous research showed that impaired&#xD;
      pulmonary gas-exchange and reduced peak cardiac output, in addition to the reduced arterial&#xD;
      oxygen content, were key contributors to the impaired V̇O2max in severe hypoxia (10.5%&#xD;
      inspired oxygen). The reason for the gas-exchange impairment and reduced cardiac output is&#xD;
      currently unclear, however, it has been hypothesized that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction&#xD;
      (HPV) may increase pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure during very&#xD;
      heavy exercise. HPV-mediated increases in pulmonary vascular resistance would increase right&#xD;
      heart work and potentially impair the pumping capacity of the heart, leading to a reduction&#xD;
      in stroke volume and, ultimately, cardiac output. HPV has been detected, even in mild hypoxia&#xD;
      (15-18% inspired oxygen), in healthy humans. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a selective&#xD;
      pulmonary vasodilator and has been shown to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance during&#xD;
      exercise in patients with pulmonary vascular dysfunction (i.e. chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease). Further, iNO has been shown to release HPV in healthy individuals. If iNO can&#xD;
      prevent HPV, this would mitigate the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance in moderate&#xD;
      (~13.6% inspired oxygen) and more severe (~12.1% inspired oxygen) hypoxia and improve V̇O2max&#xD;
      during hypoxic exercise. Therefore, we hypothesize that the iNO will improve V̇O2max during&#xD;
      exercise in moderate and severe hypoxia, secondary to reduced pulmonary artery systolic&#xD;
      pressure leading to increased stroke volume and peak cardiac output. Further, larger&#xD;
      improvements in V̇O2max, with iNO, will be observed in severe hypoxia conditions, when&#xD;
      compared to the iNO-mediated change in V̇O2max in moderate hypoxia. This would provide&#xD;
      conclusive evidence that the pulmonary vasculature is a key contributor to reduced V̇O2max in&#xD;
      both moderate and severe hypoxic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To examine the effect of iNO on maximal oxygen consumption (V̇O2max) during exercise&#xD;
      in hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Inhaled NO will improve V̇O2max during hypoxic exercise, secondary to increased&#xD;
      stroke volume and peak cardiac output. A larger improvement in V̇O2max, with iNO, will be&#xD;
      observed in more severe hypoxia conditions, when compared to the iNO-mediated change in&#xD;
      V̇O2max in moderate hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized double-blind cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol: Six sessions will be completed over a 3-week period in the following order:&#xD;
      Day 1) Participant enrollment, medical history, standard pulmonary function (PFT) and&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) breathing normoxia (21% inspired oxygen). Days 2-5)&#xD;
      Randomly-ordered experimental CPETs while either breathing A) moderate hypoxia (13.6%&#xD;
      inspired oxygen), B) severe hypoxia (12.1% inspired oxygen), C) moderate hypoxia with 40 ppm&#xD;
      iNO, and D) severe hypoxia with 40 ppm iNO. Day 6) Resting and exercise trials while&#xD;
      breathing, normoxia, moderate and severe hypoxia, and moderate and severe hypoxia with iNO,&#xD;
      with ultrasonography Doppler measurements to determine pulmonary arterial systolic pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypoxia conditions will be comparable to being at an altitude of 14,000-17,000 feet.&#xD;
      17,000 feet would be equivalent to standing on the summit of King Peak in the Yukon (the 4th&#xD;
      tallest mountain in Canada).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, participants will complete the informed consent procedure, fill out a medical&#xD;
      history questionnaire and be screened for exercise using a physical activity readiness&#xD;
      questionnaire. They will undergo lung function and cardiopulmonary exercise testing on the&#xD;
      same day. The participants will be spending approximately three hours in the laboratory on&#xD;
      this testing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5 the participants will breathe A) moderate hypoxia (13.6% inspired&#xD;
      oxygen), B) severe hypoxia (12.1% inspired oxygen), C) moderate hypoxia with 40 ppm iNO, and&#xD;
      D) severe hypoxia with 40 ppm iNO and have their blood flow/cardiac output and expired gas&#xD;
      evaluated, and time to exhaustion determined in a standard cardiopulmonary exercise test.&#xD;
      Prior to day two, the order of conditions will be block randomized to ensure both CPETs from&#xD;
      one oxygen concentration (either 12.1 or 13.6 %) is completed before the second oxygen&#xD;
      concentration condition is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 2, the participant will lie supine and be rested for 5 minutes. Their resting blood&#xD;
      pressure will be determined using manual auscultation. Resting cardiac output will be&#xD;
      evaluated using noninvasive impedance cardiography and oxygen saturation estimated with pulse&#xD;
      oximetry. Ventilation will be measured from expired gas analysis. Following these&#xD;
      measurements, the subject will begin to breathe one of the four experimental conditions (see&#xD;
      above). Following a 5 minute wash-in period, ventilation, cardiac output and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation recordings will be repeated. Participants will then perform a standard&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test while continuing to breathe the normoxic air. The participants&#xD;
      will be spending approximately three hours in the laboratory on this testing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 3, 4 &amp; 5 will be identical to day 2 except, participants will breathe the other&#xD;
      experimental conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 6 the subject will lie supine and be rested for 5 minutes to obtain supine baseline&#xD;
      measurements. Following, participants will sit upright and baseline measurements will be&#xD;
      recorded. Their resting systemic blood pressure will be determined using manual auscultation&#xD;
      and pulmonary arterial systolic arterial pressure will be determine by cardiac ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging. Resting cardiac output will be evaluated using noninvasive impedance cardiography.&#xD;
      The resting measurements will be completed while breathing while breathing, normoxia,&#xD;
      moderate and severe hypoxia, and moderate and severe hypoxia with iNO (order randomized).&#xD;
      Participants will then completed short bouts of light exercise at a fixed intensity and all&#xD;
      measurements will be repeated while breathing normoxia, moderate and severe hypoxia, and&#xD;
      moderate and severe hypoxia with iNO (order randomized). The research participants will&#xD;
      exercise at a light intensity for a total of ~25 minutes (5 minutes per conditions). For both&#xD;
      the resting and exercise measurements, a 10-minute washout time will be given when switching&#xD;
      between conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration: Each visit will take approximately 3 hours. The total time duration for&#xD;
      each participant will be approximately 18 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled Nitric Oxide Intervention: Inhaled NO is a selective pulmonary vasodilator and has&#xD;
      been shown to improve blood flow to well-ventilated lung areas (i.e. improve&#xD;
      ventilation-perfusion matching) in conditions with elevated vascular tone. Inhaled NO has&#xD;
      been previously shown to lower pulmonary artery pressure during exercise in lung disease&#xD;
      patients, while not affecting systemic blood pressure. It is important to note that a&#xD;
      selective pulmonary vasodilator will be used instead of an intravenously infused vasodilator&#xD;
      (e.g. prostacyclin) to avoid systemic vasodilation, severe arterial hypotension and syncope&#xD;
      19-20. Consistent with previous work, a standard 40 ppm dose of inhaled NO will be&#xD;
      administered using a non-rebreathing circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and Interpretation A 1-way repeated measures ANOVA will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate the changes in V̇O2max with 1) moderate and severe hypoxia and, 2) moderate and&#xD;
      severe hypoxia with iNO during exercise, when compared to placebo (normoxic condition).&#xD;
      Should a main effect be found, a Tukey post-hoc t-test with be completed to locate the&#xD;
      differences. Should iNO improve V̇O2max, then this would suggest that a hypoxic-mediated&#xD;
      increase in pulmonary vascular resistance is a key contributor to impaired cardiac output&#xD;
      during moderate and severe hypoxic exercise.&#xD;
