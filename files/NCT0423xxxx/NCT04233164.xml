      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune system is the body s defense against bacteria and other harmful invaders. In&#xD;
      people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the immune system becomes overactive and&#xD;
      attacks healthy cells by mistake. Many people use glucocorticoids (GCs) to treat their SLE.&#xD;
      GCs can calm down an overactive immune system by changing how the body reads genes. But GCs&#xD;
      have side effects that can increase over time. Researchers want to learn more about how GCs&#xD;
      work. This may help to develop new and better drugs for treating SLE without the side effects&#xD;
      GCs have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand how GCs affect the immune system in people with SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 18-80 with SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical exam. They will have a health and medical&#xD;
      history. They will have blood and urine tests. They will have an electrocardiogram to measure&#xD;
      heart activity. For this, sticky pads are put on their chest, arms, and legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a methylprednisolone infusion for about 30 minutes. It will be given&#xD;
      through a needle in a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected immediately before, 2 hours after, and 4 hours after the start of the&#xD;
      infusion. Blood pressure and heart activity will be monitored. Participants will repeat some&#xD;
      of the screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted twice in the week after the infusion visit. They will discuss&#xD;
      any health problems they are having.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune syndrome that causes pervasive&#xD;
      immune dysregulation in all cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. Most patients&#xD;
      with SLE require glucocorticoid treatment at some point of the disease course, but the&#xD;
      specific effects of glucocorticoids that lead to therapeutic benefit in this condition are&#xD;
      not well understood. In addition, the glucocorticoid dosing regimens that are administered to&#xD;
      patients with SLE in clinical practice are arbitrary and not based on detailed knowledge of&#xD;
      the effects of glucocorticoids at different doses on cells of the immune system. This study&#xD;
      aims to improve our understanding of the effects of glucocorticoids on the immune system of&#xD;
      patients with SLE, and to test for possible differences in these effects at a range of&#xD;
      clinically relevant doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A consistent outcome of glucocorticoid exposure is a significant reprogramming of a cell s&#xD;
      transcriptional state. The exact changes, however, vary substantially across cell types.&#xD;
      Studies of specific cell populations, therefore, are necessary to gain a realistic view of&#xD;
      the transcriptional effects of glucocorticoids. Given that cell composition and molecular&#xD;
      behavior are known to differ among pathological states, the study of patients with SLE is&#xD;
      necessary to identify the effects of glucocorticoids that are most likely to be responsible&#xD;
      for their clinically beneficial effects in this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants with SLE, ages 18-80 years, will be randomized to receive a&#xD;
      single intravenous infusion of 1 of 2 doses of the glucocorticoid methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg&#xD;
      or 250 mg). Blood will be collected at baseline (within 45 days before infusion), immediately&#xD;
      before the infusion, and again at 2 and 4 hours after the start of the infusion. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be processed for isolation of hematopoietic cell subsets, including neutrophils,&#xD;
      B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, and plasmacytoid&#xD;
      dendritic cells. Laboratory studies will be performed on the purified cells, with the goal of&#xD;
      understanding the human response to glucocorticoids in vivo at the level of RNA (eg, RNA&#xD;
      sequencing [RNA-seq], small-RNA-seq, real-time polymerase chain reaction), DNA (eg, chromatin&#xD;
      immunoprecipitation sequencing, methylation analysis, DNA sequencing, genotyping), and&#xD;
      protein (eg, flow cytometry, mass spectrometry). At each time point, serum methylprednisolone&#xD;
      levels will be measured and flow cytometry for standard cell-lineage markers will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
