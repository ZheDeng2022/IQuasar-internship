  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The highest incidence of tuberculosis disease (TB) in the world is in India, accounting for&#xD;
      27% of all new cases globally, with approximately 86,000 among persons with HIV (PWH).&#xD;
      Unhealthy alcohol use can worsen the health of people who have Tuberculosis (TB) and people&#xD;
      who have both TB and HIV. Behavioral interventions that 1) target alcohol use and 2) are&#xD;
      integrated into TB and TB/HIV care may lead to better outcomes. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      test if a behavioral alcohol reduction intervention integrated into TB treatment can reduce&#xD;
      alcohol use and improve TB and HIV health outcomes among people with unhealthy alcohol use.&#xD;
      The aims of the HATHI study are: Aim 1: To test if a 4 session behavioral alcohol reduction&#xD;
      intervention, called CAP (Counseling on Alcohol Problems), integrated into TB and TB/HIV Care&#xD;
      can decrease unhealthy alcohol use among persons with TB and TB and HIV. Aim 2: To test if&#xD;
      the CAP intervention, integrated into TB and TB/HIV care can improve TB and HIV clinical&#xD;
      outcomes; Aim 3: To evaluate barriers and facilitators to integrating CAP into TB and TB/HIV&#xD;
      care, and to determine the incremental costs of delivering CAP in TB and HIV clinical&#xD;
      settings. Investigators hypothesize that CAP intervention will reduce alcohol use among&#xD;
      persons with TB and TB with HIV, and that it delivery in the TB and TB/HIV setting will be&#xD;
      acceptable to patient and providers and feasible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2017, over 10 million people worldwide developed tuberculosis disease (TB), with 9% of&#xD;
      cases among people with HIV (PWH). In that same year, there were 1.6 million deaths from TB,&#xD;
      with 300,000 among PWH. The highest incidence of TB is in India, accounting for 27% of all&#xD;
      new cases globally, with approximately 86,000 among PWH. Unhealthy alcohol use triples the&#xD;
      risk of TB in the general population, increasing susceptibility to primary infection and&#xD;
      reactivation. Among PWH, unhealthy alcohol use is associated with decreased use of and&#xD;
      adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), lower viral suppression and increased mortality.&#xD;
      Treatment for TB presents a unique opportunity to address unhealthy alcohol use among people&#xD;
      with TB and HIV/TB given the frequent contact participants have with healthcare providers and&#xD;
      the deleterious effects of unhealthy use on both HIV and TB clinical outcomes. Although&#xD;
      combined cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational enhancement therapy (MET) can be&#xD;
      effective in reducing alcohol use, access to and implementation of such interventions is&#xD;
      limited in high-need, under-resourced low and middle income (LMIC) settings. Even in settings&#xD;
      where formal treatment is available, alcohol-related stigma and cost of treatment may prevent&#xD;
      individuals from seeking care. Integrating treatment for unhealthy alcohol use into TB and&#xD;
      HIV/TB care may overcome barriers to alcohol treatment for such individuals at risk for poor&#xD;
      health outcomes. HATHI (Hybrid trial for Alcohol reduction among people with TB and HIV/TB in&#xD;
      India), is a 2-arm hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) examining the effectiveness of a four-session combined CBT/MET alcohol reduction&#xD;
      intervention (CAP-Counseling on Alcohol Problems), followed by three intervention boosters,&#xD;
      integrated into TB and HIV/TB care, compared with usual care (provider advice, referral to&#xD;
      treatment as needed). There will be 3 phases. In Phase 1) investigators will tailor the&#xD;
      intervention tailoring based on results from a) focus groups (FG) with patients with HIV/TB,&#xD;
      medical and clinical staff, and the intervention counselors (IC) and b) individual&#xD;
      intervention testing with a subgroup of HIV/TB patients. In Phase 2) investigators will&#xD;
      conduct an RCT in which participants will be randomized to CAP intervention or to usual care.&#xD;
      Investigators will stratify by HIV status to ensure balance of HIV between the groups.&#xD;
      Effectiveness outcomes measured at 3, 6 and 12 months will include 1) self-reported alcohol&#xD;
      use (primary) and phosphatidyl ethanol (PEth), an alcohol biomarker (secondary), and 2) TB&#xD;
      and HIV clinical outcomes. In Phase 3, evaluating trial participants, counselors, clinical&#xD;
      and organizational staff, investigators will use the RE-AIM implementation framework using&#xD;
      mixed methods to assess barriers and facilitators to alcohol treatment integration in TB and&#xD;
      HIV/TB clinical settings and to assess the incremental costs of this intervention strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: All phases of the study will take place at two sites in India: the Byramjee&#xD;
      Jeejeebhoy Government Medical College (BJGMC) and Dr. DY Patil Medical College, Pune (DYPMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives/Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), to examine the effectiveness of CBT/MET&#xD;
      integrated into TB and HIV/TB care compared to usual care on alcohol reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: In a RCT, to examine the effectiveness of CBT/MET integrated into TB and HIV/TB care&#xD;
      compared to usual care on TB and HIV treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Guided by the RE-AIM implementation framework, and using mixed methods, to 3a)&#xD;
      evaluate patient, provider and organizational barriers and facilitators to integrated alcohol&#xD;
      treatment in TB and HIV/TB settings, and 3b) measure incremental costs from health system and&#xD;
      societal perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to RCT implementation investigators will tailor CAP and make final modifications to the&#xD;
      CAP manual. CAP will be enhanced with content specific to Pune such as local alcohol&#xD;
      containing beverages and local or state drinking norms and alcohol impacts on TB and HIV&#xD;
      progression and clinical outcomes. Investigators will modify the manual and test in focus&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2-Clinical Trial. This phase involves collection of routinely used research assessments&#xD;
      for individuals with TB and HIV/TB at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months and the launch of the&#xD;
      RCT. The study will include adults individuals with newly diagnosed TB, unhealthy alcohol&#xD;
      use, initiating TB medication treatment. Individuals will be recruited through both provider&#xD;
      and self-referral. Up to half of the sample will have both TB and HIV. Eligible individuals&#xD;
      will undergo baseline assessment which includes a medical history, clinical exam,&#xD;
      questionnaires, and a blood spot for the alcohol biomarker PEth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignments of Participants to the Study Intervention: Eligible participants will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio upon completion of the baseline evaluation. The study&#xD;
      biostatistician, independent of the trial will generate the randomization sequence in&#xD;
      permuted blocks and randomization will be stratified by the presence of HIV infection. A&#xD;
      sealed envelope with study assignment will be used to conceal the study group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: Individuals in the control arm will receive standard of care TB and HIV treatment&#xD;
      and usual care from participants' provider, which includes advice to reduce alcohol use and&#xD;
      referral to alcohol treatment services at participants' provider's discretion. Participants&#xD;
      will also receive a general guide on nutrition, diabetes, tobacco and alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: CAP is an up to 4-session manualized alcohol reduction treatment based on&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral and Motivational Enhancement Therapy. Each session lasts up to 45&#xD;
      minutes. The 4 CAP sessions will be delivered by a counselor during an 8 week period, closely&#xD;
      aligned to regular TB treatment follow up visits. After the 4 intervention sessions,&#xD;
      individuals will receive 3 scripted booster sessions, one month apart, corresponding to&#xD;
      participants' TB follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Data Ascertainment: Assessments will occur at baseline (prior to randomization), 3&#xD;
      months (end of 4 session intervention), 6, and 12 months post-baseline. Data collection will&#xD;
      include self-report questionnaires staff interviews, and biomarker and specimens and will&#xD;
      encompass demographics, a clinical assessment, measurement of alcohol use, its severity and&#xD;
      consequences; HIV measures including viral load, medication adherence and HIV retention in&#xD;
      care; TB measures, including TB clearance, TB treatment default, TB medication adherence and&#xD;
      TB retention in care. Other measures span mental health, tobacco and other substance use,&#xD;
      quality of life, diabetes mellitus, motivation to change and self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators' primary alcohol endpoint will occur at 6 months after baseline, with&#xD;
      investigators' secondary endpoint at 12 months. Sample size calculations are based on data&#xD;
      from behavioral alcohol reduction interventions in low and middle income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators' trial will enroll a total of 450 participants with TB or TB/HIV; The study&#xD;
      will be conducted at two sites and 2 counselors at each site will administer the&#xD;
      intervention. Power calculations assume a 10% loss to follow-up, and intra-class correlation&#xD;
      coefficient of 0.04 (based on CAP/PREMIUM RCT) to account for 2 counselors per site, 2&#xD;
      sites). Analyses will also account for variation by counselor and by site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: The Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM)&#xD;
      implementation framework will be used to collect quantitative and qualitative assessments&#xD;
      from 3 levels of stakeholders (Numbers approximate, pending thematic saturation).&#xD;
      Investigators will evaluate barriers and facilitators to intervention reach, effectiveness,&#xD;
      adoption, implementation and maintenance, focusing in implementation outcomes of feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity and sustainability. Investigators will also&#xD;
      calculate the incremental costs of the intervention.&#xD;
