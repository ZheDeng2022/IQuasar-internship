    <textblock>
      This trial studies activity of time (pharmacokinetics), subjective effects, and abuse&#xD;
      liability of nicotine salt-based vaping products with tobacco or e-liquids. This study aims&#xD;
      to determine and compare the levels of nicotine delivered to the bloodstream from nicotine&#xD;
      salt and free-base nicotine e-liquid solutions.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of nicotine salt (nicotine benzoate) and free-base nicotine in&#xD;
      different flavored e-liquid solutions on puffing behaviors and systemic exposure to nicotine&#xD;
      from electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Assessing short-term effects on nicotine cravings, withdrawal, and satisfaction from&#xD;
      single use of ENDS refilled with flavored nicotine salt or flavored free-base nicotine&#xD;
      solutions with two different flavors (tobacco or unflavored) in current daily ENDS users&#xD;
      following an overnight fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. Comparing users' perceptions and preferences towards inhaling vapors containing nicotine&#xD;
      salt (nicotine benzoate) or freebase nicotine with two different flavors (tobacco and&#xD;
      unflavored) versus their regular brand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. This project provides important information on whether the pharmacokinetics of nicotine&#xD;
      delivery differ between salt and free-base forms of e-liquid of equivalent nominal&#xD;
      concentration using the same device, and whether the previously observed effects of flavors&#xD;
      on subjective effects differ between salt and free-base forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine whether maximum concentration of nicotine in plasma (Cmax) or time to maximum&#xD;
      concentration (Tmax) differ between free-base and salt-based versions of the same liquid,&#xD;
      controlling for flavoring and nominal nicotine concentration [main effect of salt].&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine whether the effect of flavoring on subjective effects (e.g., harshness, liking)&#xD;
      differs between matched free-base and salt-based e-liquids [flavor X salt interaction].&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Examine effects of salt and flavoring on abuse liability using the Experimental Tobacco&#xD;
      Marketplace (ETM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 8-10 hours after nicotine abstinence, participants attend 4 vaping sessions over 2-2.5&#xD;
      hours, 5-7 days apart. During each session, participants take 20 puffs over 10 minutes (one&#xD;
      puff every 30 seconds) of vaporizer filled with freebased nicotine electronic (e)-liquid&#xD;
      solution of unflavored, free-based nicotine e-liquid solution of tobacco flavor, salt-based&#xD;
      nicotine e-liquid solution of unflavored, or salt-based nicotine e-liquid solution of tobacco&#xD;
      flavor assigned in a random order.&#xD;

    <description>Each outcome will be modeled as a function of base (free-base versus salt based), flavor (tobacco versus unflavored), their interaction, prior combination indicator (for carry over effect), and a random subject effect using a linear mixed model. All model assumptions will be verified graphically and transformations will be applied as appropriate. The effect of &quot;base&quot; on the Cmax will be evaluated using tests about the least square means of &quot;base&quot;. Additionally, 95% confidence intervals about the mean differences will be obtained.</description>
