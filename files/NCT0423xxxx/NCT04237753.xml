    <textblock>
      This study is about assessing the helpfulness of two treatment delivery methods for bladder&#xD;
      leakage or urinary incontinence. It is being funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs. By&#xD;
      doing this study, the investigators hope to learn which treatment method is the most helpful&#xD;
      remote delivery method for treating bladder leakage. The total participation time in this&#xD;
      research is 6 months. During the first 8 -12 weeks of the study, you will receive standard of&#xD;
      care from an online educational program (MyHealtheBladder) or a video visit with a provider&#xD;
      through VA Video Connect. You will be selected by chance to receive MyHealtheBladder or VA&#xD;
      Video Connect. About half-way through the study, the investigators will ask you about your&#xD;
      bladder symptoms. If your bladder symptoms are not better, you will be selected by chance to&#xD;
      continue the previous treatment or receive an initial or booster video session with a&#xD;
      provider. Throughout the study, you will be asked to answer questions related to your health,&#xD;
      bladder leakage, costs due to bladder leakage, and track your behavioral training.&#xD;

      This study represents a unique opportunity to improve access to treatments for urine leakage&#xD;
      for women Veterans. This research study will examine the effects of two mobile health&#xD;
      technologies on improving bladder symptoms, as part of a randomized clinical trial. The study&#xD;
      includes 260 women Veterans recruited from 3 sites: the Birmingham VAMC, the Atlanta VAHCS,&#xD;
      and the Durham VAMC (86 per site). Women will receive first-line treatments for urine leakage&#xD;
      through randomization to one of two delivery methods for direct treatment: (1) a web-based&#xD;
      mobile health application that delivers content daily for 8 weeks compared to (2) a single&#xD;
      video session delivered by VA Video Connect. At 8-weeks, women who do not have improved&#xD;
      symptoms will have the ability to continue the treatment or receive an initial or booster&#xD;
      video session. The investigators will measure bladder symptoms (3 questions by self-report&#xD;
      over the phone or via survey) at baseline, 8-weeks, 12-weeks, and 6-months. Additionally, the&#xD;
      investigators will interview 54 women Veterans and 12 providers to learn about their&#xD;
      experiences with the technologies using 1:1 telephone interviews at 12-weeks. The findings&#xD;
      from this study will inform the best technology to improve access for bladder leakage among&#xD;
      women Veterans across a wider array of VHA facilities.&#xD;

Participant records will be stored in a locked cabinet in a locked office and will be accessible only to the Principal Investigator, Nurse Practitioner delivering the intervention, Research Coordinator, and Site PI's (Markland, Vaughan, and Goldstein) and co-investigators per site-PI's guidance. Computer-based records will be maintained through the Veteran's Administration Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), a secure network with password protection. A separate tracking database with participant identifiers that provide a link to the unique study IDs will be stored on a secure VA research server at each study site. Only deidentified data will be entered into the Redcap database by study personnel who are credentialed at the Birmingham VAMC through the research office.</ipd_description>
