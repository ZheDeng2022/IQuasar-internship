    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well sleep and physical activity interventions work in increasing the&#xD;
      physical activity of overweight or obese and sedentary African Americans. Sleep and physical&#xD;
      activity interventions may help to increase physical activity among overweight and obese&#xD;
      African American adults who do not get enough exercise.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the feasibility and satisfaction of a brief sleep intervention prior to or&#xD;
      following a physical activity (PA) intervention and a contact control among overweight/obese&#xD;
      sedentary African Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Examine experiences of sleep among overweight/obese sedentary African Americans using&#xD;
      qualitative focus groups/individual interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Pilot test and evaluate the efficacy and sequential effects of a brief sleep intervention&#xD;
      prior to or following a PA intervention in improving sleep, increasing physical activity, and&#xD;
      reducing sedentary behavior, compared to a contact control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore the correlations among psychosocial (e.g., perceived stress, affect, neighborhood&#xD;
      characteristics), biomarker (e.g., non-fasting glucose levels, blood pressure), and health&#xD;
      behavior (e.g., diet and sedentary behavior) with sleep and PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOCUS GROUPS AND INTERVIEWS: Participants attend either a focus group or interview about the&#xD;
      sleep intervention and sleep-related problems over 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Participants receive a web-based sleep intervention weekly during weeks 1-4.&#xD;
      Participants then receive 2 web-based health coaching sessions over 30-45 minutes consisting&#xD;
      of topics such as healthy shopping, increasing physical activity, identifying barriers, and&#xD;
      eating out during weeks 5-9. Participants may optionally complete an interview over 1 hour at&#xD;
      week 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Participants receive 2 web-based health coaching sessions over 30-45 minutes&#xD;
      consisting of topics such as healthy shopping, increasing physical activity, identifying&#xD;
      barriers, and eating out during weeks 1-4. Participants then receive a web-based sleep&#xD;
      intervention weekly during weeks 5-9. Participants may optionally complete an interview over&#xD;
      1 hour at week 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP III: Participants receive educational material on healthy homes. Participants also&#xD;
      receive 2 web-based counseling sessions over 30-45 minutes consisting of topics such as&#xD;
      indoor air quality, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and first aid, and emergency&#xD;
      preparedness at weeks 1 and 3. Participants may optionally complete an interview over 1 hour&#xD;
      at week 9.&#xD;
