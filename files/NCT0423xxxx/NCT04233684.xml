  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with dyspepsia will have negative impact to their life and common cause is&#xD;
      Helicobactor pylori infection. Rapid urease test is the easy available and rapid method to&#xD;
      test the infection but the test may be interfered by proton pump inhibitor, bismuth or&#xD;
      antibiotics .In general, patients with dyspepsia usually take proton pump inhibitor to&#xD;
      relieve dyspepsia so those patients may not stop the drug before test the infection with&#xD;
      rapid urease test. So author aims to measure the sensitivity of rapid urease test from biopsy&#xD;
      of body, which H. pylori would migrate if the patients still take proton pump inhibitor and&#xD;
      biopsy of antrum, which is standard location of biopsy compare to pathology for H. pylori in&#xD;
      each sites in patients who do not stop taking proton pump inhibitor&#xD;

      The investigators contacted patients who had an appointment for esophagoendoscopy(EGD) at&#xD;
      Chulalongkorn Hospital to inform and review patient's history. If patients matched inclusion&#xD;
      and did not meet exclusion criteria, the participants would tell the information of the study&#xD;
      including proposal, method, risk and benefit then the investigators asked for consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients decided to participate then the investigator corrected the information in CRF&#xD;
      form which was sex, age, underlying disease, smoking history, alcohol drinking history,&#xD;
      current and past medication especially PPI and NSIADs, EGD and rapid urease test history, H.&#xD;
      pylori treatment history, duration of taking PPI drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGD was done by endoscopist with standard method. The investigator performed biopsy at&#xD;
      antrum, 5 cm proximal to pylorus lesser curvature, and body, greater curvature opposite to&#xD;
      angularis by standard forceps. The biopsy would take 2 times from each site for rapid urease&#xD;
      test and histopathology test for H. pylori. The endoscopists change forceps after finishing&#xD;
      biopsy in each site to reduce contamination. The EGD finding was recorded After the&#xD;
      investigators test H. pylori by rapid urease test, the result was read at 24 hours at room&#xD;
      temperature. The color changing from yellow to pink was positive test, which mean there was&#xD;
      H. pylori infection. In contrast, negative test was no color changing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Histopathologic test, the investigators fixed sample in formalin, infiltrated the tissue&#xD;
      with paraffin then embedded. Stained with Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin and looked for H. pylori by 2&#xD;
      histopathologists, who were blinded the result to each other and result of rapid urease test.&#xD;
      If negative study, the histopathologists would stain tissue with giemsa and corrected data&#xD;
      again. All gastric tissue will be sent for immunohistochemistry as a gold standard for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
