      This is a prospective, non-randomized study in which patients who meet eligibility criteria&#xD;
      and consent to participate will undergo a minimally invasive procedure using radiofrequency&#xD;
      (RF) energy for ablation of the great saphenous vein (GSV).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will undergo a procedure using the Venclose&#xD;
      Radiofrequency (RF) System to treat the great saphenous vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique involves percutaneous access and insertion of the endovenous sectional&#xD;
      radiofrequency (EVSRF™) catheter into the target vein under ultrasound guidance and relies on&#xD;
      the use of local anesthesia and thermal energy, from a radiofrequency generator, applied to&#xD;
      the target vein. After each treatment, the EVSRF™ catheter is withdrawn a single length of&#xD;
      the heating coil and another treatment is performed, until the entire vessel has been&#xD;
      treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the treatment procedure, subjects will be evaluated four (4) times to assess vein&#xD;
      recanalization and reflux, and to determine the incidence of adverse events.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject is concurrently participating in another interventional clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is pregnant or plans to be pregnant or lactating at the time of the treatment&#xD;
