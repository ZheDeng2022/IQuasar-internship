    <textblock>
      This study will use the drug daratumumab in patients who did not achieve at least a very good&#xD;
      partial response (VGPR) and are already planned to have an Autologous Stem Cell Transplant&#xD;
      (ASCT). Daratumumab will be given before the stem cell collection to attempt to get rid of&#xD;
      any multiple myeloma cells that may be present in the stem cell collection and after the ASCT&#xD;
      to get rid of any multiple myeloma cells that may be remaining.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, two-stage, phase II study to evaluate the rate of ≥ Complete Response&#xD;
      (CR) post-Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) in Multiple Myeloma (MM) subjects who failed&#xD;
      to achieve at least a Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) post initial induction therapy for&#xD;
      newly diagnosed disease, and for whom an ASCT is planned. Subjects will be treated with four&#xD;
      weekly doses of daratumumab before mobilization for Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells (HPC)&#xD;
      collection, followed by high dose chemotherapy and ASCT and four weekly doses of daratumumab&#xD;
      after ASCT. A two-stage design will be implemented. Twenty three (23) subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the first stage, and if at least 12 of the 23 subjects have at least a CR after&#xD;
      ASCT, an additional 16 subjects will be enrolled in the second stage (a total of 39&#xD;
      subjects).&#xD;

             ng/mL or other cancer for which the subject has completed treatment, been disease-free&#xD;
             for at least five years, and is considered by Sponsor-Investigator to be at &lt;30% risk&#xD;
             of relapse, or on hormonal therapy for a history of either prostate cancer or breast&#xD;
             cancer, provided that there has been no evidence of disease progression during the&#xD;
             previous three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Non-secretory MM.&#xD;

             suspected amyloidosis, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator, or any other condition (including laboratory abnormalities) that would,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the Sponsor-Investigator, place the subject at unacceptable risk if&#xD;
             he/she were to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Known allergies, hypersensitivity or intolerance to monoclonal antibodies or human&#xD;

             antigen [HBsAg]). Subjects with resolved infection (ie, subjects who are HBsAg&#xD;
             negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] and/or&#xD;
             antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened using real-time&#xD;
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels.&#xD;
             Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION: Subjects with serologic&#xD;
             findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic&#xD;
             marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV&#xD;
             DNA by PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Known to be seropositive for hepatitis C (except in the setting of a sustained&#xD;
             virologic response [SVR], defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of&#xD;
             antiviral therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Is known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus.&#xD;
