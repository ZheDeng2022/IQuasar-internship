  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When the wrist is damaged, for traumatic or degenerative reasons, the cartilage is worn out&#xD;
      and the bones rub together: this is osteoarthritis. In order to stop this pain, it may be&#xD;
      necessary to block these bones from each other, sacrificing mobility to achieve indolence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple techniques are described according to the type of osteoarthritis and for each type&#xD;
      of osteoarthritis itself, but the principle remains the same. The methods currently commonly&#xD;
      proposed are the staple and the screwed plate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the surgical practice of the Orthopaedics and&#xD;
      Traumatology department of the University Hospital of Rennes, and its long-term results, as&#xD;
      this type of surgery is intended to be definitive.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The surgery performed in the Orthopaedics and Traumatology department of the University&#xD;
      Hospital of Rennes, has 2 notable points: its technique and its equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The procedure is based on the staples 4Fusion1 (Stryker/Memometal), which is still&#xD;
           poorly assessed in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The surgical procedure has several technical specificities: intra osseous cartilage&#xD;
           freshening and preservation of the lunotriquetral ligament if intact.&#xD;
