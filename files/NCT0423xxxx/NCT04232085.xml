      This is a Phase II prospective trial to assess the rates of donor engraftment using reduced&#xD;
      intensity conditioning (RIC) hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and post-transplant&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for patients with primary immune deficiencies (PID), immune&#xD;
      dysregulatory syndromes (IDS), and inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation (alloBMT) is the only curative therapy for many&#xD;
      primary immune deficiencies (PID), immune dysregulatory syndromes (IDS), and inherited bone&#xD;
      marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS). The best reported outcomes are with human leukocyte antigen&#xD;
      (HLA)- matched sibling donors, however, only 30% of children in need of a BMT have an&#xD;
      HLA-matched sibling. Use of alternative donors has been limited by unacceptably high rates of&#xD;
      transplant-related mortality (TRM), graft rejection, infection, and graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
      (GVHD). Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have been used for this patient&#xD;
      population with improved survival and decreased TRM, but graft failure and sustained donor&#xD;
      chimerism have emerged as significant obstacles. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a&#xD;
      RIC platform that improves survival and decreases TRM while maximizing donor engraftment,&#xD;
      which is essential for cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large and growing body of literature demonstrates that post-transplant cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      (PTCy) allows for the safe and effective use of HLA-matched and mismatched related and&#xD;
      unrelated donors and haploidentical related donors after RIC alloBMT. PTCy offers a unique&#xD;
      opportunity to 1) broaden donor availability, 2) promote durable engraftment of donor cells,&#xD;
      3) achieve low rates of GVHD and TRM, 4) foster robust immune reconstitution and immunity,&#xD;
      and 5) shorten the duration of additional post-transplant immune suppression (IS) required to&#xD;
      prevent GVHD. The investigators proposed platform is uniquely suited for success in this&#xD;
      context, to broaden the scope of RIC alloBMT with PTCy as a curative therapy for patients&#xD;
      with PID/IDS and IBMFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase II single arm trial to prospectively study a RIC BMT with PTCy to enhance&#xD;
      durable engraftment of donor cells and improve outcomes for patients with PID/IDS and IBMFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indwelling central venous catheter Placement of a double lumen central venous catheter will&#xD;
      be required for administration of IV medications and transfusion of blood products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment Evaluation All patients will require documentation of a detailed history and&#xD;
      physical examination and standard evaluation of cardiac, pulmonary, liver and renal function.&#xD;
      All patients will undergo disease evaluation. Pre-BMT blood will be drawn for correlative&#xD;
      labs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparative regimen Alemtuzumab: administered as an IV infusion on days -14 to -12. For&#xD;
      patients &gt;10 kg, 3 mg IV test dose over 2 hours followed by 10 mg IV over 2 hours on day -14,&#xD;
      15 mg IV over 2 hours on day -13, and 20 mg IV over 2 hours on day -12. For patients &lt;10 kg,&#xD;
      doses are 3 mg, 10 mg, 10 mg, and 10 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fludarabine: administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes on days -7 to -3. The dose will&#xD;
      be 30 mg/m2/dose (adjusted for renal function).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melphalan: Recommended to be administered as an IV infusion over 30-60 minutes, depending on&#xD;
      volume, on days -3 and -2. The dose will be 70 mg/m2/dose. Alternatively, may be given as 140&#xD;
      mg/m2/dose as a single dose IV infusion per institutional standards on day -2. Other&#xD;
      institutional infusion standards are acceptable and will not be a protocol deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total body irradiation: 200 centigray (cGy) anterior-posterior-posterio-anterior (AP/PA) with&#xD;
      4 megavolt (MV) or 6 MV photons at 8 12 cGy/min at the point of prescription (average&#xD;
      separation of measurements at mediastinum, abdomen, and hips) will be administered in a&#xD;
      single fraction on day -1. This is only for patients with PID/IDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow transplantation Bone Marrow will be harvested and infused on day 0. Institutional&#xD;
      guidelines for the infusion of bone marrow (i.e. major or minor blood type group (ABO)&#xD;
      incompatible bone marrow, etc.) will be followed. The marrow infusion will be done by&#xD;
      designated members of the BMT team. The bone marrow graft will not be manipulated to deplete&#xD;
      T cells. The donor will be harvested with a target yield of 4 x 10^8 nucleated cells/kg&#xD;
      recipient ideal body weight (IBW). The lowest acceptable yield is 2 x 10^8 nucleated&#xD;
      cells/kg. The cluster of differentiation (CD)-34+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD3+ cell count in the&#xD;
      marrow will be quantified by flow cytometry. Bone marrow graft should be hung to gravity (not&#xD;
      infused with a pump). If possible, the total infusion time should be no more than four hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GVHD prophylaxis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-transplantation Cyclophosphamide (PTCy) Cyclophosphamide (Cy) 50mg/kg will be given on&#xD;
      D+3 post-transplant (within 60-72 hr of marrow infusion) and on D+4 post-transplant.&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide will be given as an IV infusion over 1- 2 hours (depending on volume).&#xD;
      Dosing of cyclophosphamide is based on ideal body weight for subjects whose ideal body&#xD;
      weights less than or equal to subjects' actual body weight. On occasion, a subject's actual&#xD;
      body weight may be less than his/her ideal body weight, in which case cyclophosphamide will&#xD;
      be dosed using the subject's actual body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to increase fluids overnight before cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      administration. Hydration with normal saline at 3 cc/kg/hr iv will be started 8 hr prior to&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, then the rate will be reduced to 2 cc/kg/hr for 1 hr pre-cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      and continued for at least 8 hr post-cyclophosphamide or administered per institutional&#xD;
      standards. Mesna will be given IV at 10 mg/kg/dose concurrent with cyclophosphamide infusion,&#xD;
      followed by 40 mg/kg/dose IV over 24 hours, or administered per institutional standards.&#xD;
      Mesna dose will be based on the cyclophosphamide dose being given. The total daily dose of&#xD;
      mesna is equal to 100% of the total daily dose of cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is crucial that no immunosuppressive agents are given until 24 hours after the completion&#xD;
      of the post-transplant Cyclophosphamide. This includes steroids as anti-emetics. Steroids for&#xD;
      disease treatment will attempt to be weaned but are allowed if wean is not possible.&#xD;
      Physiologic and stress dose steroids are allowed if necessary. Steroids are allowed as&#xD;
      pre-medications if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tacrolimus On day +5, patients will begin prophylaxis with Tacrolimus (oral (PO) or&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) as per institutional standards for starting this prophylaxis).Tacrolimus&#xD;
      begins on Day 5, at least 24 hours after completion of post-transplantation Cy. The&#xD;
      tacrolimus starting dose will be given per institutional standards for adult or pediatric&#xD;
      patients. The recommended, but not required, The starting dose of tacrolimus is 0.015mg/kg&#xD;
      IBW/dose IV over 4 hours every 12 hours. , or per institutional standard. Serum trough levels&#xD;
      of tacrolimus should be measured around D+7 and the dose should be adjusted based on this&#xD;
      level to maintain a level of 5-15 ng/ml. Tacrolimus should be converted to oral dosing when&#xD;
      patient has a stable, therapeutic level and is able to tolerate food or other oral&#xD;
      medications. For pediatric patients, the oral dosing is approximately two to four times the&#xD;
      IV dosing. It is recommended that serum trough levels should be checked at steady state after&#xD;
      any dose modification and when switching from IV to oral to ensure therapeutic trough&#xD;
      concentrations. Serum trough concentrations should be checked at a minimum weekly thereafter&#xD;
      and the dose adjusted accordingly to maintain a level of 5-15 ng/ml. Tacrolimus will be&#xD;
      discontinued after the last dose on Day 60 for matched related donors, Day 120 for matched&#xD;
      unrelated donors, and day 180 for haploidentical related or mismatched unrelated donors; or&#xD;
      may be continued if active GVHD is present. This should be discussed with the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mycophenolic acid mofetil (MMF) MMF will be given at a dose of 15 mg/kg PO three times daily&#xD;
      (TID) (based upon actual body weight) with the maximum total daily dose not to exceed 3 grams&#xD;
      (1 g PO TID). MMF prophylaxis will be discontinued after the last dose on day 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growth factor support Patients will receive Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF)&#xD;
      (Filgrastim®) 5µg/kg/d subcutaneous (SC) or IV starting at Day 5 and continuing until the&#xD;
      absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1000/mm3 x 3 days. For use in the case of fungal infections&#xD;
      or subsequent neutropenia (ANC &lt;500/mm3), GCSF should be continued at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfusion support Platelet and packed red cell transfusions will be given per current&#xD;
      institutional recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection prophylaxis and therapy All infection prophylaxis and therapy will be administered&#xD;
      and discontinued as per institutional requirements. The following are recommendations only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) During pre-transplant evaluation patients will be screened for respiratory syncytial virus&#xD;
      (RSV) and influenza A and B, as well as parainfluenza and other respiratory viruses if&#xD;
      symptomatic. Assays of these viruses must be negative for patients to be admitted for&#xD;
      transplant. Consideration should be given to institution of antiviral therapy if positive&#xD;
      prior to transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Oral hygiene will be maintained according to institutional standards. iii) Antifungal&#xD;
      prophylaxis will be administered according to institutional practices. It is important to&#xD;
      follow levels of tacrolimus for patients receiving one of the azole antifungal medications.&#xD;
      The combination of both drugs can raise the levels of the immunosuppressant to toxic levels.&#xD;
      If a patient on tacrolimus is started on an azole antifungal medication, a dose reduction of&#xD;
      the tacrolimus is required and levels should be obtained to ensure patients are not in the&#xD;
      toxic range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis will be administered according to&#xD;
      institutional practices. Recommendations include administering during the preparative&#xD;
      regimen, and then restarting approximately one month post-BMT (or later if white blood cell&#xD;
      count (WBC) not recovering) and continuation until at least one year post-BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v) Viral prophylaxis for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) will be&#xD;
      administered according to institutional practices. Recommendations include continuation for&#xD;
      at least one year post-BMT and/or while on immunosuppressive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vi) Prophylactic and empiric antibiotics as well as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) will be&#xD;
      administered according to institutional practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vii) Re-immunization may be performed according to institutional practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-ovulatory treatment Menstruating females will are recommended to should be be started on&#xD;
      an anti-ovulatory agent, such as Lupron prior to the initiation of the preparative regimen.&#xD;
      The treatment administered will be at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-BMT evaluation Patients will be followed during (i) the initial post-BMT period (ii)&#xD;
      after discharge to the referring physician as per standard practice.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Donor must be medically, socially, and psychologically fit to donate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone marrow should be requested from all allogeneic donors. Peripheral blood stem&#xD;
             cells (PBSCs) are allowed only if the donor is unable or unwilling to give marrow, and&#xD;
             no other bone marrow donor is available. Cord blood is not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  First-degree relatives should be tested for degree of HLA match, CMV serology, ABO&#xD;
             type, and complete blood count (CBC). An unrelated donor search should be initiated at&#xD;
             the time the patient is referred for BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors must meet the selection criteria as defined by the Foundation for the&#xD;
             Accreditation of Hematopoietic Cell Therapy (FACT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of recipient anti-donor HLA antibody in recipient Note: In some instances, low&#xD;
             level, non-cytotoxic HLA specific antibodies may be permissible if they are found to&#xD;
             be at a level well below that detectable by flow cytometry. This will be decided on a&#xD;
             case-by-case basis by the PI and one of the immunogenetics directors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In inherited disorders, family members must be tested for carrier and disease status&#xD;
             of the underlying disorders. In the event that family members are unaffected carriers,&#xD;
             their eligibility as donors will be decided upon by the PI on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the event that two or more eligible donors are identified, the donor will be&#xD;
             selected per institutional standards. Suggested criteria include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Related is preferred over unrelated.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The potential donor that is youngest in age is preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For CMV seronegative patients, a CMV seronegative donor is preferred. For CMV&#xD;
                  seropositive patients, a CMV seropositive donor is preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Red blood cell (RBC) compatibility, in order of preference:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  RBC cross match compatible&#xD;
