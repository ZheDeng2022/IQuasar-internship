  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, single-dose, placebo-controlled, 2-period,&#xD;
      crossover study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of budesonide/albuterol metered-dose&#xD;
      inhaler (BDA MDI/PT027) as compared with a placebo metered-dose inhaler (placebo MDI) on&#xD;
      exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in adult and adolescent subjects with asthma.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive each study treatment on separate visits and undergo a treadmill&#xD;
      exercise challenge test for up to 10 minutes so that the effect of study treatment on&#xD;
      exercise-induced bronchoconstriction can be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>Lung function will be measured by spirometry. Spirometry assessments will be completed at 5 minutes before dosing, 30 minutes after dosing (baseline; 5 minutes before the exercise challenge), and then 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after the exercise challenge. The percentage fall in FEV1 will be calculated based on the baseline value and maximum percentage fall value during the 60-minute assessment period.</description>
