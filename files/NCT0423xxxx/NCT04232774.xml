  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to assess the safety and feasibility of chemical denervation of multiple artery&#xD;
      beds for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and its comorbidities.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is among the most prevalent chronic diseases, affecting 435 million persons&#xD;
      as of 2015 with an annual death toll of 1.5 million, and the overwhelming majority of these&#xD;
      have Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Hypertension is a common comorbidity of diabetes and&#xD;
      present in more than 50% of diabetic patients. The risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is&#xD;
      four-fold higher in patients with both DM and hypertension as compared to the normotensive&#xD;
      non-diabetic controls. Obesity, with a prevalence of over 500 million, is another common&#xD;
      comorbidity of diabetes. These are chronic diseases associated with increased risks of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, stroke, and decreased quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurotronic developed a novel catheter for denervation procedure. Chemical agent is delivered&#xD;
      locally into the adventitial space and ablates the sympathetic nerve and nerve endings in the&#xD;
      adventitial space of the target arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and feasibility of chemical denervation of&#xD;
      the target arteries for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and its comorbidities.&#xD;
