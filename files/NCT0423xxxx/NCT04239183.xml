      A comparative study on the improvement of quality of life of colostomized patients using the&#xD;
      new Be1 device with capsule system.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate improvement of quality of life (difference of at&#xD;
      least 5 points in the StomaQoL questionnaire) among descending colostomy patients,&#xD;
      establishing the following comparisons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with recent surgery who after one month using a current two-piece mechanical&#xD;
           device switch to the new Be1 device with capsule system versus patients who after one&#xD;
           month continue to use the same current two-piece mechanical device during four months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who have been using a current two-piece mechanical device during more than 6&#xD;
           months after an ostomy and agree to switch to the new Be1 device with capsule system&#xD;
           during four months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following secondary objectives have been defined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of patient satisfaction with the new Be1 device with capsule system versus a&#xD;
           current two-piece mechanical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstration that the new Be1 device with capsule system improves the microbiota of the&#xD;
           colostomized patient.&#xD;

        The study will involve descending colostomy patients. There are three study groups. Two of&#xD;
        them will comprise new patients (recently subjected to surgery), while the third will&#xD;
        consist of patients with an ostomy for at least 6 months (pre-existing patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The sample size will comprise 240 patients (85 patients in the mentioned two groups and 70&#xD;
        in the third).&#xD;
