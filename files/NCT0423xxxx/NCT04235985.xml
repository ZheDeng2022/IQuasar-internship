  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the amount of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) present on treated skin&#xD;
      of human volunteers following different application times with a test material bathing&#xD;
      system. The amount of recovered CHG that resides on the skin following each of the evaluated&#xD;
      application times will be evaluated via high performance liquid chromatography with&#xD;
      ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) and correlated with the MIC values determined separately.&#xD;
