      DO-REAL is an observational cohort study assessing the large-scale roll-out of the&#xD;
      antiretroviral drug dolutegravir (DTG) in Lesotho.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DTG has been shown to have low side-effects and superior treatment outcomes for people living&#xD;
      with HIV-1 when compared to other antiretroviral drugs currently in use in low-income&#xD;
      countries. The use of DTG in first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens was recommended&#xD;
      by the World Health Organisation in 2018 and adopted by the Ministry of Health in Lesotho in&#xD;
      2019. While DTG-based ART regimens have led to promising health outcomes in high-income and&#xD;
      clinical trial settings, certain concerns remain regarding the risk of ART-experienced&#xD;
      patients transitioning to a DTG-based ART regimen being placed on a functional monotherapy&#xD;
      (increasing the otherwise low risk of viral resistance to DTG) as well as side-effects&#xD;
      including psychological symptoms and weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the DO-REAL study intends to address these concerns and provide data on health outcomes&#xD;
      of HIV patients on DTG in a &quot;real-life&quot; high-prevalence setting.&#xD;

      SUMMARY: DO-REAL is an observational cohort study assessing the large-scale roll-out of the&#xD;
      antiretroviral drug dolutegravir (DTG) in Lesotho.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND: DTG is a second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitor with low&#xD;
      side-effects and superior treatment outcomes for people living with HIV-1 when compared to&#xD;
      other antiretroviral drugs currently in use in low-income countries. Though some cases have&#xD;
      been described, HIV-1 resistance to DTG is rare in clinical settings when DTG is used as part&#xD;
      of a combination therapy. The use of DTG in first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens&#xD;
      was recommended by the World Health Organisation in 2018 and was adopted by the Ministry of&#xD;
      Health in Lesotho in 2019. DTG now forms part of the recommended first-line therapy for many&#xD;
      ART-naïve patients in Lesotho. In addition, many patients on a non-DTG-based first-line ART&#xD;
      regimen will be transitioned to a DTG-based regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: Despite the positive health outcomes observed in patients receiving DTG-based ART&#xD;
      in high-income countries and in clinical trial settings, there is little data on virologic&#xD;
      outcomes of patients on DTG during large-scale implementation in low- and lower middle-income&#xD;
      countries. Concerns remain regarding the risk that some patients transitioning to a DTG-based&#xD;
      regimen will be placed on a functional monotherapy. Furthermore, there are concerns as to&#xD;
      psychological side-effects and observed weight gain. This observational study aims to assess&#xD;
      the virologic outcomes (viral suppression rates as well as potential drug resistance) as well&#xD;
      as side-effects of people living with HIV-1 and transitioning to a DTG-based ART regimen in&#xD;
      Lesotho.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DO-REAL has two major objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess virologic outcomes after the programmatic shift to DTG-based regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess psychological and somatic wellbeing in patients before and after the&#xD;
           programmatic shift to DTG-based regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: DO-REAL is a cohort study enrolling people living with HIV who are initiating or are&#xD;
      eligible (according to national guidelines and the local implementation thereof) to initiate&#xD;
      a DTG-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen. The study will take place at three&#xD;
      hospitals in two districts (Butha-Buthe, Mokhotlong) in Lesotho, and aims to enrol over 2000&#xD;
      participants. Viral loads will be measured on the day of initiating a DTG-based regimen (or&#xD;
      on the day this was offered), as well as four, 12 and 24 months thereafter. In a post-hoc&#xD;
      analysis, samples will be tested for drug resistance in samples where the viral load permits&#xD;
      (approx. ≥100 c/mL). A subset of participants will complete screenings for depression,&#xD;
      general health, and HIV-related symptoms.&#xD;
