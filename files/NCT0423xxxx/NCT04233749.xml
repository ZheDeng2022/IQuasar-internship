  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no effective treatments for lichen planus pigmentosus (LPP) and erythema&#xD;
      dyschromicum perstans (EDP). Tranexamic acid, which may downregulate pigmentation through a&#xD;
      reduction in plasmin, has been shown to decrease pigmentation in patients with melasma,&#xD;
      another pigmentary disorder. Given that LPP, EDP, and melasma are all disorders of&#xD;
      pigmentation with dermal involvement, it is possible that tranexamic acid can also reduce&#xD;
      pigmentation in LPP and EDP as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lichen planus pigmentosus (LPP) and erythema dyschromicum perstans (EDP) (also known as ashy&#xD;
      dermatosis (AD)) are two conditions on the spectrum of dermal pigmentary disorders. LPP&#xD;
      typically affects skin phototypes III-V and has involvement of sun exposed areas or&#xD;
      intertriginous areas. It presents as irregularly shaped or oval grey-brown macules and&#xD;
      patches that are typically asymptomatic, but can have mild pruritus and burning. EDP, on the&#xD;
      other hand, presents as grey-brown macules and patches in sun-protected sites and may have an&#xD;
      early inflammatory phase with an erythematous border. It is typically asymptomatic, but can&#xD;
      also be mildly pruritic. There is significant histologic overlap between the two conditions&#xD;
      including basal cell degeneration, a mild perivascular or band-like infiltrate in the upper&#xD;
      dermis, and dermal melanophages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple treatments for these conditions, including topical corticosteroids, topical&#xD;
      calcineurin inhibitors, topical retinoids, chemical peels, minocycline, dapsone,&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine, isotretinoin, griseofulvin, and systemic steroids have been reported in&#xD;
      the literature. However, none of these have been effective consistently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid (TA) is a synthetic analog of lysine, and serves as a fibrinolytic agent by&#xD;
      binding lysine sites on fibrinogen. Commonly used in surgery to prevent bleeding, it has&#xD;
      recently been used in dermatology for the treatment of melasma. Melasma is a pigmentary&#xD;
      disorder characterized by hyperpigmented patches in sun-exposed areas, often in response to&#xD;
      hormones, sunlight, and other factors. The proposed mechanism of action of tranexamic acid in&#xD;
      decreasing pigmentation in this condition is that it decreases inflammation by decreasing&#xD;
      dermal angiogenesis and inhibits UV induced plasmin activity in keratinocytes. Plasmin&#xD;
      activity can increase melanogenic factors, leading to increased pigmentation. In a study by&#xD;
      Lee et al., when administered orally at a dose of 250mg twice daily over approximately 4&#xD;
      months, 89.7 % of patients had documented improvement in pigmentation. Of those who improved,&#xD;
      the median lightening was approximately 50%, which is significant. Other studies have also&#xD;
      shown promising results.&#xD;
