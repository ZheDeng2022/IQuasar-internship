  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of triapine when given together&#xD;
      with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in treating patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Triapine may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Radioactive drugs, such as lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, may carry radiation directly to tumor&#xD;
      cells and not harm normal cells. Giving triapine and lutetium Lu 177 dotatate together may be&#xD;
      a good way in treating patients with neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of lutetium Lu&#xD;
      177 dotatate in combination with triapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To determine the overall response rate&#xD;
      (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months&#xD;
      post therapy in dose escalation cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the best overall response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria In&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 in dose expansion cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To measure duration of response (DOR) associated with the combination. V. To evaluate&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS), 24-month PFS, and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Measure baseline 68 gallium-dotatate (or copper 64 dotatate) biodistribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate oral triapine plasma pharmacokinetics and corresponding methemoglobin level by&#xD;
      venous blood gas proportion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate NETest at baseline and disease progression to correlate result with clinical&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Describe the tumor molecular profile using whole exome sequencing (WES), as well as&#xD;
      ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq) by the National Clinical Laboratory Network (NCLN)&#xD;
      Genomics Lab, and correlate it with treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Collect plasma for circulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Assess the effect of triapine on single deoxyribonucleoside concentrations by a liquid&#xD;
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MSMS) assay in baseline (pre-treatment) and disease&#xD;
      progression blood samples (processed to plasma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of triapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lutetium Lu 177 dotatate intravenously (IV) over 30-40 minutes on day 1 and&#xD;
      triapine orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks (56 days)&#xD;
      for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 24 months.&#xD;

             this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy precaution: Men and women should avoid pregnancy for seven months after the&#xD;
             date of their last treatment with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. It is noteworthy that&#xD;
             beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) may be secreted by a small percentage of&#xD;
             neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), such that, in addition to being a pregnancy marker, it&#xD;
             also is a tumor marker. Consequently, NET female patients with positive beta-HCG at&#xD;
             baseline can be eligible to enter the study and receive treatment if pregnancy can be&#xD;
             excluded by lack of expected doubling of beta-HCG and negative pelvic ultrasound.&#xD;
             Normally, in pregnant subjects beta-HCG doubles every 2 days during the first 4 weeks&#xD;
             of pregnancy and every 3.5 days by weeks 6 to 7. Women of childbearing potential&#xD;
             include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful&#xD;
             surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral&#xD;
             ovariectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea &gt; 12 consecutive months,&#xD;
             and for women on hormone replacement therapy, only with a documented plasma&#xD;
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH)] level &gt; 35 mIU/mL). Even women who are using oral,&#xD;
             implanted, or injected contraceptive hormones, an intrauterine device (IUD), or&#xD;
             barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicidal) to prevent pregnancy, are practicing&#xD;
             abstinence or where the partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy) should be considered to&#xD;
             be of childbearing potential. Postmenopausal women who have fertilized eggs implanted&#xD;
             are also considered to be of childbearing potential. Acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception may include total abstinence at the discretion of the Investigator in&#xD;
             cases where the age, career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation of the patient ensures&#xD;
             compliance. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
             Reliable contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
             should be maintained throughout the study and for 7 months after study treatment&#xD;
             discontinuation. All women of childbearing potential and male partners must use a&#xD;
             double-barrier method of birth control or practice continuous abstinence from&#xD;
             heterosexual contact throughout the study and for seven months after the end of the&#xD;
             last treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a&#xD;
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;= 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on&#xD;
             the use of triapine in combination with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in patients &lt; 18&#xD;
             years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future&#xD;
             pediatric trials&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had major surgical procedures in the prior 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an inability to swallow oral medications or gastrointestinal disease&#xD;
             limiting absorption of oral agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior external beam radiotherapy to more than 50% of bone&#xD;
             marrow, as determined by a radiation medicine physicist who will calculate the volume&#xD;
             of bone marrow exposure in prior radiotherapy portals divided by the volume of total&#xD;
             bone marrow harboring tissues. This ratio must be less than 50 percent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] III, IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering&#xD;
             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to triapine or lutetium Lu 177 dotatate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection; symptomatic decompensated congestive heart failure; unstable&#xD;
             angina pectoris; cardiac arrhythmia; and known inadequately controlled hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because triapine is a ribonucleotide&#xD;
             reductase (RNR) inhibitor and lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is a peptide receptor&#xD;
             radionuclide therapy with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with triapine and lutetium Lu 177 dotatate,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with triapine and&#xD;
             lutetium Lu 177 dotatate and for 2.5 months following the last treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Discontinue long-acting somatostatin analogs (e.g., long-acting octreotide) for at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks prior to initiating lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. Long-acting somatostatin&#xD;
             analog will be allowed to continue if patient has history of carcinoid syndrome and&#xD;
             requires long-acting somatostatin analog for control of his/her functional syndrome&#xD;
