      What is the purpose of the study?&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with Multiple Sclerosis often say that they feel less support is available after they&#xD;
      are diagnosed with Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis, compared to before they received&#xD;
      this diagnosis. People sometimes experience a lessening of support, despite their physical&#xD;
      symptoms becoming more severe from both professionals and those in their personal lives. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to see whether providing some telephone support to those who have&#xD;
      recently received a diagnosis of Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis is experienced as&#xD;
      helpful and is possible to do practically. This study will help the investigators understand&#xD;
      which type of support may be helpful for patients in the future and may pave the way for&#xD;
      larger studies and changes to NHS provision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who is it for?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be those who have transitioned recently (within the last year) to Secondary&#xD;
      Progressive Multiple Sclerosis. The investigators are inviting 40 participants to take part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What will happen to participants if they take part?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked by their Neurologist or MS Nurse to take part in the study and&#xD;
      will provide written consent to be contacted, which will be stored by the research team.&#xD;
      Their details will be passed to the study team at the University of Nottingham, who will&#xD;
      telephone the participant within a week to tell them a bit more about the study and ensure&#xD;
      they are suitable for the study by asking them some questions. Following this, the&#xD;
      participant will be sent some paper or online questionnaires to complete and return. After&#xD;
      this, the researcher will visit the participant face to face to introduce themselves and&#xD;
      answer any questions they may have. They will also tell the participants what &quot;group&quot; they&#xD;
      have been randomly put into. There are two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those in the first group would be asked to commit to receiving a 30 minute support phonecall&#xD;
      each week for five weeks in addition to any usual care, and the second group will receive&#xD;
      their usual NHS care. The support phonecalls will draw from techniques used in a type of&#xD;
      psychological therapy (acceptance and commitment therapy). All the phonecalls can be done&#xD;
      whilst the participant is at home or in a quiet place of their choosing. After this, both&#xD;
      groups will fill in some more paper questionnaires eight and twelve weeks after the start of&#xD;
      the study. The investigators expect that participants will be involved in the study for&#xD;
      around 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the study, participants will also have the opportunity to feedback how they experienced&#xD;
      being a participant in the study. Their responses will help the researchers understand their&#xD;
      experience, and help them use this to think about how to adapt similar studies in the future.&#xD;

      which type of support may be helpful for patients in the future and may pave the way for&#xD;
      larger studies and changes to NHS provision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the feasibility of providing a low-resource acceptance-based telephone support&#xD;
      intervention around the time of transition to Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Configuration&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single centre, mixed-methods feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT), comparing two&#xD;
      groups: (1) Acceptance Based Support + usual care; (2) usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting Secondary care. Single centre: Nottingham Hospital and community&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimate N maximum: 40 people with Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis&#xD;
      (SPMS) (20 participants per group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to this, the investigators aim to recruit 12 of the participants for the nested&#xD;
      qualitative study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed number of participants for the study will be: 40 The proposed number of&#xD;
      participants for the interviews will be: 12&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptance Based Telephone Support (ABS+UC): One face-to-face session to be informed of the&#xD;
      group they have been randomised into and Acceptance Based Support, followed by five 30-minute&#xD;
      telephone sessions of Acceptance Based Support. Usual care continues as normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual Care (Control Group) (UC): One face to face session to be informed of the group they&#xD;
      have been randomised into and encouraged to ask any questions, and will be informed they will&#xD;
      be contacted again in 8 weeks. Usual care continues as normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place over an 8-month period from September 2019 - April 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will take each participant 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: September 2019-February 2020 Analysis: February 2020-April 2020&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the decision to include a person with MS is made, they will be randomised to one of two&#xD;
      groups in a ratio of 1:1: (1) ABS+UC or (2) UC. Block randomisation of 2, 4, 6 and 8 will be&#xD;
      used to ensure parity between groups, and randomly selected block sizes will be used.&#xD;
      Randomisation will be conducted using an online sealed envelope service&#xD;
      (www.sealedenvelope.com), to generate a priori the random allocation sequence. Due to the&#xD;
      nature of the intervention, the pwMS and CM delivering the treatment cannot be blinded to&#xD;
      group allocation, but outcome assessors will be blinded. Analysis will also be undertaken&#xD;
      blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative analysis: As a feasibility trial, the main analysis will be descriptive and&#xD;
      focus on confidence interval estimation and not formal hypothesis testing. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be used to describe outcomes and to inform power and sample size calculations&#xD;
      for a future trial. Rates of consent, recruitment and follow-up by randomised groups will be&#xD;
      reported. Based on the characteristics of the data, appropriate parametric and non-parametric&#xD;
      statistics will be used to describe trends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative analysis: Framework approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological condition affecting young adults. For&#xD;
      the majority people with MS (pwMS), it presents initially as a series of relapses, each&#xD;
      followed by a period of recovery. When there is a lack of disease progression between these&#xD;
      relapses; this is referred to as Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS). For many of those with RRMS,&#xD;
      this develops into a progressive disorder with an absence of relapse then recovery, but more&#xD;
      typically a gradual decline in function. This is called Secondary Progressive Multiple&#xD;
      Sclerosis (SPMS), and is defined by progressive accumulation of disability after an initial&#xD;
      RRMS course; which may or may not contain sharp episodes of decline during progression. This&#xD;
      progression from RRMS to SPMS happens within 15 years of initial diagnosis in 50% of cases&#xD;
      and takes a median of 20 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a significant clinical challenge for health professionals in objectively identifying&#xD;
      the transition from RRMS to SPMS in individuals due to subtle changes in symptoms, and&#xD;
      receiving a new diagnosis can take an average of almost three years after onset of&#xD;
      progressive symptoms. From a psychosocial perspective, the transition from RRMS to SPMS is a&#xD;
      very difficult time for pwMS fraught with uncertainty. Clinicians describe the impact on pwMS&#xD;
      as receiving an SPMS diagnosis as having a similar effect of receiving the initial diagnosis.&#xD;
      Some of the challenges faced during this period are an adjustment towards unremitting&#xD;
      symptoms, a withdrawal of previous disease-modifying treatments, and ever greater activity&#xD;
      limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been argued that transition to SPMS is a 'fear-point' of the disease, a crucial and&#xD;
      vulnerable time where ineffective support and insufficient communication can lead to patients&#xD;
      feeling 'devastated and demoralised', but where well placed 'supportive, encouraging and&#xD;
      compassionate' communications can be effective in addressing the attitudinal and&#xD;
      psychological aspects of the patient, and act as a 'buffer' for the emotional morbidity&#xD;
      associated with MS. In this vulnerable time, communication with pwMS ought to be considered&#xD;
      foundational to effective MS care, and that 'doing something rather than nothing can be&#xD;
      extremely important'. Loss of social support has been shown to be associated with depression,&#xD;
      in a population which is already susceptible to mood disorders due to being a neurological&#xD;
      and chronic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most consistent finding of a systematic review of the psychological factors that affect&#xD;
      adjustment in pwMS found that perceived stress and certain emotion focussed coping strategies&#xD;
      were related to worse adjustment. A strong predictor of health status in MS is self-efficacy,&#xD;
      which may represent an important source of coping with the burdens of MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploring the way in which pwMS regulate and cope with emotion therefore is a key&#xD;
      consideration. CBT states that modifying dysfunctional cognitions that contribute to&#xD;
      psychological distress is a cornerstone of the therapy process, and a central mediator of&#xD;
      therapeutic outcome. In contrast, ACT states that facilitating acceptance of emotional and&#xD;
      cognitive content is a central part of the therapeutic process. These differences can be&#xD;
      summarised as cognitive &quot;reappraisal&quot; in CBT or &quot;acceptance&quot; in ACT ways of regulating&#xD;
      emotion. These ways of regulating emotion have been compared in a study into the effects of&#xD;
      anxious arousal, which found that both cognitive reappraisal and acceptance strategies were&#xD;
      more effective than suppression for moderating physiological sensations, with the cognitive&#xD;
      reappraisal generally the most adaptive strategy in terms of reducing anxiety response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an NHS currently plagued by understaffed services, a sufficiently effective, low resource&#xD;
      psychological telephone support, which seeks to improve self-efficacy and techniques of&#xD;
      emotional coping is needed for those with SPMS. This study will assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      such an intervention, which is likely to appeal to pwMS, overworked healthcare staff, and&#xD;
      funders if it leads to a reduction in SPMS patients use of other services. The content of&#xD;
      this telephone support may benefit from a more acceptance-based regulation of emotion&#xD;
      considering the client group: in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, negative illness&#xD;
      beliefs and distress may be entirely logical due to the debilitating nature of their&#xD;
      condition which may make CBT &quot;reappraisal&quot; unrealistic. For this reason, several previous&#xD;
      authors have argued ACT has utility over existing therapeutic models in long term conditions&#xD;
      and due to its growing evidence base and strong face validity, is being widely adopted by&#xD;
      health professionals working with long term conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the AT-SPMS intervention is a 'complex intervention' (based on Medical Research Council&#xD;
      [MRC] definition); the investigators aim to evaluate the key feasibility parameters before&#xD;
      proceeding to a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the clinical and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the intervention in improving outcomes for pwMS during transition to&#xD;
      SPMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the acceptability and credibility of an acceptance-based&#xD;
      telephone support intervention provided during the transition to SPMS through a feasibility&#xD;
      RCT aimed at increasing physical activity and improving social relationships. This follows&#xD;
      NICE guidance towards recommendations for increasing activity in MS and research evidence&#xD;
      highlighting the importance of maintaining the psychological wellbeing of patients during&#xD;
      transition to SPMS and the importance of social relationships within this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to demonstrate proof of principle of the intervention by&#xD;
      gathering information about the process of change between the two treatment arms on&#xD;
      self-efficacy, emotional coping, and mood, and to gather feedback, through nested interviews,&#xD;
      on the intervention and study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL / STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL / STUDY CONFIGURATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single centre mixed methods feasibility randomised control trial (fRCT) is to be conducted&#xD;
      to assess the feasibility and optimal delivery of the acceptance based support intervention&#xD;
      with people recently diagnosed with SPMS. The fRCT will have two groups: (1) Acceptance Based&#xD;
      Support + Usual Care (ABS+UC) and (2) Usual Care (UC). Participants will be assessed at&#xD;
      Baseline, and then again at 8 and 12 weeks post-randomisation, with participation in the&#xD;
      study taking an estimated 4 months. A selection of the participants will then be invited to&#xD;
      complete feedback interviews. UC refers to the typical contact made to those recently&#xD;
      diagnosed with SPMS by the Neurology service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints in this study relate to the feasibility of proceeding to a future RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acceptability and feasibility of trial procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Appropriateness of eligibility criteria, baseline and outcome measures, audio recording&#xD;
           of sessions and randomisation protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Success of recruitment strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recruitment and retention rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Estimation of sample size needed for a future RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Completion rates of outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary endpoints are to demonstrate proof of principle of the intervention by&#xD;
           gathering information about the process of change between the two treatment arms on&#xD;
           self-efficacy, emotional coping, and mood, and to gather feedback, through nested&#xD;
           interviews, on the intervention and study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once the decision to include a pwMS is made, they will be randomised to one of two&#xD;
           groups in a ratio of 1:1: (1) ABS+UC or (2) UC. Block randomisation of 2, 4, 6 and 8&#xD;
           will be used to ensure parity between groups, and randomly selected block sizes will be&#xD;
           used to avoid selection bias. Randomisation will be conducted using an online sealed&#xD;
           envelope service (www.sealedenvelope.com), to generate a priori the random allocation&#xD;
           sequence. Trial researchers will access the allocation for each participant by logging&#xD;
           in to this remote, secure internet-based randomisation system. Once a participant has&#xD;
           consented to the study and completed the baseline measures, the researcher will log into&#xD;
           the randomisation system and enter basic demographic information to receive the&#xD;
           allocation for that participant. The sequence of treatment allocations will be concealed&#xD;
           until interventions have all been assigned and recruitment, data collection, and all the&#xD;
           other assessments are complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
           TRIAL/STUDY MANAGEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
           The University of Nottingham (UoN) will act as the Sponsor for the trial. UoN's Standard&#xD;
           Operating Procedures (SOPs) will be used to govern the conduct of all aspects of the&#xD;
           study. The Sponsor will ensure the trial is run in accordance with our University's&#xD;
           SOPs. The trial will be managed and co-ordinated from the Division of Psychiatry and&#xD;
           Applied Psychology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham by the Trial Management&#xD;
           Group (TMG), consisting of all of the authors. The trial is funded by the Health&#xD;
           Education East Midlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Trial Management Group (TMG) will meet bi-monthly to ensure milestones are achieved&#xD;
           as planned, and will be responsible for the day to day management of the trial. This&#xD;
           includes reviewing recruitment, randomisation, retention, data management, adherence to&#xD;
           protocol, patient safety, delivery and fidelity of the intervention, data quality and&#xD;
           timescales. The TMG will consist of all authors; the Chief Investigator (RdN), Trial&#xD;
           Manager (CM), Research Clinical Psychologist (NM), Research Fellow (GT), and Field&#xD;
           Supervisor (NE). The Trial Manager (referred to from here as TM) will contact other&#xD;
           co-authors for support should issues arise between TMG meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The CI has overall responsibility for the study and shall oversee all study management.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data custodian will be the CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be identified within 6 months of receiving a diagnosis of SPMS at the&#xD;
           Neurology Clinic at Queens Medical Centre (QMC, Nottingham) and will be told about the&#xD;
           study by their treating Neurologist or MS Nurse Specialist. If the potential participant&#xD;
           is interested in finding out more about the study, the treating clinician will gain&#xD;
           their written consent to contact which will be held in the study files, and their&#xD;
           contact details will be passed to the TM. The TM will make telephone contact within one&#xD;
           week to confirm their willingness to participate. If they are not interested, the pwMS&#xD;
           will be thanked for their time and excluded from the study. No further contact will be&#xD;
           made by the TM and their details will be permanently deleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Should the pwMS be interested in participating, the TM will send them an 'Information&#xD;
           for Participant' sheet and a copy of the consent form in the post or by email (based on&#xD;
           participant preference), and they will be informed that the TM will contact them over&#xD;
           the telephone in one week, which should give the material time to arrive and be read.&#xD;
           This call will enable the TM to enquire whether they have received the information,&#xD;
           allow them to explain the study in more detail, and answer any questions the interested&#xD;
           participant has about the study. If they are no longer interested, the person will be&#xD;
           thanked for their time and excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the participant is still interested in participating, then a pack of outcome measures&#xD;
           will be posted to them, and they will be asked to complete these once they arrive. The&#xD;
           participant will be instructed to sign and return the consent form, and outcome measures&#xD;
           using the pre-paid envelope provided. Completing the consent forms and outcome measures&#xD;
           can also be done online, based on participant preference, which may help those&#xD;
           participants who are less readily able to travel. Once the consent form, and outcome&#xD;
           measures have been returned and the inclusion criteria have been determined to be met,&#xD;
           the person will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Twelve participants, six from each study arm, will be invited to take part in&#xD;
           qualitative interviews by the TM following their involvement in the study. These&#xD;
           participants will be telephoned to enquire about their interest, and if they would be&#xD;
           interested, will be posted or emailed (depending on preference) a Participant&#xD;
           Information Sheet (PIS) and a consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It will be explained to the potential participant that entry into the trial is entirely&#xD;
           voluntary and that their treatment and care will not be affected by their decision. It&#xD;
           will also be explained that they can withdraw at any time but attempts will be made to&#xD;
           avoid this occurrence. In the event of their withdrawal it will be explained that their&#xD;
           data collected so far cannot be erased and the investigators will seek consent to use&#xD;
           the data in the final analyses where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Removal of participants from therapy or assessments/Participant Withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be informed through the PIS and consent form that they are free to&#xD;
           withdraw from the study at any time without it affecting their normal care or legal&#xD;
           rights. The TM will attempt to replace those who withdraw from the study before&#xD;
           randomisation however since this is a feasibility study, participants who withdraw from&#xD;
           the study after randomization will not be replaced, but withdrawal rates and reasons&#xD;
           will be recorded (if the participants choose to give them). If a participant indicates a&#xD;
           wish to withdraw from the intervention, the investigators will enquire whether they will&#xD;
           consider completing the follow-up assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants may be withdrawn from the trial either at their own request or at the&#xD;
           discretion of the TMG after discussion. If the participant requests to withdraw, efforts&#xD;
           will be made to contact the participant over the telephone or other preferred method to&#xD;
           understand and respond to their concerns. If participants continue to express they want&#xD;
           to withdraw, or do not respond, then they will be considered to have withdrawn. The&#xD;
           participants will be made aware that this will not affect their future care.&#xD;
           Participants will be made aware (via the PIS and consent form) that should they withdraw&#xD;
           the data collected to date cannot be erased and may still be used in the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The TMG may remove a participant from the study where significant disease progression&#xD;
           makes aspects of the study impossible. e.g. loss of communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Withdrawal from the Acceptance Based Support programme is not considered a safety issue&#xD;
           for participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
           All participants will provide written informed consent. The Consent Form will be signed&#xD;
           and dated by the participant before they enter the trial. The TM will explain the&#xD;
           details of the trial and provide a PIS, ensuring that the participant has enough time to&#xD;
           consider participating or not. The TM will answer any questions that the participant has&#xD;
           concerning study participation. Informed consent will be collected from each&#xD;
           participant: one copy of this will be kept by the participant, one will be kept by the&#xD;
           TM. Informed consent will be gathered through one of the following routes before they&#xD;
           undergo any interventions, this includes postal or online consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Postal: Two copies of the Consent Forms will be posted to participants, who will be&#xD;
           requested to sign and date them. The TM will be available to discuss the information&#xD;
           sheet and consent form over the telephone with the participants. Once participants sign&#xD;
           the Consent Forms and complete the baseline questionnaires, they will return one consent&#xD;
           form and the questionnaires to the investigators using the pre-paid envelope provided.&#xD;
           They will keep one consent form for their personal records.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Online: Online informed consent will be created using online survey tools. The&#xD;
           'mandatory response' function of the online survey tool will be used to ensure obtaining&#xD;
           consent from the participants. In this way, participants must confirm they have read the&#xD;
           information page and each of the ethical statements. Only when they have 'clicked' to&#xD;
           confirm each statement will they be able to move forward to the online baseline&#xD;
           questionnaires. Should they wish to have a copy of the consent form, they will be able&#xD;
           to print the consent page. If they do not have a printing facility, the investigators&#xD;
           will print their consent form and send them a hard copy by post.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the qualitative interviews, separate informed consent will be collected from the&#xD;
           patient participants before undertaking the interviews following the aforementioned&#xD;
           procedures. A separate PIS and Consent Form specific to the interviews will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Should there be any subsequent amendment to the final protocol, which might affect a&#xD;
           participant's participation in the trial, continuing consent will be obtained using an&#xD;
           amended Consent Form which will be signed by the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           TRIAL / STUDY TREATMENT AND REGIMEN&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will test the feasibility and optimal delivery of the acceptance based&#xD;
           support intervention with people recently diagnosed with SPMS, by comparing two groups:&#xD;
           (1) Acceptance Based Support + Usual Care (ABS+UC) and (2) Usual Care (UC).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Acceptance Based Support + Usual Care (ABS+UC)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The ABS+UC arm will comprise appointments with the TM who will receive training and&#xD;
           supervision from an experienced clinical psychologist (the CI). This will take place&#xD;
           over a maximum of 6 sessions, with the first being a face to face session (60 minutes)&#xD;
           and the remaining delivered over telephone (30 minutes each). The content of the&#xD;
           sessions will be an acceptance based psychological support approach to tackling&#xD;
           maintenance of physical activity, and social avoidance. This will comprise of resources&#xD;
           which teach an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) informed approach to wellbeing,&#xD;
           and will be tailored to the specific needs of the participant. A &quot;Patient Workbook&quot;,&#xD;
           developed from previously designed self-help formats for ACT will be given to all&#xD;
           patients in the ABS+UC arm of the study. The workbook will be used as a supplement to&#xD;
           assist the guidance and support of the therapist and will not be a standalone self-help&#xD;
           intervention, following the recommendations of a recent systematic review and a&#xD;
           subsequent thesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Usual Care&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the UC arm, the participant will meet once with the TM face to face to be informed of&#xD;
           the group they have been randomised into and encouraged to ask any questions, and will&#xD;
           be informed they will be contacted again in 8 and 12 weeks and be asked to complete some&#xD;
           more outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An encrypted UoN dictaphone will be used to audiotape a proportion (10%) of the&#xD;
           telephone intervention sessions. Audiotaping will take place in a practical way ensuring&#xD;
           that different time points of the intervention are captured. Fidelity to the ACT&#xD;
           intervention will then be cross-checked through comparing it against existing criteria&#xD;
           to ensure integrity to the model as outlined in an assessment manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline and follow-up assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be assessed before randomisation at baseline. They will also be&#xD;
           assessed at 8 and 12 weeks after randomisation for follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Demographic data and illness data will be collected at baseline, along with a number of&#xD;
           outcome measures detailed looking at mood, psychological flexibility, self efficacy etc.&#xD;
           The outcome measures will also be collected at follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participant Feedback Interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the final participant has been randomised, up to 12 participants, six from the&#xD;
           ABS+UC and six from the UC condition, will be invited to take part in 30-minute,&#xD;
           semi-structured interviews about their experience of the study. A separate information&#xD;
           sheet and consent form will be completed in relation to the interviews. Participants&#xD;
           will be selected for interview through purposive maximum-variation sampling based on&#xD;
           demographic and illness data. An interview schedule will be used and applied flexibly. A&#xD;
           12-participant sample is a manageable number for a study of this size.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The interviews will be conducted by a trainee clinical psychologist researcher (under&#xD;
           supervision from a qualified clinical psychologist with an expertise in qualitative&#xD;
           methods) independent of the trial team who will explore the pwMS's experience of&#xD;
           receiving each condition, (i.e. what they found helpful or unhelpful, the content and&#xD;
           delivery of the intervention). Audio recording will be taken for all interviews and will&#xD;
           be transcribed verbatim. An external person/company will be used for transcribing the&#xD;
           interviews. A confidentiality agreement will be in place before transferring the&#xD;
           interview data to the external company. The transcribed data will be analysed using a&#xD;
           framework approach which is a hierarchical, matrix-based method developed for applied&#xD;
           qualitative research. Using this approach is appropriate as our goals are clearly&#xD;
           defined at the onset (i.e. to support the development of a future definitive trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
           STATISTICS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           Qualitative Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           The feedback interviews will be transcribed by an external (GDPR compliant, and approved&#xD;
           by University of Nottingham) transcription service, and analysed by the TM using NVivo&#xD;
           data analysis software. A five step Framework Analysis approach will then be taken. This&#xD;
           approach involves use of a thematic framework a priori which helps to guide the content&#xD;
           of the interviews, which is appropriate for this study as the investigators have clearly&#xD;
           defined goals from the outset (i.e. to examine the feasibility of a future RCT trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Framework Analysis, the data will be mapped onto a constructed thematic framework.&#xD;
           After mapping all the data, a matrix will be generated in which the data will be charted&#xD;
           to summarise each main theme. This matrix will then be used in the interpretation of the&#xD;
           data - in addition to the notes made during the coding process. To ensure rigour and&#xD;
           credibility of the findings, the generated matrix will be reviewed by another researcher&#xD;
           and the quotations for their relevance to the themes will be checked. Disagreements will&#xD;
           be resolved by discussion in the TMG.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quantitative Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           As a feasibility trial, the main analysis will be descriptive and focus on confidence&#xD;
           interval estimation and not formal hypothesis testing. Descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
           used to describe outcomes and to inform power and sample size calculations for a future&#xD;
           trial. Rates of consent, recruitment and follow-up by randomised groups will be&#xD;
           reported. Based on the characteristics of the data, appropriate parametric and&#xD;
           non-parametric statistics will be used to describe trends.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SPSS for Windows will be utilised for the analysis of outcome measures, illness and&#xD;
           demographic data, and feasibility measures (e.g. number of missed appointments).&#xD;
           Frequencies and percentages of missed and rescheduled support calls, attrition rates and&#xD;
           adherence to outcome measures will be gathered. In addition, analysis of variance&#xD;
           (ANOVA) will be used to explore outcome data at different time-points, to allow for&#xD;
           calculation of effect sizes to help ascertain sample size predictions for a future RCT.&#xD;
           Regression will be used to help the investigators predict the likelihood of change,&#xD;
           using initial HADS scores, illness, and demographic factors as variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size and justification&#xD;
&#xD;
           The recruitment target is to randomise 40 pwMS, based on recommended sample sizes&#xD;
           between 24 and 50 for feasibility RCTs. Recruiting 15 participants or above per study&#xD;
           condition is considered acceptable to obtain a reasonable sample size estimate for pilot&#xD;
           trial studies, and recent similar research of an 8-session telephone study comparing CBT&#xD;
           to supportive listening showed a consistent attrition rate across interventions with&#xD;
           this population of around 15%. Therefore, a slightly larger target (20 per arm) for 6&#xD;
           sessions will help to prepare for the possibility of a 25% attrition rate, whilst still&#xD;
           achieving the 15 participants per arm suggested to evidence a future RCT. An estimation&#xD;
           for the recruitment rate is to recruit five participants each month, between March 2019&#xD;
           and October 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DATA PROTECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           All trial staff and investigators will endeavour to protect the rights of the trial's&#xD;
           participants to privacy and informed consent, and will adhere to the Data Protection&#xD;
           Act, 2018. The CRF will only collect the minimum required information for the purposes&#xD;
           of the trial. CRFs will be held securely, in a locked room, or locked cupboard or&#xD;
           cabinet. Access to the information will be limited to the trial staff and investigators&#xD;
           and relevant regulatory authorities (see above). Computer held data including the trial&#xD;
           database will be held securely and password protected. All data will be stored on a&#xD;
           secure dedicated web server. Access will be restricted by user identifiers and passwords&#xD;
           (encrypted using a one way encryption method).&#xD;
&#xD;
           For online consent and questionnaires, an online survey tool (e.g. Online Surveys) will&#xD;
           be used, which complies fully with the General Data Protection Regulation. The&#xD;
           investigators will set up an account dedicated for the AT-SPMS study (only the research&#xD;
           team members will have access to this account). All online responses will be collected&#xD;
           over encrypted SSL connections and stored on the password-protected AT-SPMS online&#xD;
           survey account. The account will be checked by the research team on a weekly basis to&#xD;
           export the collected online data to a secure dedicated web server (Access will be&#xD;
           restricted by user identifiers and passwords). Once the online data (i.e. stored on the&#xD;
           online survey account) is exported to this secure dedicated web server, it will be&#xD;
           permanently deleted from the online survey account. Automatic IP collection option would&#xD;
           be turned off to maintain the participants anonymity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Information about the trial in the participant's medical records / hospital notes will&#xD;
           be treated confidentially in the same way as all other confidential medical information.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Electronic data will be backed up every 24 hours to both local and remote media in&#xD;
           encrypted format.&#xD;
