  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for women in menopause with moderate to severe hot flashes. Menopause, a normal&#xD;
      part of aging, is the time of a woman's last period. Hot flashes can interrupt a woman's&#xD;
      daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatments are fezolinetant (1 tablet) once a day or placebo (1 tablet) once a day.&#xD;
      (Placebo is a dummy treatment that looks like medicine but does not have any medicine in it.)&#xD;
      The study will compare fezolinetant and placebo after 4 and 12 weeks of dosing. The study&#xD;
      will see if fezolinetant reduces the number of hot flashes. And the study will see if&#xD;
      fezolinetant reduces the severity of the hot flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the study will receive an electronic handheld device at the first study visit. (It&#xD;
      is similar to a smart phone.) Each day of the study, study participants will use this to&#xD;
      record their hot flashes. Their record for the 10 days before the start of study treatment&#xD;
      will be checked. They can remain in the study if their record shows 7 or 8 moderate to severe&#xD;
      hot flashes per day (50 or more per week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, they will be picked for 1 of the 2 study treatments (fezolinetant or placebo) by chance&#xD;
      alone. It is like flipping a coin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will take study treatment for 24 weeks. The first 12 weeks of study&#xD;
      treatment are &quot;double-blinded.&quot; That means that the study participants and the study doctors&#xD;
      do not know who takes which of the study treatments (fezolinetant or placebo) during that&#xD;
      time. The last 12 weeks of study treatment are &quot;noncontrolled.&quot; That means that each study&#xD;
      participant and the study doctors know which study treatment that study participant takes&#xD;
      during that time. Women who take fezolinetant during the first 12 weeks will continue to take&#xD;
      fezolinetant. Women who take placebo during the first 12 weeks will start taking&#xD;
      fezolinetant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 20 and 24, the study participants will go to the hospital or&#xD;
      clinic for a check-up. They will be asked about medications, side effects and how they feel.&#xD;
      Other checks will include physical exam and vital signs (heart rate, temperature and blood&#xD;
      pressure). Blood and urine will be collected for laboratory tests. Study participants will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires that are about how hot flashes affect their daily life. Study&#xD;
      participants who still have their uterus will have the following 2 tests done at the first&#xD;
      and last study visits if they meet the criteria. One of the 2 tests is endometrial biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This test involves removing a small amount of tissue from the inside lining of the uterus.&#xD;
      The tissue is then checked under a microscope. The other test is transvaginal ultrasound.&#xD;
      This test uses sound waves to create pictures of the organs in the pelvis. The sound waves&#xD;
      are transmitted by a probe (transducer), which is placed inside the vagina. Study&#xD;
      participants may have a screening mammogram done at the first and/or last study visit. A&#xD;
      mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breasts used to screen for breast cancer. Study&#xD;
      participants who did not have this test done in the last 12 months will have it done at the&#xD;
      first study visit. They will have it done at the last study visit if they are due for their&#xD;
      screening mammogram and their own doctor agrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last check-up at the hospital or clinic will be 3 weeks after the last dose of study&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

             cause other than fatty liver is diagnosed. Patients with Gilbert's syndrome with&#xD;
             elevated total bilirubin may be enrolled as long as hemolysis is ruled out (i.e.&#xD;
             direct bilirubin, hemoglobin and reticulocytes are normal).&#xD;
