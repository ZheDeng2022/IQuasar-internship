    <textblock>
      Postprandial hyperglycemia is a hallmark feature of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D), and&#xD;
      persistent elevated glycemic level has shown to be strongly associated with oxidative stress,&#xD;
      and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In Malaysia, the glycemic control is poor&#xD;
      and patients with T2D commonly experiencing persistent postprandial hyperglycemia (12.7&#xD;
      mmol/L). A low glycemic index (GI) meal has been reported to reduce postprandial glycemia and&#xD;
      insulin concentration in patients with T2D. Metabolomics technique can be used to identify&#xD;
      comprehensive metabolites in response to different diet. Till date, local scientific data&#xD;
      documented on the role and interaction between diet and metabolites for the Malaysian&#xD;
      patients with T2D is unknown. This study is to determine the postprandial metabolomic effect&#xD;
      of low and high GI meals in patients with T2D using the NMR-based metabolomics approach.&#xD;
      Then, patients with T2D will be assigned for 14 days of chronic feeding trial intervention.&#xD;
      This study will help to establish local baseline data and understand the impact of&#xD;
      meal-patterns on metabolic and metabolite at postprandial responses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite targeting to optimize fasting blood glucose and lowering HbA1c level, postprandial&#xD;
      hyperglycemia needs to be highlighted in the management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D).&#xD;
      Postprandial hyperglycemia is the rapid and significant rise in blood glucose level above 7.8&#xD;
      mmol/L 2 hour after meal ingestion. It is strongly associated with oxidative stress and a&#xD;
      risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Malaysia, the glycemic control is poor, and patients with T2D commonly experiencing&#xD;
      persistent hyperglycemia (12.7 mmol/L), which is the highest concentration in South East Asia&#xD;
      region. Nonetheless, a low glycemic index (GI) meal has been reported to reduce postprandial&#xD;
      glycemia and insulin concentration in patients with T2D but the metabolite responsiveness&#xD;
      following low GI meal is not studied yet. The study of the postprandial state is imperative&#xD;
      as it reveals multiple aspects of metabolic health that would not be apparent from solely&#xD;
      studying the fasting parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the objective of this study is to determine the postprandial metabolomic effects of&#xD;
      low and high GI meals in patients with T2D using the NMR-based metabolomics approach. Then,&#xD;
      the postprandial metabolic response and metabolomic profiles before and after the 14 days&#xD;
      chronic feeding trial intervention will be determined and compared. The calculated sample&#xD;
      size was 24 patients with T2D and 24 healthy individuals. The study design for meal challenge&#xD;
      test (MCT) is a single-blinded, randomized crossover trial with 1-week washout period;&#xD;
      whereas a case-control design will be used to compare metabolomic profiles of patients with&#xD;
      T2D and healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MCT model is designed to be high GI (63) and low GI (46) with similar caloric value.&#xD;
      During the test day, participants are required to consume the meal within 15 minutes and the&#xD;
      blood sample will be taken at the following time points: 0min (fasting), 30, 60, 120, 180 and&#xD;
      240 min. Meanwhile, the urine sample will also be collected at 0, 60 and 240 min accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood sample will be analyzed for blood glucose, insulin, GLP-1, and metabolites; while&#xD;
      the urine sample will be analyzed for metabolites. The findings of this study are able to&#xD;
      provide fundamental data on metabolic responsiveness of T2D patients following specific&#xD;
      meal-plan tailored to Malaysian meal pattern using NMR-based metabolomics approach. Besides,&#xD;
      this study is able to establish a local baseline data of postprandial metabolite profiles of&#xD;
      patients with T2D following a specific meal plan. At the same time, this study contributes&#xD;
      insight to improve diabetes meal-plan that is friendly to postprandial metabolic&#xD;
      perturbations.&#xD;

    <description>T2D patients will undergo a 14-day chronic feeding trial intervention where the strategies to lower postprandial hyperglycemia will be educated. For example, to control portion of carbohydrate, incorporate low GI food and diabetes-specific formula, promote physical activity and practice consistent meal timing. After that, patients will undergo MCT again to evaluate the difference before and after the intervention.</description>
