    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well durvalumab and epacadostat work in treating patients&#xD;
      with Epstein-Barr virus positive nasopharyngeal cancer that cannot be removed by surgery&#xD;
      (unresectable), has come back (recurrent), or has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (metastatic). Epacadostat blocks the enzyme, IDO1, from working. Blocking this enzyme may&#xD;
      allow for a stronger immune response against cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body?s immune system attack the cancer, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving durvalumab and&#xD;
      epacadostat may work better in treating patients with nasopharyngeal cancer compared to&#xD;
      durvalumab alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine whether adding an IDO inhibitor to PD-L1 antibody therapy improves the&#xD;
      probability of remission in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine whether adding an IDO inhibitor to PD-L1 antibody therapy improves long-term&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine whether the combination of durvalumab and epacadostat in recurrent and&#xD;
      metastatic NPC patients is safe and well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Identify potential associations between pre-treatment and on-treatment regulatory and&#xD;
      effector immune cell populations and clinical outcomes in NPC patients treated with&#xD;
      durvalumab and epacadostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Characterize the oral and fecal microbiome in responding and non-responding patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and epacadostat orally&#xD;
      (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 12 months in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression who are&#xD;
      benefiting from treatment in the opinion of the principal investigator may continue&#xD;
      durvalumab and epacadostat for up to an additional 12 months from the initiation (or&#xD;
      re-initiation) of treatment on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until start of a&#xD;
      new anti-cancer treatment, until 30 days after documented disease progression, until death,&#xD;
      or until 36 months from the initiation of treatment on study, whichever comes first.&#xD;

             addition, PD-1 antibodies have been proven to be safe in patients with active&#xD;
             hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (e. g. KEYNOTE 224). However, patients with&#xD;

             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase&#xD;
             risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving systemic steroid therapy for a chronic inflammatory condition.&#xD;

          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following:&#xD;
             measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin&#xD;
             (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally&#xD;
             killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g.,&#xD;
             FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days (use 28 days if&#xD;
             combining durvalumab with a novel agent) before the first dose of durvalumab, with the&#xD;
             exceptions of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids at&#xD;
             physiological doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone, or an equivalent&#xD;
             corticosteroid. The following are exceptions to this criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra&#xD;
                  articular injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed &lt;&lt;10 mg/day&gt;&gt; of&#xD;
                  prednisone or its equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., computed&#xD;
                  tomography [CT] scan premedication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1.0 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &lt; 75 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL or &lt; 5.6 mmol/L (transfusion is acceptable to meet this criterion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &gt;= 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) OR measured or&#xD;
             calculated creatinine clearance (glomerular filtration rate can also be used in place&#xD;
             of creatinine or creatinine clearance (CrCl)) &lt; 50 mg/min for subjects with creatinine&#xD;
             levels &gt; 1.5 x institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST or ALT &gt; 2.5 x institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Subjects with 1) bone metastases and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) &lt;&#xD;
                  2.5 x ULN may enroll if the alkaline phosphatase is &lt; 5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin above 1.5 x the institutional ULN AND conjugated bilirubin &gt;= 2.0 x&#xD;
             ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) &gt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) &gt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
