      This study evaluates a fenretinide phospholipid suspension for the treatment of T-cell&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fenretinide has been shown to be a relatively safe and effective anticancer therapy; however,&#xD;
      dose limiting toxicities due to the excipients used in previous formulations has impeded its&#xD;
      therapeutic utility. The product formulation in the current study (ST-001) is a phospholipid&#xD;
      suspension of nanoparticle sized fenretinide. The current study is a Phase 1 trial in&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory (R/R) T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in order to determine the safety&#xD;
      profile, pharmacology, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ST-001 nanoFenretinide. Targeted&#xD;
      T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (T-Cell NHL) indications include: (1) Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      (CTCL) including mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary Syndrome (SS); (2) non-cutaneous T-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (non-CTCL) subtypes: angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), peripheral T-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (PTCL) not otherwise specified (NOS); and, follicular T-cell lymphoma (FTCL) as&#xD;
      defined in the 2016 revision of the WHO classification of lymphoid malignancies.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI CTCAE v4.0 will be determined. All patients who receive any dose of ST-001 will be evaluable for toxicity. The incidence rates of adverse events (AEs) will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term, and by severity. All AEs with corresponding attributes will be displayed in a by-patient listing. The investigator at each site will determine the causal relationship between study medication and AEs. Subsets of AEs to be summarized include Severe Adverse Events (SAEs), suspected treatment-related AEs, and AEs that resulted in withdrawal of treatment or death.</description>

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Any patient who has at least one measurable disease site and has received at least on full cycle (5-day infusion) of ST-001 is eligible for response-to-treatment evaluation. The frequency and proportion of subjects with CR or PR will be calculated with a 95% Clopper Pearson confidence interval. CR + PR will constitute the overall response rate (ORR). The Global Response Scale (GRS) will be used to determine response of CTCL patients to ST-001. The GRS incorporates all components of the TNMB system (skin, lymph nodes, viscera, and blood). The International Working Group (IWG) Criteria for Response Assessment will be used to determine response in non-CTCL T-NHL patients.</description>

    <description>Pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of fenretinide Cp X t curves, Cp(plateau), and half-life (t1/2) as well as calculated parameters of Clearance and Volume of Distribution will be conducted at each dose level when all of its planned first cycle treatments have been completed. PK analysis will use descriptive statistics to characterize the range, median, and mean of calculated values of fenretinide clearance, volume of distribution, and distribution and elimination phase half-lives across all evaluable patients using individual patient C X t data. The relationship between dose and CpMAX and/or AUC will be examined as will their relationship to grade of toxicity.</description>

    <description>The pharmcodynamic (PD) effect of ST-001 will be evaluated in tissue biopsies taken from tumorous skin lesions of CTCL patients. CTL and NK cell activation will be measured by expression of granzyme A and B, perforin, and NKG2D using immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of tissue biopsies. In addition, CTLs and NK cell tumor infiltration will be evaluated using CD8 and CD56 IHC staining, respectively. Biomarker analysis will use each patient's baseline (pre-treatment) values as the Control value and normalize PD changes as % change from baseline. In addition, the baseline PD biomarker values across all evaluable patients will be characterized as a distribution, and the on-treatment PD responses analyzed for values that are statistical outliers from the baseline distribution of values.</description>

             response) to most recent therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relapsed disease is defined as recurrent disease after prior therapy that does not&#xD;
             qualify as refractory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For primary cutaneous lymphomas, stage IB, II, III and IV according to the TNMB system&#xD;
             are eligible. For primary nodal lymphomas, patients with stages II-IV according to the&#xD;
             Ann Arbor staging system are eligible.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of ST-001 nanoFenretinide on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason and because of the teratogenic effects of retinoids, women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, as well as for 4 months after completion of ST-001 administration.&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to enrollment in the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4&#xD;
             months after completion of ST-001administration.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known or history of central nervous system (CNS) disease are excluded&#xD;
             from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because of concerns&#xD;
             regarding toxicity attribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions or sensitivity to retinoids or to any excipients of&#xD;
             ST-001.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who require concurrent treatment with drugs that are strong CYP3A inducers&#xD;
             are excluded from the trial. Patients who have been treated previously with strong&#xD;
             CYP3A inducers may enroll in the trial and receive their first dose of ST-001 only&#xD;
             after four weeks have elapsed since the last dose of the CYP3A inducer. Strong&#xD;
             inducers of human CYP3A include barbiturates, bosentan, carbamazepine, efavirenz,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who require concurrent treatment with drugs that are strong to moderate CYP3A&#xD;
             inhibitors are excluded from the trial, and patients who have been treated previously&#xD;
             with strong CYP3A inhibitors may enroll in the trial and receive their first dose of&#xD;
             ST-001 only after four weeks have elapsed since the last dose of the CYP3A inhibitor.&#xD;
             This group of inhibitors includes certain antivirals (boceprevir, danoprevir,&#xD;
             paritaprevir; elvitegravir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir,&#xD;
             telaprevir, tipranavir; ombitasvir, dasabuvir), macrolide antibiotics (e.g.,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  If patients being treated with ST-001 require the use of drugs that are either strong&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A or strong to moderate inhibitors of CYP3A to treat a medical&#xD;
             condition, all treatment with ST-001 should be discontinued immediately and no further&#xD;
             treatment with ST-001 will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of acetaminophen, cephalosporins and other known hepatotoxic agents is allowed&#xD;
             with caution and close monitoring, due to known or potential interaction with ST-001&#xD;
             and potential increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Because the lists of these agents are&#xD;
             constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently updated list&#xD;
             such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/. Medical reference texts such as the&#xD;
             Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled&#xD;
             on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need&#xD;
             to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or&#xD;
             herbal product. Physician investigators should consult the websites listed above for&#xD;
             the most current information regarding drug interactions via CYP3A isozymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of vitamin A supplements is prohibited. Standard multivitamin doses are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NY heart classification III/IV),&#xD;
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, QTc interval &gt;450 milliseconds on&#xD;
             baseline triplicate ECG, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ST-001is a retinoid agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with ST-001, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             ST-001.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ST-001. Appropriate studies will&#xD;
             be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any active hepatitis infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of nyctalopia (night blindness), or hemeralopia (defective vision in a bright&#xD;
             light, 'day blindness') at enrollment, or any other retinal, ophthalmological&#xD;
             condition (eg: retinitis pigmentosa, choroidoretinitis and xerophthalmia), and&#xD;
             glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior fenretinide systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with T-cell lymphoma types other than those specified in section 3.1.1 are&#xD;
             not eligible even if they have cutaneous dissemination. Similarly, patients with any&#xD;
             type of natural killer (NK)- or B-cell lymphoma are not eligible regardless of sites&#xD;
             of involvement by disease.&#xD;
