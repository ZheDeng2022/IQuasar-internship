      treated with oral anticoagulants (OACs) in Colombia through observational, descriptive study&#xD;
      of a retrospective cohort of adult patients diagnosed with NVAF in selected Health&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study has the following primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess demographic and clinical characteristics of NVAF patients treated with oral&#xD;
           anticoagulants (OACs) in Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe treatment patterns (eg OAC usage,dose, concomitant medications, persistance)&#xD;
&#xD;
      And as exploratory analysis to descriptively assess the time to clinical events&#xD;
      (Effectiveness and Safety Outcomes) among patients persistent on OAC therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is an observational, descriptive study of a retrospective cohort of adult patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with NVAF in selected Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) of Colombia. These&#xD;
      patients will be identified from the drug claim database, whose index date of the study will&#xD;
      be the first prescription with any of the oral anticoagulants, that is, they are patients&#xD;
      with NVAF for the first time starting a therapy with any of the NOACs between January 1, 2013&#xD;
      and June 30, 2018 and follow up period will be among January 2013 to July 2019, to ensure&#xD;
      that the last patients can provide follow-up for one year. Patients will be required to have&#xD;
      an NVAF diagnosis before or on the index date and health plan for 6 months pre-index date&#xD;
      (baseline period). Colombia. The information will be used in the study comes exclusively form&#xD;
      secondary sources: claim databases and medical records.&#xD;

        The total population of patients treated with any oral anticoagulant between January 1,&#xD;
        2013 and June 30, 2018 will be analyzed in the claim database. This means that patients who&#xD;
        start warfarin and NOACs would be included within this period. Patients who initiate NOACs&#xD;
        within the established period and who have been exposed to warfarin before 2013 will also&#xD;
        be included.&#xD;
