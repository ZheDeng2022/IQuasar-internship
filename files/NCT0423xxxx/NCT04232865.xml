    <description>Stage 1 - Training:&#xD;
Up to 320 women in whom a complete procedure with the Biop System will be performed. Biopsies will be taken solely based on colposcopy examination. Enrolled participants will include at least 80 participants Histopathology identified with a high-grade lesion and at least 80 participants Histopathology identified as normal or with a low-grade lesion.&#xD;
Stage 2 - Validation:&#xD;
Up to 330 HIV negative women in whom a complete procedure with the Biop System will be performed.&#xD;
Validation stage will also include up to 165 HIV positive participants. All participants will be enrolled in up to 3 sites in South Africa.</description>
