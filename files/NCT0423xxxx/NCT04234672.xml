    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine ABA of TAK-831 following a single microdose&#xD;
      intravenous administration of 50 microgram (μg) (approximately 1 microcurie [μCi])&#xD;
      [14C]TAK-831 and a single oral administration of 500 milligram (mg) TAK-831 tablets in Period&#xD;
      1, and to assess the mass balance, characterize the PK of TAK-831 in plasma and urine, and&#xD;
      total radioactivity concentration equivalents in plasma and whole blood following a single&#xD;
      oral suspension dose of 500 mg (approximately 100 μCi) [14C]TAK-831 in Period 2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-831 (also known as luvadaxistat). The study&#xD;
      will determine ABA in Period 1, and the absorption, metabolism, excretion, and mass balance&#xD;
      of TAK-831 after single oral administration in Period 2 in healthy adult male participants,&#xD;
      by collecting plasma, urine, and feces samples for drug concentration analysis, and plasma,&#xD;
      whole blood, urine, and fecal samples for total radioactivity analysis and metabolic&#xD;
      profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 6 participants. The study is designed to consist of 2&#xD;
      periods: Period 1 (ABA study period) and Period 2 (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and&#xD;
      elimination [ADME] study period). In Period 1 (ABA study period), all participants will&#xD;
      receive a single unlabelled oral dose of TAK-831 as tablet and a microdose intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of 50 μg (approximately 1 μCi) [14C]TAK-831, followed by a washout period of 8 days&#xD;
      before the dose in Period 2. In Period 2 (ADME study period), all participants will receive a&#xD;
      single dose of 500 mg (approximately 100 μCi) [14C]TAK-831 as an oral suspension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this study is approximately 65 days including screening period. Participants&#xD;
      will be contacted approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an AE with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an AE with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
