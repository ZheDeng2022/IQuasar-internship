      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have documented differences in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a once daily&#xD;
      FK506 formulation (Advagraf) based on patient ethnicity. These findings may be of particular&#xD;
      relevance to the First Nations population who constitute a large and increasing segment of&#xD;
      the liver transplant population in Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to determine whether PK differences exist for Advagraf in&#xD;
      First Nations compared to Caucasian liver transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Document and compare PK determinations for Advagraf in First Nations and Caucasian&#xD;
           patients with stable liver transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Document and compare CYP3A gene expression profiles in the two ethnic populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  single-centre, open-label&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  consecutive enrollment (N=8/group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  self-identified adult First Nations and Caucasian ethnic cohorts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  7 day steady state conversion (mg/mg/day) from twice to once daily FK506 formulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  timed blood samples at 0, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours post medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PK determinations:concentration at zero time (C0), time to maximum concentration&#xD;
           (Tmax),Area Under the Curve (AUC 0-24), apparent oral clearance (CLoral) and maximum&#xD;
           concentration (Cmax)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whole blood FK506 levels will be measured by UPLC tandem mass spectroscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CYP3A allele analyses will be performed by Dr. Richard Kim, University of Western&#xD;
           Ontario&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will serve to determine whether present guidelines for conversion&#xD;
      of twice to once daily FK506 formulations need be modified for First Nations liver transplant&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Immunosuppressive regimens typically include an immune modulator (e.g.&#xD;
      azathioprine, mycophenolatemofetil or mycophenolate sodium), a steroid and a calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitor, either Cyclosporine or FK506. FK506 (C44H69NO12; see Figure 1) which is isolated&#xD;
      from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces tsukubaesis2,3is a 23-membered macrolide lactone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is highly effective in preventing rejection in liver, kidney, heart, bone marrow,&#xD;
      pancreas, lung and small bowel recipients and for therapy of certain autoimmune diseases4.&#xD;
      Previous studies have documented that ethnic differences exist between the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      properties of FK506 given orally5-7. For example, Mancinelli et al reported that African-&#xD;
      American (AA) transplant patients require higher FK506 dosages (mg/kg) than Asians (Chinese&#xD;
      or Japanese) and Caucasians7. Moreover, bioavailability was significantly reduced (9.9%&#xD;
      versus 19%) and Cmax levels were lower in AA compared to Caucasians. In a similar study,&#xD;
      researchers in the DeKAF group6documented clinical and recipient genetic correlates of&#xD;
      dose-normalized FK506 troughs in the first 6 months post transplant using a customized&#xD;
      single-nucleotide polymorphism chip with 2,722 variants in a large, ethnically diverse (144&#xD;
      AA and 551 non-AA) adult kidney transplant population through a seven-centre consortium. In&#xD;
      their study, AAs had consistently lower median (interquartile range) troughs than non-AAs,&#xD;
      6.2 (4.4-8.4) ng/mL vs 8.3 (6.4-10.4) ng/mL (P&lt;0.0001), despite 60% higher daily doses, 8&#xD;
      (5-10) mg vs 5 (4-7) mg (P&lt;0.0001). In addition, the median FK506 trough concentration at&#xD;
      week 1 post-transplant was particularly low in AAs (2.1 [1.2-3.5] ng/mL) compared with&#xD;
      non-AAs (5.0 [3.1-8.2] ng/mL) (P&lt;0.0001), despite similar initial doses6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differences described above may result from racial differences in intestinal CYP3A or&#xD;
      Pglycoprotein activity, since no ethnic differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      FK506 when administrated intravenously7.CYP3A5*1 is a genotype associated with low FK506&#xD;
      concentrations6. However, although its effect is important, it incompletely explains the&#xD;
      variability in FK506 concentrations and has a relatively low minor allele frequency in whites&#xD;
      relative to AAs8,11. Nonadherence to immunosuppressive treatment is another factor that&#xD;
      contributes to variable trough levels and potentially, adverse outcomes for various&#xD;
      transplant populations12. Advagraf is a FK506 formulation that has been demonstrated to lower&#xD;
      the risk of nonadherence by virtue of it being administrated once rather than twice daily5.&#xD;
      There are an estimated 1.14 million Aboriginal peoples (largely First Nations) living in&#xD;
      Canada with in excess of 80% residing in Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba and&#xD;
      Saskatchewan. Due to a high prevalence of; viral hepatitis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and&#xD;
      autoimmune chronic liver disease, First Nations peoples represent an important and increasing&#xD;
      percentage of the country's liver transplant population13. Clinical observations in the&#xD;
      setting of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity suggest significant differences exist in drug&#xD;
      metabolism between the First Nations and Caucasian populations (personal communication: G.Y.&#xD;
      Minuk). In addition, compliance with medications has been an issue in this cohort14. Thus,&#xD;
      the present study was designed to document and compare the relative bioavailability of a once&#xD;
      daily FK506 formulation (Advagraf) and CYP3A allele profiles in First Nations and Caucasian&#xD;
      patients with stable liver transplants. AIM The principal aim of this study is to document&#xD;
      and compare the oral pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus and CYP3A allele profiles in First&#xD;
      Nations and Caucasians with stable liver transplants. METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients will be derived from the Post-Liver Transplant Clinic at the Health Sciences&#xD;
      Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba. At present, approximately 175 patients are being followed in&#xD;
      the 6 December 18, 2013 clinic with 10-15% being of First Nations ethnicity. Patient&#xD;
      ethnicity will be based on selfidentification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First Nations or Caucasian subjects between the ages of 18 and 70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A minimum of 12 months from the transplant procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No acute rejection episode within the previous 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No evidence of pre-transplant liver disease recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stable Tacrolimus dosage during the previous 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with absorption problems or unable to take oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are on steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients unable or unwilling to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Study Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver and renal function, lipid and glucose levels and arterial blood pressure determinations&#xD;
      will be derived from the patients' last clinic visit. Liver function will have been&#xD;
      determined by the results of liver enzyme (ALT, AST, AP and GGT) and serum bilirubin, albumin&#xD;
      and INR values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal function will be evaluated using creatinine plasma levels and by using the estimated&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) derived from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease&#xD;
      (MDRD) equation with six variables. Patients will be defined as having renal dysfunction if&#xD;
      the MDRD is below 60 ml/min but not excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single-centre, open-label study conducted at the Health Sciences Centre and&#xD;
      University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, under the supervision of Drs. D. Peretz (Transplant&#xD;
      Hepatologist) and V. Perez-Alvarez (Liver Pharmacologist). Following written informed&#xD;
      consent, consecutively enrolled First Nations and Caucasian subjects (n=8/group) attending&#xD;
      the Liver Transplant Outpatient Clinic at the Health Sciences Centre will receive oral FK506&#xD;
      capsules (mg/mg conversion, i.e. 1 mg/d of the twice daily formulation: Prograph = 1 mg/d of&#xD;
      the once daily formulation: Advagraf) as a single daily dose for seven days until a steady&#xD;
      state is achieved. As food has been shown to potentially interfere with the absorption of&#xD;
      tacrolimus, patients will be NPO two hours prior to administration of the medication. On the&#xD;
      morning of day 8, patients will be seen at the John Buhler Research Centre to begin the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic study. Following establishment of venous access, a baseline blood sample will&#xD;
      be obtained. Patients will then receive Advagraf (between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m.) with 200 mL of&#xD;
      water (T=0). Further blood sampling will be obtained at times 1.5, 2, 4 , 6 and 24 hours. The&#xD;
      T=24 hour sample will include an additional 30 ml for subsequent CYP3A allele testing.&#xD;
      Breakfast will be scheduled at 10:00 a.m. and a standard lunch served at 1:00 p.m.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to return the following morning for the final 24 hour sample, after&#xD;
      which they will be discharged with instructions to resume Prograph at the previous dosage&#xD;
      (until funding for the once daily formulation is in place). Concomitant drugs will not be&#xD;
      altered during the pharmacokinetic study. The study will be approved and monitored by the&#xD;
      Research Ethics Board committee at the University of Manitoba and carried out according to&#xD;
      the declaration of Helsinki and its amendments following the principles of good clinical&#xD;
      practice. All study subjects will have provided signed informed consent, and will be free to&#xD;
      withdraw from the study at any time.&#xD;
