  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although hearing aids are the most common treatment for hearing loss, and have the potential&#xD;
      to help seniors stay active and productive, almost 50% of them who receive hearing aids&#xD;
      rarely if ever use them, a state of affairs sometimes referred to as &quot;the hearing aid in the&#xD;
      drawer&quot; syndrome. clEAR's customized auditory brain training has been shown to be effective&#xD;
      in improving adults' abilities to recognize speech, in reducing their perceptual effort&#xD;
      associated with listening with a hearing loss, and in increasing their confidence to engage&#xD;
      in everyday conversations. In the proposed research, we will determine whether older adults&#xD;
      who receive hearing aids for the first time report higher satisfaction with their new hearing&#xD;
      aids and have longer daily use time as a result of having completed clEAR's auditory brain&#xD;
      training program for new hearing aid users.&#xD;

      Auditory training as the potential to dramatically affect older persons' adjustment to a new&#xD;
      hearing aid and to maximize the benefits they receive from wearing one. In turn, by wearing&#xD;
      hearing aids, they experience easier and more successful communication patterns. They enhance&#xD;
      their ability to engage in everyday conversations and will be able to become more socially&#xD;
      involved with their family and friends. In this study we will try to determine the extent to&#xD;
      which web-based clEAR auditory brain training, with concomitant support from a clEAR in-house&#xD;
      audiologist, affects satisfaction with new hearing aids and increases daily use time. The&#xD;
      study will include thirty adults over the age of 60 years who have received hearing aids for&#xD;
      the first time. After an adjustment period, half will complete clEAR's auditory brain&#xD;
      training program right away and the other half will complete it after a delay period, and&#xD;
      both will complete a control condition. To establish the level of feasibility and clinical&#xD;
      utility. We will measure hearing aid satisfaction, benefit ratings, and hearing aid use time.&#xD;
