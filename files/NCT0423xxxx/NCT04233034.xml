  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized trial of youth aged 7-&lt;18 years with newly diagnosed stage 3 type 1 diabetes (T1D)&#xD;
      to assess the effect of both (1) near-normalization of glucose concentrations achieved&#xD;
      through use of a hybrid closed loop (HCL) system and (2) verapamil on preservation of β-cell&#xD;
      function 12 months after diagnosis. Participants with body weight ≥30 kg (Cohort A) will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned in a factorial design to (1) HCL plus intensive diabetes management or&#xD;
      usual care with no HCL and (2) verapamil or placebo. Participants with body weight &lt;30 kg&#xD;
      (Cohort B) will be randomly assigned 2:1 in a parallel group design to HCL plus intensive&#xD;
      diabetes management or to usual care with no HCL.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After informed consent is obtained, potential participants will be assessed for eligibility,&#xD;
      including eliciting medical history, physical examination, and laboratory testing (including&#xD;
      HbA1c, auto-antibody measurement [unless positive auto-antibody results already available],&#xD;
      and pregnancy test for females with childbearing potential).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who already have positive auto-antibodies can be randomized immediately. All&#xD;
      other participants will be scheduled for a randomization visit after the auto-antibody&#xD;
      results are available; positive auto-antibodies are required for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants with body weight ≥30 kg (Cohort A) will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      4 groups: HCL and placebo, HCL and verapamil, non-HCL and placebo or non-HCL and verapamil.&#xD;
      Eligible individuals with body weight &lt;30 kg (Cohort B) will be randomly assigned 2:1 to&#xD;
      either HCL or non-HCL. Randomization schedules will be separate for Cohort A and Cohort B and&#xD;
      will be stratified by site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to HCL will receive intensive diabetes management with frequent&#xD;
      contacts by study staff with the goal of near-normalization of glucose concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to non-HCL will receive a Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor (CGM)&#xD;
      and diabetes management will follow usual care by their personal diabetes health care&#xD;
      provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for 12 months from diagnosis, completing a 6 week visit timed&#xD;
      from randomization and 13, 26, 39, and 52 week visits timed from diagnosis. Participants will&#xD;
      have a MMTT performed, HbA1c measured, and blood drawn for mechanistic studies at&#xD;
      Randomization, 13, 26, 39 and 52 weeks. At all follow-up visits, a physical exam will be&#xD;
      performed, pregnancy testing performed (if indicated), insulin dose (units/kg/day) recorded,&#xD;
      and device data downloaded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will be made throughout the study by querying about episodes of severe&#xD;
      hypoglycemia and DKA, and overall health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants already enrolled in the study and using the Medtronic 670G 4.0 AHCL may&#xD;
      transition to the Medtronic 780G if desired. Contacts will be performed to review CareLink&#xD;
      data and check for adverse events and device deficiencies on days 1, 3 and 5 after transition&#xD;
      from 670G 4.0 AHCL to 780G.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the 780G system becoming commercially available, study participants using the&#xD;
      Medtronic system at 52 weeks will have the opportunity to continue using the 780G system at&#xD;
      home until the system is commercially available OR until the CLVer trial is complete (last&#xD;
      participant's 52-week visit), whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Procedures for Cohort A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug will be double blinded. Drug dose will be weight-dependent and will be escalated at 2-4&#xD;
      week intervals, up to a weight-dependent maximum if tolerated. Cohort A will have additional&#xD;
      safety visits 1 week after initiation of study drug and after each study drug dose increase,&#xD;
      to test blood pressure and pulse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local lab measurement of aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) and&#xD;
      creatinine will occur, and an EKG will be performed at Screening, 6, 26, and 52 weeks. Over&#xD;
      the course of the trial, study drug dose may be decreased or discontinued if side effects&#xD;
      occur.&#xD;
