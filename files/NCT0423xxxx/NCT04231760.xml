  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a lung disorder commonly caused by smoking,&#xD;
      which makes breathing more difficult. When COPD patients exercise, they are not efficient&#xD;
      breathers and this leads to serious breathing difficulties, which often causes these patients&#xD;
      to stop exercise at low intensities. Even though patients with a mild form of COPD have&#xD;
      relatively well preserved lung function, they still have inefficient breathing during&#xD;
      exercise. The investigators think that these individuals have problems exchanging fresh gas&#xD;
      (i.e., oxygen) into the blood stream because of poor lung blood vessel function. The&#xD;
      investigators will test whether inhaled medications, specifically nitric oxide, can improve&#xD;
      lung blood vessel function and decrease breathing difficulties during exercise. With this&#xD;
      research, the investigators will understand more about breathing efficiency and lung blood&#xD;
      vessel function in individuals with mild COPD, and find out whether improving lung blood&#xD;
      vessel function helps COPD patients breathe easier and exercise longer. Understanding the&#xD;
      reasons behind the feeling of difficult breathing may lead to more effective therapy and&#xD;
      improved quality of life in COPD patients.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a respiratory disorder typically caused by&#xD;
      smoking and is characterized by airway obstruction. Exertional dyspnea (perceived&#xD;
      breathlessness) is a hallmark of COPD regardless of severity and is the primary reason for&#xD;
      exercise intolerance even in patients with mild COPD. Dyspnea in COPD has been shown to&#xD;
      profoundly reduce patient quality of life, physical activity, and impair patients' ability to&#xD;
      complete day-to-day tasks. Previous work in mild COPD has demonstrated that exertional&#xD;
      dyspnea is the result of increased work of breathing during exercise, and that this increased&#xD;
      work of breathing comes from: 1) an exaggerated ventilatory response to exercise (i.e.&#xD;
      increased minute ventilation relative to carbon dioxide production, V̇E/V̇CO2), and 2)&#xD;
      airflow limitation (i.e. expiratory flow limitation and resulting dynamic hyperinflation). A&#xD;
      great deal of work has focused on improving airflow limitation in COPD; however, very little&#xD;
      has been done to understand and treat the exaggerated ventilatory response to exercise in&#xD;
      COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several previous studies in mild COPD have consistently shown an elevated ventilatory&#xD;
      response (i.e. greater V̇E/V̇CO2) during exercise. The elevated V̇E/V̇CO2 response to&#xD;
      exercise appears to be clinically important, as it independently predicts mortality in COPD.&#xD;
      This increased V̇E/V̇CO2 in mild COPD appears to be secondary to increased deadspace&#xD;
      ventilation (i.e. sections of the lung with ventilation, but no perfusion), and this&#xD;
      increased deadspace ventilation results in a compensatory increase in total minute&#xD;
      ventilation (i.e. increased V̇E/V̇CO2) to maintain effective alveolar ventilation and&#xD;
      arterial blood gas homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying mechanism(s) for the increased deadspace ventilation and V̇E/V̇CO2 during&#xD;
      exercise in mild COPD is currently unclear; however, pulmonary microvascular abnormalities&#xD;
      and hypoperfusion of pulmonary capillaries are potential pathophysiologic mechanisms.&#xD;
      Downregulation of NO bioavailability, secondary to persistently reduced endothelial NO&#xD;
      synthase (eNOS), contributes to pulmonary vascular endothelial dysfunction and the&#xD;
      development of both emphysema and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in COPD. Inhaled&#xD;
      nitric oxide (iNO) is used to treat disorders of the pulmonary vasculature such as forms of&#xD;
      PAH. By increasing NO bioavailability, pulmonary vascular function is improved. Previous work&#xD;
      in PAH patients has shown that typical clinical doses (20-40 parts per million (ppm)) of iNO&#xD;
      can reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and increase exercise capacity (V̇O2peak). Despite&#xD;
      emerging evidence that COPD is associated with pulmonary vascular dysfunction, there is&#xD;
      limited research investigating iNO as a therapeutic intervention in COPD. The investigators&#xD;
      recently completed a randomized double-blinded controlled trial examining the effectiveness&#xD;
      of 40 ppm iNO on V̇O2peak in mild COPD. As compared to placebo (inhaled room air), iNO&#xD;
      improved V̇O2peak and dyspnea in COPD secondary to a reduction in ventilatory inefficiency&#xD;
      (V̇E/V̇CO2), suggesting that vascular dysfunction is an important contributor to ventilation,&#xD;
      dyspnea and exercise intolerance in mild COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reduction in V̇E/V̇CO2 during exercise with iNO would suggest that iNO increases&#xD;
      pulmonary microvascular perfusion, leading to improved V̇A/Q̇ matching, reduced deadspace&#xD;
      ventilation and therefore reduced ventilation for a given metabolic demand. However, this&#xD;
      needs to be demonstrated experimentally. The gold standard for evaluation of V̇A/Q̇ matching&#xD;
      is the multiple inert gas elimination technique (MIGET), as this technique is able to&#xD;
      quantify V̇A/Q̇ matching by the relative distribution of ventilation (log SDV) and perfusion&#xD;
      (log SDQ)27. Further, MIGET allows for quantification of pure deadspace (sections of&#xD;
      ventilation with no perfusion) as compared to high V̇A/Q̇ regions of the lung (i.e.&#xD;
      ventilation with low relative perfusion). Should iNO reduce deadspace and improve V̇A/Q̇,&#xD;
      this would clearly establish that vascular dysfunction (and not vascular destruction)&#xD;
      contributes to V̇A/Q̇ mismatch in mild COPD, and that the reduction in V̇E/V̇CO2 and&#xD;
      improvement in exercise capacity with iNO is explained by improved V̇A/Q̇ matching. Further,&#xD;
      this finding would help identify a vascular target to improve dyspnea, exercise tolerance,&#xD;
      and by extension quality of life in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PURPOSE AND DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To determine the effect of iNO on ventilatory demand and V̇A/Q̇ matching during&#xD;
      exercise in individuals with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Inhaled NO will reduce ventilatory demand during exercise, secondary to improved&#xD;
      V̇A/Q̇ matching during exercise in individuals with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized double-blind cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol: Four sessions will be completed over a 4-week period in the following order:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1): Participant enrollment, medical history, standard pulmonary function and&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Day 2): Resting cardiac ultrasound. Day 3):&#xD;
      Participants will complete two separate experimental conditions breathing either room air&#xD;
      (placebo, 21% O2, 79% N2) or iNO (room air with 40 ppm NO). The order of condition will be&#xD;
      randomized using a concealed randomized methodology, and the participant will breathe through&#xD;
      the identical apparatus throughout both conditions. Within each condition, data will be&#xD;
      gathered at 3 stages: 1) in the resting upright position, 2) during exercise at 30% of&#xD;
      V̇O2peak, and 2) at the exercise intensity corresponding to their nadir V̇E/V̇CO2 (workload&#xD;
      determined during CPET, and typically ~60% V̇O2peak). All physiological measurements will be&#xD;
      completed at each stage. A 15 minute break between each condition will be given to allow for&#xD;
      recovery and washout of NO. Day 4): Participants will repeat the exercise protocol as&#xD;
      described in Day 3, however, only MIGET data will obtained while operating lung volume data&#xD;
      will not be gathered so as to ensure high-quality MIGET data. Each visit will take&#xD;
      approximately 3 hours. The total time duration for each participant will be approximately 12&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, participants will complete the informed consent procedure and be screened for&#xD;
      exercise using a medical history questionnaire. They will undergo lung function, resting&#xD;
      echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise testing on the same day. The participants will&#xD;
      be spending approximately three hours in the laboratory on this testing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day2, the participant will lie in a semi-supine and be rested for 5 minutes. There cardiac&#xD;
      function and pulmonary arterial systolic pressure will then be measured using&#xD;
      echocardiography. Measurements will be made while the participants breathing breathe medical&#xD;
      grade air (room air) or room air titrated with 40 parts per million of nitric oxide&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days 3 &amp; 4 (one day per week in 2 consecutive weeks), the participants will breathe&#xD;
      medical grade air (room air) or room air titrated with 40 parts per million of nitric oxide&#xD;
      and have their blood flow/cardiac output, arterial blood gas and expired gas evaluated during&#xD;
      sub-maximal exercise. The participants will complete both conditions (room air &amp; nitric&#xD;
      oxide) on each day, in random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 3, the participant will lie supine and be rested for 5 minutes. Their resting blood&#xD;
      pressure will be determined using manual auscultation. Resting cardiac output will be&#xD;
      evaluated using noninvasive impedance cardiography and oxygen saturation estimated with pulse&#xD;
      oximetry. Ventilation will be measured from expired gas analysis. Following these&#xD;
      measurements, the participant will begin to breathe medical grade room air. Following a 20&#xD;
      minute wash-in period, ventilation, cardiac output and oxygen saturation recordings will be&#xD;
      repeated. Participants will then exercise on a cycle ergometer while continuing to breathe&#xD;
      the medical grade room air and all physiological measurements will be repeated. After a short&#xD;
      break (minimum 15 minutes), the 20-minute wash in and exercise bout will be repeated in the&#xD;
      nitric oxide condition. The participants will be spending approximately three hours in the&#xD;
      laboratory on this testing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 4 will be identical to day 3 except, however, arterial blood gas will also be sampled at&#xD;
      rest and during exercise. Further, a venous catheter will be inserted into the ante-cubital&#xD;
      vein and a solution containing 6 inert gases will be infused to allow assessment of&#xD;
      ventilation-perfusion matching using the multiple inert gas elimination technique (MIGET).&#xD;
      The arterial and venous catheter will be inserted by either a certified cardiologist or&#xD;
      respirologist. Further details regarding catheterization and MIGET are detailed below in the&#xD;
      outcomes section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled Nitric Oxide Intervention: Inhaled NO is a selective pulmonary vasodilator and has&#xD;
      been shown to improve blood flow to well-ventilated lung areas (i.e. improve V̇A/Q̇ matching)&#xD;
      in conditions with elevated vascular tone. Inhaled NO has been previously shown to lower&#xD;
      pulmonary artery pressure during exercise in severe COPD patients, while not affecting&#xD;
      systemic blood pressure. It is important to note that a selective pulmonary vasodilator will&#xD;
      be used instead of an intravenously infused vasodilator (e.g. prostacyclin) to avoid systemic&#xD;
      vasodilation, severe arterial hypotension and syncope. Consistent with previous work, a&#xD;
      standard 40 ppm dose of inhaled NO will be administered using a non-rebreathing circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and Interpretation: Unpaired t-analysis will be used to compare&#xD;
      demographics between the COPD group and the controls. A mixed effects linear regression model&#xD;
      will be used to evaluate changes in V̇A/Q̇ inequality, specifically the variability in&#xD;
      perfusion (log SDQ, primary outcome), with the intervention. Fixed effects will be&#xD;
      intervention (placebo vs. iNO), workload (rest, 30% V̇O2peak, power output at nadir&#xD;
      V̇E/V̇CO2), period (i.e. randomization order) and random effects will represent participants&#xD;
      and intervention order. Sex will also be included in the model as well as interactions.&#xD;
      Similar models will be developed for each secondary outcome (log SDV, deadspace ventilation,&#xD;
      V̇E/V̇CO2). Hypotheses and other aspects (e.g. carry-over effect) will be assessed by testing&#xD;
      various contrasts.&#xD;
