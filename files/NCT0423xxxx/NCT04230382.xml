      The aims of the study are to determine the prevalence of diabetes in subgroups of the&#xD;
      population with certain characteristics (age, gender, socioeconomic status, geographical area&#xD;
      of residence), to estimate the proportion of those patients with diabetes treated without&#xD;
      drugs, to estimate the proportion of the patients in which diabetes is not yet diagnosed, and&#xD;
      to develop a proposal and recommendations for the development, implementation and evaluation&#xD;
      of programs for the prevention and early diagnosis of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analysis of the prevalence of diabetes in population subgroups and an estimate of the&#xD;
      proportion of those patients who have non-drug treated diabetes will be drawn upon the data&#xD;
      from the National Health and Health System Survey 2019, run by National Institute of Public&#xD;
      Health. Methodologically it is a cross-sectional survey using a survey questionnaire based on&#xD;
      the European Health Interview Survey. A sample of 16,000 inhabitants is invited to&#xD;
      participate. The database contains sets of questions about health status, health markers and&#xD;
      health care, and contains all the information that the research project covers. All those&#xD;
      interviewees from the National Health and Health System Survey 2019 who are not aware to have&#xD;
      diabetes will be invited to the health examination survey. They will be invited to perform an&#xD;
      oral glucose tolerance test (once or twice, based on the results). In this way, diabetes can&#xD;
      be diagnosed in those individuals who already have diabetes, but have not yet been aware of&#xD;
      it. Secondary analyses of the data and the measurement of HbA1c from the sample of blood&#xD;
      taken at the same collection will also give the opportunity to assess for example, the&#xD;
      prevalence of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, their combinations, and&#xD;
      obtain more data on the clinical meaning of oral glucose tolerance test versus HbA1c in&#xD;
      diagnosing diabetes in Slovenian context. We estimate that approximately 1500-2000 people&#xD;
      will perform the health examination survey part.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      National Diabetes Program 2010-2020 is a strategic document of Slovenia aimed at reducing the&#xD;
      incidence of type 2 diabetes, preventing type 2 diabetes in people at highreducing the&#xD;
      incidence of type 2 diabetes, preventing type 2 diabetes in people at high risk, early&#xD;
      diagnosis of diabetes and reducing complications and diabetes mortality. Diabetes is one of&#xD;
      the most common reasons why the inhabitants of Slovenia visit a doctor, while extending life&#xD;
      expectancy and aging of the population will additionally increase these needs. In order to&#xD;
      evaluate the activities that are already being implemented and to guide further activities in&#xD;
      Slovenia, a high-quality analysis is needed to evaluate the prevalence of diabetes in people&#xD;
      with specific characteristics, the estimation of the proportion of patients who are treating&#xD;
      diabetes without drugs and the estimate of the proportion of those patients whose diabetes is&#xD;
      not yet detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of diabetes in certain population subgroups, in particular in relation to age,&#xD;
      gender, socioeconomic status and geographical area of residence, is important for assessing&#xD;
      the current burden of the disease and for predicting the needs in the future. These analyses&#xD;
      can lead to adaptation of measures in the health system and, depending on the needs&#xD;
      identified, also outside health system. A more accurate estimate of the proportion of&#xD;
      patients who are treating diabetes without drugs will enable a more accurate calculation of&#xD;
      the number of patients with diabetes in Slovenia. This will also improve the accuracy of&#xD;
      calculating the burden of the disease today and in the future. Above all, in order to be&#xD;
      accurate in predicting the burden in the future, a reliable estimate of the proportion of&#xD;
      patients who already have diabetes but who are not already aware of it and their&#xD;
      characteristics are important. Such an analysis is also a key feedback on the effectiveness&#xD;
      of existing prevention and early detection programs for diabetes and a basis for adjusting&#xD;
      measures in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the research project are therefore to determine the prevalence of diabetes in&#xD;
      subgroups of the population with certain characteristics (age, gender, socioeconomic status,&#xD;
      geographical area of residence), to estimate the proportion of those patients with diabetes&#xD;
      treated without drugs, to estimate the proportion of the patients in which diabetes is not&#xD;
      yet diagnosed, and to develop a proposal and recommendations for the development,&#xD;
      implementation and evaluation of programs for the prevention and early diagnosis of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analysis of the prevalence of diabetes in population subgroups and an estimate of the&#xD;
      proportion of those patients who have non-drug treated diabetes will be drawn upon the data&#xD;
      from the National Health and Health System Survey 2019, run by National Institute of Public&#xD;
      Health. Methodologically it is a cross-sectional survey using a survey questionnaire based on&#xD;
      the European Health Interview Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of 16,000 inhabitants was invited to participate. The database contains sets of&#xD;
      questions about health status, health markers and health care, and contains all the&#xD;
      information that the research project covers. Secondary analyses of the collected data will&#xD;
      also allow evaluation of some other characteristics of the population, such as, for example,&#xD;
      lifestyle characteristics, body weight, score by FINDRISC for the assessment of the risk of&#xD;
      diabetes, and considering that the survey is conducted for the third time, some of the trends&#xD;
      that are important for the analysis of future needs and proper planning of the activity in&#xD;
      the future can also be developed. In order to prepare a methodologically relevant assessment&#xD;
      of the proportion of patients with diabetes in Slovenia in whom diabetes is not yet&#xD;
      diagnosed, a cross-sectional survey will be carried out using a Health Examination Survey&#xD;
      approach. All those interviewees from the National Health and Health System Survey 2019 who&#xD;
      are not aware to have diabetes will be invited to the health examination survey. An oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test Will be performed (once or twice, based on the results). In this way,&#xD;
      diabetes can be diagnoses in those individuals who already have diabetes, but have not yet&#xD;
      been aware of it. Secondary analyses of the data and the measurement of HbA1c from the sample&#xD;
      of blood taken at the same collection will also give the opportunity to assess for example,&#xD;
      the prevalence of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, their combinations,&#xD;
      and obtain more data on the clinical meaning of oral glucose tolerance test versus HbA1c in&#xD;
      diagnosing diabetes in Slovenian context. It is estimated that approximately 1500-2000 people&#xD;
      will perform the health examination survey part. The research protocol was approved by the&#xD;
      Republic Medical Ethics Committee. The survey will be conducted in accordance with all&#xD;
      ethical standards that relates to the volunteers in such studies, including providing&#xD;
      feedback, what is the importance of the results for in such studies, including providing&#xD;
      feedback, what is the importance of the results for them personally, and will give them the&#xD;
      instructions for the use of healthcare system, if appropriate. Data and their identity will&#xD;
      also be protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2007 and 2014, the constellation of questions in national health and health system surveys&#xD;
      already gave an estimate of the prevalence of diabetes in specific population subgroups. The&#xD;
      study will, in addition to the cross-sectional descriptions, also provide a more robust&#xD;
      description of the trends. On the basis of these results, an assessment of the management of&#xD;
      the incidence of diabetes in individual population groups in the past can be made, as well as&#xD;
      recommendations for the development and implementation of appropriate activities in the&#xD;
      future, such as the further upgrading of health promotion centres, upgrading health care&#xD;
      activities carried out by family medicine, and in the preparation of targeted measures in&#xD;
      individual population groups, including through the involvement of partners outside health&#xD;
      care, and with approaches to reducing inequalities and other activities of the implementation&#xD;
      of National Diabetes Plan 2020- 2030.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of the proportion of people with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus and&#xD;
      their characteristics will be made for the first time in Slovenia. People with unrecognized&#xD;
      chronic illnesses, including type 2 diabetes, represent those individuals with the greatest&#xD;
      burden of the disease, both in health and, for example, in financial and psychosocial&#xD;
      aspects. Undertaking approaches to reducing the proportion of people with an unrecognized&#xD;
      chronic disease is therefore one of the greatest health and society challenges in the next&#xD;
      decade, as it is an indispensable measure to ensure the sustainability of the health system&#xD;
      and to ensure the well-being of society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final task of this research project is the development of a report that will include a&#xD;
      proposal and recommendations for the development, implementation and evaluation of programs&#xD;
      for the prevention and early diagnosis of diabetes, which will represent the so-called&#xD;
      evidence-informed policy making, risk, early diagnosis of diabetes and reducing complications&#xD;
      and diabetes mortality.&#xD;
