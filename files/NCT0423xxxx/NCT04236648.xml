    <textblock>
      This is a pilot prospective cohort study to assess the efficacy of minimally-invasive&#xD;
      non-surgical periodontal therapy (MINST) for the treatment of teeth with unfavourable&#xD;
      periodontal prognosis. 20 patients who have teeth with unfavourable periodontal prognosis&#xD;
      (due to bone loss to the apex or furcation involvement grade II C) will receive&#xD;
      minimally-invasive non-surgical treatment (MINST) and will be reassessed up to 12 months&#xD;
      after treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty patients with advanced periodontitis who have teeth with unfavourable periodontal&#xD;
      prognosis (due to bone loss to the apex or furcation involvement grade II C) will be entered&#xD;
      in this study, conducted at Guy's Hospital in London, UK. The study has a prospective cohort&#xD;
      design, so following baseline assessment, all patients will receive minimally-invasive&#xD;
      non-surgical treatment (MINST). A total of 10 visits are planned over a 12-13 months period&#xD;
      including initial treatment (MINST) and follow-up appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are radiographic defect depth (for teeth with bone loss to the apex,&#xD;
      n=10) and furcation involvement (for teeth with furcation involvement degree II C, n=10).&#xD;
      Paired t-test will be used to detect significant changes between baseline and 12 months for&#xD;
      the primary outcomes using the patient as unit of analysis. Additional outcomes will be&#xD;
      probing pocket depths (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), levels of inflammatory markers&#xD;
      and growth factors in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and saliva and bacterial detection in&#xD;
      periodontal pockets&#xD;
