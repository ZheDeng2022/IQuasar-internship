  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex condition with various&#xD;
      causes that is not yet fully understood. Most significantly there is no single method of&#xD;
      diagnosing or treating the condition. Recently a novel non-invasive diagnostic criterion to&#xD;
      predict the likelihood of HFpEF was proposed called H2FPEF. The main limitation of this study&#xD;
      was the use of a single centre population from the Mayo clinic in Rochester, US. Another&#xD;
      limitation is that the H2FPEF diagnostic criterion consists of common and often co-existing&#xD;
      conditions which could as a result overestimate HFpEF probability. The aim of the&#xD;
      investigators is to retrospectively test the H2FPEF criteria on the population at Queen&#xD;
      Alexandra Hospital (QAH) in Portsmouth, which is of a lower socio-economic status and greater&#xD;
      ethnic diversity. Implications of the proposed project if H2FPEF is proved to be&#xD;
      generalizable to the study population is that it can be used within the Trust and rolled out&#xD;
      to others. This would allow diagnosis to be made quicker and more cost effectively using&#xD;
      echocardiography and without the need for invasive cardiac catheterisation. On the other hand&#xD;
      if H2FPEF is found not to be applicable to the population then further research would be&#xD;
      required to find the ideal diagnostic tool.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HFpEF was previously characterised as 'diastolic dysfunction' but this terminology was&#xD;
      changed as it was found that diastolic dysfunction was also seen in patients with 'systolic&#xD;
      dysfunction'. Myocardial stiffness which leads to increased filling pressures is a common&#xD;
      pathophysiologic attribute of HFpEF despite its multifactorial aetiology. Other common&#xD;
      conditions associated with HFpEF include: atrial fibrillation (AF), chronotropic&#xD;
      incompetence, pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction and endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction; with common non-specific risk factors such as: age, gender, hypertension,&#xD;
      obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and renal failure. This complex heterogeneity of HFpEF&#xD;
      which is not yet fully understood highlights the difficulty that clinicians have in being&#xD;
      able to diagnose the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of HFpEF is difficult and as of yet there is no test to confirm diagnosis, with&#xD;
      current guidelines saying initial diagnosis should include the presence of typical signs and&#xD;
      symptoms, an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (&gt;35 pg/mL and/or N-Terminal&#xD;
      pro-B-type Natriuretic Peptide [NT-proBNP] &gt;125 pg/mL) and ejection fraction â‰¥50%.&#xD;
      Echocardiography is the preferred method of assessing for HFpEF due to it being widely&#xD;
      available, non-invasive, and able to provide immediate results. Recent studies comparing the&#xD;
      use of echocardiography against 'gold standard' invasive cardiac catheterisation to assess&#xD;
      cardiac filling pressures found echocardiography to be just as accurate and reliable.&#xD;
      Implications of this research would be that patients could be assessed as outpatients by&#xD;
      focus echocardiography rather than invasively in the cardiac catheterisation lab, which would&#xD;
      improve patient experience, enhance patient outcomes and prove cost-effective for trusts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response a recently proposed non-invasive diagnostic criteria called H2FPEF which assesses&#xD;
      patients based on body mass index (BMI), the number of hypertensive medications they take,&#xD;
      presence of AF, pulmonary pressure, age and filling pressure. The advantage of the H2FPEF&#xD;
      score is that it uses only non-invasive echocardiography data alongside routine clinical data&#xD;
      making it easy to derive. However one key limitation of their study is the population they&#xD;
      used was all from the Mayo clinic and so the generalisability of their results has not been&#xD;
      tested for other populations, such as those of lower socioeconomic status like in Portsmouth.&#xD;
      A further limitation is the parameters chosen to create H2FPEF are all relatively common&#xD;
      morbidities and usually co-exist, making it likely that it will over diagnose HFpEF.&#xD;
