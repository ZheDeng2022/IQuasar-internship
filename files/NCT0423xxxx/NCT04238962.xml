  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will look at how 2 different semaglutide versions reach and stay in the blood after&#xD;
      injection. The study aims to show similar levels of semaglutide in the blood when using the&#xD;
      different semaglutide versions. Participants will get 1 of the 2 versions of semaglutide -&#xD;
      which version is decided by chance. One version is the one that doctors already can prescribe&#xD;
      and the other is the new version. Participants will get the medicine as an injection under&#xD;
      the skin of the belly with a pen-injector. The type of pen-injector is different for the 2&#xD;
      versions of semaglutide. Participants will receive 7 once-weekly injections in total. The&#xD;
      study will last for about 80-106 days. Participants will have 19 study visits with the study&#xD;
      doctor. For 2 of the visits, participants will stay in the clinic, 1 visit for 2 days and 1&#xD;
      night and the other visit for 4 days and 3 nights. Participants may have to stop the study if&#xD;
      the study doctor thinks that there are risks for their health. Participants cannot take part&#xD;
      in this study if they have any disease or disorder that the study doctor thinks is a health&#xD;
      problem. Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to become pregnant&#xD;
      during the study period.&#xD;
