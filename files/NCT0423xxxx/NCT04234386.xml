  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The GammaPod machine was made by Xcision Medical Systems and is already FDA cleared to&#xD;
      deliver focused radiation within the breast. Unlike current radiation machines, the GammaPod&#xD;
      was designed specifically for treating breast cancer. The GammaPod can pinpoint radiation to&#xD;
      the tumor bed in the breast which lowers the amount of radiation to nearby tissues. The&#xD;
      machine uses a breast cup system to hold the breast in place for the treatment. This breast&#xD;
      cup system was tested at MSGCCC (Marlene Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center).&#xD;
      Patients reported this system was more comfortable than an MRI or mammogram. The cup system&#xD;
      was able to securely position the breast for treatment in the correct location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Receiving radiation before surgery is not a new concept in cancer management. Preoperative&#xD;
      radiation has proven to result in improved disease free survival in certain types of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study treatment, the participants will receive a dose of breast radiation therapy&#xD;
      before the lumpectomy surgery. The lumpectomy surgery is where they remove the participant's&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to determine a safe and effective dose of pre-operative&#xD;
      radiation to treat early stage breast cancer. The pre-operative radiation is delivered using&#xD;
      the FDA approved, GammaPod machine. The study will also determine the cosmesis of&#xD;
      pre-operative radiation at different doses. Cosmesis is another word for looking at skin&#xD;
      changes. The research team will use questionnaires for patient and physicians to assess&#xD;
      adverse cosmesis changes as accurately as possible. In addition, the investigators are going&#xD;
      to assess radiation related changes using photo software analysis tools and patients quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must sign consent for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be female with a diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma. Lobular&#xD;
             histologies will not be included, because of difficulty in defining the extent of&#xD;
             disease with imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be deemed appropriate candidates for breast-conserving therapy (i.e.,&#xD;
             not pregnant, never had RT to the treated breast, breast size would allow adequate&#xD;
             cosmesis after volume loss from partial mastectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor must not involve the overlying skin or underlying chest wall, based on imaging&#xD;
             evaluation and/or clinical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Greatest tumor dimension is &lt;3 cm based on US. MR imaging measurements can be included&#xD;
             only if performed BEFORE the biopsy (postbiopsy measurements can be larger as a result&#xD;
             of hematoma formation or increased edema).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor must be unifocal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be &gt; 45 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The tumor must be visible on a CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must undergo MR imaging for work-up to aid in tumor delineation and to rule&#xD;
             out additional foci of disease. If additional foci of disease are found to be present,&#xD;
             then these must be biopsied with negative results to proceed with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The tumor must be clinically and radiographically N0 (node negative). If a suspicious&#xD;
             node is visualized, it must be biopsied with negative results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be estrogen-receptor positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be HER2neu negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must weigh &lt;150 kg (330 lb), which is the limit of the imaging loader.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be &lt;6'6&quot; in height, again because of instrumentation limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to lie prone for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have no lymphovascular invasion on biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may be taking hormonal therapy prior to initiation of treatment. This will be&#xD;

             anatomic reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to obtain an adequate seal when using the immobilization breast cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast implants.&#xD;

             informed consent or study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating (because of potential RT exposure to the fetus&#xD;
             and unknown effects of RT in lactating women).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient unable to undergo MR imaging (e.g., because of known contrast reaction or&#xD;
             concerns about contrast and existing health status).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lymphovascular invasion on original biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  ER-negative tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HER2neu-positive tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pure ductal carcinoma in situ (no invasive component).&#xD;
