  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The acute study will evaluate pre- and post-exercise ingestion of a multi-ingredient&#xD;
      supplement in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Participants&#xD;
      will complete one enrollment visit, in which they will sign a consent form and complete a&#xD;
      health history questionnaire. Participants will complete two interventions, with three visits&#xD;
      each (6 visits total), in which a treatment beverage (pre/post supplement, or non-caloric&#xD;
      placebo) will be consumed within 30 minutes prior to exercise and within 15 minutes&#xD;
      post-exercise, in random order. Total time from enrollment to completion will be at least 14&#xD;
      days. Testing visits will be separated by a minimum of 7 days of rest to allow for recovery&#xD;
      and washout, based on a half-life of ≤8 hours for all ingredients present in the supplement.&#xD;
