    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to address two key questions in the literature on incentives for&#xD;
      substance use. The first question is whether it is more effective to directly incentivize the&#xD;
      outcome of interest - drug abstinence - or to incentivize behaviors that are inputs into the&#xD;
      production of abstinence. This study will compare two versions of the incentive program: one&#xD;
      that incentivizes inputs to achieving abstinence and one that incentivizes the outcome of&#xD;
      abstinence. The second question is how to optimize the size of incentives over time to&#xD;
      maximize incentive effectiveness. This will be done by randomly varying the size and timing&#xD;
      of incentives offered to participants in both the Inputs and Outcomes groups. The incentive&#xD;
      amounts will then be varied across participants and time to fit a structural model of&#xD;
      abstinence behaviors over time. The model will be used to describe the optimal shape of&#xD;
      incentives over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have tested whether providing incentives to encourage abstinence from drugs&#xD;
      can further reduce drug abuse in a drug-treatment setting. The results are promising:&#xD;
      Incentives to reduce opioid abuse increase the average duration of abstinence by 25 - 60%&#xD;
      relative to medication and counseling alone. Similar effects have been demonstrated&#xD;
      repeatedly across a wealth of populations, substance-abuse disorders, and payment&#xD;
      methodologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite evidence that incentives are effective and the increasing need for effective&#xD;
      approaches to combat the addiction crisis, incentive programs have not been widely&#xD;
      implemented. A key barrier is that while the benefits are largely borne by patients and&#xD;
      taxpayers, there are large logistical costs that must be borne by clinics: most existing&#xD;
      incentive programs involve manual, in-person measurement of behaviors, and prize or voucher&#xD;
      purchase and delivery by clinic staff. The significant clinic-level legwork necessary to set&#xD;
      up these programs, including setting up behavioral and payment tracking systems, training&#xD;
      staff, etc., have prevented the programs from scaling widely. In sum, prior experience has&#xD;
      consistently shown that incentives increase duration of treatment and decrease substance&#xD;
      abuse, but the logistical complications remain a hurdle to implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first randomized evaluation of an innovative, scalable incentives program&#xD;
      for opioid addiction delivered through a mobile application. The application, which was&#xD;
      developed by our implementing partner, DynamiCare Health, provides a &quot;turnkey&quot; solution that&#xD;
      health clinics can easily prescribe. The app enables remote monitoring of behavior; for&#xD;
      example, drug tests can be administered in patients' homes, as patients submit&#xD;
      &quot;selfie-videos&quot; showing them taking saliva drug tests, which are then verified by trained&#xD;
      remote staff. Treatment adherence can similarly be checked through GPS tracking for on-site&#xD;
      methadone pharmacotherapy. The efficacy of this approach has not been tested rigorously&#xD;
      before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will address two key knowledge gaps in the logistics of existing incentive program&#xD;
      design for opioid addiction. First, the first technology t for remote monitoring of&#xD;
      abstinence behavior for opioid use will be tested. Remote monitoring of abstinence from&#xD;
      cigarettes and alcohol has been integral in reducing the costs and extending the potential&#xD;
      reach of incentive programs for people with nicotine/tobacco and alcohol use disorders (e.g.&#xD;
      to vulnerable or rural populations), and this study promises to do the same for opioid&#xD;
      addiction. The second gap is in remote delivery of incentives. After a behavior is verified,&#xD;
      the app will deliver incentives to patients as cash available on a linked debit card. The&#xD;
      delay between monitoring of the target behavior and the delivery of financial incentives has&#xD;
      been shown to be a significant moderator of treatment effect size. This technology allows&#xD;
      patients to receive incentives almost immediately following the undertaking of the&#xD;
      incentivized behavior: a first in incentives for opioid addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another novel feature of this design is that can allow assessment of a gap in the literature&#xD;
      on incentive delivery: comparing both the isolated effects of incentives and of the&#xD;
      monitoring needed to implement an incentive program. In addition to a control group, this&#xD;
      study includes both monitoring groups and incentives groups. While existing literature on&#xD;
      incentives for addiction has included either a monitoring group or a control group, this is&#xD;
      the first to include both, such that a comparison can be made between incentives that are&#xD;
      distal (inputs) and proximal (outcome) to the targeted abstinence behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, this study will directly address two key open questions in the literature on&#xD;
      incentives for drug-users. The first question is whether it is more effective to directly&#xD;
      incentivize the outcome of interest - drug abstinence - or to incentivize behaviors that are&#xD;
      inputs into the production of abstinence. Similarly designed studies did not detect different&#xD;
      effects on abstinence from incentivizing treatment attendance and incentivizing cocaine&#xD;
      abstinence among cocaine users (both were effective): however, not only was this study for a&#xD;
      different substance use disorder, but because of differential rates of test submission among&#xD;
      these two groups, the results were not conclusive. This study will similarly compare two&#xD;
      versions of the incentive program: one that incentivizes inputs to achieving abstinence, and&#xD;
      one that incentivizes the outcome of abstinence. To address differential test submission&#xD;
      rates, the impacts of the intervention will be measured via urine drug-tests administered&#xD;
      identically to patients in both treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second question is how to optimize the size of incentives over time to maximize incentive&#xD;
      effectiveness. This will be assessed by randomly varying the size and timing of incentives&#xD;
      offered to participants in both the Inputs and Outcomes groups. The variation in incentive&#xD;
      amounts across participants and time to fit a structural model of abstinence behaviors over&#xD;
      time. The model will be used to describe the optimal shape of incentives over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this intervention will be directly relevant for potential users of this or&#xD;
      similar mobile applications for incentive provision among people with opioid-use disorders,&#xD;
      including insurers, treatment facilities, and governments.&#xD;

Patients in this group will receive the same services and urine drug-test schedule as standard of care and a similar mobile app and debit card as the Inputs group. However, the app will prompt patients in this group to submit saliva drug tests through their mobile phones on a random schedule (averaging three tests per week). Patients will receive immediate financial rewards in exchange for submitting drug-negative samples. Saliva tests typically have a window of detection between 24-48 hr after drug use.&#xD;
App + Outcomes Contingency Management: The app has programmed contingencies whereby incentives can be earned for outcomes of abstaining from drug use (e.g., drug-negative saliva samples on saliva opioid tests).</description>

            <description>During the intervention period, the &quot;Outcomes&quot; group will receive incentives for abstaining from drug use. Patients in this group will receive the same services and urine drug-test schedule as standard of care and a similar mobile app and debit card as the Inputs group. However, the app will prompt patients in this group to submit saliva drug tests through their mobile phones on a random schedule (averaging three tests per week). Patients will receive immediate financial rewards in exchange for submitting drug-negative samples. Saliva tests typically have a window of detection between 24-48 hr after drug use.&#xD;
