  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass and function with age. It has been recognised as an&#xD;
      important health problem because it is common in older adults and associated with decline in&#xD;
      physical function as well as a reduced quality of life. Sarcopenia can also lead to serious&#xD;
      health consequences in terms of increased disability and the need for increased health and&#xD;
      social care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is considerable interest in understanding what causes sarcopenia in order to develop&#xD;
      new approaches to prevention, diagnosis and treatment. To gain a detailed understanding of&#xD;
      sarcopenia across a range of ages, we have designed the Muscle Ageing Sarcopenia Study&#xD;
      (MASS_Lifecourse) in collaboration with members of the public and patients.&#xD;

      We aim to recruit 160 participants from Newcastle upon Tyne across an age range of 45-85&#xD;
      years from primary care, secondary care and the NIHR (National Institute for Health Research)&#xD;
      Bioresource. Participants will receive a home visit from a researcher to complete a detailed&#xD;
      health profile. Participants will then be invited to attend a clinical visit at Newcastle's&#xD;
      Campus for Ageing and Vitality for imaging and muscle biopsy. A subsequent clinical visit&#xD;
      will involve a fasting blood test, follow-up of the biopsy site and gather participants'&#xD;
      views about taking part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if it is acceptable and feasible to recruit adults across a range of ages&#xD;
           to undergo detailed studies of skeletal muscle including biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To understand how lifestyle is related to the characteristics of muscle&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To use advances in technology (an omics approach) to identify mechanisms of sarcopenia&#xD;
           and biomarkers for early diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To use findings from 2 and 3 to develop new approaches to treatment and also to invite&#xD;
           participants to relevant trials&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To secure funding for maintaining and expanding the cohort&#xD;

        The study will aim to recruit 160 participants (approximately 80 women and 80 men) aged 45&#xD;
        to 85 years of age to participate in this study, divided into four ten-year age groups of&#xD;
        equal size (45-54, 55-64, 65-74 and 75-85 years old, with 20 men and 20 women in each age&#xD;
        group).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Primary care source:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Registered patient with one of the GP (General Practice) surgeries identified as PIC&#xD;
        (Participant Identification Centre) via North East and North Cumbria Clinical Research&#xD;
        Network.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Secondary care source:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Attending a NuTH (Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust) clinical area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NIHR Bioresource:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Participants identified by the NIHR Bioresource Centre Newcastle as being eligible for&#xD;
        the study and who have not previously expressed a wish to no longer be contacted about&#xD;
        further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For all recruitment sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has capacity to consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Within the study age range (45-85 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not taking any anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications (see below under exclusion&#xD;
             criteria), with the exception of aspirin being taken for primary prevention (i.e.&#xD;
             where there is no diagnosis of cardiovascular disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Inability to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - As the study involves biopsy of skeletal muscle, individuals who are taking medications&#xD;
        that increase bleeding risk are excluded, specifically: i. anti-coagulant medication:&#xD;
        warfarin, injected low-molecular weight heparins such as dalteparin, and direct oral&#xD;
        anticoagulant drugs such as rivaroxaban and apixaban.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. anti-platelet medication such as clopidogrel or prasugrel. This also includes aspirin&#xD;
        where an individual has a known history of cardiovascular disease. Aspirin being taken&#xD;
        where there is no history of cardiovascular disease is acceptable, as we would consider&#xD;
        there to be minimal risk of stopping the aspirin for 14 days prior to biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals known to have diabetes mellitus, due to the increased risk of infection at&#xD;
             the biopsy sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals currently taking medication that suppresses the immune system (such as&#xD;
             prednisolone or methotrexate), due to the increased risk of infection or poor healing&#xD;
             of the biopsy sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy, due to the exposure to small amount of ionising radiation during the DXA&#xD;
             scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who use a wheelchair or who are unable to walk without assistance, as we&#xD;
             would anticipate that the muscle biopsy procedure would not be feasible in these&#xD;
             groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An individual who the NuTH clinician / GP feels it is inappropriate for the&#xD;
             researchers to approach - the NuTH clinician / GP may consider an individual&#xD;
             unsuitable for approach for reasons such as end stage terminal disease or safety risk.&#xD;
