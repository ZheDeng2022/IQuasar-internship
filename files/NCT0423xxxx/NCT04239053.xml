  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB) is a regional anesthesia technique that is used for as a&#xD;
      part of multimodal analgesia. Bupivacaine is one of the local anesthetic drugs and it is&#xD;
      applied for ESPB. In this study, it is aimed to examine its blood concentration following the&#xD;
      application for ESPB regarding its adverse effects and pharmacokinetics.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ESPB is prefered block technique for thoraco abdominal surgeries. Bupivacaine is a widely&#xD;
      used drug for these kind blocks.The systemic absorption rate of bupivacaine depends on the&#xD;
      dose administered, the route of administration, and the vascularization of the injection&#xD;
      site. The highest plasma concentration is achieved in intercostal blocks due to its rapid&#xD;
      absorption (4 mg / liter after 400 mg dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lowest plasma concentrations are seen in subcutaneous administration in the abdominal&#xD;
      region. Total plasma clearance of bupivacaine was 0.58 L / min, steady state distribution&#xD;
      volume was 73 liters, the elimination half-life was 2.7 hours and the hepatic extraction rate&#xD;
      was 0.40. The maximum applicable legal dose varies by country. While it is 150 mg in Sweden,&#xD;
      it is administered up to 400 mg in 24 hours in Finland. Clearance of bupivacaine has been&#xD;
      shown to be lower in uremic patients. Plasma concentrations of highly proteing binding drugs&#xD;
      are significantly effected by low cardiac output. The pharmacokinetics of many local&#xD;
      anesthetics are influenced by inadequate liver function due to changes in body fluids and&#xD;
      circulation. However, it seems safe in single dose blocks in patients with hepatic&#xD;
      dysfunction. CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitors such as propranolol and CYP3A4 inhibitors such as&#xD;
      itraconazole can reduce the clearance of bupivacaine by up to 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the concentration of local anesthetics including bupivacaine increases in systemic&#xD;
      circulation, signs and symptoms of cardiovascular central nervous systems appear. The doses&#xD;
      of bupivacaine that produce cardiovascular toxicity / central nervous system toxicity are&#xD;
      similar. Stopping the administration of local anesthetics when early signs of the central&#xD;
      nervous system observed does not prevent cardiotoxicity. Therefore, measurement of plasma&#xD;
      levels of the drug may be important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood level of bupivacaine is not routinely measured. Bupivacaine When the arterial&#xD;
      plasma concentration is above 1.5 /g / ml, dizziness may occur, peripheral paresthesia above&#xD;
      2.0 /g / ml, and convulsions above 4.0 /g / ml. Intramuscular administration of 1.3 ug/kg&#xD;
      causes psychomotor impairment in motor vehicle use. Dose-dependent central nervous system&#xD;
      adverse effects are monitored and patient-related adverse event information is recorded. In a&#xD;
      study in which toxic effects were observed with bupivacaine, which included 11,080 patients,&#xD;
      the number of systemic toxicities was found to be 15 and none of them had permanent sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no reports on plasma bupivacaine levels in patients undergoing ESPB.&#xD;
