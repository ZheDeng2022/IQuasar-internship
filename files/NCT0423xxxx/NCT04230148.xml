  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label, non-comparative, single arm multi-country study in&#xD;
      approximately 300 adult and pediatric subjects (≥ 6 years of age) with fascioliasis. The&#xD;
      study population consists of male and female adult and pediatric patients (≥ 6 years of age).&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 300 subjects with acute (minimum 15% of overall study&#xD;
      population) or chronic fascioliasis. Enrolled subjects will receive two doses of 10 mg/kg of&#xD;
      Egaten given approximately 12 hours apart. Subjects will be treated and followed up on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis. After screening and post treatment, at Day 3 and Day 6 the subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for safety and tolerability. These visits are primarily for safety follow up and may&#xD;
      be telephonic or home visit by qualified personnel or onsite visits based on the&#xD;
      investigator's discretion. During visits Day 10, Day 30, Day 60 and Day 90 post-treatment,&#xD;
      the subjects will be followed for safety, tolerability and efficacy. On Day 15, Day 45 and&#xD;
      Day 75, telephonic follow-up (primarily for safety) will be conducted.&#xD;
