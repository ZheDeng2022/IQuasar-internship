        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a&#xD;
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood pressure&#xD;
             (BP), Pulse rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 18 to 55 years (inclusive) at the time of signing informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive) as measured at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study, in&#xD;
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are sexually active must use, with their partner, highly effective&#xD;
             contraception from the time of administration of trial medication until 30 days after&#xD;
             administration of trial medication. Adequate methods are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms plus use of hormonal contraception by the female partner that started at&#xD;
                  least 2 months prior to administration of trial medication (e.g., implants,&#xD;
                  injectables, combined oral or vaginal contraceptives, intrauterine device) or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms plus surgical sterilization (vasectomy at least 1 year prior to&#xD;
                  enrolment) or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms plus surgically sterilised partner (including hysterectomy) or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms plus intrauterine device or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms plus partner of non-childbearing potential (including homosexual men)&#xD;
                  Subjects are required to use condoms to prevent unintended exposure of the&#xD;
                  partner (both, male and female) to the study drug via seminal fluid. Male&#xD;
                  subjects should use a condom throughout the study and for 30 days after last&#xD;
                  Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) administration. Alternatively, true&#xD;
                  abstinence is acceptable when it is in line with the subject's preferred and&#xD;
                  usual lifestyle. If a subject is usually not sexually active but becomes active,&#xD;
                  with their partner, they must comply with the contraceptive requirements detailed&#xD;
                  above Male subjects should not donate sperm for the duration of the study and for&#xD;
                  at least 30 days after last IMP administration&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be&#xD;
             of clinical relevance&#xD;
&#xD;
