      This study examines the prevalence and incidence of older ER users with cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (i.e., dementia and/or delirium) using the ER2 item temporal disorientation in older ED users&#xD;
      who are participants of the ER2 cohort study database.&#xD;

      The Emergency Departments (EDs) in North America are under duress because of overcrowding,&#xD;
      delays and diversions, which increase to epidemic proportions. The aging of Canadian's&#xD;
      population amplifies the magnitude of this situation because older ED users are the fastest&#xD;
      increasing group of ED users and they have complex and specific needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are simple interventions with which providers must proceed in order to cure or prevent&#xD;
      short-term ED adverse events. Delirium, motor deconditioning, polypharmacy-related adverse&#xD;
      drug reactions, and inappropriate home support are the main conditions to target when taking&#xD;
      care of older ED users. We previously demonstrated that acting on these conditions may&#xD;
      significantly accelerate the discharge and significantly reduce the length of ED and hospital&#xD;
      stay. Evidence-based medicine showed that simple and early interventions may prevent delirium&#xD;
      (e.g., through hydration, avoiding restraint, mobilizing and satisfying basic needs, time and&#xD;
      place reorientation) and motor deconditioning (e.g., through encouraging mobility, up to&#xD;
      chair at mealtime during daytime hours, providing appropriate walking aid) in older patients.&#xD;
      Medication reconciliation is also an efficient intervention to prevent adverse drug&#xD;
      reactions. Furthermore, an early assessment of home support is a crucial step in adjusting&#xD;
      services for an early and smooth discharge back home. Based on this evidence, we have&#xD;
      modified the 6-item Emergency Room Evaluation and Recommendations (ER2) by adding an&#xD;
      interventional component to the assessment portion of the tool. The interventional part&#xD;
      depends on the assessment's results and is based on recommendations designed to encourage&#xD;
      easy and basic interventions that prevent delirium, motor deconditioning, adverse drug&#xD;
      interactions and inappropriate home support. These recommendations are based on answers to&#xD;
      the ER2 items&#xD;

    <description>ER2 is a simple and standardized clinical tool. The results of the questionnaires performed in ER2 study will be used. The assessment component of ER2 consists of 6 very simple closed-ended format questions (i.e., yes versus no) which are: Age category (≥ 85), male, polypharmacy (≥ 5 different medications per day), use of formal (health care or social professional) and/or informal (family and/or friend) home support, use of a walking aid regardless of its type, and temporal disorientation (inability to give the current month and/or year). A score of five points is assigned to the items &quot;use of walking aid&quot; and &quot;temporal disorientation&quot;, whereas, for the other items, the assigned score is one point. The weighting of points for ER2 items is based on the results of our previous studies. Scores range from 0 (lowest risk) to 14 (highest risk). ER2 scores stratify the risk for short-term ED adverse events into three levels: low, moderate and high.</description>
