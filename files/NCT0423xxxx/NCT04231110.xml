  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of combination therapy using FMT and vedolizumab for induction of UC.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a combination therapy approach which addresses immune&#xD;
      trafficking and microbial manipulation simultaneously will lead to superior outcomes than&#xD;
      those seen with single agent therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot trial involving a single centre (McMaster University Medical&#xD;
      Centre) recruiting patients from Hamilton, Ontario Canada and the surrounding regions, to&#xD;
      evaluate efficacy and safety outcomes when using fecal microbiota transplantation once weekly&#xD;
      for six weeks in UC patients who are initiated on vedolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lead in study will be conducted with the first five patients to ensure engraftment of FMT&#xD;
      within the colon. Interim analysis will be conducted after these five patients to ensure&#xD;
      engraftment within the colon. Data Safety and Monitoring Board will also be informed of the&#xD;
      results after the first five patients, including any adverse events. Decision will be made&#xD;
      based on these results whether to proceed with the prospective study using FMT weekly for six&#xD;
      weeks, or whether to modify the dose/frequency of FMT treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As patients with previous biologic failure tend to have sub-optimal response to vedolizumab&#xD;
      monotherapy, this pilot study will focus on recruitment of previous biologic failure&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
