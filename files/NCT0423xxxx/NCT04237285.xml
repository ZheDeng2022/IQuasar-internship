  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was carried out in the Pediatric Burn Unit, aged between 2 months and 7 years, with&#xD;
      no chronic pain, second degree superficial scald burns, hydrotherapy application, no burn&#xD;
      surgery, no pathogen growth in the burn site, the burn had not undergone epithelialization.&#xD;
      Children receiving routine analgesic therapy were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lavender oil 15 minutes, Lavender oil 60 minutes and Jojoba oil 15 minutes (Placebo group)&#xD;
      were studied with a total of 108 children in three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children included in the study were randomized. One of the researchers measured the pain&#xD;
      and vital signs of children before the application. 0.5 cc of aromatherapy oil, which was&#xD;
      dripped into the gauze 15 or 60 minutes before the start of hydrotherapy and dressing, was&#xD;
      placed 20 cm away from the child's nose. The child who inhaled the smell was hydrotherapy and&#xD;
      dressing and then taken to bed. The other investigator, who did not know how long the child&#xD;
      inhaled in the morning, evaluated pain and vital signs 1 and 30 minutes after the child&#xD;
      returned to bed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial research experimental design was performed with pediatric burn&#xD;
      patients on May 2018-May 2019. Routine treatment of any child was not interfered with during&#xD;
      the data collection phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum sample size in each intervention and control group was considered 36 using G&#xD;
      power formula with a = 0.05, power of 80%, 95% confidence interval (Gpower 3.1.9.2.,&#xD;
      Germany). Allocation to the groups was performed using the Stratified Randomization. The&#xD;
      absence of differences in age, vital signs and pain levels between groups prior to the&#xD;
      intervention was achieved using Stratified Randomization method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinic where the study was conducted, all children are routinely given hydrotherapy&#xD;
      treatment for the examination of the burn area as of 10 am every morning and then dressings&#xD;
      are applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides routine care, the Control Group was treated with jojoba oil (Simmondsia Chinensis-&#xD;
      produced by Arifoğlu, obtained from jojoba fruits by cold squeezing method) inhalation&#xD;
      aromatherapy 15 minutes before Hydrotherapy. Jojoba oil was used as a placebo because it had&#xD;
      no specific odour. Besides routine care, Intervention-15 Group received lavender oil&#xD;
      (Lavandula angustifolia Miller Oleum-produced by Arifoğlu, obtained from lavender flowers by&#xD;
      water vapour distillation method) inhalation aromatherapy 15 minutes before Hydrotherapy and&#xD;
      besides routine care, Intervention-60 Group received lavender oil inhalation aromatherapy 60&#xD;
      minutes before Hydrotherapy. 0.5 ml (8.44 minim-imperial) of aromatherapy oil, which had been&#xD;
      dripped into 7.5x7.5 cm gauze 15 or 60 minutes before the start of Hydrotherapy, was placed&#xD;
      20 cm (7.87 inches) away from the child's nose by the clinical nurse. To conceal the&#xD;
      allocation, the group in which the child belongs is only known to the clinical nurse who has&#xD;
      placed the aromatherapy oil-soaked gauze in the child's room and this clinical nurse did not&#xD;
      carry out any assessment of the child's outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before randomization, the characteristics of all participants were collected using the&#xD;
      Turkish version of the FLACC Pain Scale, Demographic Data Collection Form, and the Vital&#xD;
      Signs Follow-up Form which were developed by the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the clinical nurse 0.5 ccs of aromatherapy oil, which had dripped into the gauze, was&#xD;
      placed 20 cm away from the child's nose. The child who inhaled the oil was then taken to&#xD;
      hydrotherapy and then dressing. The pain and vital signs of the child were evaluated and&#xD;
      recorded 1 minute and 30 minutes after the child returned to bed by a researcher who was&#xD;
      blind to the study groups.&#xD;

    <description>The FLACC Pain Scale scores of the child was evaluated and recorded before dressing, also 1 minute and 30 minutes after the dressing.&#xD;
FLACC (The Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability Scale) Pain Scale used by Merkel et al in 1997 in children between 2 months-7 years of age. With this scale, five behavioral criteria such as facial expression, the position of legs, movements, crying and comforting are evaluated. Each episode is rated 0-2 with scores ranging from 0-10 in total, the lower the score, the less pain is said .0 points:&quot; no pain &quot;1-3 points:&quot; there is little pain &quot;4-6 points:&quot; there is moderate pain &quot; 7-10 points:&quot; there is much pain&quot;.</description>
