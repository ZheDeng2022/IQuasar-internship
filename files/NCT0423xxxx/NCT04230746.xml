  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the most common type of human bacterial disease, prompting&#xD;
      more than 10 million physician office visits annually at a healthcare cost of over $1 billion&#xD;
      dollars. Treatment of UTI is typically empiric or culture-driven antibiotics which are&#xD;
      associated with ever increasing bacterial resistance. Over the last decade, The Human&#xD;
      Microbiome Project has established that even 'culture-negative' urine represents a diverse&#xD;
      ecosystem of bacteria. Despite broad use of antibiotics to cure disease for the past 90&#xD;
      years, the broader impact of antibiotics on typical flora are not well understood.&#xD;
      Antibiotics are also commonly used as prophylaxis for surgical procedures in the urinary&#xD;
      tract altering patient outcomes in unforeseen ways. Despite widespread utilization of&#xD;
      antibiotics, the longitudinal impact on the dynamic intravesical environment remains&#xD;
      completely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysbiosis in the microbiome has been suggested as a causative agent in a wide range of&#xD;
      disease: arthritis, metabolic disorders, neurologic disease, inflammatory bowel conditions,&#xD;
      and cancer. Yet there remains a fundamental knowledge gap regarding the short and long-term&#xD;
      effect of antibiotics on microbiota communities. Specifically within the urinary tract,&#xD;
      variance in baseline commensal organisms have been associated with interstitial cystitis,&#xD;
      overactive bladder, frequent symptomatic urinary tract infection and potentially cancer&#xD;
      development. The study of microbiota reveal pathways and mechanisms that play important roles&#xD;
      in immunological response and health but studies typically are limited to the gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this knowledge gap, the investigators plan a placebo controlled randomized trial&#xD;
      to test the longitudinal impact of 10 days of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on the urinary&#xD;
      microbiome in healthy adults. Data collection for individual participants will persist for a&#xD;
      period of 6 months. The investigators hypothesize antibiotic administration contributes to a&#xD;
      rise in bacterial resistance and directly leads to urine microbiome dysbiosis. The&#xD;
      investigators further hypothesize the urinary microbiome does not return to baseline, with&#xD;
      loss of certain bacteria permanent during the study period. While the investigators' study is&#xD;
      groundbreaking and novel, the feasibility of the investigators' experimental plan has been&#xD;
      previously demonstrated in the study of the salivary and gut microbiome. Ultimately the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate even a single course of antibiotic treatment may increase the risk&#xD;
      of bacterial resistance and lead to long-lasting shifts in the urinary microbiome. If&#xD;
      confirmed, this knowledge will directly influence clinical decision making in antibiotic&#xD;
      selection, duration, and utility.&#xD;
