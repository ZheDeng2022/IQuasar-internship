  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with heart failure (HF) and left ventricular (LV) dilation, adverse LV remodeling&#xD;
      causes tethering of mitral valve (MV) preventing sufficient coaptation of normal leaflets and&#xD;
      resulting in functional MR. Because secondary functional MR usually develops as a result of&#xD;
      LV dysfunction, guideline-directed medical therapy for HF forms the mainstay of therapy.&#xD;
      However, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor blockers (ARB) fail to reverse adverse LV remodeling and functional MR, and the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of patients with functional MR remain high despite standard medical&#xD;
      therapy. Randomized trials to explore cardiovascular (CV) benefit of the sodium-glucose&#xD;
      co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor have been performed and showed a significant reduction on&#xD;
      the risk of CV death or hospitalization for HF. However, its effect on cardiac structure and&#xD;
      function was not evaluated and further mechanistic studies are needed to interpret beneficial&#xD;
      clinical effects of the SGLT2 inhibitors. Based on studies demonstrating SGLT2 inhibitors'&#xD;
      favorable effects on LV modeling, investigators hypothesize that SGLT2 inhibitor,&#xD;
      ertugliflozin, is effective on improving MR in patients with functional MR secondary to LV&#xD;
      dysfunction and try to examine this hypothesis in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized&#xD;
      comparison study using echocardiography.&#xD;

      In patients with heart failure (HF) and left ventricular (LV) dilation, adverse LV remodeling&#xD;
      causes tethering of mitral valve (MV) preventing sufficient coaptation of normal leaflets and&#xD;
      resulting in functional MR. Because secondary functional MR usually develops as a result of&#xD;
      LV dysfunction, guideline-directed medical therapy for HF forms the mainstay of therapy.&#xD;
      However, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor blockers (ARB) fail to reverse adverse LV remodeling and functional MR, and the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of patients with functional MR remain high despite standard medical&#xD;
      therapy. A recent randomized trial proved that reduction of functional MR by transcatheter MV&#xD;
      repair resulted in a lower rate of hospitalization for HF and lower mortality in patients&#xD;
      with HF and significant secondary MR, and investigators recently demonstrated that the&#xD;
      angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) is more effective in improving functional MR&#xD;
      associated with HF than the ARB in a double-blind, randomized trial. In this trial,&#xD;
      investigators enrolled 118 stable HF patients with functional MR, whose effective regurgitant&#xD;
      orifice area (EROA) larger than 0.1 cm2, lasting &gt; 6 months despite standard medical&#xD;
      treatment, and the primary end point of change in EROA was significantly different between&#xD;
      the ARNI group and the ARB group (-0.058±0.095 versus -0.018±0.105 cm2; P=0.032), and a&#xD;
      decrease in end-diastolic volume index of the LV was also significantly greater in the ARNI&#xD;
      group than in the ARB group (P=0.044).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce cardiac preload and afterload by&#xD;
      natriuresis and lowering arterial stiffness, similar to the neprilysin inhibitor that&#xD;
      facilitates sodium excretion and has vasodilating effects. In addition, effects on blood&#xD;
      pressure reduction and weight loss may ultimately have a beneficial effect on LV remodeling.&#xD;
      Recently it has been reported that SGLT2 inhibitors have a multifaceted effect on cardiac&#xD;
      function including improvement in endothelial dysfunction and aortic stiffness, reduction in&#xD;
      epicardial fat accumulation as well as in visceral adipocyte hypertrophy. Randomized trials&#xD;
      to explore cardiovascular (CV) benefit of the SGLT2 inhibitor have been performed and showed&#xD;
      a significant reduction on the risk of CV death or hospitalization for HF. However, its&#xD;
      effect on cardiac structure and function was not evaluated and further mechanistic studies&#xD;
      are needed to interpret beneficial clinical effects of the SGLT2 inhibitors. Based on studies&#xD;
      demonstrating SGLT2 inhibitors' favorable effects on LV modeling, investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that SGLT2 inhibitor, ertugliflozin, is effective on improving MR in patients with functional&#xD;
      MR secondary to LV dysfunction and try to examine this hypothesis in a multicenter,&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized comparison study using echocardiography.&#xD;
