      To investigate the effectiveness and tolerability of a second maintenance treatment in&#xD;
      participants with platinum-sensitivity relapsed (PSR) epithelial ovarian cancer, who have&#xD;
      previously received PARPi maintenance treatment and who have benefit (complete response [CR]&#xD;
      or partial response [PR]) or stable disease (SD) from further platinum based chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomised, multicentre study to investigate the efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of a second maintenance treatment in participants with PSR epithelial ovarian&#xD;
      cancer, who have previously received PARPi maintenance treatment and who have benefit (CR or&#xD;
      PR) or SD from further platinum based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited globally from approximately 120 study sites in the USA,&#xD;
      Canada, Middle East and Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 192 participants fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to the following 3 treatment arms (64&#xD;
      participants per arm):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1 (ceralasertib+olaparib): Ceralasertib 160 mg once daily (QD) orally or per os (PO)&#xD;
           on Days 1 to 7 plus olaparib 300 mg twice daily (BD) PO continuous (28 day cycle)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2 (olaparib monotherapy): Olaparib 300 mg BD PO daily continuous&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3 (placebo): Placebo to match olaparib BD PO daily continuous&#xD;
&#xD;
      The olaparib and placebo arms will be double blinded, whereas the ceralasertib+olaparib arm&#xD;
      will be open label. It is expected that approximately 320 participants will be screened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study achieved First Subject In date, but enrollment equals 0 as 7 participants have&#xD;
      signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) and were later screen failed.&#xD;

    <description>To assess both European quality of life descriptive system and European quality of life visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).&#xD;
The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The participant is asked to indicate his health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the participant's health state.&#xD;
The EQ VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'.</description>
