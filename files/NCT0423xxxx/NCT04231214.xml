  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a combined LABA/LAMA treatment with&#xD;
      olodaterol/tiotropium on small airway function, autonomic nervous system and cardiac function&#xD;
      in COPD. The main objective is to study the acute effect of dual bronchodilation with&#xD;
      olodaterol/tiotropium on cardiac function measured by MRI. This work is unique as it assesses&#xD;
      the effects of Spiolto® Respimat® on the left-ventricular end-diastolic volume and muscle&#xD;
      sympathetic nerve activity, two endpoints relevant for cardiovascular disease. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the study concept introduces exhaled particle analysis as a measure for small airway&#xD;
      function, thus offering the opportunity for a mechanistic link between airway openness,&#xD;
      hyperinflation, and cardiac function.&#xD;
