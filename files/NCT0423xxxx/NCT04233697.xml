    <textblock>
      This is an open label, Phase IB dose-escalation study of the PI3K inhibitor copanlisib in&#xD;
      combination with romidepsin in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the phase I study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD),&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of the combination of&#xD;
      copanlisib and romidepsin in patients with R/R, NHL or HL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) represent 4-5% of all new cancer cases, and is the seventh&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer death. In 2015, there were an estimated 71,850 cases in the United&#xD;
      States, and approximately 19,790 deaths. An evaluation of the distribution of NHL sub-types&#xD;
      was performed on 114,548 cases of lymphoid neoplasms diagnosed between 1992-2001 and reported&#xD;
      to the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry. Of all NHL, 87,666 were&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoid neoplasms, and 6,228 were considered T/Natural Killer (NK) cell neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are a heterogeneous group of aggressive lymphoid&#xD;
      neoplasms and account for 10-15% of all newly diagnosed cases of NHL. The current prevalence&#xD;
      of PTCL in the United States is estimated to be approximately 9,500 patients. PTCL-Not&#xD;
      Otherwise Specified (NOS), a nodal subtype, is the most common T-cell lymphoma in the United&#xD;
      States and Europe. PTCL is associated with a significantly worse prognosis compared to its&#xD;
      B-cell counterparts. Treatment options for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) PTCL have&#xD;
      been limited. The addition of novel drugs to conventional chemotherapy has largely proven&#xD;
      unsuccessful. Since 2009, new drugs have entered the therapeutic field for patients with R/R&#xD;
      PTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pralatrexate was the first drug approved for patients with R/R PTCL. Other drugs approved for&#xD;
      patients with R/R PTCL include romidepsin and belinostat. These agents appear to exhibit&#xD;
      lineage-specific activity in PTCL. Over the past few years, the investigators have focused on&#xD;
      exploring rational combinations of these T-cell active agents in an effort to develop novel&#xD;
      treatment platforms. Early clinical studies of these combinations have shown very promising&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
