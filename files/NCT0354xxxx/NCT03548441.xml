  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common cause of low back and leg pain in elderly&#xD;
      impacting physical activity and quality of life. Initial treatments are non-surgical options.&#xD;
      If unsuccessful, surgery is advocated. The literature is not clear as to the outcome of&#xD;
      surgery when compared to non-surgical treatment, and the optimal time for surgery is not&#xD;
      explicit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and analysis: This observational study is designed to investigate the course of&#xD;
      treatment, compare effectiveness of surgical and non-surgical treatment in patients with&#xD;
      lumbar spinal stenosis, and identify prognostic factors for outcome in the context of current&#xD;
      clinical practice. Prospectively registered data on treatment, outcome and patient&#xD;
      characteristics are collected from nationwide registers on health and social issues, a&#xD;
      clinical registry of people with chronic back pain and hospital medical records. Primary&#xD;
      outcome is change in physical function measured by the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are changes in symptom severity, pain-related function, health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, and general self-efficacy. All outcomes are measured at baseline, 6 months&#xD;
      and 12 months follow up. Comparisons on these variables will be made between those who&#xD;
      undergo surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis and those not receiving surgery at 12 months&#xD;
      follow up according to different analysis populations. Prognostic factors include treatment&#xD;
      allocation, back and leg pain intensity, comorbidity, duration of symptoms, pre-treatment&#xD;
      function, self-rated health, income, general self-efficacy and magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      graded compression of central stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination: The study has been evaluated by The Regional Committees on Health&#xD;
      Research for Southern Denmark (S-20172000-200) and notified to the Danish Data Protection&#xD;
      Agency (17/30636). All participants provide consent. Findings will be disseminated in&#xD;
      peer-reviewed publications and presented at national and international conferences following&#xD;
      the guidance from the STROBE and PROGRESS statement. Potential sources of bias will be&#xD;
      addressed using ROBINS-I.&#xD;

    <description>Change in physical function score in the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) collected through a clinical registry of people with chronic back pain (SpineData).&#xD;
The ZCQ is a condition-specific self-reported measure of symptom severity, physical function and satisfaction with treatment in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.&#xD;
The questionnaire is composed of three domains (subscales) with a Likert-type scale.&#xD;
The physical function subscale includes 6 items addressing walking distance and walking ability. All but one item have Likert response scales with 4 categories.&#xD;
The physical function subscale score is calculated from the unweighted mean of all answered items.&#xD;
The possible range of the score is 1 to 4.&#xD;
Lower scores indicate less disability.</description>

    <description>Change in symptom severity score in the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) collected through a clinical registry of people with chronic back pain (SpineData).&#xD;
The ZCQ is a condition-specific self-reported measure of symptom severity, physical function and satisfaction with treatment in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.&#xD;
The questionnaire is composed of three domains (subscales) with a Likert-type scale.&#xD;
The symptom severity subscale includes 7 items addressing pain, numbness, weakness and balance disturbances. All but one item have Likert response scales with 5 categories.&#xD;
The possible range of the score is 1 to 5.&#xD;
Lower scores express less symptom severity.</description>

    <description>Change in Oswestry Disability Index collected through a clinical registry of people with chronic back pain (SpineData).&#xD;
The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is a region-specific questionnaire for assessing self-reported levels of disability for patients with spinal disorders.&#xD;
The questionnaire contains 10 pain related sections (items) with 6 response options (statements). Each section of six response options is scored from 0 (no pain) to 5 (most severe pain).&#xD;
For each section of six statements the total score is 5; if the first statement is marked, the score equals 0; if the last (6th) statement is marked, the score equals 5. If more than one box is marked in each section, the highest score is used.&#xD;
The section scores are summarised to a total score, ranging from 0-100. Scores are expressed as a percentage of total points.&#xD;
Lower scores indicate less disability.</description>

    <description>Change in health related quality of life measured by EQ-5D-3L collected through a clinical registry of people with chronic back pain (SpineData).&#xD;
The EQ-5D-3L is a generic self-reported instrument for measuring health-related quality of life consisting of a descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).&#xD;
The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression), each with 3 response options.&#xD;
These are converted into a single summary index by applying preference weights obtained from the general population with a total score ranging from -0.6 to 1, where 1 corresponds to perfect health and 0 to death.&#xD;
Higher scores indicate better health related quality of life,&#xD;
The EQ VAS is a vertical, visual analogue scale scoring patients self-rated health ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).&#xD;
Higher scores indicate better self-perceived health.</description>

    <description>Change in general self-efficacy score obtained by the General Self Efficacy Scale collected through a clinical registry of people with chronic back pain (SpineData).&#xD;
The General Self efficacy scale is a self-reported unidimensional measure of general sense of perceived self-efficacy designed for the general adult population and used in patients with chronic pain.&#xD;
The questionnaire comprises of 10 items (statements) with 4 response options. Responses are scored on a 4-point Likert-scale from 1 (not true at all) to 4 (exactly true).&#xD;
Responses of all 10 items are summarised to yield the final composite score with a range from 10 - 40 points.&#xD;
Higher scores express greater perceived self-efficacy.</description>

The Charlson Comorbidity Index is a method of categorising comorbidities of patients based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes found in administrative data, such as a national patient registry.&#xD;
Each comorbidity category has an associated weight (from 1 to 6), based on the relative risk of 1-year mortality. The sum of all the weights results in a single comorbidity score for a patient.&#xD;
An index score of 0 indicates that no comorbidities were found.&#xD;
A higher index score indicates a higher risk of death within 1 year.</description>

MRI graded compression is estimated using a classification ranging from mild to moderate or severe stenosis.&#xD;
Mild stenosis is defined as narrowing of one-third of the normal area or less, moderate stenosis as narrowing of between one- and two-thirds, and severe stenosis as narrowing of more than two-thirds of the area.</description>
