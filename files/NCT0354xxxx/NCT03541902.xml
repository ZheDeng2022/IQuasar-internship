  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      cabozantinib and sunitinib when given to patients with metastatic (has spread) variant&#xD;
      histology renal cell carcinoma (vhRCC), a type of kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Cabozantinib and sunitinib are both FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer, including vhRCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 84 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no&#xD;
      one knows if one group is better, the same, or worse than the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant is assigned to Group 1, participant will receive cabozantinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant is assigned to Group 2, participant will receive sunitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both participant and the study doctor will know to which group participant has been assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is in Group 1, participant will take cabozantinib tablets by mouth 1 time a&#xD;
      day at about the same time every day while on study with a cup (about 8 ounces) of water. The&#xD;
      tablets must be swallowed whole. Participant should not crush or chew them. Participant's&#xD;
      dose of cabozantinib must be taken on an empty stomach (participant should not eat for at&#xD;
      least 2 hours before and at least 1 hour after participant's dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is in Group 2, participant will take sunitinib tablets by mouth 1 time a day&#xD;
      on a &quot;4 weeks on/2 weeks off&quot; schedule. This means participant will take sunitinib on Days&#xD;
      1-28 and then participant will not take any drug between Days 29-42. Participant may take the&#xD;
      tablets with or without food. Sunitinib tablets should be swallowed whole (participant should&#xD;
      not crush or chew them) with at least 1 cup of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all participants, if participant misses a dose, participant may take it as soon as&#xD;
      participant remembers as long as it has been less than 12 hours of participant's scheduled&#xD;
      dose. If it has been more than 12 hours since participant's missed dose, participant must&#xD;
      wait until participant's next dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in&#xD;
      participant's best interest. Participant may no longer be able to take the study drug if the&#xD;
      disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow&#xD;
      study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will be over after follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 7 days before participant's first dose of study drug, the following tests will be&#xD;
      performed. If participant has had them done recently, they may not need to be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3½ teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests and to check participant's kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected&#xD;
           for a pregnancy test within 24 hours before participant can begin to receive the study&#xD;
           drug(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Week 1 every 6 weeks after that (Weeks 7, 13, 19, 25, and so on):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3½ teaspoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have imaging scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check participant's thyroid function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected&#xD;
           for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days after participant's last dose of study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2½ teaspoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests and to check participant's kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected&#xD;
           for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant has a side effect at the follow-up visit and the doctor thinks it is needed,&#xD;
      participant may be asked to continue having follow-up visits until the side effect goes away&#xD;
      or becomes stable. This will be discussed with participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant stopped taking study drug before the disease gets worse, participant will&#xD;
      continue to have imaging scans every 6 weeks for the first year, then every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the study staff will check up on participant to ask how participant is doing&#xD;
      every 3 months after participant's last dose of the study drugs. This could be either a phone&#xD;
      call or a review of participant's medical and/or other records. If participant is contacted&#xD;
      by phone, the call should only last a few minutes.&#xD;
