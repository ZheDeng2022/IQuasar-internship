    <textblock>
      This open labelled first in human dose phase 1/2a study is designed to evaluate safety,&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy of multiple dosing with individualised VB10.NEO immunotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours including melanoma, non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC), clear renal cell carcinoma, urothelial cancer or squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      of the head and neck (SCCHN), who did not reach complete responses with immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor (CPI) therapy as their standard of care (SOC) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with melanoma, NSCLC, RCC and urothelial carcinoma must upon screening, have been&#xD;
      receiving a CPI (anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1) for at least 12 weeks as the patient's standard of&#xD;
      care. Patients with SCCHN can be screened as long as they have initiated treatment with CPI&#xD;
      as SOC. The VB10.NEO vaccine will be added to continuing CPI treatment and shall not replace,&#xD;
      omit, postpone or terminate the standard therapy. Patients who have been treated with CPI for&#xD;
      at least 12 weeks, will be enrolled in case of some benefit to CPI treatment is expected, as&#xD;
      defined by partial response, stable disease or disease progression (in case of a mixed&#xD;
      response to CPI, provided at least one lesion shows measurable regression and patient,&#xD;
      according to the investigator, would have a clinical benefit of continued immunotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assumption is to combine the immuno-stimulating effect of CPIs with immune responses&#xD;
      towards specific neo-antigens in the vaccine, which may possibly increase the anti-tumour&#xD;
      effect to reach durable efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One arm of the study patients with SCCHN will have the option to be treated with&#xD;
      bempegaldesleukin (NKTR-214) in combination with personalised VB10.NEO. This arm is open for&#xD;
      enrollment from November 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two parts. Part A will evaluate safety, feasibility and&#xD;
      efficacy of individualised VB10.NEO and bempegaldesleukin (NKTR-214) immunotherapy in SCCHN&#xD;
      patients. The expansion part B will explore efficacy and safety in further patients with&#xD;
      selected types of cancer showing signs of efficacy during part A.&#xD;
