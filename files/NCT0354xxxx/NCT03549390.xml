      The amount of people with diabetes has now reached over 4 million in the United Kingdom. Type&#xD;
      2 Diabetes accounts for the majority of all cases of diabetes and increases the risk of many&#xD;
      other diseases, such as heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that individuals from South Asian descent have elevated risk of certain&#xD;
      chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The risk of developing&#xD;
      these diseases can be reduced by engaging in a healthy lifestyle. One component of a healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle is engaging in physical activity. However, previous research has shown that South&#xD;
      Asian individuals engage in less physical activity, compared to other ethnicities. It is not&#xD;
      yet wholly understood why South Asians engage in less physical activity, but it is vitally&#xD;
      important to try and find new ways to increase South Asian physical activity levels.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators have worked with South Asian communities in identifying&#xD;
      culturally appropriate forms of physical activity. From this, yoga and walking were&#xD;
      identified as two forms of culturally appropriate physical activity. This study will test and&#xD;
      compare whether yoga and light intensity walking can be effectively used in the prevention of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes. The results of this study will help the investigators and health policy&#xD;
      makers understand how South Asians and other ethnicities respond to exercise, the therapeutic&#xD;
      benefits of yoga and help inform future diabetes prevention programmes within multi-ethnic&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;

      Physical activity, commonly defined as any movement of skeletal muscle that requires low-mid&#xD;
      level energy expenditure has long been associated with improving cardiometabolic health.&#xD;
      Furthermore, increased PA has more recently been associated with decreased all-cause and&#xD;
      chronic disease mortality. Evidence on lifestyle risk factors such as PA continues to grow&#xD;
      and demonstrate associations with improved health. Interestingly, evidence has suggested type&#xD;
      2 diabetes is a 'lifestyle disease', with 80-90% of the prevalence in any given ethnic group&#xD;
      explained by lifestyle and environmental factors. This suggests lifestyle factors, such as PA&#xD;
      and diet may play a pivotal role in the prevention and management of T2D. The number of&#xD;
      individuals with diabetes has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 425 million in 2017, with&#xD;
      global prevalence in over 18 year olds rising from 4.7% to 8.5% in the same time period. This&#xD;
      illustrates the importance of PA in preventing and managing T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is a disease characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia with disturbances to&#xD;
      carbohydrate metabolism, resulting from the body's impaired ability to produce or respond to&#xD;
      insulin. Diabetes can lead to a number of complications which can reduce a person's quality&#xD;
      of life and life expectancy. The main cause of premature mortality with diabetes is&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Insulin resistance is suggested to be the predominant factor in the&#xD;
      aetiology of T2D. PA has been shown to be a stimulator of insulin sensitivity, both acutely&#xD;
      and chronically. Epidemiological data on PA (and other lifestyle habits) and T2D is important&#xD;
      as it provides associations between exposures and the disease. This research can give a sense&#xD;
      of an association and where robust evidence reinforces these associations, it can be the&#xD;
      starting point for initiating disease prevention programmes based on reducing/increasing&#xD;
      exposure to the risk/preventative factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic review and network meta-analysis of lifestyle, pharmacological and surgical&#xD;
      interventions stated that lifestyle interventions, which included exercise, are beneficial in&#xD;
      reducing the risk of developing T2D, compared to standard care. When focusing on lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions, diet plus exercise plus pedometer had the highest probability of being&#xD;
      effective (HR 0.35 95% CI [0.11-1.14]). Exercise had the second highest probability of being&#xD;
      the most effective lifestyle intervention (HR 0.51 95% CI [0.33-0.82]). The Indian Diabetes&#xD;
      Prevention Programme found improved lifestyle significantly improved cardiometabolic health&#xD;
      in a 42-month study. Improved lifestyle accounted for educational sessions revolving around&#xD;
      improving diet and then engaging in PA. When comparing control, metformin, lifestyle and&#xD;
      lifestyle + metformin groups it was found metformin, lifestyle and lifestyle &amp; metformin&#xD;
      groups significantly delayed time to diabetes, compared to control. The two groups that&#xD;
      involved positive lifestyle changes delayed time to diabetes marginally longer than the&#xD;
      metformin group. The solely lifestyle group delayed time to diabetes the longest over the&#xD;
      entire 42-month period. Similarly, The Diabetes Prevention Program found that incorporating&#xD;
      positive lifestyle changes significantly reduced the cumulative incidence of T2D, compared to&#xD;
      metformin and placebo groups. The lifestyle group were instructed to engage in 150min.week-1&#xD;
      of PA. There was a 58% reduction in incidence of T2D in the lifestyle group, compared to&#xD;
      placebo, in a 4-year follow-up. When participants were split into their respective&#xD;
      ethnicities, American Indians and Asians saw the greatest reductions in T2D incidence. At 10&#xD;
      year post trial follow up, the lifestyle group still had significantly lower cumulative&#xD;
      incidence of T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The molecular mechanisms by which PA affects insulin have been heavily researched. In brief,&#xD;
      after one bout of exercise there is an immediate increase in glucose uptake to the skeletal&#xD;
      muscle, which is in response to muscle contraction. This increase is thought to be due to&#xD;
      increased GLUT-4 translocation to the cell surface, which increases insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
      Additionally, exercise may increase oxidative metabolism in mitochondria in the skeletal&#xD;
      muscle. An increase in the size and number of mitochondria in the cells improves oxidative&#xD;
      capacity, decreasing the amounts of TG and fatty acids. TG and fatty acids interfere with the&#xD;
      insulin signalling process, which may cause insulin resistance. This reiterates the&#xD;
      importance of PA in T2D prevention and management. Additionally, physical inactivity and&#xD;
      sedentary behaviour have both been noted to disrupt normal metabolic state and chronically&#xD;
      increase insulin resistance/decrease insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other mechanisms that PA may improve T2D by are improving lipoprotein profile, endothelial&#xD;
      function (and subsequently hypertension), reducing obesity and increasing anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidently, PA is vitally important in the prevention and management of T2D. However, rates of&#xD;
      PA are worryingly low in the UK and globally. Globally, it is stated 1 in 4 adults are not&#xD;
      active enough and more than 80% of world's adolescent population are insufficiently&#xD;
      physically active (WHO). Within the UK, 39% (20 million) of adults do not meet recommended&#xD;
      guidelines for PA. Importantly, PA levels in UK South Asian populations are reported to be&#xD;
      lower, compared to White European populations. This trend is particularly evident among women&#xD;
      and older individuals. Consequently, specific ethnicities may need culturally appropriate and&#xD;
      alternative forms of PA to engage them. To date, public health guidelines have largely been&#xD;
      based on results from studies in Caucasian populations. It is essential that governments and&#xD;
      public health organisations engage individuals in more novel, appropriate and culturally&#xD;
      specific practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, researching culturally appropriate and alternative forms of exercise is important&#xD;
      in understanding whether different types of exercise will engage individuals more and improve&#xD;
      adherence, ultimately improving health. For example, SAs form the largest ethnic minority&#xD;
      group in the UK and 1 in 5 individuals globally and while it is known PA can positively&#xD;
      impact the health of SAs, it is not fully understood what types of PA can engage SA ethnic&#xD;
      groups most effectively. This is of particular importance because the prevalence of T2D is 2&#xD;
      to 4 times higher in SAs, compared to WEs. India is estimated to have a diabetes prevalence&#xD;
      of 134.3 million by 2045, with Pakistan and Bangladesh estimated at 16.1 and 13.7 million,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, culturally appropriate forms of exercise are needed. Intervention trial data has&#xD;
      suggested that yoga may yield similar health benefits to conventional exercise. Yoga is an&#xD;
      ancient Indian tradition that embodies unity of body, mind, emotion and energy and has been&#xD;
      part of traditional Indian spiritual practice for millennia. There are different forms of&#xD;
      yoga that focus on slightly different aspects of one's self, with these respective&#xD;
      philosophies varying focus on meditation (dhyana), body postures (asana) and breathing&#xD;
      techniques (pranayama). Regardless of these different philosophies, yoga has over recent&#xD;
      years become more prominent in improving physical and mental wellbeing worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two recent systematic reviews on yoga and T2D state yoga improves HbA1c, fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose and postprandial blood glucose. Additionally, significant improvements were found in&#xD;
      lipid profile, blood pressure and body composition. Overall, the metabolic benefits of yoga&#xD;
      are not fully understood, particularly in those at high-risk of T2D. Further research is&#xD;
      required on the metabolic benefits of yoga. Additionally, it is suggested that yoga may also&#xD;
      have benefits to mental health, quality of life and emotional state. Data are needed to&#xD;
      evaluate how individuals may respond psychologically to yoga, compared to traditional&#xD;
      exercise, especially when used as a therapy to improve metabolic health in those at high&#xD;
      diabetes and cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a gap in the literature investigating the metabolic benefits of culturally&#xD;
      appropriate and alternative forms of exercise in different ethnicities. Specifically, there&#xD;
      is a lack of high-quality research investigating the health benefits of yoga in relation to&#xD;
      T2D prevention, and comparing health benefits of yoga and traditional forms of PA. Therefore,&#xD;
      this research will investigate the effects of yoga on glycaemic control in a multi-ethnic&#xD;
      population at risk of type 2 diabetes and to compare these effects against matched&#xD;
      traditional exercise and a non-exercise control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical design Based on a previous study undertaken by the investigators group in a&#xD;
      multi-ethnic population (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02453204), 24 are needed to&#xD;
      complete the trial. This is based on estimating a reduction in incremental area under the&#xD;
      insulin curve from 76 to 53 mU/l x hr (30% reduction) in either exercise intervention group,&#xD;
      a standard deviation of 38 mU/l x hr, a within person correlation of 0.05, a power of 80% and&#xD;
      a significance of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting The study will be co-ordinated within the Leicester Biomedical Research Centre&#xD;
      (Leicester Diabetes Centre) at the Leicester General Hospital. Clinical measurement sessions&#xD;
      will be carried out by the appointed research team. Participants will be asked to visit the&#xD;
      study centre on six occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This study is a three period crossover design. There are three experimental&#xD;
      conditions (yoga, continuous exercise and control) and participants will be randomised to one&#xD;
      of six sequences requiring them to complete all three conditions.&#xD;

    <description>The yoga session will be held in a room where lighting, temperature and music can be regulated. The session will be led by a trained instructor and involve a combination of body postures, breathing techniques and meditation. There will be a series of progressive breath centred yoga poses named Sun Salutations A &amp; B for participants to complete, which have been chosen based on PPI and current relevant yoga practices. Sun Salutations A &amp; B will be completed in a continuous sequence and aim to be completed with one breath per pose, but can be modified based on participant ability.</description>

    <description>The exercise will be 30 minutes of treadmill walking. During the initial stages of walking, participants will gradually be taken up to a speed that registers between 10 and 12 on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Scale, up to a maximum of 4.0 km/h. This speed will be fixed for the entire exercise period. This exercise intensity has been chosen as it is the exercise intensity matched to light-moderate physical activity.</description>
