      The Effectiveness of the Jamboxx Respiratory Therapy Device in Treatment of Patients with&#xD;
      Decreased Respiratory Function is a proposal for investigation of the application of gaming&#xD;
      to improving respiratory health. The Jamboxx device (see appendix A for device details)&#xD;
      combines gaming with traditional incentive spirometry to provide users with a fun experience&#xD;
      to keep them engaged in their respiratory therapy routine. The device allows users to play a&#xD;
      series of mini-games that walk them through their routines. The Jamboxx also records airflow&#xD;
      and lung parameters with an external mouthpiece attachment to provide users with real time&#xD;
      feedback, and helps to assess increases or decreases in relative lung function over time. The&#xD;
      Jamboxx has the potential to significantly impact the field of respiratory therapy by being&#xD;
      one of the first gaming devices for patient therapy, and the first respiratory therapy gaming&#xD;
      device that is accessible to users with limited mobility. Jamboxx provides a fun and&#xD;
      engaging, low cost alternative to the traditional therapy techniques used and aims to improve&#xD;
      patient compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study addresses postoperative pulmonary atelectasis that results from diaphragm&#xD;
      dysfunction and pain following upper abdominal surgery. This issue is a major cause of&#xD;
      morbidity in these patients (Ford et al 1983). Incentive spirometry is used in this setting,&#xD;
      but there is conflicting data regarding its effectiveness (Rupp et al 2013). Study 3 will&#xD;
      focus on the questions regarding the influence of education and a novel use of a gaming&#xD;
      device on prevention of atelectasis. Study 3 will include 3 subgroups of subjects. The first&#xD;
      subject group will be enrolled in a nonintrusive observation only studies. Group 1 will&#xD;
      explore the effect of technology via a tablet device on standard spirometry usage. Group 2&#xD;
      will look at the combined effect of technology via the tablet device and intensive education&#xD;
      on compliance and reduction of post-surgical atelectasis. Finally, Group 3 will explore the&#xD;
      effect of gaming technology with intensive educational reinforcement on compliance and&#xD;
      reduction of post-surgical atelectasis.&#xD;

      Testing Plan: Study participants will be enrolled sequentially in one of three study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Group 1 - the first 25 patients will be consented to participate by a member of the&#xD;
      research team. These study patients will receive a study information/authorization sheet&#xD;
      about the study prior to surgery during their pre-operative clinic visit. This subgroup will&#xD;
      be provided postoperatively with an incentive spirometer connected to a tablet interface.&#xD;
      This tablet device uses a digital interface to mimic the look and function of the standard&#xD;
      issue incentive spirometer. Subjects in this group will receive current standard of care with&#xD;
      routine surgical and RN encouragement to use the spirometer. The tablet will monitor and&#xD;
      record spirometer device utilization. Demographic data (age ( or &gt;89), gender, ethnicity) and&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI) will be collected. No patient identifiers will be collected. At 72&#xD;
      hours or at discharge, the devices will be exchanged for standard issue incentive spirometer.&#xD;
      Research staff will extract the demographic data described above as well as BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized Study Subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Groups 2 and 3 are active study groups. -Patients will be randomized via a random number&#xD;
      generator post-operatively to group 2 or 3, stratified by surgery type (laparoscopic or open)&#xD;
      . Each subgroup will include a total of 72 randomized participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 : These study patients will be consented by members of the research team prior to&#xD;
      surgery at their pre-operative clinic visit. The patient will receive RT or RN education&#xD;
      preoperatively as to the importance of incentive spirometry in prevention of post-operative&#xD;
      respiratory complications. This subgroup will be provided with an incentive spirometer&#xD;
      connected to a tablet interface. This tablet device uses a digital interface to mimic the&#xD;
      look and function of the standard issue incentive spirometer, and will set a spirometry goal&#xD;
      while collecting usage and pulmonary function data. Subjects in this group will also receive&#xD;
      daily intensive education from a study team member during the postoperative time up until 72&#xD;
      hours or until discharge. This education will be done to reinforce the standard instruction&#xD;
      provided by the hospital staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff will collect data on pain, utilization of incentive spirometry, and room air&#xD;
      oximetry. The oximetry measurements will be collected after patients have been off of oxygen&#xD;
      for between 3.5 to 4 minutes. For patients requiring high levels of supplemental oxygen&#xD;
      (pulse oximetry measurement (&lt;90%), oxygen will not be removed for pulse oximetry&#xD;
      measurements. The additional education and oximetry measure will be collected by a&#xD;
      respiratory therapist three times a day at the preferred times of 0600, 1200 and 1800 post&#xD;
      operatively. Patients will remain on study for 72 hours post-surgery, return to the OR, SICU&#xD;
      admission or medical prescription of directed chest physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Chest x-ray will be obtained at 48 hours post-surgery. Demographic data (age ( or &gt;89),&#xD;
      gender, ethnicity), pulmonary function data and body mass index (BMI) will be collected. No&#xD;
      patient identifiers will be collected. At 72 hours or at discharge, the devices will be&#xD;
      exchanged for standard issue incentive spirometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: These study patients will be consented by a member of the research team prior to&#xD;
      surgery at their pre-operative clinic visit. The patients will receive RT or RN education&#xD;
      preoperatively as to the importance of incentive spirometry in prevention of post-operative&#xD;
      respiratory complications. This subgroup will be provided with both intensive education&#xD;
      reinforcement and a spirometry tablet device that also includes multiple gaming programs. The&#xD;
      games are meant to encourage incentive spirometry and are programmed to progress in&#xD;
      accordance with the patient's personal increasing capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This tablet device uses a digital interface to mimic the look and function of the standard&#xD;
      issue incentive spirometer, and will set a spirometry goal while collecting usage and&#xD;
      pulmonary function data. Subjects in this group will also receive daily intensive education&#xD;
      from a study team member during the postoperative time up until 72 hours or until discharge.&#xD;
      This education will be done to reinforce the standard instruction provided by the hospital&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff will collect data on pain, utilization of incentive spirometry, and room air&#xD;
      oximetry. The oximetry measurements will be collected after patients have been off of oxygen&#xD;
      for between 3.5 to 4 minutes. For patients requiring high levels of supplemental oxygen&#xD;
      (pulse oximetry measurement &lt;90%),oxygen will not be removed for pulse oximetry measurements.&#xD;
      The additional education and oximetry measure will be collected by a respiratory therapist&#xD;
      three times a day at the preferred times of 0600, 1200 and 1800 post operatively. Patients&#xD;
      will remain on study for 72 hours post-surgery, return to the OR, SICU admission or medical&#xD;
      prescription of directed chest physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Chest x-ray will be obtained at 48 hours post-surgery. Demographic data (age ( or &gt;89),&#xD;
      gender, ethnicity), pulmonary function data and body mass index (BMI) will be collected. No&#xD;
      patient identifiers will be collected. At 72 hours or at discharge, the devices will be&#xD;
      exchanged for standard issue incentive spirometer.&#xD;
