  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to improve the delivery of an established,&#xD;
      evidence-based intervention (cognitive-behavioral therapy-CBT) in Michigan schools through&#xD;
      different implementation strategies designed to better educate school professionals.&#xD;
      Specifically, the study will assist the ongoing Transforming Research into Action to Improve&#xD;
      the Lives of Students (TRAILS) Program by evaluating different ways to educate school&#xD;
      professionals (SPs) to improve their delivery of CBT to high school students and ultimately&#xD;
      improve student mental health outcomes in the state of Michigan. The three educational&#xD;
      approaches are Replicating Effective Programs (REP), Coaching, and Facilitation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study seeks to develop an effective and efficient sequence of implementation strategies&#xD;
      for encouraging delivery of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) by school professionals in&#xD;
      high schools across Michigan. In the run-in phase, all schools will receive support and&#xD;
      training from REP for three months. After three months, schools will be randomized to either&#xD;
      (1) continue with REP; or (1) augment REP with a minimum of 12 weeks of coaching. Eight weeks&#xD;
      after this first randomization, schools will be evaluated to determine whether they might&#xD;
      also benefit from an augmentation of their current strategy with Facilitation. Schools that&#xD;
      could benefit from Facilitation (defined as delivering 3 or more CBT modules to less than 10&#xD;
      students or reporting 3 or more organizational barriers to delivering CBT) will be&#xD;
      re-randomized to either (1) continue with their current strategy (REP or REP + Coaching); or&#xD;
      (2) have their current strategy augmented with Facilitation. All implementation support will&#xD;
      be discontinued 12 months after first randomization; outcomes will be assessed through 18&#xD;
      months after study start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This results in four sequences of implementation strategies: REP only; REP + Facilitation for&#xD;
      those who did not adequately respond initially to REP alone; REP + Coaching; and REP +&#xD;
      Coaching + Facilitation for those who did not adequately respond initially to REP + Coaching.&#xD;

    <description>All schools enrolled will first be randomized to an optimal first line treatment in order to compare REP vs. REP + Coaching. Schools assigned to Stage 1 treatment &quot;REP&quot; will receive a daylong didactic training covering core elements of CBT and proper screening and identification of students; training to help SPs identify eligible students; a package that includes tools to deploy CBT; and ongoing technical assistance in CBT implementation. Schools assigned to Stage 1 treatment &quot;REP + Coaching&quot; will receive the REP components plus weekly visits from a CBT expert or &quot;Coach&quot;, for a minimum of 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>After 2 months, schools will be assessed to determine whether they could benefit from augmenting their current strategy with a step-up strategy called &quot;Facilitation&quot;. Schools identified as potentially benefiting will be re-randomized to compare the added value of augmenting their current strategy with Facilitation, compared to continuing with their same strategy. Stage 2 treatment strategy: step-up will include provision of an additional implementation strategy called &quot;Facilitation&quot;. A full-time Facilitator who is a member of the study team and has expertise in CBT, implementation methods, and use of EBPs in schools will support school professionals in strategic thinking and leadership skills to address organizational barriers. Sites receiving Facilitation will receive regular calls for up to a minimum of 10 weeks from the Facilitator. All schools will also continue to receive their first line treatment (i.e. REP or REP + Coaching).</description>

Stage 2 Randomization: All 83 schools (employing 154 SPs) identified as potentially benefitting from augmentation with Facilitation (i.e., &quot;schools that did not respond sufficiently following Stage 1 strategy&quot;) were re-randomized at Stage 2.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of CBT Sessions Delivered by School Professionals to Students After 18 Months</title>
        <description>School professionals include counselors, social workers, and trained mental health providers working within the school. The primary aim is a comparison of schools offered the REP only intervention (the least intensive strategy) versus schools offered the adaptive implementation strategy involving REP, Coaching, and Facilitation (the most intensive strategy).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to 18-months</time_frame>
        <population>The primary outcome measure pertains to delivery of CBT by school professionals only, and thus the number analyzed reflects data categorized by number of school professionals that had REP only vs. most intensive intervention: REP, Coaching and Facilitation</population>

Thus, it corresponds in Participant Flow to both the REP only, Responders Continue and REP Only, Non-Responders Continue. The 43 professionals represent 26 schools.</description>

A full-time Facilitator who is a member of the study team and has expertise in CBT, implementation methods, and use of EBPs in schools supported school professionals in strategic thinking and leadership skills to address organizational barriers. Sites receiving Facilitation received regular calls for a minimum of 10 weeks from the Facilitator.&#xD;

            <title>Group 2: REP + Coaching, Responders Continue and REP + Coaching With Facilitation</title>
            <description>This arm consists of those schools that received REP + Coaching in Stage 1, who were either Responders after Stage 1 or, as Non-Responders were randomized to additionally receive &quot;Facilitation&quot; in Stage 2. A full-time Facilitator who is a member of the study team and has expertise in CBT, implementation methods, and use of EBPs in schools supported school professionals in strategic thinking and leadership skills to address organizational barriers. Sites receiving Facilitation received regular calls for a minimum of 10 weeks from the Facilitator.&#xD;
Thus, this arm represents &quot;REP + Coaching Responders, Continue&quot; and &quot;REP + Coaching, Non-Responders, Facilitation&quot; from the Participant Flow. The 45 professionals represent 26 schools.</description>
