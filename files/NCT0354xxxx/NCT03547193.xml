      Background: Unpredictable laryngoscopic difficulty remains a dramatic challenge for&#xD;
      anaesthesiologists. Ultrasound (US) based airway assessment has been recently proposed as a&#xD;
      useful tool in adjunct to clinical methods, but to date few studies are available about the&#xD;
      potential role of ultrasound in difficult airway evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the correlation between the sonographic measurements of&#xD;
      anterior cervical soft tissues's thickness and Cormack-Lehane grade view at direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy in patients with normal clinical screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective, single blinded, observational study. Number of patients: 300 adult&#xD;
      patients Methods: All patients are assessed before surgery to evaluate clinical evidence of&#xD;
      difficult airways. Simultaneous ultrasound measures of the anterior cervical soft tissues are&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At induction of anaesthesia the laryngoscopic view is graded by a different anaesthetist,&#xD;
      blinded to the ultrasound assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) are used to determine the &quot;difficulty&#xD;
      prediction capability&quot; of each sonographic measurement and to assess the optimal cut-off&#xD;
      scores To allow for comparisons between &quot;restricted-difficult&quot; airway and &quot;easy&quot; airway&#xD;
      groups, a two-sided Student's t-test and Fisher's exact test is employed as appropriate. The&#xD;
      results will be averaged (mean ± standard deviation SD) for each parameter for continuous&#xD;
      data. Values of p &lt; 0.05 are considered as statistically significant.&#xD;

      Unpredictable laryngoscopic difficulty, especially if difficult ventilation occurs, during&#xD;
      standard laryngoscopy, remains a dramatic challenge for anaesthesiologists. Accurate airway&#xD;
      assessment should always be performed, but the common clinical screening tests have shown low&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity with a limited predictive value. Ultrasound (US) based airway&#xD;
      assessment has been recently proposed as a useful, simple, bedside and non-invasive tool in&#xD;
      adjunct to clinical methods, but to date few studies are available about the potential role&#xD;
      of ultrasound in difficult airway evaluation and these are mostly limited on specific groups&#xD;
      of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective, single blinded, observational study is to determine the&#xD;
      correlation between two neck ultrasound measures assessed at the pre-operative visit and&#xD;
      Cormack-Lehane grade view at direct laryngoscopy, assessed at the induction of anaesthesia 24&#xD;
      hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: During the pre-operative visit (24 hours before surgery), clinical screening tests&#xD;
      to predict a difficult airway are performed and the anterior cervical soft tissue's thickness&#xD;
      is assesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thickness of the anterior cervical soft tissues is measured at two levels, thyro-hyoid&#xD;
      membrane (pre-epiglottis space) and vocal cords (laryngeal inlet), using a US probe 10-13-MHz&#xD;
      linear transducer placed in the transverse plane with the patient's head in neutral position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each level the distance from the skin in the median axis in cm (mDSE = median distance&#xD;
      skin to epiglottis; mVC = median distance skin to vocal cords) and the surrounding Area in&#xD;
      cm2 (PEA = pre-epiglottis area; AVC = Area pre vocal cords) are measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the induction of anaesthesia the laryngoscopic view is graded by a different anaesthetist&#xD;
      blinded to the ultrasound assessments and with more than 5 years of experience with OR&#xD;
      activity. For each patient it's considered only the best attempt at direct laryngoscopy&#xD;
      obtained after optimizing position, complete muscle relaxation (TOF=0), and, if necessary,&#xD;
      external laryngeal manipulation. A decrease of SpO2 &lt; 92% is a criterion for abandoning the&#xD;
      procedure and a maximum of three attempts are admitted before declaring intubation failure&#xD;
      with direct laryngoscopy. A Cormack-Lehane Grade 1 or 2a are classified as easy laryngoscopy&#xD;
      and grade 2b - 3a - 3b or 4 as restricted or difficult laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALISYS: According to the literature, ultrasound measurements should predict as&#xD;
      difficult at least 80% of the intubations that are really difficult (with a C-L ≥ 2b). Since&#xD;
      the incidence of difficult intubation is about 5-10% of all intubations 1-3,6, it is&#xD;
      necessary to study at least 244 patients in order to obtain statistically significant&#xD;
      differences between the two groups accepting an alpha error of 0.05 and a beta error of 0.20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov's test is used to test the normality of distribution. Receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristic curves (ROC) is used to determine the &quot;difficulty prediction capability&quot; of&#xD;
      each sonographic measurement and to assess the optimal cut-off scores To allow for&#xD;
      comparisons between &quot;restricted-difficult&quot; airway and &quot;easy&quot; airway groups, a two-sided&#xD;
      Student's t-test and Fisher's exact test are employed as appropriate. The results will be&#xD;
      averaged (mean ± standard deviation SD) for each parameter for continuous data. Values of p &lt;&#xD;
      0.05 were considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS: Ethical approval for this study was provided by Marche's Regional Ethics Committee&#xD;
      (CERM), Ancona, ITA (Protocol No. 2016-0405); Chairperson: Prof Marcello D'Errico on 23 March&#xD;
      2017. Informed written consent was obtained. The study conformed to the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.&#xD;
