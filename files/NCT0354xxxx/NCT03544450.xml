    <textblock>
      Psychological treatments may be provided by non-medical health workers (NMHW) to increase&#xD;
      accessibility. Task shifting of screening and treatment of non-communicable diseases to&#xD;
      non-medical health workers is both effective and cost-effective. A recent review included&#xD;
      five randomized controlled trials to assess effectiveness of NMHW provided psychological&#xD;
      interventions to treat common mental disorders and depression, and all five trials found the&#xD;
      intervention beneficial over usual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of psychosocial counselling as practiced&#xD;
      by non-medical psychosocial counsellors in improving the outcomes of persons with common&#xD;
      mental disorders in a primary health care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with psychosocial distress will be randomized to receive either counseling +&#xD;
      enhanced usual care or enhanced usual care by health workers. The hypothesis is that adding&#xD;
      psychosocial counselling to enhanced usual care, will be more effective than enhanced care&#xD;
      alone in reducing the symptoms of depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder and&#xD;
      in improving day-to-day functioning of clients receiving services in primary health care&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If proven effective, non-medical health worker led counseling could be an affordable&#xD;
      treatment to alleviate psychological suffering and improve functional capacity of Nepalese&#xD;
      people.&#xD;

      Statement of problem&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychosocial interventions, such as counselling, are effective in improving social&#xD;
      functioning in common mental disorders. Specifically, culturally adapted psychological&#xD;
      treatments are effective in the treatment of depression, according to a recent meta-analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological treatments may be provided by non-medical health workers (NMHW) to increase&#xD;
      accessibility. Task-shifting of screening and treatment of non-communicable diseases to&#xD;
      non-medical health workers is both effective and cost-effective. A recent review included&#xD;
      five randomized controlled trials to assess effectiveness of NMHW provided psychological&#xD;
      interventions to treat common mental disorders and depression, and all five trials found the&#xD;
      intervention beneficial over usual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the MANAS trial in India, for example, those receiving the intervention were 55% more&#xD;
      likely to recover from common mental disorders than the control group in public health&#xD;
      facilities. The stepped-care intervention was provided by NMHWs who had received a two-month&#xD;
      training in counselling. In Pakistan, a psychological treatment delivered by Lady Health&#xD;
      Workers (NMHWs) resulted in 78% reduction in maternal depression, compared with usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Nepal, the need for psychosocial interventions led by NMHWs is high because of the very&#xD;
      limited number of mental health professionals. Centre for Victims of Torture (CVICT) has&#xD;
      extensive experience in developing psychosocial counseling services and training counsellors.&#xD;
      CVICT has experienced that even a short intervention, including only 1-5 counselling&#xD;
      sessions, leads to decreased mental distress. Positive feedback has been given both by the&#xD;
      patients and the people working in primary health care. However, no rigorous research has&#xD;
      been conducted on the effectiveness of counselling on the symptoms of common mental&#xD;
      disorders. This will be the first study comparing the effectiveness of psychosocial&#xD;
      counseling and enhanced usual care to enhanced usual in rural Nepal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conceptual framework&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will examine the added value of psychosocial counseling in individuals with&#xD;
      psychological distress when provided together with enhanced usual care in rural health posts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychosocial approach emphasizes the close connection between psychological aspects of an&#xD;
      individual's experience (namely, thoughts, feelings and beliefs) and the wider social&#xD;
      experience (namely, relationships with family, community and friends) as well as the broader&#xD;
      social environment (i.e. culture, traditions, religion, socio-political environment). There&#xD;
      is a dynamic relationship between the psychological and social effects of experiences on the&#xD;
      individual person, with each continually influencing the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychosocial counselling starts with the complaints that a client brings into the session,&#xD;
      and is aimed at decreasing disability. The client is assisted in dealing with problems&#xD;
      himself/herself within a counselling process, or is sometimes referred to other existing&#xD;
      resources if the counsellor feels that to be more appropriate. Specifically, the counselling&#xD;
      process consists of: (i) introduction, explanation and rapport building; (ii) assessment of&#xD;
      and understanding of the problem (including looking for positive assets); (iii) goal setting&#xD;
      (asking the client what outcomes are preferred); (iv) problem management (exploring and&#xD;
      identifying solutions, brainstorming, working with existing coping strategies, using social&#xD;
      and cultural resources, and additional techniques such as relaxation and psycho-education);&#xD;
      (v) implementation (making a plan of action and transition); and, finally, (vi) termination&#xD;
      of counselling (including closing and follow-up). This process helps to reduce psychological&#xD;
      distress experienced by the patients and is practiced by trained psychosocial counselors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced usual care is provided by health workers, who have already been trained on diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment of common mental disorders, and usage of basic psychosocial counseling skills&#xD;
      (communication, listening and basic emotional support).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to note that in this conceptual framework psychosocial counselling is just&#xD;
      one part of the spectrum of psychosocial care and dealing with distress in Nepal's context&#xD;
      where there are other issues such as poverty, human rights abuses, gender based violence etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial counseling as practiced by non-medical&#xD;
      psychosocial counselors in improve the outcomes of persons with common health disorders in&#xD;
      primary health care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial counselling on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improving functional capacity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improving coping and use of available resources&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess acceptability of psychosocial counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, coping mechanisms and usage of available resources,&#xD;
      functional capacity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covariates: Demographic variable (gender, age, socioeconomic position)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Sampling methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a randomized controlled trial, randomization will be done using a randomization&#xD;
      table. Participants coming to the health post for treatment of symptoms of psychological&#xD;
      distress will be potential participants for this research. Individuals referred by the&#xD;
      counselors during their field mental health promotion work will also be potential&#xD;
      participants for this research. Individuals will be screened with the General Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire (GHQ-12, validated Nepali version, and those who score 6 or more on will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study. The Research Assistant will use the GHQ. In the Nepali&#xD;
      context, score of 6 or more in the GHQ-12 reveals psychological distress. The GHQ-12 was&#xD;
      validated using Likert scale in Nepal. Randomization will be done by a health worker at the&#xD;
      health post. Research Assistant will be blinded to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling size&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 132 in each group will be required to detect a clinically important&#xD;
      difference of three points on the Beck scale of depression (BDI: Beck Depression Inventory),&#xD;
      using a two-tailed test of the difference between means and a power of 80%, and a&#xD;
      significance level of 5%. Based on a previous study, we assume a standard deviation of 8.7&#xD;
      for BDI and also the calculation is based on the assumption that the measurements on BDI are&#xD;
      normally distributed. However, considering the possible 30% dropout rates, we will need to&#xD;
      recruit 176 individuals per group, 352 in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on paper and stored safely in lockers. No names will appear on study&#xD;
      forms. All participants will be read out consent forms and asked to sign on the form. All&#xD;
      questions of the data tools will be read aloud and participants will be asked to choose which&#xD;
      level they agree with on Likert's scale. RA's data and counselors data will be kept&#xD;
      separately. Study coordinator will enter data into SPSS bi-weekly. Participants will be&#xD;
      referred by the project counselors, female community health volunteers and health workers of&#xD;
      other health posts to the centres for study/ treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the Quantitative study, questionnaires will be used to collect the data from each group.&#xD;
      The questionnaire will have five sections. The sections are: Socio and Demographic&#xD;
      information, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), World Health&#xD;
      Organization Disability Assessment Schedule-II (WHODAS-II) and Resource and Coping Mechanism&#xD;
      will be used. All in all tools are validated in Nepal and study area (Dang), availed in&#xD;
      Nepali language and used by CVICT in their previous Research.&#xD;
