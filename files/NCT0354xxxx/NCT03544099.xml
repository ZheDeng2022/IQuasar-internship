      This is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label, phase II trial to examine the efficacy of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab for prolonging the one-year disease free survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma&#xD;
      patients with solely detectable EBV DNA after curative chemoradiation. Sixty-three patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase II study is aimed to prove the efficacy of adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab for&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with detectable plasma EBV DNA after curative&#xD;
      chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal cancer was a malignancy related to Epstein-Barr virus infection. It was a&#xD;
      malignancy endemic in Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and China. The primary treatment was&#xD;
      chemoradiation. The three-year disease free survival was around 50-60% for locally-advanced&#xD;
      (stage IVA, IVB) NPC. Adjuvant chemotherapy after curative chemoradiation is a strategy to&#xD;
      improve disease control rate for advanced NPC. However, two phase III trials in Taiwan (TCOG&#xD;
      1394) and China failed to prove its efficacy on improving disease control and overall&#xD;
      survival. How to identify patients who are truly at risk is an important question for the&#xD;
      therapy of advanced NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma EBV DNA copy number is a biomarker predicting the recurrent risk of nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      cancer. A higher level of plasma EBV DNA before chemoradiation is related to a poorer&#xD;
      prognosis. A detectable EBV DNA after chemoradiation, which is a hint for occult residual or&#xD;
      metastatic disease, is a strong predictor for early recurrence. The relapse free survival at&#xD;
      two years for patients with detectable plasma EBV DNA (&gt; 0 copies/mL) was around 20%. The&#xD;
      results of other similar trials are summarized on table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer cells escaped from the immune surveillance by several mechanisms. One of them is&#xD;
      activating immune inhibitory pathway by &quot;immune checkpoints&quot; . Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) and&#xD;
      Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) is one immune checkpoint axis to regulate immune response&#xD;
      against cancer. Pembrolizumab (MK-3475), an anti-PD-1 antibody, had a good activity against&#xD;
      melanoma and other types of cancers. The toxicity profiles were tolerable. In the Keynote-028&#xD;
      phase Ib trial, pembrolizumab showed good clinical activity against recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
      NPC. The overall response rate is 22%, and the disease control rate is 77.8%. This data is&#xD;
      encouraging for further clinical trials of pembrolizumab for NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 axis has an important role for the resistance of chemoradiation[18]. In patients&#xD;
      refractory to chemoradiation, the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 increased in the tumor. In&#xD;
      animal model, sequential administration of anti-PD-1 after radiation significantly improved&#xD;
      the progression free survival in mice with tumors [19]. This concept supports the&#xD;
      investigator's sequential design for high-risk NPC patients.&#xD;
