  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study follows a group of patients admitted to the PICU who are identified as being at&#xD;
      risk for developing acute kidney injury. The investigators will use risk-stratification,&#xD;
      biomarker testing, and a functional assessment to predict patients who will become fluid&#xD;
      overloaded and develop acute kidney injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the pediatric population, acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonly observed in critically ill&#xD;
      patients. At this time, there are no standardized care pathways that begin at identifying&#xD;
      patients at risk for developing AKI and progress through to early recognition and treatment.&#xD;
      Through previous work, the investigators have developed, tested, and integrated an AKI&#xD;
      risk-stratification/clinical recognition tool (RAI) and a urine biomarker (NGAL) to try to&#xD;
      identify patients at risk vs. not at-risk for developing AKI. However, these factors alone&#xD;
      have yet to be integrated into clinical decision support to optimize AKI therapies and&#xD;
      patient outcomes. The furosemide stress test (FST), previously described in adults, may be a&#xD;
      good predictor for the patients who need acute dialysis for AKI versus those that can be&#xD;
      managed medically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this study, the investigators will be following a cohort of patients admitted to the&#xD;
      PICU who are identified as being at risk for developing AKI through RAI and NGAL results. The&#xD;
      aim is to standardize the FST in this population, as well as determine the accuracy of the&#xD;
      RAI-NGAL-FST clinical decision tool in predicting patients who become fluid overloaded and&#xD;
      develop AKI.&#xD;
