  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-site study will test the efficacy of an intervention to train and equip&#xD;
      pharmacists to provide naloxone, an overdose antidote, to patients using prescribed and&#xD;
      illicit opioids, to improve opioid safety and prevent opioid-involved adverse events. The&#xD;
      study will carry out a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized trial implemented over five waves,&#xD;
      within two chain community pharmacies across four states with varying pharmacy-based naloxone&#xD;
      distribution laws: Oregon, Washington, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Our specific study&#xD;
      aims are to: 1) integrate two successful demonstration research projects into one cohesive&#xD;
      educational program (MOON+), 2) evaluate the effectiveness of MOON + on naloxone-related&#xD;
      outcomes, and 3) use mixed methods to further explore the impact and implementation of MOON+&#xD;
      and associated factors (e.g., state policy, store policy, region).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to integrate two pharmacy-focused educational interventions&#xD;
      designed to increase pharmacy based naloxone (PBN) dispensing and improve opioid safety. The&#xD;
      intervention is comprised of two successful demonstration research projects (RESPOND, PI:&#xD;
      Hartung; MOON, PI: Green), which include online and one-on-one educational outreach (i.e.&#xD;
      academic detailing) demonstrated to provide knowledge and training for pharmacists to&#xD;
      identify and effectively engage with patients who may be at high-risk for an opioid overdose.&#xD;
      This study tests the combined interventions' effectiveness at improving opioid safety&#xD;
      engagement and naloxone-related outcomes in community pharmacies. The following primary&#xD;
      specific aims will drive this research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 1: The research team and study pharmacy partners will work collaboratively to&#xD;
      integrate MOON and RESPOND into MOON+, including the creation of a website to host&#xD;
      intervention components. Feedback from community partners and pharmacy professional&#xD;
      associations will be sought to finalize the MOON+ content and materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 2: We will conduct a stepped wedge, cluster randomized design in 160 pharmacies&#xD;
      throughout Oregon, Washington, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Implementation will occur&#xD;
      across five waves, each of which will include a baseline survey, toolkit orientation session,&#xD;
      academic detailing, an online course, and access to printed onsite materials (algorithm,&#xD;
      checklists, stickers, posters). The targeted population is pharmacists and pharmacy managers&#xD;
      in CVS pharmacies (MA and NH) and Albertsons Companies (OR and WA) across the study states&#xD;
      and who volunteer to participate in the educational intervention. We will recruit 40&#xD;
      pharmacies per state, 160 pharmacies total, providing a sample of approximately 450&#xD;
      pharmacist participants. Each store will have a pharmacy champion (a pharmacist or pharmacy&#xD;
      manager), who will be the point of contact for the intervention. Only pharmacies with a&#xD;
      consenting pharmacy champion will be eligible for the study; pharmacists at those sites may&#xD;
      opt to participate. Data collection will occur at baseline, 6-, and 12-month follow-up, using&#xD;
      surveys (pharmacist-level), store dispensing data and daily faxed counts of naloxone&#xD;
      encounters (store-level). Note that no identifiable health information about the patients&#xD;
      will be collected in these forms, only basic counts and communication descriptors. The follow&#xD;
      up surveys for pharmacists consist of brief questionnaires about the training, attitudes and&#xD;
      perceptions of naloxone and naloxone dispensing, sale of syringes over the counter, and&#xD;
      dispensing of buprenorphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 3: We will use a mixed methods approach to identify facilitators and barriers (e.g.&#xD;
      state-specific policies, store policies, region) to intervention implementation and&#xD;
      effectiveness. Methods will include an environmental scan of extant laws and policies,&#xD;
      fidelity checking, pharmacist focus groups (n=50), and interviews with patients who have&#xD;
      received or would be eligible for receiving naloxone (n=28).&#xD;
