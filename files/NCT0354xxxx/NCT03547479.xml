      This project proposes to develop and pilot a novel smart phone-based intervention to improve&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB) treatment adherence in Cambodia, which integrates video-enabled Directly&#xD;
      Observed Treatment (vDOT) with an automated rewards system that transfers mobile money and&#xD;
      eventual phone ownership to compliant patients. The results will be of immediate relevance to&#xD;
      Cambodia's National TB Control Program (which is partnering with us), the major implementing&#xD;
      field partner Operation ASHA (a leading TB-focused nonprofit organization), as well as other&#xD;
      TB control programs seeking new alternatives to improving adherence, especially where&#xD;
      traditional DOT may be infeasible or costly, and outside the area of TB where adherence to&#xD;
      treatment is critical, such as HIV, and will provide key insights into mobile health&#xD;
      (mHealth) programs in a setting relevant to other developing countries. The project will&#xD;
      involve building new capacity in Cambodia for behavioral research, mHealth,and communications&#xD;
      through hands-on training for study staff in-country, and through general training sessions&#xD;
      for internal and external stakeholders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of death from infectious disease&#xD;
      worldwide, and treatment adherence a persistent challenge. This is particularly pressing in&#xD;
      high-burden, low-resource settings such as Cambodia, where approximately two-thirds of people&#xD;
      carry the TB bacterium, one of the highest rates in the world. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      develop and pilot a novel smart phone-based intervention to improve TB treatment adherence,&#xD;
      integrating video-enabled Directly Observed Therapy (VDOT) with transfers of mobile money and&#xD;
      phone ownership to compliant patients. This intervention aims to directly address two of the&#xD;
      key barriers to TB treatment adherence in low resource settings where DOT is costly or&#xD;
      impractical. First, the video component has the potential to substitute direct in-person&#xD;
      observation with time-stamped videos of patients taking their medication. Second, the&#xD;
      proposed intervention incorporates incentives to patients for treatment adherence and&#xD;
      equipment preservation in the form of mobile money and eventual phone ownership upon&#xD;
      treatment completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In partnership with the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP), the investigators will assess&#xD;
      the feasibility of this intervention and of a future randomized study in two districts of&#xD;
      Cambodia. First, the team will extend and adapt an existing platform for video-enabled&#xD;
      medication monitoring (Mobile Interactive Supervised Therapy (MIST)) to incorporate mobile&#xD;
      cash payments conditional upon compliance. Outstanding technical and usability issues with&#xD;
      the platform will be identified and addressed by conducting an initial 1-month test of the&#xD;
      intervention with 10 TB patients. Finally, the investigators will conduct an 8-month&#xD;
      demonstration study among 50 households in our study locations to assess the acceptability,&#xD;
      implementation, and potential for scale up of the intervention. We also aim to assess the&#xD;
      practicalities and challenges of a future randomized controlled effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine a mHealth intervention for&#xD;
      TB that integrates both adherence monitoring and patient incentives into a single platform.&#xD;
      The results will be of immediate relevance to the NTP as well as other TB control programs&#xD;
      seeking new alternatives to improving adherence, especially where traditional DOT may be&#xD;
      infeasible or costly. These results will also be of interest outside the area of TB where&#xD;
      adherence to treatment is critical, such as HIV. More generally, the study will provide key&#xD;
      insights into mHealth programs in a setting relevant to other developing countries. This&#xD;
      project will involve building new capacity in Cambodia for behavioral research, mHealth, and&#xD;
      communications through training to the study personnel and general training on conducting TB&#xD;
      and/or mHealth research to study partners and other stakeholders in the country.&#xD;
