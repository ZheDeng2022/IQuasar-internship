  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on treatment outcomes of human metastatic cancer which usually fares with&#xD;
      dismal (&lt;5%) survival at 5 years following first diagnosis of a metastasis. However, a&#xD;
      subgroup of patients with an initial oligometastatic presentation (i.e. 1-5 clinically&#xD;
      detectable lesions) have been reported to respond to complete surgical removal of detectable&#xD;
      deposits with up to 20% disease-free survival at 10 years. Patients relapsing with a second&#xD;
      oligometastatic presentation respond to a second round of ablation with encouraging rates of&#xD;
      5-year disease free survival. Based on patterns of response to therapy and relapse, we&#xD;
      propose investigate on the hypothesis that metastatic disease may be limited in extent,&#xD;
      slowly growing and amenable to successive eradication of metastatic deposits. For visible&#xD;
      tumor ablation, we propose to employ the effective and safe technique of Single Dose&#xD;
      Image-Guided Radiotherapy (SDRT) and to optimize its use in conjunction with systemic&#xD;
      therapy. Where SDRT at a full ablative dose (24Gy) is deemed unfeasible, hypofractionated&#xD;
      SBRT (9Gy x3) will be offered. Response assessment will be via local control,&#xD;
      poly-metastasis-free survival and overall survival rates. Preliminary phase I/II studies&#xD;
      indicate remarkable benefits from the SDRT/SBRT in patients with limited metastatic disease.&#xD;
      The expected outcomes may be significant conceptual and practical changes in the management&#xD;
      of selected metastatic settings resulting in long-term periods of disease-free and overall&#xD;
      survival in settings presently associated with dismal prognosis.&#xD;

      This phase II clinical trial is designed assess clinical outcomes following ablation by&#xD;
      Single Dose Image Guided Radiotherapy (SDRT) in patients with oligometastatic (OM)&#xD;
      presentation (1-5 clinically detectable lesions). For local tumor ablation the investigators&#xD;
      will use the novel non-invasive and highly effective technique of SDRT which is capable of&#xD;
      conferring long-term local relapse-free rates in approximately 90% of metastatic lesions&#xD;
      independently of tumour histology. Historical series with various tumor histologies have&#xD;
      shown subgroups of patients with an initial oligometastatic presentation respond to complete&#xD;
      surgical removal of detectable deposits, yielding up to 20% disease-free survival at 10&#xD;
      years. The study will determine response rates by metabolic criteria (i.e. PERCIST). Pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment assessment are performed by FDG (or other appropriate PET tracer) PET/CT scans&#xD;
      with acquisition of information on lesion(s) location, volume and metabolic parameters.&#xD;
      Changes in metabolic avidity post treatment can be used to evaluate the rates of complete&#xD;
      metabolic response, stable disease and progression at the site(s) of SDRT to measure local&#xD;
      relapse-free survival intervals (LRFS and the kinetics of tracer uptake may serve as a&#xD;
      potential predictive tool of treatment response). Additionally, whole-body PET/CT scans can&#xD;
      be used to assess distant metastasis-free progression, polymetatstasis-free survival (PMFS).&#xD;
      Lesions which are not amenable to the SDRT approach due to the inability to safely fulfill&#xD;
      dose/volume constraints, are consistently treated with a hypofractionated approach of three&#xD;
      sessions of 9Gy, an established and safe treatment regimen. Comparisons in LRFS, persistence&#xD;
      of the oligometastatic status, distant metastasis free-survival, poly-metastasis-free&#xD;
      survival, interval between repeat treatments and overall survival will be evaluated&#xD;
      evaluated. The impact of systemic treatment, as per current established clinical practices,&#xD;
      will also be assessed.&#xD;
