  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to understand how a neuromodulation technique, transcranial&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (tES), affects brain function in adults with chronic tinnitus measured&#xD;
      with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We hypothesize that multiple sessions of&#xD;
      tES (5 consecutive days) will modulate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Overall activity and local connectivity within brain regions near tES electrodes, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Functional connectivity within brain networks associated with brain regions near tES&#xD;
           electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In exploratory analyses, we also measure the extent to which the hypothesized changes listed&#xD;
      above a related to changes in tinnitus symptoms after tES.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic subjective tinnitus is a common and sometimes disabling condition, with few effective&#xD;
      treatments and no cure. Tinnitus is thought to involve dysfunction in central brain networks&#xD;
      subsequent to peripheral injury or interference; thus, neurostimulation therapies that&#xD;
      directly target central circuits are receiving growing interest. Of these, noninvasive&#xD;
      transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is an attractive option, due to its relative&#xD;
      affordability, mobility, and favorable safety profile. A growing number of studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that tES of temporal/auditory cortex is effective at transiently reducing&#xD;
      tinnitus symptoms, including tinnitus loudness and tinnitus distress. However, the results of&#xD;
      previous clinical trials are variable, and a mechanistic understanding of tES and its&#xD;
      therapeutic effects remains elusive. The main goal of this research is to lay the groundwork&#xD;
      for improved, patient-centered approaches to noninvasive neurostimulation therapy for chronic&#xD;
      tinnitus. To accomplish this long-term goal, this study will determine how the intrinsic&#xD;
      activity and connectivity of auditory networks are affected during simultaneous tES-fMRI of&#xD;
      auditory cortex, specifically in those patients who experience reduced tinnitus symptoms&#xD;
      after 5 consecutive days of tES. Though the primary goal of the proposed research is to&#xD;
      optimize tES for the treatment of tinnitus, these studies will also provide a wealth of&#xD;
      information regarding tinnitus pathophysiology and the mechanisms of tES more generally,&#xD;
      which is being investigated for the treatment of a wide variety of brain disorders and&#xD;
      injuries.&#xD;

    <description>In tES, a mild electrical current is passed between two or more electrodes placed on the volunteer's head (scalp). In this study, a mild unvarying (constant) electrical 2mA current is passed between two rubber electrodes placed on the head over auditory cortex for 20 minutes per session for 5 consecutive days. Because the electrical current direction (positive/negative) and current amplitude (2mA) does not vary or change during stimulation, this type of tES is also called transcranial &quot;direct current&quot; stimulation, or tDCS.</description>
