  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this project is to build a tool, adapted to the French geriatric&#xD;
      population, that will predict the risk of death at three months after hospitalization in&#xD;
      acute geriatric medicine. This tool will be built using selected items via a review of the&#xD;
      literature published in 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 8 items of the CriSTAL tool will be collected prospectively in all patients hospitalized&#xD;
      successively in the 2 post-emergency geriatric services (PUG) of the University Hospital of&#xD;
      Toulouse, over a period of 9 months, by a dedicated clinical research associate. Patient&#xD;
      survival will be assessed by obtaining the vital status of the cohort via CÃ©piDC&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As the population ages, the prevalence of chronic diseases increases. Let's take the example&#xD;
      of cardiovascular, respiratory or neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. These&#xD;
      pathologies are at the origin of decompensations requiring sometimes multiple&#xD;
      hospitalizations. It is clear that the goals of care (curative or palliative) are not always&#xD;
      related to life expectancy. Decision making, especially in an acute context, is often tricky.&#xD;
      The use of a tool with certain parameters of the patient could help to guide the reflection.&#xD;
      The present study propose a tool proposed by an Australian team (CriSTAL), which lists items&#xD;
      described in the literature as a risk factor for the death of elderly patients. This tool is&#xD;
      currently being studied in several types of populations around the world (general population,&#xD;
      cancer patients, hospitalized etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study aimed at evaluating routine, single-center care, conducted at&#xD;
      Toulouse University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The successive inclusion of hospitalized patients in Post Emergencies Geriatric (PUG) unity&#xD;
      will be carried out over a period of 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the vital status (alive / deceased) at 3 months of&#xD;
      hospitalization in acute geriatric medicine.&#xD;

    <description>CriSTAL Tool (Criteria for Screening and Treatment of Appropriate Long-Term Care) is a multidimensional geriatric tool that lists 18 elements of the literature, under construction and validation by an Australian retrospective study. This tool is a practical questionnaire and easy to use in current care, with items adapted to the geriatric dimension. The investigators chose to target hospitalized geriatric patients through emergencies.</description>
