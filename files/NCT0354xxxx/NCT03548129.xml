    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most commonly occurring bacterial infections in&#xD;
      women, Asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) is a common complication during pregnancy, with a&#xD;
      prevalence of 2-10%. It has been associated with a greater incidence of symptomatic urinary&#xD;
      tract infection (UTI), as well as foetal and obstetric complications. Appropriate treatment&#xD;
      reduces the incidence of UTI by 80-90%, as well as the risk of a premature birth and&#xD;
      low-birth-weight baby Fosfomycin trometamol (Monuril) is approved in numerous countries&#xD;
      worldwide, including various European countries and the USA, mainly for the treatment of&#xD;
      uncomplicated UTIs&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare between the efficacy of empirical use of fosfomycin trometamol and&#xD;
      the use of selected antimicrobials according to urinary culture and sensitivity in curing&#xD;
      asymptomatic bacteriuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women included in the study will be counseled regarding mode of intervention and informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained. All cases will be subjected to complete history taking, routine&#xD;
      antenatal examination and investigations including complete blood picture, kidney functions&#xD;
      and urine analysis, treatment of genital infection if diagnosed. Routine obstetric ultrasound&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group (A): Fosfomycin group (FG); where all patients will receive empirical 3 gm oral&#xD;
           fosfomycin fosfomycin will be taken by mouth on an empty stomach i.e. 2-3 hours after&#xD;
           meals preferably in the evening before bed time after emptying the bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The contents of 1 packet of Monuril will be dissolved in a glass of water or another&#xD;
           non-alcoholic drink and drink immediately. Do not mix with hot water. Do not take&#xD;
           fosfomycin in its dry form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nature: also known as phosphomycin, phosphonomycin, is a broad-spectrum antibiotic,&#xD;
           produced by certain Streptomyces species, although it can now be made by chemical&#xD;
           synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Trade name: Monuril Company: Zambon, Pharma Con Company, Switzerland&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group (B): Culture specific group (CG): where all patients will receive oral antibiotic&#xD;
           according to urine culture and sensitivity, oral antibiotics will be given in the form&#xD;
           of five days regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How the urine sample will be collected? The caregiver will give the patient a sterile cup and&#xD;
      lid, and advice her to wash herself completely then clean the perineal area from anterior to&#xD;
      posterior by water and in standing position as male begin to urinate then stop urinating put&#xD;
      the sterile cup and catch the rest of urine in it. Do not touch the inside of the cup or the&#xD;
      lid. Put the lid on the cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after completing the course of treatment all patients included in the study will be&#xD;
      subjected to colony count evaluation, to figure out the need for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Urine culture in fosfomycin group in case of inadequate response to treatment and to&#xD;
           give antibiotic according.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The change of duration or the type of antibiotic in case of inadequate response to&#xD;
           initial treatment in the culture group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resolution of asymptomatic bacteriuria as measured by colony count.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time frame: 1 week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Side effects of fosfomycin as, nausea, diarrhea, headache, vaginal itching, runny nose,&#xD;
           back pain Side effects from other antibiotics in culture and sensitivity group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Need for further treatment, either extending the course of treatment into 5 or 7 days&#xD;
           regimen or changing the antibiotic in case of inadequate initial response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Need for further investigations, as urine culture and sensitivity for fosfomycin group&#xD;
           in case of inadequate response on empirical treatment.&#xD;
