  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize neuropsychological mechanisms (positive affect,&#xD;
      negative affect and self-evaluation) mediating processing of social feedback in people with&#xD;
      different levels of social anxiety, by implementing functional and structural MRI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social anxiety (SA) disorder is a relatively widespread emotional disorder which is&#xD;
      associated with considerable impairment in social, educational, and occupational functioning&#xD;
      (Kessler et al., 2005). This condition is characterized by a debilitating preoccupation with&#xD;
      the evaluation of the self by others, ultimately leading to excessive fear and avoidance of&#xD;
      interpersonal encounters. As opposed to healthy individuals who typically process social&#xD;
      feedback in a positively biased manner, Individuals with high levels of SA tend to evaluate&#xD;
      the feedback conveyed by others negatively. Such biases have a profound contribution to the&#xD;
      maintenance of social-related concerns (Clark &amp; Wells, 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the overreaching goal of this research is to provide a neuropsychological account of&#xD;
      biased processing of social feedback evident in SA. To meet this goal, participants varying&#xD;
      in their level of SA are asked to deliver a speech and evaluate it before and after receiving&#xD;
      social feedback during an fMRI scan. Additional structural and resting-state fMRI scans, as&#xD;
      well as physiological and psychological measures, are obtained throughout the experiment in&#xD;
      order to explain individual differences in processing of feedback. fMRI tasks probing basic&#xD;
      neuropsychological processes include a self-referential paradigm, wherein participants judge&#xD;
      if different traits varying in valence and social domain (power vs. affiliation) are&#xD;
      descriptive of them; a reward vs. punishment task, in which participants can win or lose&#xD;
      money; and an emotional reactivity task, in which participants view faces with different&#xD;
      emotional expressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this study is to better delineate both neurobiological and&#xD;
      psychological models of SA, as well as to help in directing future neuromodulation-based&#xD;
      treatments of mood and anxiety disorders.&#xD;

Neural activation and functional connectivity measured in fMRI tasks probing elemental neuropsychological processes:&#xD;
2.A. Processing of self-descriptive traits differing in valence (positive vs. negative) and social domain (power vs. affiliation).&#xD;
2.B. Response to emotional faces. 2.C. Anticipating and receiving monetary reward vs. loss. 3. Brain functional connectivity obtained during resting-state scans obtained at three time-points: a) before the speech; b) before feedback reception; c) after feedback reception.&#xD;
4. We will assess the correlation between multiple measurements (i.e. anxiety levels, behavioral indices of speech evaluation bias, and the battery of fMRI tasks) by implementing multivariate and multiparametric statistical models.</description>
