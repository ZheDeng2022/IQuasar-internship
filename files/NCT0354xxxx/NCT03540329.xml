  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Distraction osteogenesis is a powerful technique for creating new bone during significant&#xD;
      lengthening of the mandible without the need for bone grafting and associated donor site&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The idea of distraction osteogenesis was largely abandoned by many until the 1950s. Ilizarov&#xD;
      minimized complications by performing a corticotomy with minimal disruption of the&#xD;
      surrounding blood supply and using a system of tension ring fixators to control the&#xD;
      distraction in multiple planes. Through a series of experimental studies and clinical&#xD;
      applications, Ilizarov established the foundation of distraction osteogenesis and its role in&#xD;
      orthopedic management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applications in craniofacial surgery were first seen in 1973, when Synder et al applied the&#xD;
      approach to mandibular lengthening in a canine animal model. Almost another 20 years passed&#xD;
      before McCarthy and colleagues published, in 1992, the first report of mandibular lengthening&#xD;
      in 4 children with congenital mandibular deficiency, 3 with hemifacial microsomia, and 1 with&#xD;
      Nager syndrome. Thereafter, its role rapidly expanded to the midface and nearly all classic&#xD;
      approaches to craniofacial reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, mandibular distraction can be performed in the ramus for ramus lengthening, in&#xD;
      the mandibular angle for downward and forward advancement, or in the mandibular body. Ramus&#xD;
      or gonial angle distraction are mainly used to treat facial asymmetries as in hemifacial&#xD;
      macrosomia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe mandibular retrognathia can be classified as congenital or acquired. Congenital&#xD;
      abnormalities that are associated with severe mandibular retrognathia or micrognathia include&#xD;
      craniofacial syndromes such as hemifacial microsomia, Pierre-Robin syndrome, Treacher-Collins&#xD;
      syndrome, and Nager syndrome. Adult patients with craniofacial syndromes may have undergone&#xD;
      previous surgery at an earlier age, but unfavorable postsurgical growth or skeletal relapse&#xD;
      may have occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe mandibular retrognathia also can develop following maxillofacial trauma and mandibular&#xD;
      fractures, which may have occurred in an adult or as a child Condylar fractures occurring at&#xD;
      an early age can result in subsequent bony and/or fibrous temporomandibular joint ankylosis&#xD;
      and/or deficient mandibular growth, also adult patients with complications from previous&#xD;
      mandibular tumor resection and reconstruction can also present with acquired severe&#xD;
      mandibular retrognathia that may require distraction osteogenesis as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the advantages of extra-oral distraction devices in the hands of clinicians&#xD;
      (application for very small children, simplicity of attachment, ease of manipulation,&#xD;
      bidirectional and multidirectional dis- traction), patients are apprehensive about wearing&#xD;
      bulky external appliances because of the social inconvenience and the potential of permanent&#xD;
      facial scars, these disadvantages and limitations were the primary force driving the&#xD;
      evolution of mandibular lengthening and widening toward the development of intra-oral&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However nowadays both internal and external distractors are used in a variety of indications&#xD;
      in these cases each of the two types of distractor devices has its own advantages and&#xD;
      disadvantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare external and internal distraction devices for mandibular&#xD;
      lengthening in terms of bone lengthening, patient comfort, and complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted on 30 patients who are suffering mandibular problems either&#xD;
      congenital acquired or post tumor mandibular resection that requires lengthening of the&#xD;
      mandible, attending the outpatient clinic of Plastic Surgery Department in Ain Shams&#xD;
      University Hospital &amp; Assiut University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent will be obtained from all patients before their inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographs will be taken for the patient in lateral, antro-posterior and oblique&#xD;
           positions preoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lateral cephalometric radiographs or computed tomography (CT) or cone beam CT scans will&#xD;
           be done for each patient pre-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The decision to perform internal or external device will be based on preoperative and&#xD;
           intraoperative considerations, such as anatomical bony characteristics affecting the&#xD;
           possibility to place internal devices and patient cooperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principles of the operation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anaesthesia: general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraoperative consideration of internal versus external distractor is decided depending&#xD;
           on the availability of bone stock.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Osteotomy will be done according to each case individually making sure that it suits the&#xD;
           vector of distraction required for each case.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The approach for the external devices will be intraoral between the mental nerve&#xD;
           anteriorly and gonial area posteriorly on both sides of the mandible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The approach for internal devices will be intraoral. While preserving the mandibular&#xD;
           branch of the facial nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 3-5 days of latency period for callus organization, gradual lengthening of the&#xD;
           mandible will be performed at a rate of 0.5 mm twice a day for a total of 1 mm per day&#xD;
           until achieving desired length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative management and assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will take broad spectrum and anaerobic antibiotics, anti-edematous,&#xD;
           analgesic in addition to supportive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 3-5 days of latency period for callus organization according to patient age and&#xD;
           condition, gradual lengthening of the mandible was performed at a rate of 0.5 mm twice a&#xD;
           day for a total of 1 mm per day until achieving desired length.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following distraction phase there will be consolidation phase that will not be less than&#xD;
           8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Removing of internal or external distractor device and start retention phase if required&#xD;
           with assistance of orthodontic appliances to avoid relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will be evaluated with lateral cephalograms and head CT to assess the&#xD;
           changes and amount of new bone formation following distraction.&#xD;
