    <textblock>
      The Veterans Health Administration (VA) is a national leader in addressing the twin epidemics&#xD;
      of chronic pain and opioid use, misuse, and opioid use disorder (OUD); but important&#xD;
      challenges remain. Both chronic pain and OUD are more common among Veterans compared to the&#xD;
      general population.1 As the VA transitions toward a greater emphasis on non-opioid chronic&#xD;
      pain treatments, improving access to OUD treatment will be critical for those Veterans with&#xD;
      new diagnoses of OUD in the context of long-term opioid therapy. Strong evidence supports the&#xD;
      treatment of OUD with medications, including naltrexone, buprenorphine, and methadone.2&#xD;
      Buprenorphine and naltrexone can be prescribed in primary care settings; OUD treatment in&#xD;
      primary care is associated with decreased opioid use, higher quality of care, and improved&#xD;
      quality of life.3-5 In partnership with VISN19 leadership, this project will address the&#xD;
      priority goal of improving access to medication-assisted therapy for OUD treatment. The&#xD;
      objective of the VISN Partnered Implementation Initiative startup phase (PHASE 1) is to&#xD;
      implement and evaluate the evidence-based, effective practice of medication treatment of&#xD;
      opioid use disorder in primary care settings. A subsequent PHASE 2 will study the&#xD;
      implementation of strategies from PHASE 1 across the entire VISN19. The investigators propose&#xD;
      two specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate the implementation and impact of a multifaceted provider support initiative&#xD;
      at two VA medical centers and four community-based clinics in VISN19 using the&#xD;
      integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS)&#xD;
      implementation framework. The multifaceted initiative will leverage existing VA and VISN&#xD;
      resources (including e-consults, telementoring and telehealth) to facilitate improved access&#xD;
      to OUD treatment in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Create an interactive implementation toolkit with guidance on facilitation and&#xD;
      incentive strategies and resources for broader dissemination across the VISN and VA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among Veterans receiving healthcare from the Veterans Health Administration (VA), there has&#xD;
      been sharp rise in the number of veterans diagnosed with opioid use disorder (OUD). In 2013,&#xD;
      25,031 Veterans had OUD and in 2017, Veterans with OUD nearly tripled to 69,142.6 As the&#xD;
      largest direct provider of addiction treatment nationally, VA has taken steps to increase&#xD;
      access to medication treatment for OUD, which is recognized as an essential component of&#xD;
      evidence-based care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of OUD involves several FDA-approved, VA formulary medications including&#xD;
      naltrexone, methadone, and buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine (hereafter collectively&#xD;
      termed buprenorphine). Strong evidence supports the treatment of OUD with medications, and&#xD;
      they are the &quot;gold standard&quot; treatments for OUD. Medications for OUD have been shown to&#xD;
      substantially decrease risk for all-cause mortality and overdose mortality in people with&#xD;
      opioid use disorder. Unlike methadone, buprenorphine for OUD can be prescribed in&#xD;
      office-based settings such as primary care, and buprenorphine delivered in primary care is&#xD;
      associated with decreased opioid use, higher quality of care, and improved quality of life.&#xD;
      Medication treatment includes dispensation of methadone and buprenorphine in licensed opioid&#xD;
      treatment programs (OTPs) and prescriptions of buprenorphine and naltrexone in office-based&#xD;
      settings. Because there are only 32 licensed OTPs in the VA, buprenorphine and naltrexone&#xD;
      prescriptions are the means to improve access to medication treatment for Veterans with OUD.&#xD;
      Uptake of medication treatment, however, has been slow and uneven in the VA. In 2017, 35% of&#xD;
      Veterans diagnosed with OUD had received OUD medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In VISN19, rates of OUD and OUD treatment are low and heterogeneous across facilities and&#xD;
      compared with the national average (35%), fewer patients with OUD are on OUD medications&#xD;
      (21%) in VISN19. Multiple initiatives have been instituted to improve access to medication&#xD;
      treatment for Veterans with OUD, particularly in non-specialty office-based settings. In&#xD;
      2007, VA introduced the Buprenorphine in the VA Initiative (BIV; Director Gordon), a national&#xD;
      consult service, which aimed to improve care processes and patient outcomes associated with&#xD;
      buprenorphine. In 2010, VA unrolled Academic Detailing program in which pharmacy specialists&#xD;
      take on high-priority pharmaceutical education campaigns. An Academic Detailing campaign&#xD;
      specifically targeting the treatment of opioid use disorder was initiated in 2017. Further&#xD;
      improving access to evidence-based medication treatment of OUD remains a priority for VA and&#xD;
      VISN19.&#xD;
