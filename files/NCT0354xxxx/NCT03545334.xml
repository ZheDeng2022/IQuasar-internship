      A diagnostic sensitivity study comparing intradermal indocyanine green (ICG) and near&#xD;
      infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRFI) with intradermal technetium 99m and traditional&#xD;
      lymphoscintigraphy (LS) for transcutaneous identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in&#xD;
      malignant melanoma - a prospective Phase II clinical study in a single center.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Switzerland has the highest rate of new melanomas in Europe (19.2 per 100,000). Melanomas&#xD;
      have the worst prognosis of all skin cancers. The current treatment depends on the&#xD;
      histological diagnosis after a biopsy and is primarily related to the tumor thickness&#xD;
      (Breslow Score), the tumor cells in division (mitosis rate), the substance defect of the skin&#xD;
      (ulceration), the occurrence of regression, and the age of the patients. The initial&#xD;
      treatment is performed by surgical removal with a safety margin of macroscopically healthy&#xD;
      skin around the tumor. If the tumor thickness is more than 1 mm or more than 0.7 mm&#xD;
      associated with a high mitosis rate in younger patients, ulcerations, regression or Clark&#xD;
      Level IV / V, then current melanoma guidelines suggest that the patient undergoes sentinel&#xD;
      lymph node biopsy (SLKB) as this is most likely the first site where metastases spread.&#xD;
      Merkel cell carcinoma is a very aggressive, neuroendocrine skin tumor with a mortality rate&#xD;
      of about 33% after 3 years. Due to the frequent lymphatic metastases, SLNB is highly&#xD;
      recommended in all patients in order to better assess their prognosis. The gold standard&#xD;
      technique to identify SLKs is to inject the radioisotope Technetium-99m around the primary&#xD;
      tumor into the skin. The patient is then scanned to determine the position of the SLK after&#xD;
      approximately 30 and 120 minutes. Other teams have attempted to identify transcutaneous SLK&#xD;
      with ICG and NIRFI, but have concluded that ICG fluorescence technique is not reliable in&#xD;
      patients with high BMI or a primary tumor with lymph drainage in the axillary lymph node&#xD;
      region. This study aims to evaluate a medical device that uses an improved technology&#xD;
      compared to previous studies (stereoscopic 3D high definition for both fluorescence and&#xD;
      visible light imaging). The investigators hope is that by applying similar principles SLKs&#xD;
      can be identified through the use of transcutaneous fluorescent dye injections and NIRFI.&#xD;

    <description>The patient first receives a standard Tc-99m-based lymphoscintigraphy. The identified lymph nodes are not marked in the patients, so that the surgeons are not affected in lymph node identification during ICG and near infrared fluorescence imaging. The surgeon also has no access to lymphoscintigraphy images.&#xD;
Transcutaneous ICG lymphography is then performed by intradermal injection of ICG around the scar of the primary tumor excision and transcutaneous fluorescence evaluation with the Visionsense™ VS3 - Stereoscopic High Definition Visualisation System (VS3-3DHD) and results are compared.</description>
