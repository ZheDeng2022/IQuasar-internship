      Cattle encephalon glycoside and ignotin Cattle encephalon glycoside and ignotin (CEGI)&#xD;
      injection (drug approval H22025046; Jilin Sihuan Pharmaceutical Co. LTD., Jilin, People's&#xD;
      Republic of China) is a compound preparation of muscle extract from healthy rabbits and&#xD;
      cattle brain gangliosides, which was approved by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration in&#xD;
      2011 and was commonly used as neuroprotectant in the treatment of central and peripheral&#xD;
      nerve injuries in China. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of CEGI in treatment of&#xD;
      Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, we designed this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH) is a type of stroke that is caused by&#xD;
      hypertension-induced intracranial arterial, venous, and capillary ruptures. In recent years,&#xD;
      the incidence of HICH has become higher, which has exposed society greatly to heavy social&#xD;
      and economic burdens. Therefore it is necessary to find therapeutic strategies. ICH causes&#xD;
      primary white matter injury by direct mechanical compression and hematoma expansion, and then&#xD;
      it induces secondary injury through toxic product from the blood out of the vessel. The&#xD;
      inﬂammatory response that follows ICH also contributes to the white matter injury.&#xD;
      Additionally, post-ICH complications that include cortical thinning, cerebral edema, and&#xD;
      hydrocephalus further aggravate the subcortical white matter damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complex injury mechanisms that follow ICH implies that a multi-target neuroprotective&#xD;
      agent might be able to achieve better neuroprotective eﬀects than current single-agent&#xD;
      neuroprotective therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cattle encephalon glycoside and ignotin Cattle encephalon glycoside and ignotin (CEGI)&#xD;
      injection (drug approval H22025046; Jilin Sihuan Pharmaceutical Co. LTD., Jilin, People's&#xD;
      Republic of China) is a multi-target neuroprotective agent that includes polypeptides,&#xD;
      various gangliosides, free amino acids and nucleic acids, which were extracted from muscle&#xD;
      tissue of healthy rabbits and cattle brain gangliosides, and was approved by the Chinese Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration in 2011, commonly used as neuroprotectant in the treatment of central&#xD;
      and peripheral nerve injuries in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been proven by basic research that CEGI treatment significantly alleviated the&#xD;
      neurobehavioral dysfunction, promoted hematoma absorption, effectively up-regulated MBP/MAP-2&#xD;
      expression, and ameliorated white matter fiber damage [1]. CEGI was frequently used in the&#xD;
      treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage, yet there is still a lack of high quality study to&#xD;
      demonstrate its clinical efficacy. To achieve more clinical evidence of CEGI in treatment of&#xD;
      Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, we designed this study to further evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of CEGI in the treatment of Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage.&#xD;
