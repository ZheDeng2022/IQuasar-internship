  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A debilitating and common symptom in Gulf War Illnesses (GWI) is the inability to retrieve&#xD;
      words. This affects one's conversations, ability to fluidly exchange information verbally and&#xD;
      retrieve information from memory. The investigators have discovered 3 brain regions - the&#xD;
      PreSupplementary Motor Area (preSMA), caudate nucleus, and the thalamus - that are essential&#xD;
      for word retrieval. They have also detected abnormal EEG signals related to these regions in&#xD;
      GWI patients who have problems retrieving words.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have used their model of verbal retrieval to design a noninvasive,&#xD;
      nonpharmacological treatment that uses High Definition transcranial Direct Current&#xD;
      Stimulation (HD tDCS). Using HD tDCS, they deliver small amounts of electric current to areas&#xD;
      of the head to stimulate specific brain regions. The objective is to determine if delivery of&#xD;
      HD tDCS over the preSMA will improve performance in GWI veterans with a verbal retrieval&#xD;
      deficit. The investigators will administer pre-treatment tests of verbal retrieval measures&#xD;
      while recording brain electrical activity. They will then administer 10 sessions of HD tDCS&#xD;
      over the preSMA (20 minutes a session) in half the veterans. The other half will go through&#xD;
      the same procedures, except the current will not be turned on (called the sham condition).&#xD;
      The investigators will then compare performance between the &quot;active&quot; and sham group and&#xD;
      assess if the treatment had a significant effect on performing verbal retrieval tasks and if&#xD;
      there is a change in the ERP markers to account for how the treatment worked. If the&#xD;
      treatment is found to be effective it will be offered to those in the sham group at the&#xD;
      study's end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators predict this treatment regimen will lead to positive effects on a person's&#xD;
      daily functions, especially improved conversational abilities, with few, if any, side&#xD;
      effects. They hope to outline the standard procedures for physicians to perform the treatment&#xD;
      by creating a manual on how to apply the treatment in a clinical setting so that it will be&#xD;
      quickly available to use in multiple sites if the proposed study demonstrates that it is&#xD;
      efficacious. This treatment can be made widely available for Warrior Transition Units,&#xD;
      military clinics, and VA medical centers. In addition, if successful, this could potentially&#xD;
      lead to development of other targets of stimulation to improve other cognitive deficits in&#xD;
      GWI, and help alleviate verbal fluency deficits associated with other disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to identify patients with GWI who have a verbal retrieval&#xD;
      deficit and determine if delivery of HD tDCS over the PreSupplementary Motor Area of the&#xD;
      brain (preSMA) will improve performance in verbal retrieval-related tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key cognitive symptom described by patients with GWI extends from a disruption in the&#xD;
      cognitive process of verbal retrieval. This is manifested in a variety of dysfunctions&#xD;
      including word retrieval deficits, verbal fluency disruption and potentially verbal episodic&#xD;
      memory. The investigators have delineated a circuit of verbal retrieval using functional&#xD;
      neuroimaging and electrophysiology measures in normal controls and in patient populations&#xD;
      showing that a circuit of the preSMA-caudate nucleus-thalamus is essential for effective&#xD;
      retrieval of verbal information. This model has generated specific ERP neural markers of&#xD;
      successful verbal retrieval and we have studied GWI patients with dysfunction in these ERP&#xD;
      and functional MRI markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients with MS and TBI have been treated by the investigators for similar&#xD;
      verbal retrieval deficits as those with GWI by using the technique of High Definition&#xD;
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD tDCS) over the preSMA region to strengthen the&#xD;
      connections of this retrieval circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that application of 1 ma anodal HD tDCS over the preSMA for 20&#xD;
      minutes a session for 10 sessions over a two week period will lead to improvement in verbal&#xD;
      retrieval that will be detectable in both performance measures of verbal retrieval tasks and&#xD;
      in ERP markers of verbal retrieval processing. The objective is to determine if 10 sessions&#xD;
      of 1 ma anodal HD tDCS to the preSMA for 20 minutes a session are an effective treatment for&#xD;
      verbal retrieval deficits in GWI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this proposal is to entrain the verbal retrieval circuit using HD tDCS to target&#xD;
      the preSMA in order to improve retrieval in impaired GWI patients, using behavioral and&#xD;
      electrophysiological markers to assess outcomes. After identifying GWI patients with&#xD;
      retrieval deficits using standard neuropsychological measures, the following aims will be&#xD;
      addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Administer 10 20-minute sessions of either 1 mA high definition tDCS or sham to the&#xD;
      preSMA region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subtypes of Gulf War Illness patients have been shown to have dysfunction that disrupts the&#xD;
      above-described retrieval circuit. Transcranial DCS targeted to the preSMA has been shown in&#xD;
      preliminary studies in other diseased populations to result in improved performance in tasks&#xD;
      that engage this circuit by purportedly strengthening potentially weak connections within the&#xD;
      preSMA-caudate-thalamus circuit for verbal retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1:HD tDCS to the preSMA will produce long-term modulation of the basal state of&#xD;
      the preSMA-caudate-thalamic-cortical retrieval circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Assess neuropsychological and electrophysiological (ERP) markers of verbal retrieval&#xD;
      following tDCS therapy. Long-term modulation of the preSMA-caudate-thalamic-cortical&#xD;
      retrieval circuit, via tDCS to the preSMA region, will alter the neurophysiological&#xD;
      properties of the circuit due to modulation of the readiness of the retrieval circuit. This&#xD;
      will result in changes in neural markers as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2a: Neuropsychological measures of verbal retrieval that were impaired at&#xD;
      baseline will be improved to expected premorbid levels of functioning for the treated&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2b: Patients with impairments in making a correct retrieval will exhibit both&#xD;
      high false negative errors and false positive errors compared to norms and a decreased 750-ms&#xD;
      ERP amplitude difference between retrievals and nonretrievals on the SORT task. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that after HD tDCS treatment, these patients will improve&#xD;
      performance and/or have an increase in amplitude difference in the ERP between retrievals and&#xD;
      nonretrievals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2c: An increase in false negative errors and a decreased &quot;Go&quot; P3 ERP response on&#xD;
      the Semantic Selection Tasks is indicative of an impaired ability to select a correct memory&#xD;
      for retrieval. Conversely, there will be increased false positive errors and a decreased&#xD;
      &quot;NoGo&quot; P3 ERP on the Semantic Selection Tasks if a patient cannot inhibit an incorrect&#xD;
      memory. The investigators hypothesize that following HD tDCS therapy, there will be a&#xD;
      normalization of the patient's behavior (reduced errors, improved RTs) and/or ERP responses&#xD;
      (increased P3 amplitudes for Go and/or NoGo trials) due to modulation of the retrieval&#xD;
      circuit, with the changes based on the pre-treatment impaired retrieval function (selection&#xD;
      and/or inhibition).&#xD;
