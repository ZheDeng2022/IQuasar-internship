  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial involving a single centre&#xD;
      (McMaster University) recruiting patients from Hamilton, ON and the surrounding regions, to&#xD;
      evaluate whether fecal microbiota transplantation once weekly for six weeks increases the&#xD;
      remission rate compared to placebo in patients with active pouchitis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) may undergo colectomy due to a variety of reasons,&#xD;
      including medically refractory disease or dysplastic changes of the colon. Ileal-pouch anal&#xD;
      anastomosis is often offered to these patients. Unfortunately the pouch commonly develops&#xD;
      inflammation, known as pouchitis, which is the most common complication of this procedure and&#xD;
      occurs in approximately 50% of patients, with the majority of these patients having multiple&#xD;
      episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the exact cause of pouchitis is not clear, it is felt that fecal bacteria may be&#xD;
      implicated in the cause. Studies have demonstrated changes in the fecal contents of patients&#xD;
      with pelvic pouches compared to those with end ileostomies, with higher concentrations of&#xD;
      Bacteroides and stool anaerobes identified in those patients with pelvic pouches. Antibiotics&#xD;
      are a mainstay of treatment for pouchitis, with randomized controlled trials demonstrating&#xD;
      response rates of 70-85% to metronidazole or ciprofloxacin for treatment of acute pouchitis.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, recurrent use of systemic antibiotics is associated with adverse events and&#xD;
      development of antibiotic resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) is the administration of the supernatant component of&#xD;
      stool and water mixture from a healthy screened donor. The donors are screened for numerous&#xD;
      infections and pathogens prior to being accepted as donors. FMT has been advocated for some&#xD;
      colonic disorders; however it is primarily used in recurrent/refractory Clostridium difficile&#xD;
      infections (CDI). A case series from McMaster of over 100 patients and have shown that&#xD;
      approximately 90% of patients with recurrent CDI have been cured with FMT. The rationale is&#xD;
      that the aberrant colonic microbiome can be replaced with a normal healthy microbiome from a&#xD;
      donor. A similar rationale has been applied to ulcerative colitis, and a recent systematic&#xD;
      review and meta-analysis conducted by the investigators demonstrated FMT is associated with&#xD;
      improved clinical remission and endoscopic healing compared to placebo. It seems possible&#xD;
      that changing the intestinal flora in patients with pouchitis could also return the mucosa to&#xD;
      a healthy state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have conducted the world's first randomized trial of fecal transplant&#xD;
      therapy to determine its efficacy and safety in patients with active UC. The investigators&#xD;
      found that fecal transplants given once per week for 6 weeks resolved the inflammation in 24%&#xD;
      of patients with active UC compared to 5% with placebo. There has been no randomized control&#xD;
      trial evaluating the efficacy of FMT for treatment of pouchitis. An initial case series of 8&#xD;
      patients did not find treatment with one administration of FMT via nasogastric administration&#xD;
      to be associated with any improvement in clinical response. However a subsequent case series&#xD;
      found improvement in 4 out of 5 patients with chronic pouchitis who had multiple FMT&#xD;
      treatments over 3-4 weeks. The investigators will conduct a randomized trial at a single&#xD;
      centre (McMaster University) comparing fecal transplant therapy (from a healthy donor) versus&#xD;
      placebo for six weeks for induction of remission in patients with active pouchitis.&#xD;
