    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the efficacy of Povidone Iodine (BetadineÂ®) irrigation of&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue prior to skin closure in reducing the incidence of surgical site&#xD;
      infection after elective caesarean section and post discharge.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All women will be counseled regarding mode of intervention and informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained. All women will be subjected to complete history taking, routine antenatal&#xD;
      examination and investigations especially Hemoglobin test and 2 hour glucose tolerance test,&#xD;
      treatment of genital or urinary tract infections if diagnosed. Routine obstetric ultrasound&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical site infection up to 14 days following elective caesarian section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria of Surgical site infection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection involves only skin and subcutaneous tissue of this incision. Occurs within 14 days&#xD;
      after the operative procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Includes at least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. purulent drainage is present (culture documentation not required)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. organisms are isolated from fluid/tissue of the superficial incision&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. at least one sign of inflammation (eg, pain or tenderness, induration, erythema, local&#xD;
           warmth of the wound) is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the wound is deliberately opened by the surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the surgeon or clinician declares the wound infected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The need for secondary sutures closure of the infected wound after cleaning and&#xD;
           debridement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The need for other doses of antibiotic rather than the preoperative prophylactic one.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Postoperative fever exceeding 38.2, 24 hours following the caesarian section after&#xD;
           exclusion of the other possible causes (eg: DVT, chest infections, Urinary tract&#xD;
           infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The duration of post operative hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Coast effectiveness of hospital stay duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be randomly distributed according to the mode of intervention into&#xD;
      2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization is performed using a Computer generated randomization system. Table of&#xD;
      randomization is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 Includes the 100 women who will undergo elective caesarian section with subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissue irrigation with Povidone iodine 1% solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature of Povidone Iodine: It's a stable chemical complex of polyvinylpyrrolidone and&#xD;
      elemental iodine.with chemical formula (C6H9I2NO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiseptic properties: it's a broad spectrum antiseptic for topical application in the&#xD;
      treatment and prevention of infection in wounds, using the antiseptic properties of iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iodine has been recognized as an effective broad-spectrum bactericide, and is also effective&#xD;
      against yeasts, molds, fungi, viruses, and protozoans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it has been demonstrated that bacteria do not develop resistance to Povidone&#xD;
      Iodine (Fleischer and Reimer, 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic 1gm of 3rd generation cephalosporins 30 minutes prior to skin incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of surgeon will be 2nd year residency or higher. Skin incision will be done by&#xD;
      scalpel in Pfannenstiel manner. Subcutaneous tissue incision and division will be done using&#xD;
      scalpel. Rectus sheath division will be done by scalpel with good hemostasis. Opening of the&#xD;
      parietal peritoneum either sharp or blunt. Opening of the uterus in a C-shaped manner.&#xD;
      Oxytocin 5 IU by slow intravenous injection will be used to encourage contraction of the&#xD;
      uterus and to decrease blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placenta will be removed using controlled cord traction and not manual removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Closure of the uterus in two continuous layers using polyglactin 910 No 1. Closure of&#xD;
      parietal peritoneal. Closure of the rectus sheath in a continuous fashion using polyglactin&#xD;
      910 No1. Good hemostasis of subcutaneous tissue using the diathermy in coagulation mood.&#xD;
      Irrigation of the subcutaneous tissue layers using povidone iodine using Betadine filled 20&#xD;
      cm syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No insertion of subcutaneous tissue drain. No interrupted sutures in the skin. Approximating&#xD;
      of the subcutaneous tissue using polyglactin 910 (2-0) if the tissue thickness more than 2 cm&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Closure of the skin using polypropylene (2-0) in subcuticular manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Includes the 100 women who will undergo elective caesarian section without subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissue irrigation with Povidone iodine 1% solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Same steps as group 1 without subcutaneous tissue irrigation with Povidone iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation and Concealment 200 eligible women (who fulfill the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria) are to be randomly allocated into one of the two groups. Concealed allocation is&#xD;
      adopted, however, in order to minimize selection bias. The allocated group numbers are&#xD;
      concealed in serially-numbered opaque envelopes. Each envelope will contain the number of one&#xD;
      of the two arms of the study, envelopes will be put in a box, and each woman under the study&#xD;
      will pick one envelope which corresponds to the group to which she will be allocated. The&#xD;
      envelopes are unsealed after recruitment of the cases.&#xD;
