    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, open and exploratory clinical study, with 50 cases&#xD;
      planned for a period of 2 years. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the consistency and&#xD;
      accuracy of Patient-Derived Organoid Model of breast cancer to predict the clinical efficacy&#xD;
      of the drug, as well as the possibility of guiding the neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;

      After obtaining informed consent, patients who met the eligibility criteria underwent biopsy&#xD;
      of the primary lesion or metastatic lesion (such as lymph node).Under the premise of ensuring&#xD;
      normal detection requirements, a certain volume of fresh tumor tissues will be retained and&#xD;
      used for the cultivation of Patient-Derived Organoid Model.If the organoid cultivation is not&#xD;
      successful, the corresponding follow-up observation will be stopped.If the organoid&#xD;
      cultivation is successful, drug sensitivity verification or prediction by Patient-Derived&#xD;
      Organoid Model will be completed (final report will be available in about one month). During&#xD;
      this period, the patient was first treated with paclitaxel (PTX) chemotherapy 3 cycles (2&#xD;
      weeks regimen) and Herceptin was treated in HER2 amplification patients. After 3 cycles, the&#xD;
      efficacy was assessed according to the RECIST solid tumor evaluation standard (version 1.1),&#xD;
      and the evaluation methods mainly included physical examination, ultrasound, CT and MRI.If&#xD;
      the tumor continues to reduce in the first 3 cycles, continue paclitaxel chemotherapy for 3&#xD;
      cycles (6 weeks) and Herceptin was treated in HER2 amplification patients.If the evaluation&#xD;
      of the curative effect is SD or PD, according to the result of drug sensitivity of the class&#xD;
      organ, combined with the clinical practice, the doctor chooses the most sensitive treatment&#xD;
      plan, and continues the 2 cycle treatment (6 weeks).After the completion of the evaluation,&#xD;
      combined with the clinical situation, the next step is decided.For those who meet the&#xD;
      conditions of the operation, the modified radical mastectomy or breast conserving surgery was&#xD;
      performed after the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The pCR status of the primary breast cancer and&#xD;
      the axillary lymph nodes were evaluated after the operation. The adjuvant radiotherapy and&#xD;
      endocrine therapy were given after the operation, and the long-term survival was observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug sensitivity tests include single drug and drug combination. The organs that are&#xD;
      successfully cultured will be kept in liquid nitrogen for a specific time.&#xD;
