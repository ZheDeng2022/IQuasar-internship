      This study will systematically assess epigenome methylation changes in participants of the&#xD;
      Israel multi-ethnic centenarian study cohort, which includes citizens of Israel aged 95 years&#xD;
      and older, compared to their offspring and younger controls.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The number of men and women reaching advanced age is rapidly increasing in developed&#xD;
      countries and life expectancy has already doubled since the beginning of the last century. In&#xD;
      parallel, the proportion of those who have survived to advanced old age without major health&#xD;
      complications has become increasingly common. This phenomenon has led to concerted research&#xD;
      efforts to understand the correlates and mechanisms of extended human longevity and healthy&#xD;
      aging. For decades the public health perspective has emphasized environmental and life style&#xD;
      factors as having beneficial effects on health and disease prevention in the general&#xD;
      population. Important biological insights have been reached by examining the genetic basis of&#xD;
      longevity and healthy aging, especially among individuals who demonstrate a favorable healthy&#xD;
      aging phenotype. Epigenetics, defined as heritable changes in gene function or phenotypes, in&#xD;
      the absence of DNA sequence changes, has revolutionized the concept of how genetics affect&#xD;
      disease risk. Epigenetics have been shown to be associated with cancer risk and autoimmunity&#xD;
      disorders. Moreover, epigenetic changes at specific sites appear to increase with age, hence&#xD;
      they may serve as indices for chronological age. This background has led us to our central&#xD;
      hypotheses that: i) epigenetic changes associated with healthy aging could serve as markers&#xD;
      for a healthy life span, and ii) the epigenetic changes may represent one of the central&#xD;
      mechanisms by which aging predisposes to many age-related diseases, and therefore affects&#xD;
      healthy aging. We propose to test these hypotheses within the Israel multi-ethnic centenarian&#xD;
      study cohort (which includes all citizens of Israel&gt;95 years old; an estimated 1 in 5000 of&#xD;
      the population). We will systematically assess genomic methylation changes in three major&#xD;
      sub-groups which signifies three major points in human lifespan: Age 60±5 years (leading age&#xD;
      of onset of age associated diseases and also considered to represent the beginning of old&#xD;
      age, age 80±5 years (average life expectancy in the western world), and age 100±5 years&#xD;
      (exceptional longevity). Our centenarians includes 3 subgroups: SURVIVORS: those who survive&#xD;
      and become centenarians in spite of early onset of cognitive impairment, functional&#xD;
      disability or major age associated diseases, such as diabetes, vascular disease or cancer, at&#xD;
      the beginning of old age, i.e., age of 60±5 years (thus long life span but short healthy&#xD;
      lifespan). DELAYERS: those who develop age related diseases or cognitive/physical disability&#xD;
      much later than the control population i.e., at the age of 80±5 years instead of 60 years&#xD;
      (therefore have a longer healthy life span). DODGERS: those who fail to develop age-related&#xD;
      illnesses or cognitive/physical disability throughout their life span. We will compare these&#xD;
      groups to healthy controls with no family history of longevity in two reference groups,&#xD;
      namely 60±5 years and 80±5 years, comparing them to the survivors and delayers groups,&#xD;
      respectively. We predict that subjects will exhibit differences in methylation at sites&#xD;
      distinct from each other, in contrast to healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly our proposed goals are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To characterize the Israel multi-ethnic centenarian study cohort (I-MECS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To screen, catalog and annotate epigenome methylation variants in five different groups&#xD;
           (a. Survivors, b. Delayers, c. Dodgers, d. 60±5YO healthy control, and e. 80±5YO healthy&#xD;
           controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To validate differential methylated loci by ranking and prioritizing using Sequenom's&#xD;
           MassARRAY.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Exploratory goal (depend on time and funding availability) - To establish expression&#xD;
           patterns using a qRT-PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) Roche light-cycler of the candidate&#xD;
           epigenetic loci identified in Aims 1, 2 and 3 as well as specific genes (such as&#xD;
           deoxyribonucleic acid methyltransferase and tumor suppressor genes) in blood cells of&#xD;
           the initially screened population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test our hypotheses, we propose to employ a novel high-throughput genome-wide methylation&#xD;
      assay, namely HELPtag. Additionally, we will utilize a combination of epigenome-wide&#xD;
      association studies (EWAS) to identify the most distinctive epigenetic loci that show&#xD;
      greatest differential methylation. We will then perform multi-locus validation for&#xD;
      methylation status using MassARRAY.&#xD;

      Three 10 ml blood samples will be drawn into vacutainer tubes (Yellow top with anticoagulant;&#xD;
      speckled top without anticoagulant). Blood samples will be analyzed for the levels of&#xD;
      hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell counts, and levels of glucose, insulin, albumin,&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, and plasma lipids. CD34+Lin- cells will be isolated from the peripheral&#xD;
      blood specimen using immuno-magnetic separation technique, followed by cell sorter.&#xD;
      Mononuclear cells are separated by Ficoll-Paque density gradient, and CD34+ cells obtained by&#xD;
      positive immuno-magnetic bead selection, using Macs columns (Miltenyi Biotech). The purified&#xD;
      cells are then subjected to a cell sorter following immunostaining. The isolated cells will&#xD;
      be cryopreserved in 10% DMSO by controlled rate freezing.&#xD;
