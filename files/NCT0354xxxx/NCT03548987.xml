  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the change in participant's body weight from the start to the end of&#xD;
      the study. This is to compare the effect on body weight in people taking semaglutide (a new&#xD;
      medicine) and people taking &quot;dummy&quot; medicine. In addition to taking the medicine, the&#xD;
      participant will have talks with study staff about healthy food choices, how to be more&#xD;
      physically active and what a participant can do to lose weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will get semaglutide for the first 20 weeks. Then the participant will get&#xD;
      either semaglutide or &quot;dummy&quot; medicine - which treatment the participant gets after the 20&#xD;
      weeks is decided by chance. The participants will need to take 1 injection once a week. The&#xD;
      study medicine is injected with a thin needle in a skin fold in the stomach, thigh or upper&#xD;
      arm. The study will last for about 1.5 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Physical Functioning Score (Short Form 36 [SF-36])</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization (week 20) to week 68</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary and mental component summary). The 0-100 scale scores from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively. Change from week 20 in the domain scores and component summary scores were evaluated at week 68. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. These endpoints were evaluated based on the data from in-trial observation period which is the uninterrupted time interval from start of run-in (week 0) to last trial-related subject-site contact (week 75).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted in 73 sites in Denmark (2), Israel (6), Netherlands (3), Portugal (6), South Africa (6), Spain (7), Sweden (4), Switzerland (6), Ukraine (5) and United States (28).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The trial included 20-week run-in period and 48-week maintenance period. During the run-in period, participant started with a semaglutide dose of 0.25 mg and the dose was increased every fourth week until the target dose, 2.4 mg was reached. Out of 902 participants, 803 have completed the run-in period. Thus, these were randomised in 2:1 ratio either to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo. The treatment is an adjunct to reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.</pre_assignment_details>

The participants with target dose reached were randomised in 2:1 at week 20, to receive once weekly semaglutide s.c 2.4 mg until week 68.</description>

In-trial observation period: the uninterrupted time interval from start of run-in (week 0) to last trial-related subject-site contact (week 75). On-treatment observation period: includes all time intervals in which participants are considered to be on treatment from the first (week 0) to last trial product administration (week 68) including 2 weeks of follow-up. It excludes any period of temporary treatment interruption. Temporary treatment interruption is defined as more than 2 consecutive missed doses (off-treatment period).</description>

        <title>Change in Physical Functioning Score (Short Form 36 [SF-36])</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary and mental component summary). The 0-100 scale scores from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively. Change from week 20 in the domain scores and component summary scores were evaluated at week 68. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. These endpoints were evaluated based on the data from in-trial observation period which is the uninterrupted time interval from start of run-in (week 0) to last trial-related subject-site contact (week 75).</description>

All AEs mentioned here are treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) defined as an event that had onset date (or increase in severity) on or after the first day of exposure to treatment (week 0-20 run-in period). The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from on-treatment observation period. On-treatment observation period: includes all time intervals in which participants are considered to be on treatment from the first (week 0) to last trial product administration (week 68), including 7 weeks of follow-up. It excludes any period of temporary treatment interruption. Temporary treatment interruption is defined as more than 7 consecutive missed doses (off-treatment period).</description>

        <title>Number of Treatment-emergent AEs</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. All AEs mentioned here are TEAE defined as an event that had onset date (or increase in severity) on or after the first day of exposure to treatment (week 20-75). The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from on-treatment observation period. On-treatment observation period: includes all time intervals in which participants are considered to be on treatment from the first (week 0) to last trial product administration (week 68), including 7 weeks of follow-up. It excludes any period of temporary treatment interruption. Temporary treatment interruption is defined as more than 7 consecutive missed doses (off-treatment period).</description>

          <description>Change in calcitonin (measured as ng/L) is presented as ratio to baseline. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from on-treatment observation period. On-treatment observation period: includes all time intervals in which participants are considered to be on treatment from the first (week 0) to last trial product administration (week 68) including 2 weeks of follow-up. It excludes any period of temporary treatment interruption. Temporary treatment interruption is defined as more than 2 consecutive missed doses (off-treatment period).</description>
          <population>SAS included all participants who received at least one dose of trial product. Only randomised subjects in the safety analysis set contribute. 'Overall Number of Participants Analyzed' = participants with available data.</population>
