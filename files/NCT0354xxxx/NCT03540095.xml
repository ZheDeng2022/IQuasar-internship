  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous paravertebral analgesia and erector spinae plane blockade (ESP) are accepted&#xD;
      techniques at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) for the management of thoracic&#xD;
      pain following surgery and trauma. Recently, an increasing number of erector spinae plane&#xD;
      blocks are being performed as it has been demonstrated in our institution and via case&#xD;
      reports that they provide clinical effectiveness, but may have a better side-effect profile&#xD;
      than the paravertebral nerve block. However, the relative efficacy of ESP and continuous&#xD;
      paravertebral analgesia for patients with rib fractures remains to be established. This study&#xD;
      will include 60 consecutive patients presenting to the UPMC Presbyterian Acute Interventional&#xD;
      Perioperative Pain Service suffering from unilateral rib fractures and will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either nerve blocks via continuous paravertebral infusion or via erector spinae plane&#xD;
      infusion. In addition, to treat breakthrough pain, the patients in both arms will receive&#xD;
      multimodal adjunctive therapy per routine. Bupivicaine and ropivicaine are FDA approved for&#xD;
      use in nerve block catheters. The primary outcome will be total opioid consumption in the&#xD;
      first 3 days of nerve block. Secondary outcomes include highest visual analog pain score&#xD;
      (VAS) with deep breathing and at rest, adverse events, and total number of nerve blocks.&#xD;
      Other data points include time to readiness for discharge, and length of hospital stay.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All interventions regarding the placement and management of ESP and paravertebral blocks in&#xD;
      this study are consistent with existing standard of care practices at UPMC and utilize&#xD;
      protocols that are already in use. In addition, by nature of being included in a research&#xD;
      study, patients are likely to receive closer monitoring for side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and enrollment: After approval by the institutional review board, all (American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiology) ASA I-IV patients aged 18-85 years, weighing between 50 and 120 kg&#xD;
      with unilateral rib fractures will be screened for enrollment. Sixty patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this randomized prospective study with equal numbers in each arm of the trial.&#xD;
      This study design is unblinded as we cannot blind patients nor observers as to the type of&#xD;
      block performed (slightly different location). This is an accepted limitation of the study.&#xD;
      No advertising will be used and no monetary compensation will be offered. The nature of the&#xD;
      study, planned interventions, risks, benefits, and alternatives will be discussed in detail&#xD;
      with the patients at the time of enrollment and prior to the patients' signing of a written&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Patients will be enrolled into one of the study groups on the day of&#xD;
      consultation in an alternating fashion. The study groups are defined as: Group I: Erector&#xD;
      Spinae Plane Block (ESP) 30 patients Group II: Paravertebral Block (PVB) 30 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day of Block: After written informed consent is confirmed, a research assistant will&#xD;
      introduce the scoring system used for pain assessment (VAS), and demonstrate proper use of&#xD;
      the incentive spirometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All nerve blocks will be performed by an experienced member of UPMC's pain management&#xD;
      service. Both nerve blocks can take between 10-60 minutes to perform. They will either occur&#xD;
      in the ICU or on a monitored medicine floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral nerve block catheter placement and activation (PVB group only): Paravertebral&#xD;
      catheters will be placed according to UPMC standard of care practices as outlined below:&#xD;
      After an intravenous catheter has been established and standard monitors and oxygen applied,&#xD;
      the patient will be placed in the sitting position. The patient will be administered&#xD;
      appropriate sedation based on the discretion of the provider if needed to safely perform the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral technique: With the patient in a sitting position, the point of needle entry&#xD;
      will be marked on the skin corresponding to paravertebral catheter placement. The thoracic&#xD;
      spine level will be at the anatomic level corresponding to the ribs fractured. The needle&#xD;
      entry sites will be 2.5 cm lateral to the midpoint of the spinous process of the&#xD;
      corresponding thoracic vertebrae. The area will be prepped and draped in a sterile fashion,&#xD;
      and 1% lidocaine infiltrated subcutaneously at each point of anticipated needle entry. For&#xD;
      each of the catheter placement, a sterile gauge Tuohy needle will be introduced with&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance towards the paravertebral space. After final needle placement, a hanging&#xD;
      drop technique will be used to assess for interpleural placement while the patient inhales&#xD;
      and exhales deeply. Next 5 mL of ropivicaine 0.5% will be injected incrementally through each&#xD;
      needle after negative aspiration under ultrasound visualization, followed by insertion of the&#xD;
      nerve block catheter to a depth 5 cm beyond the tip of the needle. An additional 20 mL of&#xD;
      ropivicaine 0.5% will then be injected in 5 mL increments with negative aspiration in&#xD;
      between, through each catheter yielding a total activation dose of 25 ml of ropivicaine 0.5%&#xD;
      via each catheter. The catheters will be secured with Steri-strips and a transparent&#xD;
      occlusive dressing. Vital signs will be monitored at regular intervals until the procedure is&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erector spinae catheter placement and activation (ESP group only): An erector spinae plane&#xD;
      catheter will be placed according UPMC standard of care practices as outlined below: After an&#xD;
      intravenous infusion has been established and standard monitors and oxygen applied, the&#xD;
      patient will be placed in the sitting position. The patient will be administered appropriate&#xD;
      sedation based on the discretion of the provider if needed to safely perform the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESP technique: With the patient in a sitting position, the point of needle entry will be&#xD;
      marked on the skin corresponding to the appropriate vertebral level relative to the rib&#xD;
      fractures. The area will be prepared and draped in a sterile fashion, and 1% lidocaine&#xD;
      infiltrated subcutaneously at the point of anticipated needle entry. A sterile Tuohy needle&#xD;
      will be introduced and advanced towards the corresponding transverse process. Hydrodissection&#xD;
      will ensure that the proper plane is located. Once the erector spinae musculature is&#xD;
      separated from the rib, 25ml of ropivicaine 0.5% will be introduced into the plane under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance. A catheter will be placed to a depth 5 cm beyond the tip of the needle.&#xD;
      The catheter will be secured with Steri-strips and a transparent occlusive dressing. Vital&#xD;
      signs will be monitored at regular intervals until the procedure is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral infusions of Bupivicaine 0.0625% will be titrated to 12 ml/hr maximum for the&#xD;
      patients in the paravertebral catheter group (Group PVB). Patients in the ESP group (ESP)&#xD;
      will start a continuous infusion of Bupivicaine 0.0625% and titrate to 12 mL/hr maximum as&#xD;
      needed for pain. The patients in both groups will also be given access to acetaminophen 1000&#xD;
      mg every 6 hours IV or PO if there is no contraindication. Other adjuncts such as gabapentin,&#xD;
      celebrex, ketamine, and opioid analgesics may be adjusted by the physicians involved based on&#xD;
      the patients clinical condition. A PCA may be required for opioid pain medication&#xD;
      administration initially, and will be continued until the patient is able to tolerate oral&#xD;
      pain medication. Additional pain relief is available via nurse-administered 3 mL boluses of&#xD;
      0.0625% bupivacaine via the catheter pumps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post nerve block anesthesia protocol: Once on the floors, additional pain relief is available&#xD;
      via nurse-administered 3 mL boluses of Bupivicaine via the catheter pumps given no more than&#xD;
      hourly. All patients will be assessed daily by members of the acute interventional&#xD;
      perioperative pain service. The infusion rates via the paravertebral and ESP catheters may be&#xD;
      adjusted at the discretion of the pain service up to a rate of 12 mL/hr on each side&#xD;
      (standard infusion rate used at UPMC-Presbyterian). All paravertebral ESP catheters will be&#xD;
      stopped and removed as tolerated by the patient or post-procedure day #5, whichever occurs&#xD;
      first. Additional pain medication will be available to all patients per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICU (Intensive Care Unit): Patients will be admitted to an intensive care unit at the&#xD;
      discretion of the emergency department. Patients who are intubated and sedated, and who are&#xD;
      unable to participate medical decision making will not be accepted for this study. If a&#xD;
      patient fits the inclusion criteria and is in the ICU, the nerve block will be placed and&#xD;
      managed in the ICU as above for all other situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected daily from the patients until the nerve block is removed or 5 days&#xD;
      post-procedure, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge: The readiness for discharge will be determined by the primary team: This decision&#xD;
      will likely include (1) return of respiratory function, (2) hemodynamic stability, (3)&#xD;
      normothermia, (4) no clinical evidence of DVT/PE (Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism)&#xD;
      which is untreated, (5) pain controlled by oral agents. In addition, actual length of&#xD;
      hospital stay will be recorded. Nerve block will be performed and the catheters will be&#xD;
      removed according to the ASRA (American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine)&#xD;
      guidelines for regional anesthesia catheter placement and removal available on the ASRA&#xD;
      website.&#xD;
