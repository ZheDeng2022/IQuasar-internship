  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endodontic postoperative pain is described as a sensation of discomfort following the&#xD;
      completion of root canal treatment and is experienced by the 25-40% of the patients&#xD;
      regardless of pulp and periradicular diseases (1, 2). Prevalence of pain has been reported to&#xD;
      decrease from 40% in the first 48 hours to 11% after 7 days (2). Mechanisms of endodontic&#xD;
      postoperative pain is multifactorial and procedural processes such as glide path preparation,&#xD;
      establishment of apical patency or root canal instrumentation technique were claimed to&#xD;
      influence the posttreatment pain incidence (3-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glide path preparation has been reported to guide the successor instruments and prevent&#xD;
      complications of root canal preparation such as taper lock, instrument separation,&#xD;
      transportation, and ledge formation (6-8). Several instruments and techniques have been&#xD;
      suggested for the preparation of glide path, including hand preparation with stainless steel&#xD;
      K-files, the combination of reciprocating handpiece and stainless steel K-files or the use of&#xD;
      a less tapered motor-driven nickel-titanium (NiTi) rotary instrument (9-11). The use of NiTi&#xD;
      rotary instruments has been associated with a less time-consuming and safe glide path&#xD;
      preparation, which respects to the original canal anatomy (9, 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ProGlider (Dentsply Sirona; Ballaigues, Switzerland) is a rotary glide path instrument&#xD;
      manufactured from memory NiTi wire, which provides increased fatigue resistance, compared to&#xD;
      the conventional NiTi glide path instruments (12). The concept of reciprocation motion was&#xD;
      introduced with the expectation of a safer instrumentation with a single file (13).&#xD;
      Reciprocation motion has been reported to increase the fatigue resistance of the instrument&#xD;
      by exerting to lower stress values compared to the continuous rotation (14). The R-Pilot&#xD;
      (VDW; Munich, Germany) instrument introduces the reciprocating motion to the glide path&#xD;
      preparation (15). Reciprocating motion has been reported to produce greater amount of&#xD;
      apically extruded debris, which was associated with irritation of periradicular tissues and&#xD;
      postoperative endodontic pain, compared to continuous motion (16). However, a few clinical&#xD;
      trials compared the reciprocation and rotation kinematics regarding their effect on&#xD;
      postoperative pain and reported conflicting results, which could be attributed to the use of&#xD;
      different instrumentation systems with different mechanical properties and designs (17-19).&#xD;
      However, the effect of reciprocating motion during glide path preparation on the&#xD;
      postoperative endodontic pain has not been investigated, yet. The purpose of the present&#xD;
      study was to evaluate the incidence of postoperative pain after glide path preparation&#xD;
      performed with stainless steel K-files, ProGlider or R-Pilot glide path instruments. The null&#xD;
      hypothesis tested was that there is no difference in the incidence and severity of&#xD;
      postoperative pain following the glide path preparation with any of the 3 instruments.&#xD;

      For this study, ethical board approval was given by the local university clinical researches&#xD;
      ethical committee (KAEK-357). This study included a total of 240 patients (137 women and 103&#xD;
      men) between the ages of 18 and 60. According to the a priori sample size calculation using&#xD;
      G*Power software (G*Power 3.1 for Macintosh, Heinrich-Heine, Düsseldorf, Germany) and the&#xD;
      results of a previous study (20) a minimum sample size of 66 would be required based on a&#xD;
      type I error of 0.05 and a power of 90% to detect differences among 3 study groups at 6&#xD;
      measurement times. In the present study, 80 patients were assigned to each group. Maxillary&#xD;
      and mandibular teeth of healthy patients, who were diagnosed with asymptomatic irreversible&#xD;
      pulpitis, symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic apical periodontitis or asymptomatic&#xD;
      apical periodontitis, were included to the study. Patients, who were diagnosed with acute or&#xD;
      chronic apical abscesses, showing signs of systemic infection, having allergies to local&#xD;
      anesthetic agents, taking medication (analgesic, antibiotic or anti-inflammatory drugs)&#xD;
      during the 7 days before the procedure, presenting with multiple teeth requiring treatment or&#xD;
      having a progressive periodontal disease, were excluded from the study (Fig. 1). All&#xD;
      participants were informed about the study and had signed the written informed consent prior&#xD;
      to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulp vitality was tested using thermal and electric pulp tests (Parkell, NY, USA) and&#xD;
      confirmed and recorded after access cavity preparation according to the presence of bleeding.&#xD;
      Periapical radiographs were taken using phosphor plates and digital radiologic system (Sirona&#xD;
      Vario DG, Bensheim, Germany) and achieved. Clinical and radiological data were recorded on&#xD;
      each patient's sheet and analyzed by 2 blinded examiners who were experienced endodontists.&#xD;
      In case of conflict a third opinion was taken from another endodontist. The examiners were&#xD;
      previously calibrated by a case series evaluation and consensus between examiners was&#xD;
      analyzed by Kappa test, until interexaminer reliability between 0.90-1.00 was expected.&#xD;
      Baseline demographic and clinical features of each patient (pulp vitality, tooth type,&#xD;
      presence and level of preoperative pain) were registered (Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects were treated by 4 endodontists between July 2017 and April 2018. Prior to&#xD;
      treatment the patients were instructed how to complete a visual analogue scale (VAS) to&#xD;
      determine their pain scores. The VAS included a 10 cm straight horizontal line numbered at&#xD;
      each centimetre from 0 to 10. Local anesthesia using 4% articaine with adrenaline 1:100.000&#xD;
      was performed to all patients. In case of requirement another carpule of 4% articaine was&#xD;
      used. Following preparation of access cavity each patient was randomly assigned to 1 of the 3&#xD;
      experimental groups by choosing a closed envelope, which was written the group name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In manual glide path group, glide path creation was performed with stainless steel #08, 10,&#xD;
      15 K-files used with &quot;push and pull&quot; which was described in a previous study (21).&#xD;
      Instruments were used with a motion, which the instrument proceeds apically quarterly to the&#xD;
      point of resistance then pulled out for debris removal. The procedure was repeated with each&#xD;
      file until the working length (WL) was achieved and confirmed with electronic apex locator&#xD;
      (Root ZX Mini, Morita Corp., Kyoto, Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ProGlider group, #08 stainless steel files were used to measure WL with electronic apex&#xD;
      locator (Morita Corp., Kyoto, Japan). ProGlider instrument was operated by an endodontic&#xD;
      motor (X-Smart, Dentsply Sirona, Ballaigues, Switzerland) with 16:1 contra angle at the&#xD;
      suggested settings (300 rpm on display, 5 Ncm) at the measured WL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In R-Pilot group, #08 stainless steel files were used to measure WL with electronic apex&#xD;
      locator (Morita Corp., Kyoto, Japan). R-Pilot instrument was operated by an endomotor (VDW&#xD;
      Silver, Munich, Germany) at &quot;Reciproc All&quot; setting at the measured WL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After glide path creation, further endodontic procedures were standardized. The root canals&#xD;
      were prepared up to X3 instrument of ProTaper Next (Dentsply Sirona) rotary instrumentation&#xD;
      system. In case of requirement root canals were enlarged up to X4 or X5 instrument of&#xD;
      ProTaper Next. Irrigation was performed with 5.25% NaOCl delivered with 30-G needle syringe&#xD;
      for 10 mL for each root canal. Following preparation each root canal was flushed with 2.5 mL&#xD;
      of 17% EDTA for 1 minute, 2.5 mL distilled water and 2.5 mL of 5.25% NaOCl, respectively as&#xD;
      final irrigation. Root canals were dried with sterile paper points and obturated by cold&#xD;
      lateral compaction technique using epoxy resin sealer and gutta-percha. Access cavities were&#xD;
      restored with temporary glass ionomer filling (Riva Light Cure, Southern Dental&#xD;
      Industries-SDI, Australia). Then the patients were discharged with VAS forms. The patients&#xD;
      were contacted each day for 3 days for the record of their VAS score at the post operative&#xD;
      6th, 12th, 18th, 24th, 48th, and 72nd hours and any possible analgesic intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distribution of age, gender, tooth type, presence/absence of preoperative pain and pulp&#xD;
      vitality among the experimental groups were tested using chi-square test whereas the level of&#xD;
      preoperative pain scores at each group was compared using one-way analysis of variance test.&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to test the distribution of VAS score data and&#xD;
      comparisons among the preparation groups regarding the severity of postoperative pain were&#xD;
      measured by one-way analysis of variance and post-hoc Tukey tests for each measurement&#xD;
      interval. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the categorical variables&#xD;
      such as group, age (categorized according to decades), gender, tooth type (incisor, premolar,&#xD;
      molar), presence of preoperative pain and pulp vitality that best correlated with&#xD;
      postoperative pain incidence. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software&#xD;
      (v.18.0; IBM Corp., Chicago, IL, USA) with a level of significance set at 0.05.&#xD;

    <description>VAS is a measure of pain intensity. In the present study, the VAS included a 10 cm straight horizontal line numbered at each centimetre from 0 to 10 showing two extreme symptoms of pain. &quot;0&quot; means no pain and &quot;10&quot; means the worst pain the subject has ever experienced. Each centimeter represents the pain intensity that the subject will mark orientated from 0 to 10. The intensity is increased from 0 to 10, therefore a higher score means a higher pain intensity. There are no subscales.</description>
