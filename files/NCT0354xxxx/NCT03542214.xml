  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase I study 6 patients with inoperable colorectal cancer is treated with calcium&#xD;
      electroporation to establish safety and efficacy of the treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 6 evaluable patients with inoperable colorectal cancer are expected to be included&#xD;
      in the study and the time for inclusion of patients is estimated to be 1-2 years. All&#xD;
      patients will have been offered the standard of care and all available alternatives before&#xD;
      entering the protocol. Calcium electroporation will not be compared to other means of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated once, but in case of residual tumor tissue at follow-up, and if&#xD;
      the investigator considers it safe, they will be offered re-treatment. A maximum of 3&#xD;
      treatments per patient will be conducted with an interval of minimum 4 weeks. The patients&#xD;
      will be followed with regular examinations for 12 months, starting from first treatment day.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically verified colorectal tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Conferred by multidisciplinary team (radiologists, surgeons and oncologists)&#xD;
             discussing options possible for the patient, resulting in agreement that an endoscopic&#xD;
             treatment with calcium electroporation should be offered to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment free interval of minimum 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Thrombocytes ≥ 50 billions/l, INR &gt;1,2. Medical correction is allowed, e.g. correction&#xD;
             of elevated INR by means of vitamin K.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance status ECOG/WHO ≤2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both men and women who are sexually active must use safe contraception (contraceptive&#xD;
             coil, deposit injection of gestagen, subdermal implantation, hormonal vaginal ring or&#xD;
             transdermal patch.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Trial subject ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Trial subject must be able to understand the participants' information.&#xD;

        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Coagulative disturbance that cannot be corrected&#xD;

             blood sample)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent participation in other clinical trials that involve experimental drugs or&#xD;
             participation in a clinical trial involving experimental drugs within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             administration of the drug in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with bevacizumab within the last 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heavily inflamed colorectal mucus membrane with bleeding or ulcerations.&#xD;
