  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well stereotactic body radiation therapy works in treating&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body and have&#xD;
      undergone surgery. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy&#xD;
      that sends x-rays directly to the tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause&#xD;
      less damage to normal tissue.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of postoperative stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) at a&#xD;
      dose of 34 grays (Gy) in five fractions, as compared with historical control efficacy rates&#xD;
      in patients who received conventionally fractionated postoperative radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the toxicity of postoperative SBRT at a dose of 34 Gy in five fractions,&#xD;
      both via physician-scored and patient-reported metrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the proportion of SBRT fractions for which on-line adaptive radiotherapy is&#xD;
      required due to changes in organ-at-risk anatomy, in the subset of patients treated with&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To gather biomarkers that may elucidate predictors of increased efficacy or increased&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare toxicity profiles (both physician-scored and patient-reported) between patients&#xD;
      treated utilizing a linear accelerator versus a tri-60Co teletherapy platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo SBRT every other day (QOD) for 14 days. Patients may also receive androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy (ADT) comprised of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist or a&#xD;
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, and an oral anti-androgen for 6 months at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 3 months for&#xD;
      1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;

    <measure>Biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rising from the post-treatment nadir to a level of 0.4 ng/mL or more with a confirmatory second test, initiation of salvage androgen deprivation therapy, or continued rise in PSA after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimate of the BCRFS will be estimated and presented graphically. One sample log-rank test will be used to test difference in BCRFS between intervention and historical control. The median BCRFS time will be calculated with 95% confidence interval. Summaries of the number and percentage of patients experiencing a biochemical recurrence will be provided.</description>
