  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study evaluating the feasibility of using adaptive intermittent dosing of&#xD;
      vemurafenib and cobimetinib in BRAF mutant patients with elevated baseline lactate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (LDH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an intermittent adaptive dosing of&#xD;
      vemurafenib and cobimetinib may be superior to standard, continuous dosing with these study&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vemurafenib and cobimetinib are already U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for&#xD;
      the treatment of BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma; however, melanoma often develops resistance&#xD;
      to these drugs over time, and the tumors start to re-grow. Investigators will use the&#xD;
      participant's LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) levels obtained from routine blood work, along with&#xD;
      CT scans to decide when to hold or resume their study treatment. Investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that this type of dosing schedule with vemurafenib and cobimetinib may potentially delay the&#xD;
      time to progression and re-growth of their melanoma.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Must have cytologically or histologically-confirmed unresectable melanoma that harbors&#xD;
             a BRAF V600 mutation determined by pyrosequencing assay or equivalent genotyping assay&#xD;
             in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory, meeting&#xD;
             one of the following American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition staging&#xD;
             criteria: a.) AJCC stage IV (Tany, Nany, M1a(1), M1b(1), M1c(1) or M1d(1)); b.) AJCC&#xD;
