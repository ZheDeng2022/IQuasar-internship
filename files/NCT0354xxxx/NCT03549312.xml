      The study hypothesis is to determine the feasibility of switching HIV-HCV co-infected&#xD;
      patients receiving methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone as opioid substitution therapy with&#xD;
      suppressed HIV RNA viral load on current antiretroviral therapy to&#xD;
      elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF, Genvoya™) followed by&#xD;
      12 weeks of HCV antiviral therapy with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL, Epclusa™), followed&#xD;
      then by switch to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF, Biktarvy™) for an&#xD;
      additional 48 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a phase IV, prospective, open-label study that is being conducted in&#xD;
      25 participants over the age of 18 on stable antiretroviral therapy with documented HIV viral&#xD;
      suppression who have received opioid substitution therapy (OST) for at least three months.&#xD;
      The study is designed to assess the feasibility of the switch from a participant's current&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen to Genvoya, followed shortly thereafter by initiation of&#xD;
      Epclusa for treatment of HCV co-infection with subsequent optimization of the ART regimen to&#xD;
      Biktarvy in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV receiving methadone or&#xD;
      buprenorphine/naloxone as OST. Participants will be recruited from the Infectious Diseases&#xD;
      Clinic (IDC) in Regina, a tertiary referral site that cares for a large number of patients&#xD;
      living with HIV and viral hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will have baseline investigations performed, including measures of&#xD;
      renal parameters and bone mineral densitometry, and will be switched from their current&#xD;
      antiretroviral regimen to Genvoya for the first 12 weeks of the study. Various reasons for&#xD;
      switching may play a role in clinician decision-making, including simplification, improved&#xD;
      tolerability, an improved metabolic risk profile, etc. The primary drawbacks to Genvoya in&#xD;
      clinical practice include the potential for drug-drug interactions due to the presence of&#xD;
      cobicistat, and the relatively low so-called &quot;genetic barrier&quot; of resistance, meaning that&#xD;
      sub-optimal adherence may be more likely to result in antiretroviral resistance. Participants&#xD;
      must already be fully suppressed at the time of screening to be enrolled in the study, as&#xD;
      well as having been stable on OST for at least three months, in order to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      poor adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the switch to Genvoya occurs, participants will be seen at weeks 1 and 4 to assess for&#xD;
      adverse events, including any changes in OST dosing. Laboratory testing will be performed as&#xD;
      per standard of care with CD4 counts and HIV viral loads checked at weeks 4 and 12 to ensure&#xD;
      stable virologic suppression following switch of ART. After 12 weeks of Genvoya, provided&#xD;
      that participants remain stably suppressed in terms of their HIV, they will then receive 12&#xD;
      weeks of Epclusa to treat their chronic HCV infection while continuing to take Genvoya.&#xD;
      Participants are allowed to have any HCV genotype and may have stage 0-4 liver fibrosis as&#xD;
      assessed by transient elastography, but may not have decompensated cirrhosis or&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Participants will be followed at weeks 13, 16 and 24 with clinical&#xD;
      assessments performed, and repeat HCV viral loads at weeks 16 and 24 (end of HCV treatment)&#xD;
      as per standard of care. Participants will be seen at weeks 36 and 48 and have their HCV&#xD;
      viral loads performed to determine whether they have achieved a sustained virologic response&#xD;
      12 and 24 weeks following end of HCV therapy, which defines HCV cure. Bone mineral&#xD;
      densitometry will be performed at week 48 to determine any interval change in bone mineral&#xD;
      density has occurred between study initiation and week 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 48 weeks of treatment with Genvoya, participants who agree will be switched to a&#xD;
      modern unboosted ARV regimen consisting of Biktarvy through a 48 week extension phase.&#xD;
      Biktarvy is approved by Health Canada as an unboosted integrase-inhibitor based single-tablet&#xD;
      regimen with once-daily dosing and a small pill size, which facilitates adherence to&#xD;
      treatment. Due to the presence of bictegravir, Biktarvy is likely to have a higher &quot;genetic&#xD;
      barrier&quot; of resistance than Genvoya, and the lack of boosting significantly decreases the&#xD;
      risk of drug-drug interactions. During the extension phase, participants will be seen at&#xD;
      weeks 49, 52, 60, 72. 84 and 96 for clinical assessments with HIV viral loads, CD4 counts and&#xD;
      standard of care laboratory testing. Bone mineral densitometry will be performed at week 96&#xD;
      to determine any interval change in bone mineral density has occurred between study&#xD;
      initiation and week 96.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, participants will see a study coordinator and have vital signs performed, a&#xD;
      review of their concurrent medications including any changes in their methadone dosing,&#xD;
      review for any adverse events, and weight and height measurements. Laboratory investigations&#xD;
      and urine drug screens will be performed as per current standards of care. Validated&#xD;
      questionnaires assessing whether the participant is having any symptoms or signs of opioid&#xD;
      withdrawal or overdose as well as determining treatment satisfaction with their new&#xD;
      antiretroviral regimen. will be administered at each visit. Each visit is anticipated to take&#xD;
      approximately 60-90 minutes, and the appointment for bone mineral density testing will take&#xD;
      no longer than 2 hours to complete with waiting time included. All study medication will be&#xD;
      provided during study period but not after study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study conclusion, demographic and other baseline variables will be summarized using&#xD;
      percentage, mean, median, standard deviation and interquartile range as appropriate. The&#xD;
      proportion of subjects achieving the various endpoints and the associated 95% confident&#xD;
      interval will be calculated. Adverse events will be summarized by grade and relationship to&#xD;
      treatment in addition to presenting the data in a listing format.&#xD;
