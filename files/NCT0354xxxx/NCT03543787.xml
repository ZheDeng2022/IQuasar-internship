      &quot;STRENGTHS&quot; is a transdisciplinary implementation research study, guided by the&#xD;
      PRECEDE-PROCEED framework, to address the challenge of improving hypertension control in&#xD;
      low-resource settings. The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that referral&#xD;
      networks strengthened by an integrated health information technology and peer support&#xD;
      intervention will be effective and cost-effective in improving hypertension control among&#xD;
      patients in western Kenya. The investigators hypothesise that the integrated Health&#xD;
      information Technology and Peer Support intervention will facilitate seamless referral of&#xD;
      hypertensive patients across the different levels of the health system compared to usual&#xD;
      care, leading to improvement in blood pressure. If proven to be successful, STRENGTHS can&#xD;
      serve as a model for improving referral of patients upstream and downstream in health systems&#xD;
      worldwide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and 80% of global mortality&#xD;
      due to cardiovascular diseases occurs in low- and middle-income countries. In low income&#xD;
      countries, lack of coordination between different levels of the health system threatens the&#xD;
      ability to provide the care necessary to control hypertension and prevent cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease related morbidity. Strong referral networks have improved health outcomes for chronic&#xD;
      disease in a variety of settings. Health information technology and peer-based support are&#xD;
      two strategies that have improved care coordination and clinical outcomes. However, their&#xD;
      effectiveness in strengthening referral networks to improve blood pressure control and reduce&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk in low-resource settings is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) partners with the Kenya Ministry&#xD;
      of Health to provide care for non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs), including&#xD;
      hypertension at all levels of the health system. The Kenya Ministry of Health Sector Referral&#xD;
      Strategy 2014-2018 calls for improving the referral system at every level of the health&#xD;
      system. AMPATH has piloted both health information technology and peer support for NCDs, and&#xD;
      both strategies are feasible in this setting. However, the impact of integrating Health&#xD;
      information technology and peer support to strengthen referral networks for hypertension&#xD;
      control is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposal's objective is to utilise the PRECEDE-PROCEED framework to conduct&#xD;
      trans-disciplinary, translational implementation research focused on strengthening referral&#xD;
      networks for hypertension control. The central hypothesis is &quot;Health Information Technology&#xD;
      integrated with peer support will be effective and cost-effective in strengthening referral&#xD;
      networks, improving blood pressure control, and reducing cardiovascular risk among&#xD;
      hypertensive patients in western Kenya.&quot; The investigators hypothesise that Health&#xD;
      information technology(HIT) and peer support(PS) will synergistically address barriers to&#xD;
      hypertension control at the patient, provider and health system levels. The investigators&#xD;
      further hypothesise that changes in referral network characteristics may mediate the impact&#xD;
      of the intervention on the primary outcome, and that baseline referral net-work&#xD;
      characteristics may moderate the impact of the intervention. To test these hypotheses and&#xD;
      achieve the overall objective, STRENGTHS has the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Conduct a baseline needs and contextual assessment for implementing and integrating&#xD;
      HIT and PS to strengthen referral networks for hypertension control, using a mixed-methods&#xD;
      approach, including: observational process mapping and gap assessment; baseline referral&#xD;
      network analysis; and qualitative methods to identify facilitators, barriers, contextual&#xD;
      factors, and readiness for change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Aim 1.1: Use data from the aim 1 to develop a contextually and culturally appropriate&#xD;
      intervention to strengthen referral networks for hypertension control using a participatory,&#xD;
      iterative design process. Conduct pilot acceptability and feasibility testing of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of HIT and PS for hypertension control by conducting a&#xD;
      two-arm cluster randomized trial comparing: 1) usual care vs. 2) referral networks&#xD;
      strengthened with an integrated HIT-PS intervention. The primary outcome will be one-year&#xD;
      change in systolic blood pressure and a key secondary outcome will be cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Aim 2.1: Conduct mediation analysis to evaluate the influence of changes in referral&#xD;
      network characteristics on intervention outcomes, and a moderation analysis to evaluate the&#xD;
      influence of baseline referral net-work characteristics on the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Aim 2.2: Conduct a process evaluation using the Saunders framework, evaluating key&#xD;
      implementation measures related to fidelity, dose delivered, dose received, recruitment,&#xD;
      reach, and context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of the intervention, in terms of costs per&#xD;
      unit decrease in SBP, per percent change in CVD risk score, and per disability-adjusted life&#xD;
      year (DALY) saved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project will add to the existing knowledge base on innovative and scalable&#xD;
      strategies for strengthening referral networks to improve control of NCDs in lower-MICs. If&#xD;
      proven to be effective, it has the potential to be a scalable model for other low-resource&#xD;
      settings globally.&#xD;

    <description>QRISK2 score is a computerised algorithm for predicting the ten-year risk of developing CVD events. The factors that enter into the calculation of the QRISK2 score include: Age 25-84 years, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, diabetes status, family history of coronary artery disease in first degree relatives below the age of 65 years, chronic kidney disease stages 4 and 5, atrial fibrillation, rheumatoid arthritis, cholesterol / high density lipoprotein ratio, systolic blood pressure, body mass index. A score of 10% or more suggest a 10% risk of primary CVD events in ten years and warrants intervention to reduce the risk. It's not used among patients who already have a heart attack or a stroke.</description>
