  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a condition affecting the persons' central nervous system&#xD;
      with a need for extensive and highly specialized initial health care provision followed by&#xD;
      comprehensive rehabilitation efforts. Frequent and life-long medical, cognitive, emotional&#xD;
      and behavioral changes are expected. The community-based services are largely responsible for&#xD;
      dealing with the chronic challenges affecting people with TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 patients &gt;16 years at the time of injury and between 18 and 72 years at inclusion, with&#xD;
      clinical TBI diagnosis on acute admission and verified injury-related intracranial&#xD;
      abnormalities reporting cognitive, emotional and physical problems more than 2 years after&#xD;
      the injury will be included and randomized to a patient-centered in-home program intervention&#xD;
      and treatment as usual. The intervention consists of an individualized and goal-oriented&#xD;
      intervention will be provided in the persons' home environment, in close collaboration with&#xD;
      family members and local health care providers when available. Assessments will be conducted&#xD;
      at baseline, at the end of the intervention 4 months after inclusion and one year after&#xD;
      inclusion. Primary outcome is participation (Part-O) and TBI specific health related quality&#xD;
      of life (Qolibri). Secondary outcomes include goal attainment within individualized targeted&#xD;
      outcome areas, depression and anxiety, symptom burden, unmet health care needs and&#xD;
      acceptability of intervention as assessed by patient, family member and health professional.&#xD;
      The project will contribute to increased understanding of knowledge transfer processes, and&#xD;
      dissemination of evidence based practice for TBI. Thus, the project has the potential to&#xD;
      improve the current health care for patients with TBI and its delivery.&#xD;

      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a condition affecting the persons' central nervous system&#xD;

      and behavioral changes are expected. The community-based services are largely responsible for&#xD;

&#xD;
      120 patients &gt;16 years at the time of injury and between 18 and 72 years at inclusion, with&#xD;
      clinical TBI diagnosis on acute admission and verified injury-related intracranial&#xD;
      abnormalities reporting cognitive, emotional and physical problems more than 2 years after&#xD;
      the injury will be included and randomized to a patient-centered in-home program intervention&#xD;
      and treatment as usual. The intervention consists of individualized and goal-oriented&#xD;
      strategies provided in the persons' home environment in close collaboration with family&#xD;
      members and local health care providers. The original protocol describes a total of 8&#xD;
      sessions of which 2 will be telephone based. Due to the Corona pandemic hittting Norway in&#xD;
      March 2020 the home visits had to be reduced and adapted to the individual situation of the&#xD;
      participants. The protocol now includes 8 sessions with up to 6 of them being delivered by&#xD;
      video. The intervention will be provided in addition to the usual treatment the participants&#xD;
      receive in the municipality. The control group will receive the usual treatment provided in&#xD;
      the municipality. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, at the end of the intervention&#xD;
      4-5 months after inclusion and one year after inclusion. Primary outcome is participation&#xD;
      (Part-O) and TBI specific health related quality of life (Qolibri). Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include goal attainment within individualized targeted outcome areas, depression and anxiety,&#xD;
      symptom burden, unmet health care needs and acceptability of intervention as assessed by&#xD;
      patient, family member and health professional. In March 2020 a few additional questions&#xD;
      regarding the impact of the Corona pandemic on health and participation has been included.&#xD;
      The project will contribute to increased understanding of knowledge transfer processes, and&#xD;
      dissemination of evidence based practice for TBI. Thus, the project has the potential to&#xD;
      improve the current health care for patients with TBI and its delivery.&#xD;
