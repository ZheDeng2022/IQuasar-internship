  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a soluble fibre supplement in the&#xD;
      development of gestational diabetes in women at high-risk. The secondary aim will to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of the soluble fibre supplement on glycaemic control in high-risk women who&#xD;
      develop gestational diabetes in early pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN We plan to conduct a randomised open label controlled study to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      the consumption of soluble fibre, from early to mid-pregnancy, on the incidence of&#xD;
      gestational diabetes, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion and metabolic control in GDM&#xD;
      diagnosed participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION We will be studying women with diagnosis of gestational diabetes in previous&#xD;
      pregnancies, (considered as high-risk) aged &gt;18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT Participants in the treatment arms will be 5 gr of Guar gum fibre supplement with&#xD;
      meals three times a day (total daily 15 g). Participants in the placebo arms will be taking 5&#xD;
      gr of Cellulose three times a day (total daily dose 15 g).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION Participants will be involved for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In women with early gestational diabetes (diagnosed at first assessment):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Glycaemic control assessed the need of insulin treatment Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
      In women requiring insulin treatment: days-to-insulin and total daily insulin dose.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Aim: To evaluate the effect of a soluble fibre supplement in glucose metabolism in pregnant&#xD;
      women at high risk of developing gestational diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methodology: 12 week randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Women will first be categorised according to their glycaemic status into two&#xD;
      groups: GDM and glucose tolerant women. Afterwards, each group will be randomised into two&#xD;
      groups and given either&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fibre supplement (Guar gum)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Placebo (Cellulose) The participants will take the dietary supplement three times a day&#xD;
           for 12 weeks. They will receive regular antenatal control according to NICE guidelines&#xD;
           recommendations. Compliance will be addressed by weekly phone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of volunteers: The number of participants will be arbitrarily define as no data of&#xD;
      this type of intervention exists in this cohort. 40 participants will be recruited. Previous&#xD;
      studies, outside pregnancy, have observed metabolic effects in samples of 15-40 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Women will be recruited in the antenatal clinic at Queen Charlotte and Chelsea's&#xD;
      Hospital. An information sheet will be provided to eligible women in the first antenatal&#xD;
      visit to explain the purposes of the study. Women who decide to take part will be asked to&#xD;
      sign a consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: Initially women will be categorised according to glycaemic status in two&#xD;
      cohorts: Glucose tolerant and Early gestational diabetes (GDM) cohort. Each of the two&#xD;
      cohorts will then be independently randomised to either intervention or standard care using&#xD;
      the sealed envelope website. Guar gum (intervention) and cellulose (placebo) will be provided&#xD;
      in identical packed sachets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose values at 0 and 120 minutes during an OGTT performed at 28 weeks in the glucose&#xD;
           tolerant group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glycaemic control assessed by need of insulin treatment, days to insulin treatment and&#xD;
           total insulin dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion at 28 weeks of pregnancy in the glucose&#xD;
      tolerant cohort of women through validated indices using glucose and insulin (or C-peptide)&#xD;
      values derived from the OGTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Insulin sensitivity will be assessed using the Matsuda formula&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Insulin secretion will be assessed by second-void fasting UCPCR. In the gestational&#xD;
      diabetes cohort, where a second OGTT will not be performed, parameters of insulin resistance&#xD;
      (HOMA_IR index) and secretion could be assessed using urinary C-peptide obtained from a&#xD;
      fasting second-void urine sample at 28 weeks gestation, although these measurements have not&#xD;
      been validated in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW UP Women will be assess by the researchers at four different visits.&#xD;
      At the first antenatal visit, the general care team will mentioned the study, if the patient&#xD;
      consents, she will then be approached by the researchers to explain the study protocol. At&#xD;
      the second visit, when the OGTT is performed, women who decided to take part in the study&#xD;
      will sign the consent from. At the next antenatal visit where results from the OGTT are&#xD;
      explained, women included will be randomised. The last research visit will take place at 28&#xD;
      weeks gestation. Additionally, they will be contacted weekly, by telephone to assess&#xD;
      compliance and confirm willingness to participate in the study. All participating women will&#xD;
      continue to attend routine follow up by the Obstetrics team at the antenatal clinic. Women&#xD;
      diagnosed with GDM in early pregnancy will continue their routine care under the Obstetric&#xD;
      team at Queen Charlotte's Hospital. We will be collecting information regarding treatment&#xD;
      from the notes taken at this follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st visit (≤16 weeks gestation) Women with a previous history of GDM will be considered&#xD;
           at high risk of recurrence and will be referred to the antenatal clinic before 16 weeks&#xD;
           of pregnancy. At this first visit, the direct care team will inform them about the study&#xD;
           and ask them if they are willing to speak with a member of the research team. If they&#xD;
           agree, a research team member will explain the protocol and invite them to participate&#xD;
           in the study. An information sheet will be provided and women will have time to consider&#xD;
           if they are willing to participate and inform the research team at their next antenatal&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd visit Women who decide to participate will inform the research team when they attend&#xD;
           their second antenatal visit, when an OGTT is to be performed. In this visit, women&#xD;
           willing to participate will be asked to sign a consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As part of the standard pregnancy care, these women will be booked for GDM early&#xD;
           screening. The following investigations will be performed as part of their usual NHS&#xD;
           care:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood tests: full blood count, renal function. GAD antibodies can be requested in&#xD;
                women in whom type 1 diabetes is suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urine sample to test for proteinuria, glycosuria, leucocytes and nitrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Women willing to participate in the study will be additionally requested to provide&#xD;
                a second urine sample after the 120 min during the OGTT. When bloods are taken will&#xD;
                also request HbA1c as part of the study's investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An OGTT to test for early GDM will be performed as part of routine care. During the&#xD;
                OGTT blood samples are taken at 0 and 120 minutes. Additionally to glucose, which&#xD;
                is normally measure during the OGTT, for study purposes we will request serum&#xD;
                C-peptide at these time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion will be estimated through validated&#xD;
           indices using serum glucose, insulin (or C-peptide) and urinary C-peptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the participants have agreed to take part in the study and consent has been&#xD;
           signed, data regarding anthropometrics, demographics and medical history will be&#xD;
           collected. This information will be obtained by reviewing the participant's medical&#xD;
           notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anthropometric measurements will be recorded at the first antenatal routine visit,&#xD;
           including: pre-pregnancy weight, weight at first visit and height. BMI will be&#xD;
           calculated with this data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Demographics, personal and medical history will be extracted from medical records,&#xD;
           including: maternal age, ethnicity, education, smoking during pregnancy, medical history&#xD;
           (hypertension, PCOS, other relevant condition), obstetric history (parity, stillbirth,&#xD;
           macrosomia, pre-eclampsia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. rd visit (Randomisation)&#xD;
&#xD;
           After obtaining the results from the OGTT, women will be categorised by their glycaemic&#xD;
           status and divided into two independent cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Women diagnosed with gestational diabetes (according to NICE guidelines 2015&#xD;
                diagnostic criteria): early GDM cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Women with normal glucose tolerance or impaired glucose tolerance but not&#xD;
                fulfilling GDM criteria: Glucose tolerant cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Women from each cohort will be randomised into two groups after the results of the OGTT&#xD;
           are obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intervention group: Guar gum fibre supplement&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Placebo group: Cellulose supplement Women will the fibre supplement 3 times a day&#xD;
                (with each main meal) until the 28th week of pregnancy when they will be&#xD;
                re-evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. rd visit (28th weeks gestation)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Glycaemic status will be assessed at 28 weeks gestation in the two cohorts of women&#xD;
           participating in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Women from the Glucose tolerant cohort will undergo a second OGTT. Blood and urine&#xD;
                samples will be collected at 0 and 120 minutes. Glycaemic status will then be&#xD;
                assessed with the endpoint being the diagnosis of GDM (yes/no). Insulin sensitivity&#xD;
                and insulin secretion will be estimated using the same parameters as in the first&#xD;
                visit. As part of the study, women will be weight to calculate BMI and gestational&#xD;
                weight gain at 28 weeks gestation. The research team will have their last face to&#xD;
                face visit with the participant to discontinue the intervention and answer any&#xD;
                potential questions about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In women in the Early GDM cohort, glycaemic control will be assessed by the need of&#xD;
                insulin treatment (yes/no) and in those requiring insulin the days-to-treatment&#xD;
                (insulin) and total insulin dose will be recorded. Data will be obtained by&#xD;
                reviewing medical records. As part of the study, women will be weight to calculate&#xD;
                BMI and gestational weight gain at 28 weeks gestation. The research team will have&#xD;
                their last face to face visit with the participant to discontinue the intervention&#xD;
                and answer any potential questions about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           PROCEDURES Women will be advised to fast for 10 hours the night before the oral glucose&#xD;
           tolerance test. They will also be advised no to restrict carbohydrate ingestion the&#xD;
           three days prior to the OGTT. At the antenatal clinic, blood samples will be collected&#xD;
           at baseline (0 min) and at 120 min after the administration of an oral load of 75 g of&#xD;
           glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the baseline sample other parameters will also be determined. Creatinine and HbA1c&#xD;
           will measure in all participants and GAD antibodies will be requested in women in whom&#xD;
           type 1 diabetes is suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serum insulin and C-peptide will be collected at 0 and 120 min during the OGTT. Women&#xD;
           will be advised to void their first urine before attending the antenatal clinic.&#xD;
           Second-void fasting urine sample will be collected at 0 min during the OGTT. A second&#xD;
           urine sample will be collected at 120 min. Urinary C-peptide will measure in these&#xD;
           samples will be transfer to boric acid containers, the alliquoted into 1 ml cryotubes&#xD;
           ans stored at -80 ºC until analysis. Serum creatinine will be collected at baseline (0&#xD;
           min) and measure in the central lab. The urinary C-peptide creatinine ratio (UCPCR) will&#xD;
           be calculated using these data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ASSESSMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
           (i) Gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes will be diagnosed if fasting plasma&#xD;
           glucose &gt;5.6 mmol/L and/or 120 min plasma glucose &gt;7.8 mmol/L after the glucose load&#xD;
           administered in the OGTT. Women with fasting plasma glucose &lt;5.6 mmol/L and 120 min&#xD;
           plasma glucose &lt;7.8 mmol/L will be classified as &quot;Glucose tolerant&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (ii) Insulin sensitivity Insulin sensitivity will be assessed using the Matsuda index as&#xD;
           originally described (18) (Equation 1) and using two modified Matsuda equations in which&#xD;
           insulin is substitute by either serum or urinary C-peptide (21,22) (Equations 2 and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Equation 1. ISOGTT= 10,000 / √ {[FPG x fasting insulin] x [mean glucose x mean insulin&#xD;
           during OGTT]} Equation 2. ISOGTTC-pep=500,000/√{[FPGxFsC-pep] x [mean glucose x mean&#xD;
           sC-pep during the OGTT]} Equation 3. ISOGTT-UCPCR=500,000/√{[FPG×FUCPCR pmol/mmol] x&#xD;
           [mean glucose x mean UCPCR during the OGTT]}&#xD;
&#xD;
           (iii) Insulin secretion Insulin secretion will be estimated by the UCPCR obtained using&#xD;
           the fasting second-void urine sample, as it is strongly correlated with serum insulin,&#xD;
           serum C-peptide (19) and 24-h urinary C-peptide (20).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Insulin response will be estimated using the UCPCR calculated with 120 min post-OGTT&#xD;
           urine sample, as it is strongly correlated with the C-peptide and insulin area under the&#xD;
           curve (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
           (iv) Need of insulin treatment, Days to insulin treatment and Total insulin dose Medical&#xD;
           records of women in the Early GDM cohort will be review in order to determine the need&#xD;
           of insulin treatment (yes/no) at 28 weeks gestation. In women requiring insulin&#xD;
           treatment at any time during follow up, days-to-insulin treatment, calculated from&#xD;
           randomisation day to the day insulin treatment is prescribed, and total insulin dose,&#xD;
           calculated as the total dose of insulin international units (IU) divided by weight in Kg&#xD;
           (insulin UI/Kg), will be recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
           PRE-RANDOMISATION EVALUATIONS Women will be evaluated by the mid-wife at the first visit&#xD;
           in the antenatal clinic. An OGTT will be book to test for early GDM in women with&#xD;
           previous GDM considered at high risk of recurrence. Personal and medical history will be&#xD;
           recorded. When women attend for the OGTT, blood and urine samples will be collected at 0&#xD;
           and 120 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA Participants will be free to withdraw at any time and are not&#xD;
           required to give a reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ADVERSE EVENTS Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or&#xD;
           clinical study subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Any untoward and unexpected medical occurrence that:&#xD;
           results in death, is life- threatening, requires hospitalisation, results in persistent&#xD;
           or significant disability or incapacity or a congenital abnormality or birth defect&#xD;
&#xD;
           Medical judgement should be exercised in deciding whether an AE is serious in other&#xD;
           situations. Important AEs that are not immediately life threatening or do not result in&#xD;
           death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the subject or may require intervention to&#xD;
           prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, should also be&#xD;
           considered serious.&#xD;
&#xD;
           REPORTING PROCEDURES All adverse events should be reported. Depending on the nature of&#xD;
           the event the reporting procedures below should be followed. Any questions concerning&#xD;
           adverse event reporting should be directed to the Chief Investigator in the first&#xD;
           instance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Non serious AEs All such events, whether expected or not, should be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serious AEs An SAE form should be completed and faxed to the Chief Investigator within&#xD;
           24 hours. However, relapse, death and hospitalisations for elective treatment of a&#xD;
           pre-existing condition do not need reporting as SAEs. All SAEs should be reported to the&#xD;
           sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All SAEs should be reported to the Bromley Research Ethics Committee where in the&#xD;
           opinion of the Chief Investigator the event was:&#xD;
&#xD;
           'Related', i.e. resulted from the administration of any of the research procedures; and&#xD;
           'Unexpected', i.e. an event that is not listed in the protocol as an expected&#xD;
           occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reports of related and unexpected SAEs should be submitted within 15 days of the Chief&#xD;
           Investigator becoming aware of the event, using the NRES SAE form for non-IMP studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Local investigators should report any SAEs as required by their Local Research Ethics&#xD;
           Committee and/ or Research and Development Office.&#xD;
&#xD;
           STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS Data handling and analysis will be carried out by SPSS&#xD;
           version 20.0 version. No power calculation to decide sample size will be used. The&#xD;
           number of participants has been arbitrarily defined, as it is a pilot study. We aim to&#xD;
           recruit 40 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before randomisation, women will be categorised according to their glycaemic status in&#xD;
           two cohorts: Glucose tolerant and GDM. Each of these two cohorts will be randomly&#xD;
           allocated into the intervention (soluble fibre supplement) and control (placebo) group.&#xD;
           Randomisation will be by sealed envelopes. Participants but not researchers will be&#xD;
           blinded as to the type of intervention prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Differences between group en each cohort will be assessed using Student t test or&#xD;
           Mann-Whitney U test for numeric variables depending on distribution; X2 will be used for&#xD;
           categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the Glucose tolerant women cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the primary outcome, GDM (yes/no), logistic regression analysis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the secondary outcomes, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion, linear regression&#xD;
           analysis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the early GDM cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the primary outcome, need for insulin treatment (yes/no), logistic regression&#xD;
           analysis will be performed. Additionally days-to-treatment analysis will be performed&#xD;
           for those participants starting insulin therapy during follow up.&#xD;
