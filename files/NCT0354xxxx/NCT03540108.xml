  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the major causes of death and disability in&#xD;
      industrialised countries. Results from several epidemiological and clinical studies indicate&#xD;
      a positive correlation between elevated total serum cholesterol levels, mainly reflecting the&#xD;
      LDL-cholesterol fraction, and risk of CHD. It is thought that a reduction in total plasma&#xD;
      cholesterol levels in populations suffering from primary hypercholesterolemia (elevated&#xD;
      cholesterol) can lower the incidence of coronary thrombosis. Currently, therefore there is&#xD;
      extensive interest in the management of serum cholesterol and other blood lipids. Diet is&#xD;
      viewed as a major influencing factor that can reduce levels. This is largely driven by the&#xD;
      expense of drug therapy, the large numbers of individuals affected and unwanted side effects&#xD;
      of such treatments. Dietary strategies for prevention of CHD implicate adherence to a&#xD;
      low-fat/low-saturated fat diet. Although such diets may present an effective approach, they&#xD;
      are difficult to maintain on a long-term basis and efficacy diminishes over time. As such,&#xD;
      new approaches towards identification of other dietary means of reducing blood cholesterol&#xD;
      levels have been evaluated. These include, among others, the use of probiotics. Probiotics&#xD;
      are 'live microbial feed supplements that offer a benefit to health'. They are marketed as&#xD;
      health or functional foods whereby they are ingested for their purported positive advantages&#xD;
      in the digestive tract and/or systemic areas like the liver, vagina or bloodstream. The main&#xD;
      goal of the study is to test the efficacy of the probiotic in degrading cholesterol as well&#xD;
      as produce metabolites that interfere with its synthesis in the liver in adults with high&#xD;
      cholesterol (&gt;6mmol). The effect may also be partially ascribed to an enzymatic deconjugation&#xD;
      of bile acids.&#xD;
