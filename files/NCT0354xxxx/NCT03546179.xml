  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether a temporary increase in tidal volume can&#xD;
      predict fluid responsiveness in patients receiving a low tidal volume ventilation in&#xD;
      hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that a temporary increase in tidal volume from 6 to 8 ml/kg&#xD;
      would improve the predictability of PVI in patients receiving low tidal volume ventilation in&#xD;
      surgical procedures with large fluid shift as hepatobiliary and pancreatic procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Common hepatobiliary and pancreatic procedures include repair of lacerations, drainage of&#xD;
      abscesses, and resection of primary or metastatic neoplasms. Care of patients undergoing&#xD;
      hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgeries in the perioperative period is often challenging&#xD;
      because of coexisting medical problems and debilitation found in many patients and because of&#xD;
      the potential for significant operative blood loss. Hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgeries&#xD;
      have been associated with high mortality and morbidity rates, but recent advances in&#xD;
      anesthetic and surgical management have significantly reduced the operative risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that intraoperative optimization of cardiac output by repeated volume&#xD;
      loading reduces postoperative morbidity and shortens hospital stay following abdominal&#xD;
      surgery. However, unnecessary intravenous fluids may be deleterious, and intraoperative fluid&#xD;
      restriction has been shown to improve clinical outcomes. During major hepatobiliary and&#xD;
      pancreatic surgeries, intravascular volume expansion is constantly required but the safety&#xD;
      margin of fluid management is quite narrow. The thought of fluid responsiveness has been&#xD;
      progressively used in order to improve the fluid management of critically ill patients. Over&#xD;
      the past two decades, many studies have been performed searching for the best index to&#xD;
      predict fluid responder in a variety of clinical situations. recent studies have shown that&#xD;
      what is called dynamic indexes of fluid responsiveness such as stroke volume variation (SVV),&#xD;
      pulse pressure variation (PPV) and others are obviously superior to the more commonly&#xD;
      measured static preload variables e.g. pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and central venous&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plethysmography variability index (PVI) is a dynamic variation parameter that automatically&#xD;
      and continuously calculates the respiratory variations in the plethysmographic waveform&#xD;
      acquired by the pulse oximeter. The PVI is presented as a safe and useful parameter for&#xD;
      evaluating the fluid responsiveness of perioperative patients who underwent major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery and for critically ill patients. Several studies have shown that PVI may predict&#xD;
      fluid responsiveness in patients undergoing noncardiac surgeries as well as those under&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. However, the accuracy of the PVI is&#xD;
      unclear for hepatobiliary and pancreatic operations that may have major cardiovascular&#xD;
      changes and/or hyperdynamic circulation. Also, there are still limited studies investigating&#xD;
      the direct relationship of PVI and cardiac preload status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PVI is based on the respiratory variations in the pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform&#xD;
      amplitude and various factors that affect lung mechanics, including tidal volume (VT) could&#xD;
      also influence PVI values and It is presumed that the effect of tidal volume reaches&#xD;
      significance at &gt;8 mL/kg Several studies have shown that dynamic indicators of fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness do not reliably predict fluid response during low tidal volume ventilation&#xD;
      whereas there is currently a growing trend towards a reduction in tidal volume, not only in&#xD;
      ICU patients with acute lung injury but also in patients with healthy lungs undergoing&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'tidal volume challenge' is a novel test proposed to improve the reliability of dynamic&#xD;
      indexes in predicting fluid responsiveness in patients receiving low tidal volume&#xD;
      ventilation. In a recent study testing the tidal volume challenge on some dynamic indexes, it&#xD;
      is found that the changes obtained by transiently increasing tidal volume (tidal volume&#xD;
      challenge) are superior to dynamic index itself in predicting ﬂuid responsiveness during low&#xD;
      tidal volume ventilation. However, no studies use this novel test to know the reliability of&#xD;
      PVI in predicting fluid responsiveness in patients receiving low tidal volume ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed on adult patients undergoing hepatobiliary and pancreatic&#xD;
      operations after obtaining approval of the Ethical and Scientific Committee of Fayoum&#xD;
      University Hospital and National Liver Institute and written informed consent from the&#xD;
      patients or their surrogates to participate. This study will be conducted at the National&#xD;
      Liver Institute Hospital, Menoufia, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery, intravenous access will be obtained. Demographic and anthropometric&#xD;
      data will be recorded. All patients will be monitored by standard routine monitoring which&#xD;
      includes a 5-lead electrocardiography, a non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      capnography, fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) and core temperature (using a&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal probe). After preoxygenation, general anesthesia will be induced with Propofol&#xD;
      2 mg/kg IV, Fentanyl 1 µg/kg IV and Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg IV followed by the endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation. Maintenance of general anesthesia with a mixture of Sevoﬂurane with 50% oxygen in&#xD;
      the air (GE Datex-Ohmeda S/5 Anesthetic Delivery Unit System). Mechanical ventilation will be&#xD;
      performed in all patients on a semi-closed system adjusted to keep SaO2&gt;95% and end-tidal CO2&#xD;
      between 35 mmHg and 40 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 7 F triple lumen central venous catheter will be inserted in the right internal jugular&#xD;
      vein by ultrasound guidance. The central venous catheter will be connected to a pressure&#xD;
      transducer, and the pressure trace will display continuously. The left radial artery will be&#xD;
      cannulated, Pressure transducer will be placed on the midaxillary line and fixed to the&#xD;
      operating table in order to keep the transducer at an atrial level during the study protocol.&#xD;
      All transducers will be zeroed to atmospheric pressure for measuring invasive arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure. An indwelling urinary bladder catheter will be inserted to monitor urinary output.&#xD;
      Head and extremity wraps and warmer systems in the form of forced warming system (Model&#xD;
      750-Bair Hugger Temperature Management Unit, Arizant Healthcare Inc, USA) will be applied to&#xD;
      maintain body temperature. A trans-esophageal Doppler (TED) probe (Cardio QP EDM™; Deltex&#xD;
      Medical, Chichester, UK) will be greased with a lubricating gel and passed nasally into the&#xD;
      mid-esophagus until aortic blood ﬂow signals will be best identified. Four skin electrodes&#xD;
      (iSense electrical cardiometry skin sensors; Osypka Medical) will be applied on the neck and&#xD;
      thorax per manufacturer recommendations on patients and electrical cardiometry monitor&#xD;
      (electrical cardiometry monitor, ICON Cardiotronics, Inc., La Jolla, CA 92307; Osypka Medical&#xD;
      GmbH, Berlin, Germany) will be connected to the sensor cable. These systems enable the&#xD;
      continuous monitoring of stroke volume (SV), stroke volume Index (SVI), heart rate (HR),&#xD;
      cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), thoracic fluid content (TFC), systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistance(SVR), corrected flow time (FTc) and stroke volume variation (SVV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Masimo Pulse Co-Oximeter probe (Masimo SET Rainbow R2-25r and R225a, Masimo Corp.,&#xD;
      Irvine, CA, USA) will be placed on the index finger of the patients and will be covered with&#xD;
      a shield to eliminate light interference, as recommended by the manufacturer. The PVI and&#xD;
      perfusion index (PI) variations will be automatically measured using the Masimo monitor&#xD;
      (Masimo Radical-7, Masimo Corp., Irvine, CA, USA) with PVI software. PVI is an automatic&#xD;
      measure of the dynamic change in PI that occurs during a complete respiratory cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All throughout surgery packed red blood cells (300 ml) will be transfused when hematocrit&#xD;
      percentage will be &lt;25%. Fresh frozen plasma (unit of 200 ml) will be administrated when a&#xD;
      Partial thromboplastin time&gt;70 s, Fibrinogen &lt;2 g/dl, or International Normalized Ratio (INR)&#xD;
      &gt;2. Patients will be extubated either in the operating room or post-operatively in intensive&#xD;
      care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention protocol Initially, demographic data of patients including age, sex, height,&#xD;
      actual body weight, predicted body weight (PBW), smoking history, comorbid diseases,&#xD;
      operative time will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After resection phase of tumours, baseline hemodynamic and respiratory variables including&#xD;
      CI, CO, SV, SVI, SVV, SVR, HR, mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP),&#xD;
      plateau pressure (Pplat), compliance of the respiratory system (Crs), TFC, FTc, PI and PVI&#xD;
      with an 6 ml/kg tidal volume ventilation (PVI6) will be recorded. After baseline measurement,&#xD;
      VT will be increased from 6 ml/kg to 8 ml/kg of predicted body weight for one minute and the&#xD;
      above-mentioned hemodynamic variables, including PVI with 8 ml/kg tidal volume ventilation&#xD;
      (PVI8) will be recorded. The tidal volume will be decreased back to 6 mL/kg PBW and after one&#xD;
      minute measurements will be recorded. After these hemodynamic measurements, volume expansion&#xD;
      will be performed for 10 min using an infusion of balanced crystalloid solution (6ml/kg of&#xD;
      predicted body weight). The same hemodynamic parameters will be measured under ventilation&#xD;
      with a VT of 6 ml/kg 5 min after volume loading. Thereafter the absolute (ΔPVI6-8,) and&#xD;
      percentage change (%ΔPVI6-8) between the PVI at 6 mL/kg PBW (PVI6) and at 8 mL/kg PBW (PVI8)&#xD;
      i.e. after performing a &quot;tidal volume challenge&quot; will be calculated. The change in PVI after&#xD;
      giving the fluid bolus (ΔPVIfb) will also be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No more than two tidal volume challenges can be performed in any patient. Doses of vasoactive&#xD;
      medications and PEEP will be kept constant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS version 24.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Data&#xD;
      are presented as mean (SD), median [interquartile range (IQR)], or number of patients (%).&#xD;
      Changes in continuous variables from 6 to 8mL/kg PBW will be compared using paired t-test or&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed rank sum test, and group comparisons between responders and non-responders&#xD;
      will be made using independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. Distribution&#xD;
      normality will be assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Categorical variables will be&#xD;
      analyzed using chi-square test or Fisher exact test.To test the abilities of dynamic preload&#xD;
      indices to predict fluid responsiveness, areas under the receiver operating characteristics&#xD;
      (ROC) curves of the responders will be calculated and compared using the Hanley-McNeil test&#xD;
      [area under the curve (AUC)=0.5, no better than chance, a useless test with no prediction&#xD;
      possible; AUC=0.6-0.69, a test with a poor predictability; AUC=0.7-0.79, a fair test;&#xD;
      AUC=0.8-0.89, a test with a good predictability; AUC=0.9-0.99, an excellent test; AUC=1.0, a&#xD;
      perfect test with the best possible prediction]. A value of optimal threshold will be&#xD;
      determined for each variable to maximize the Youden index [sensitivity + (specificity - 1)]&#xD;
      For the sample size calculation, Statstodo computer program is used to calculate the sample&#xD;
      size requirement for comparing two ROC curves with expected areas under the curves of 0.65&#xD;
      (PVI6) and 0.90 (ΔPVI6-8), assuming an α error of 0.05 and power of 90%, a minimum of 40&#xD;
      patients will be needed to detect an AUC difference of 0.25 when assuming the number of&#xD;
      responders is similar to that of non-responders. The investigators expect data loss to be&#xD;
      20%, so 48 patients needed to be enrolled in this study&#xD;
