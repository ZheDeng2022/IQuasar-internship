      Pembrolizumab plus autologous dendritic cell vaccine in patients with PD-L1 negative advanced&#xD;
      mesothelioma who have failed prior therapies.This is an exploratory, single-arm, open-label,&#xD;

      Pembrolizumab plus autologous dendritic cell vaccine in patients with PD-L1 negative advanced&#xD;
      mesothelioma who have failed prior therapies.This is an exploratory, single-arm, open-label,&#xD;
      phase 1b clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will explore treatment safety and the ability to induce PD-L1 expression of the&#xD;
      study treatment. Secondary objective will include clinical activity and immunological&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18 Patients will be enrolled . To ensure patients' protection and avoid unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, a formal safety analysis will be conducted after six patients have been observed&#xD;
      for at least 30 days after the third treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted on PD-L1 negative advanced mesothelioma patients with progressive&#xD;
      disease after standard therapy. Previous therapies must have included an antifolate agent and&#xD;
      a platinum compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment: Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV q3w until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      or informed consent withdrawal, or for a maximum of 2 years Autologous dendritic cells loaded&#xD;
      with autologous tumor homogenate, 107 cells ID q3w for up to six doses Interleukin-2 3 MU&#xD;
      s.c. from day +2 to day +6 after each DC administration.&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Any known history of or positivity of any serologic marker indicative of infection by&#xD;
             Treponema pallidum, hepatitis B virus (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBcAB), hepatitis C virus (HCVAb,&#xD;
             HCV RNA quantitative), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), whether actual or previous.&#xD;
             The sole positivity for antibodies against the HBsAg Ab (i.e. with all other HBV&#xD;
             markers negative) is indicative of previous HBV vaccination and therefore is&#xD;
             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.&#xD;
