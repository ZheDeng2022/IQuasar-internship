  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental trauma injuries during childhood may have an adverse impact on oral health throughout&#xD;
      life. If trauma injuries causes pulpal necrosis, then the root stop forming. These teeth have&#xD;
      consequently a questionable long-term survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental management of necrotic teeth with aberrant root formation represents a challenging&#xD;
      clinical situation. The classical approach for treating these teeth includes apexification.&#xD;
      Both apexification with Calcium hydroxide and MTA do not achieve the goals of continued root&#xD;
      development or restoration of pulp tissue functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last decades, a biological based approach referred as &quot;revascularization&quot;, or&#xD;
      &quot;regeneration&quot; has emerged as a biological treatment for necrotic pulps with aberrant root&#xD;
      development. This treatment aims to regenerate pulp-like tissue within the root canal space&#xD;
      after inducing an influx of stem cells from the apical papilla that results in&#xD;
      reestablishment of pulp protective functions. There is evidence supporting the regeneration&#xD;
      potential of dental tissues after regenerative endodontic treatment. However, root formation&#xD;
      in traumatized immature teeth seems variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study is to gain knowledge about the treatment of immature necrotic&#xD;
      teeth in young individuals due to dental trauma. The primary goal is to compare volumetric&#xD;
      hard tissue formation between the MTA apexification and the regeneration treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial, employing 34 young individuals aged 6-18 years, with immature&#xD;
      necrotic teeth will be included. The test group will be treated by the regeneration procedure&#xD;
      and the control group by the application of an MTA-plug. Clinical and low-dose cone-beam&#xD;
      computed tomography scans (preoperatively and at 18-months follow-up) will be retrieved.&#xD;
      Clinical data with information about tooth survival, absents of symptoms, resolution of&#xD;
      infection and root development will be taken at every session.&#xD;
