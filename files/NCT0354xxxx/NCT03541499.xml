  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, partially blind, placebo controlled, clinical trial evaluating a single&#xD;
      intranasal dose of BPZE1 in healthy adults. The study will evaluate a lyophilized formulation&#xD;
      of the product, with the goal of testing for the optimal dose for subsequent clinical trials.&#xD;
      Fifty healthy adults, 18-49 years of age will be randomized to one of the four following&#xD;
      treatment groups in a 3:3:3:1 ratio: 10^7 colony forming units (CFU) of BPZE1 administered by&#xD;
      VaxINator device, 10^9 CFU of BPZE1 administered by VaxINator device, placebo administered by&#xD;
      VaxINator device, 10^9 CFU of BPZE1 administered by needleless tuberculin syringe. Study&#xD;
      duration will be approximately 12 months with a subject participation duration of&#xD;
      approximately 6 months. The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of a single intranasal dose of either 10^7 or 10^9 CFU of lyophilized BPZE1&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;

      This is a phase 2a, single center, randomized, partially blind, placebo controlled, clinical&#xD;

      CFU of BPZE1 in healthy adults. The study will evaluate a lyophilized formulation of the&#xD;

      of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of a single intranasal dose of either&#xD;
      10^7 or 10^9 CFU of lyophilized BPZE1 vaccine. The secondary objectives of this study are: 1)&#xD;
      to assess the humoral immunogenicity of lyophilized BPZE1 vaccine at Day 15, Day 29 and Day&#xD;
      181 following receipt of one intranasal dose of 10^7 or 10^9 CFU of BPZE1; 2) to assess&#xD;
      mucosal immunogenicity of lyophilized BPZE1 vaccine at Day 29 and Day 181 following receipt&#xD;
      of one intranasal dose of 10^7 or 10^9 CFU of BPZE1; 3) to evaluate nasal clearance of BPZE1&#xD;
      by culture at Day 29 (and if still positive, at Day 46) following receipt of one intranasal&#xD;
      dose of lyophilized BPZE1 vaccine of 10^7 or 10^9 CFU of BPZE1.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects eligible to participate in this study must meet all inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for all&#xD;
             study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Males or non-pregnant females, 18-49 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. In good health*.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or&#xD;
             currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that have&#xD;
             been present for at least 90 days that would affect the assessment of the safety of&#xD;
             subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations. Chronic medical diagnoses or&#xD;
             conditions should be stable for the last 60 days. This includes no change in chronic&#xD;
             prescription medication, dose, or frequency because of deterioration of the chronic&#xD;
             medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to enrollment. Any prescription&#xD;
             change that is due to change of health care provider, insurance company, etc., or that&#xD;
             is done for financial reasons, if it is in the same class of medication, will not be&#xD;
             considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription&#xD;
             medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the site&#xD;
             principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a&#xD;
             deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn)&#xD;
             medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate&#xD;
             sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of&#xD;
             reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis&#xD;
             or condition. Similarly, medication changes after enrollment and study vaccination are&#xD;
             acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the subject's chronic medical&#xD;
             condition that necessitated a medication change, and there is no additional risk to&#xD;
             the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses to study vaccination.&#xD;
             Note: Topical and inhaled medications (with the exception of inhaled or nasal&#xD;
             corticosteroids within 30 days prior to enrollment), herbals, vitamins, and&#xD;

             symptoms are present. Otherwise, pulse should be 50-100 bpm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Systolic blood pressure is 85 to 150 mm Hg, inclusive.&#xD;

             anomalies may be repeated once to ensure accuracy; additionally, otherwise eligible&#xD;
             subjects with grade 1 abnormalities in these values may be considered for enrollment&#xD;
             if, in the opinion of the investigator (or clinician on the 1572), the abnormalities&#xD;
