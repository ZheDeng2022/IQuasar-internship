  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 single center, parallel group study to assess and compare the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK and PD of 4 single ascending doses of P1101 (100, 200, 300, and 450 μg)&#xD;
      following subcutaneous administration in healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-four healthy eligible Japanese male subjects and 24 healthy eligible Caucasian male&#xD;
      subjects, each divided into 4 cohorts of 6 subjects, will participate in this study. No&#xD;
      subject will participate in more than 1 cohort and all subjects will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      P1101. Caucasian subjects will be body weight- and height-matched to Japanese subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing will be initiated with the lowest dose of 100 μg in both Japanese and Caucasian&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

        Subjects are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria&#xD;
        apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult Japanese and Caucasian males aged 21 to 50 years inclusive and body mass index&#xD;

             grandparents born in Japan, lived for &lt; 10 years outside of Japan, and have no&#xD;
             significant change in life style since leaving Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Caucasian subjects must have both parents of Caucasian descent; Caucasian subjects are&#xD;
             defined as descendants of the original peoples of Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individual Caucasian subjects should be selected to match body weight (± 20%) and&#xD;
             height (± 15%) of corresponding Japanese subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to use effective methods of contraception during the entire&#xD;
             study period and for 12 weeks after dosing on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are healthy as determined by pre-study medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, and 12-lead ECG.&#xD;

             hematological parameters and liver function tests at Screening and Day -1. For results&#xD;
             outside the reference range at Screening and considered not clinically significant by&#xD;
             the Investigator a repeat test is allowed once during the Screening period. Note:&#xD;
             subjects with an absolute neutrophil count below 2.0 × 109/L will be excluded. All&#xD;
             other clinical laboratory test results must be within the reference range or judged&#xD;
             not to be clinically significant and acceptable to the Investigator.&#xD;

          -  Subjects with a history of latent or active tuberculosis or exposure to endemic areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a positive result in the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and/or clinically&#xD;
