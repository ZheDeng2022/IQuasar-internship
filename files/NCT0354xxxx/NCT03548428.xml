  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50% of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients will develop metastases in the course of&#xD;
      their disease. Cytotoxic therapy is a standard treatment in this setting but yields average&#xD;
      tumor response rates of 25% at first line and ≤10% at later lines. It is also limited in the&#xD;
      number of lines and courses by tolerance issues. Trials include poly/oligometastases&#xD;
      indistinctively and suggest that consolidation ablation is used in ~20% of patients with&#xD;
      residual oligometastases refractory to chemotherapy. Oligometastases represent a stage of&#xD;
      disease between completely absent and widely metastatic, and which might be cured if the&#xD;
      limited numbers of metastatic sites are eradicated. Ablative strategies to treat patients&#xD;
      with oligometastases from sarcomas yield prolonged survival times and stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy (SBRT) is associated with excellent tolerance. Surgery may be offered in&#xD;
      selected metastatic cases. Alternatively and increasingly, SBRT yields high control rates at&#xD;
      treated sites (≥ 80%). The so-called radioresistance of sarcomas is overcome by the high&#xD;
      doses per fraction made possible owing to the high precision achieved with SBRT. SBRT is an&#xD;
      accepted treatment strategy provided that tumor burden remains limited in the number and size&#xD;
      of metastases. Systemic treatment can be combined with SBRT. SBRT may produce abscopal&#xD;
      effects where tumors outside the irradiation area also demonstrate tumor shrinkage in some&#xD;
      occurrences. SBRT produces systemic antitumoral immune response in certain conditions and&#xD;
      enhances radiation-induced tumor cell death compared to conventional lower dose irradiation.&#xD;
      Abscopal effects have been potentialized with SBRT/immunotherapy in several tumor models.&#xD;
      Sarcomas are a privileged target tumor given their high metastatic propensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several potent immunomodulators that skew the tumor immune microenvironment toward a&#xD;
      proimmunity context are being investigated in STS either alone or in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy or targeted therapy. The PD-1 receptor is present within the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment, and limits the activity of infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes, thus&#xD;
      blocking effective immune responses. The action of PD-1 is triggered upon binding to its&#xD;
      ligands. PD-1 can stimulate the immunosuppressive function of regulatory T cells. Moreover,&#xD;
      blockade of PD-1 can stimulate anti-tumor immune responses. Significant responses have been&#xD;
      obtained in several sarcomas with acceptable tolerance. Preliminary clinical experience&#xD;
      suggests that immunotherapy can be efficient in refractory leiomyosarcomas. Several drugs&#xD;
      targeting the PD-1/PD-L1/2 axis are ongoing either as single agents or in combination with&#xD;
      ipilimumab, kinase inhibitors, or chemotherapy in STS subtypes. Combination of radiotherapy&#xD;
      with immunotherapy is included as a means of increasing tumor antigen release in metastatic&#xD;
      STS. Immunomodulated SBRT is a particularly attractive strategy, given the potential of&#xD;
      radiation to induce cytotoxicity in tumors and induce abscopal effects. A phase II radiation&#xD;
      trial showed increased apoptosis-, intra-tumoral dendritic cells and accumulation of&#xD;
      intratumoral T cells in STS with correlation with tumor-specific immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We here propose a randomized phase II study to prolong progression-free survival (PFS) with&#xD;
      the combination of SBRT/immunotherapy in oligometastatic STS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBRT is well-tolerated with hardly any severe toxicity (fewer than 5% acute and late grade 3&#xD;
      toxicities). It is performed in an ambulatory setting in only a few treatment fractions.&#xD;
      Associations between irradiation and immunomodulatory agents appear to be synergistic and&#xD;
      show favorable tolerance profiles. Immunomodulatory agents have a more favorable toxicity&#xD;
      profile than cytotoxic agents with about 65% overall acute toxicities. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      selectively binds to PD-L1 and competitively blocks its interaction with PD-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with anti-PD-1 antibodies that target T-cells, immunotherapy targets tumor cells,&#xD;
      and is therefore may induce fewer side effects, including a lower risk of autoimmune-related&#xD;
      safety issues, as blockade of PD-L1 leaves the PD-L2 - PD-1 pathway intact to promote&#xD;
      peripheral self-tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic irradiation is associated with an excellent tolerance with rates of grade 3 or&#xD;
      more toxicities below 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data of toxicity with the association of stereotactic irradiation and&#xD;
      immunotherapy show no cumulative toxicity in association with immunotherapy. However, their&#xD;
      incidence and characteristics are no different from that observed with stereotactic&#xD;
      irradiation alone. Moreover, intracranial metastases are exceptional in sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The toxicity of the association for extracranial stereotactic irradiation does not seem to be&#xD;
      increased either.&#xD;

      Open label, Phase II, prospective, multicentric, randomized study 2:1, 2 arm study designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy of a Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy treatment associated with&#xD;
      immunotherapy versus a Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy treatment only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy, in term of&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months, of immunomodulated stereotactic irradiation&#xD;
      in oligometastatic sarcoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PFS by immune response criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ratio PFS after radiotherapy/PFS during the previous line of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months by line of treatment and histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the toxicity of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the quality of life of patient treated by the combination of radio- and&#xD;
           immunotherapy or radiotherapy only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the cost of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate of PET-CT at inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlative study: Impact of biomarkers on clinical endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Developing a mathematical models for STS treatment by SBRT + immunotherapy predictive of&#xD;
           oligo versus poly metastatic evolution&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment to be used in this study is the Atezolizumab concomitant with High Dose&#xD;
      Radiation (SBRT) or the SBRT Alone Atezolizumab Subjects randomized in the experimental arm&#xD;
      will receive Atezolizumab 1200 mg in combination with SBRT, Q3W (6 cycles) for 4 months until&#xD;
      progression/completion. The Atezolizumab will be provided by the Sponsor (Centre Antoine&#xD;
      Lacassagne).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy will be discontinued in case of progression, unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      withdrawal of patient consent to receive study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation therapy SBRT can be performed with different equipments (CyberKnife, Truebeam,&#xD;
      etc.). Adequate tumor tracking and patient setup/repositioning as well as online IGRT&#xD;
      (image-guided radiation therapy) must be performed at each fraction. The maximal cumulative&#xD;
      tumor diameter is 6 cm to maintain an advantageous risk-benefit ratio with SBRT. Two types of&#xD;
      fractionation are proposed to account for tumor size and proximity of the tumor to sensitive&#xD;
      organs at risk. Three fractions are proposed in favorable cases, 5 in more delicate cases.&#xD;
      Fractions can be performed on consecutive days. Depending on cases, they may be delivered&#xD;
      every other day; the whole SBRT duration should not exceed 3 weeks.&#xD;
