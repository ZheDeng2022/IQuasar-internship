  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no doubt that chronic migraine is a large public health problem, which is both&#xD;
      disabling and costly. Many patients and headache doctors see Botulinum toxin (Botox)&#xD;
      treatment as a big stride forward, but it is a problem that the effect has been shown in only&#xD;
      one study, with a low therapeutic gain. For this reason, before this costly treatment is&#xD;
      expanded to potentially several thousand patients in Norway, it would be highly desirable&#xD;
      that 1) there is additional good scientific evidence for use of Botox , 2) a more effective&#xD;
      treatment procedure is developed, 3) the potential for unblinding is reduced, and 4) the&#xD;
      dose, number of injection sites and cost can be halved, and 5) the adverse effects are&#xD;
      minimized. These may be the results of this pilot project where injections are given along&#xD;
      the sutures, which can open up for a later randomized, blinded and controlled study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Infection at one or more injection site(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having received extracranial nerve block, cervical facet injection, or other&#xD;
             interventional procedure for headache within the prior 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of opioids or barbiturate containing medication(s) &gt; 10 days per month within the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Should not participate in the opinion of the investigator (e.g. not able to comply&#xD;
             with study procedures).&#xD;
