  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the change in participants' body weight from the start to the end of&#xD;
      the study. The weight loss in participants taking semaglutide (a new medicine) will be&#xD;
      compared to the weight loss of participants taking &quot;dummy&quot; medicine. In addition to taking&#xD;
      the medicine, participants will have talks with study staff about healthy food choices, how&#xD;
      to be more physically active and what you can do to lose weight. Participants will either get&#xD;
      semaglutide or &quot;dummy&quot; medicine - which treatment participants get, is decided by chance.&#xD;
      Participants will need to take 1 injection once a week. The study medicine is injected with a&#xD;
      thin needle in a skin fold in the stomach, thigh or upper arm. The study has two phases: A&#xD;
      main phase and an extension phase.The main phase will last for about 1.5 years. Participants&#xD;
      will have 15 clinic visits and 10 phone calls with the study doctor. Extension phase:&#xD;
      Approximately 300 participants will continue in the extension phase in the following&#xD;
      countries only: Canada, Germany, the UK and selected sites in the US and Japan. These&#xD;
      participants will be in the study for about 2.5 years.They will not receive treatment, but&#xD;
      will attend another 5 follow-up visits with the study doctor.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 129 sites in 16 countries as follows (all sites screened and randomized): Argentina (5 sites), Belgium (5 sites), Bulgaria (5 sites), Canada (7 sites), Denmark (1 site), Finland (2 sites), France (7 sites), Germany (13 sites), India (13 sites), Japan (5 sites), Mexico (3 sites), Poland (4 sites), Russian Federation (8 sites), Taiwan(1 site), UK (10 sites), US (40 sites).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The trial included an initial 16-week dose-escalation period and a 52-week dose maintenance period. Participants were randomized in 2:1 ratio either to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo. The treatment is an adjunct to reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Change in body weight from baseline (week 0) to week 68 is presented. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from both in-trial and on-treatment observation periods. In-trial observation period: the uninterrupted time interval from date of randomization (week 0) to date of last contact with trial site (week 75). On-treatment observation period: includes all time intervals in which participants are considered to be on treatment from the first (week 0) to last trial product administration (week 68), including 2 weeks of follow-up. It excludes any period of temporary treatment interruption. Temporary treatment interruption is defined as more than 2 consecutive missed doses (off-treatment period).</description>

        <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary and mental component summary). In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation, respectively, for the 2009 US general population. Change from week 0 in the domain scores and component summary scores were evaluated at week 68. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. These endpoints were evaluated based on the data from in-trial observation period which is the uninterrupted time interval from start of randomization (week 0) to last trial-related subject-site contact (week 75).</description>

        <description>IWQoL-Lite for CT is a modified version of an instrument designed to assess weight-related quality of life. It is used to assess the impact of body weight changes on patients' physical and psychosocial functioning in three composite scores (physical function, physical and psychosocial) and a total score. The scores range between 0-100 where higher scores indicate a better quality of life. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. These endpoints were evaluated based on the data from in-trial observation period which is the uninterrupted time interval from start of randomization (week 0) to last trial-related subject-site contact (week 75).</description>

        <description>The observed number of participants experiencing a meaningful within participant improvement in SF-36 Physical function after 68 weeks was determined based on two different thresholds. The threshold of 4.3 is the default generic responder threshold defined in SF-36 manual for a general population. The threshold of 3.7 is specific for the population with overweight or obesity included in the study and calculated using patient global rating anchor questionnaires to reflect participants' own perspective based on FDA recommendations. In the reported data, &quot;Yes&quot; infers the number of participants who have achieved an improvement in score greater than or equal to the threshold and &quot;No&quot; infers number of participants who have not achieved an improvement in score greater than or equal to the threshold.

        <description>The observed number of participants experiencing a meaningful within participant improvement in IWQOL-Lite-CT physical function after 68 weeks was determined based on two different thresholds. The threshold of 20 was a preliminary responder threshold based on earlier studies. The threshold of 14.6 is specific for the population with overweight or obesity included in the study and calculated using patient global rating anchor questionnaires to reflect participants' own perspective based on FDA recommendations. In the reported data, &quot;Yes&quot; infers the number of participants who have achieved an improvement in score greater than or equal to the threshold and &quot;No&quot; infers the number of participants who have not achieved an improvement in score greater than or equal to the threshold.

          <title>Participants Who Achieve &quot;Responder Definition Value&quot; (Yes/no) for IWQoL-Lite for CT Physical Function Domain (5-items) Score</title>
          <description>The observed number of participants experiencing a meaningful within participant improvement in IWQOL-Lite-CT physical function after 68 weeks was determined based on two different thresholds. The threshold of 20 was a preliminary responder threshold based on earlier studies. The threshold of 14.6 is specific for the population with overweight or obesity included in the study and calculated using patient global rating anchor questionnaires to reflect participants' own perspective based on FDA recommendations. In the reported data, &quot;Yes&quot; infers the number of participants who have achieved an improvement in score greater than or equal to the threshold and &quot;No&quot; infers the number of participants who have not achieved an improvement in score greater than or equal to the threshold. The endpoint was evaluated based on the in-trial observation period. In trial observation period: the uninterrupted time interval from randomization (week 0) to last trial related subject-site contact (week 75).</description>

        <description>Change in lipase (measured as units per litre [U/L]) is presented as ratio to baseline. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from on-treatment observation period. On-treatment observation period: includes all time intervals in which participants are considered to be on treatment from the first (week 0) to last trial product administration (week 68) including 2 weeks of follow-up. It excludes any period of temporary treatment interruption. Temporary treatment interruption is defined as more than 2 consecutive missed doses (off-treatment period).</description>
