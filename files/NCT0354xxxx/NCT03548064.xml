      This is a trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of double mutant heat-labile toxin&#xD;
      LTR192G/L211A (dmLT) from Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) by oral, sublingual, or&#xD;
      intradermal vaccination in approximately 135 healthy adult volunteers, age 18-45 years. Study&#xD;
      duration is approximately 2.5 years, with each participant duration for up to 9 months&#xD;
      depending on the route of dmLT administered. There is no specific hypothesis being tested in&#xD;
      this study. The primary objective of this study is to assess the reactogenicity, safety, and&#xD;
      tolerability of dmLT when administered in three sequential doses, over a range of dosages by&#xD;
      oral, sublingual, or intradermal routes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity of double mutant heat-labile toxin LTR192G/L211A (dmLT) from&#xD;
      Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) by oral, sublingual, or intradermal vaccination in&#xD;
      approximately 135 healthy adult volunteers, age 18-45 years, who meet all the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria and reside in Bangladesh. Study duration is approximately 2.5 years, with each&#xD;
      participant duration for up to 9 months depending on the route of dmLT administered. The&#xD;
      study population will be recruited from Mirpur, a community of Dhaka, Bangladesh, known as&#xD;
      having a high rate of diarrheal, respiratory, and enteric disease. This clinical trial is&#xD;
      designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a range of&#xD;
      dosages of dmLT administered by three different routes: oral, sublingual, or intradermal. The&#xD;
      oral and sublingual routes of administration will evaluate dosages of 5, 25, and 50&#xD;
      micrograms of dmLT; the intradermal route of administration will evaluate dosages of 0.3,&#xD;
      1.0, and 2.0 micrograms of dmLT. Participants will receive a total of three sequential doses&#xD;
      of dmLT; the oral and sublingual routes will be at days 1, 15, and 29 and the intradermal&#xD;
      route will be at days 1, 22, and 43. There is no specific hypothesis being tested in this&#xD;
      study. The primary objective of this study is to assess the reactogenicity, safety, and&#xD;
      tolerability of dmLT when administered in three sequential doses, over a range of dosages by&#xD;
      oral, sublingual, or intradermal routes. The secondary objectives of this study are: 1) to&#xD;
      assess the long-term safety, from first vaccination through 6 months following the last dose&#xD;
      of vaccine, 2) to evaluate the serum anti-dmLT IgG and IgA response, 3) to evaluate the IgG&#xD;
      and IgA anti-dmLT Antibody Secreting Cell (ASC) response, 4) to evaluate the IgG and IgA&#xD;
      anti-dmLT Antibodies in Lymphocyte Supernatant (ALS) response, 5) to evaluate the total fecal&#xD;
      IgA and fecal anti-dmLT IgA response, and 6) to evaluate the total salivary IgA and the&#xD;
      saliva-derived anti-dmLT IgA response.&#xD;
