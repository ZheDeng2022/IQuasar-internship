  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of an accelerated course for percutaneous&#xD;
      tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) induction to treat overactive bladder symptoms. The standard&#xD;
      12 weekly induction treatments may be a patient burden and a more rapid induction may speed&#xD;
      up symptomatic improvement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition with a prevalence ranging from 5.9% to 16.9%&#xD;
      in the United States and has been found to increase with age. OAB has a negative impact on&#xD;
      health related quality of life (QoL), Per American Urological Association (AUA) / Society of&#xD;
      Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU) guidelines, PTNS is&#xD;
      a third line recommendation for OAB along with onabotulinumtoxinA (BTX) injection and sacral&#xD;
      neuromodulation. In the single sham-controlled trial (SUmiT: n=220), Peters et al reported&#xD;
      that 54.5% of PTNS subjects had moderately or markedly improved bladder symptoms on global&#xD;
      response assessments (GRA) compared to 20.9% of sham subjects (p &lt;0.001). PTNS subjects also&#xD;
      had statistically significant improvements in frequency, nighttime voids, voids with moderate&#xD;
      to severe urgency and urge urinary incontinence (UUI) episodes compared to sham. There is&#xD;
      also early data from an implanted chronic tibial nerve stimulation lead study that shows a&#xD;
      minimum of 8 hours of tibial nerve stimulation a day results in significant improvement in&#xD;
      incontinence episodes per day at one week. Our study will test the concept of whether the&#xD;
      PTNS effect is dose (total time of treatment) sensitive, and whether expanding the dosage of&#xD;
      each treatment, i.e. from 30 minutes to 2 hours, will provide significant clinical&#xD;
      improvement after a one week induction course.&#xD;
