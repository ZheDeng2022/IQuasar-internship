  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic insufficiency (IA) is defined as an abnormal regurgitation of blood from the aorta to&#xD;
      the left ventricle in diastole, due to a lack of tightness of the aortic valves. It&#xD;
      represents about 10% of valvular pathologies but the annual mortality of nonoperated patients&#xD;
      can be as high as 10% to 20%. The quantification of AI is therefore important as it can&#xD;
      remain perfectly asymptomatic for a long time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doppler echocardiography is currently the key examination to confirm the presence of&#xD;
      valvulopathy, to allow positive diagnosis of valve leakage regardless of location, to specify&#xD;
      the etiology and mechanism of regurgitation. The quantification of IA requires, in&#xD;
      transthoracic ultrasound, to take into account many parameters that individually have all&#xD;
      certain limitations. The recommendations are therefore to have an integrative approach&#xD;
      considering a combination of different parameters and an overall interpretation. This makes&#xD;
      it possible to evaluate with greater precision the importance of the leak. Thus, there is the&#xD;
      difficulty of quantifying moderate and severe AI for lack of a truly unique criterion. One of&#xD;
      the evaluation criteria commonly used in transthoracic ultrasound is diastolic regurgitation&#xD;
      in the aortic arch but this assessment is sometimes difficult. The left subclavian artery&#xD;
      (SCG) is more accessible than the aortic arch in terms of the ultrasound window. The&#xD;
      measurements will be easier to record since the vessel is more superficial and there are&#xD;
      fewer air interpositions than for the aortic arch. The quantification of the AI based on this&#xD;
      new element will be compared to the other previously validated ultrasound criteria. The&#xD;
      investigators will use this study to describe the feasibility of collecting coronary flow in&#xD;
      the artery (IVA), and they will compare systolic velocity, diastolic rate / systolic rate&#xD;
      ratio compared to a control group without severe aortic insufficiency (grades 2 and 3). The&#xD;
      flows recorded in the IVA will be compared to the importance of the aortic leakage according&#xD;
      to its different modes of quantification (ultrasound and MRI). The aim of the study will be&#xD;
      to show that diastolic reflux in the left subclavian artery is a marker of severe AI (grades&#xD;
      2 and 3) by comparing this regurgitation with that measured at the level of the aortic arch&#xD;
      and other validated ultrasound criteria and cardiac MRI.&#xD;

    <description>The TransThoracic Echocardiography imaging data are collected exactly as for a standard examination. However, an additional measurement of the flow at the level of the left subclavian artery is performed, resulting in a 10-minute increase in the examination time. A Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging 4D Flow is programmed within a maximum of 10 (no change in treatment that could skew the comparison). The usual procedure for MRI is not modified. The examination allows the acquisition of conventional 2D sequences of flow measurements, regurgitant volume and regurgitation fraction obtained at the level of the descending aorta and the sino-tubular junction of the ascending aorta. An additional 4D sequence is acquired increasing the examination time by 10 minutes.</description>
