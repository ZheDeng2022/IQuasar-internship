  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Obesity is an important and growing worldwide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obesity is highly related to the development of metabolic syndrome, diabetes,&#xD;
           cardiovascular diseases and cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diverse adverse events have been reported with the use of antiobesity drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Several articles describe the beneficial effect of several specific components of the&#xD;
           Obex® supplement on weight loss, in the reduction of waist circumference, suppression of&#xD;
           appetite, decrease fasting glucose levels, improvement of insulin sensitivity and β&#xD;
           cells function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therefore, the administration of Obex in overweight and obese patients could be an&#xD;
           excellent strategy to induce weight loss and ameliorate the metabolic disturbances&#xD;
           related to obesity and overweight.&#xD;
