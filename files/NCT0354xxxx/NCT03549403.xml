  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study describe and evaluate the effectiveness of patient-centered telephone education in&#xD;
      day surgery. The aim is to evaluate the effects of patient-centered telephone education on&#xD;
      the experienced health of adult patients and the costs of healthcare in day surgery.&#xD;
      Telephone education intervention is planned in co-operation with the day surgery unit´s&#xD;
      healthcare staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of participants will receive current education in day surgery, while the other half will&#xD;
      receive developed patient-centered telephone education before and after day surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research is an experimental randomized controlled trial -study and it will be carried out in&#xD;
      a Finnish day surgery unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What are the implications of patient-centered pre- and postoperative telephone education&#xD;
           for the experienced health of day surgery adult patients? Hypothesis 1: The experimental&#xD;
           health of the trial group is better than the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the impact of patient-centered pre- and postoperative telephone education on the&#xD;
           costs of healthcare in day surgery adult patients? Hypothesis 1: The costs of healthcare&#xD;
           in the trial group is lower than in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to produce new information that is used in the design and implementation of&#xD;
      patient-centered and cost-effective patient education as well as develop patient education&#xD;
      more patient-centered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to the trial (n = 60) and the control group (n = 60) in the order in&#xD;
      which they receive the surgery time. The sample size is verified by force analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group´s education: The nurse will call the preoperative call to the patient home&#xD;
      one week before the day surgery and postoperatively within 3-8 days after the day surgery.&#xD;
      The intervention will be carried out in accordance with the guidelines and the contents of&#xD;
      the developed patient-centered telephone education intervention in the same way in each&#xD;
      patient. The call duration is approximately 15 to 30 minutes. Telephone education is carried&#xD;
      out by a nurse responsible for preoperative telephone education in day surgery unit and 2-3&#xD;
      anesthesia nurses who have also participated in the intervention planning. The researcher&#xD;
      provides them with guidance on patient-centered telephone education prior to intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group´s education: The control group's education is carried out by nurses responsible&#xD;
      for patient education in the day surgery unit who have not been involved in the planning and&#xD;
      implementation of the intervention. Education is implemented in accordance with current&#xD;
      practice, where day surgery adult patients receive preoperative education over the phone one&#xD;
      week prior to day surgery and postoperative education during the day surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of the data is done by the modified Oldwellactive Oulu -instrument, whose&#xD;
      reliability has been found to be acceptable in the previous studies.The preliminary&#xD;
      questionnaire is sent before surgery to the patient and returns the questionnaire is upon&#xD;
      arrival in the day surgery. Nurses receive the questionnaires and put them in a sealed&#xD;
      mailbox placed in the department. The investigator is responsible for clearing the mailbox.&#xD;
      The questionnaire for the final measurement is given by nurses to the day surgery patient in&#xD;
      connection with discharge education. The questionnaire is requested to fill in two weeks&#xD;
      after the surgery and return it with a supplied postage stamped addressed envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The costs of health-care are calculated in the number and duration of postoperative patient´s&#xD;
      phone calls to the day surgery unit of the patient documents as well as separate book counts.&#xD;
      Additionally calculated the number of emergency / polyclinic / hospital department visits and&#xD;
      laboratory examinations / X-ray images after the day surgery of patient documents for 3&#xD;
      months. The costs of the trial group are compared to the control group before and after the&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient randomization is performed by various nurses than by the intervention itself, thus&#xD;
      avoiding the risk of selective randomization. A randomizing nurse will share day surgery&#xD;
      adult patients meeting the criteria for entry into the trial and control groups in the order&#xD;
      in which they receive the surgery time. Patients are provided with a Register Statement and&#xD;
      an identification code list to ensure the intervention´s planned implementation of the study.&#xD;
      The Register Statement of the patients is stored on the researcher's computer behind the&#xD;
      password. Questionnaires are encoded that the identity of the patients is not disclosed. In&#xD;
      the health-care cost´s calculation, markings from patient documents are processed without&#xD;
      personal identifiers, so the issues being processed can not be combined with a particular&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires are stored in a locked locker and all material on the researcher's computer&#xD;
      behind the password. The researcher is responsible for the retention and proper disposal of&#xD;
      the material, questionnaires, registration descriptions and identification code lists.&#xD;
      Research findings are set to scientific criticism at the publishing stage and possible&#xD;
      criticism is taken into account. The results are not generalized or prettify. Reporting aims&#xD;
      at open, clear and accurate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data is analyzed using descriptive parameters and regression analysis for preliminary and&#xD;
      final status by testing the difference between the trial and control groups by the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U-test. The Consort checklist is used to evaluate and report the intervention&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
