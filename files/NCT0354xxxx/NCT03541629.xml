      Objective. The objective of the study is to verify and validate the data collected in the&#xD;
      Spanish EURECCA (EUropean REgistry of Cancer CAre) Esophagogastric Cancer Registry between&#xD;
      January 2014 and December 2017 through an audit process. It is also intended to describe the&#xD;
      initiation and implementation of this Registry as well as its early outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. An audit of registered cases (esophageal, esophagogastric junction and gastric&#xD;
      cancer resectable patients undergoing surgery) from 01/01/2014 to 12/31/2017 and a&#xD;
      descriptive analysis of these data will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results. The study could show that the Spanish EURECCA Esophagogastric Cancer&#xD;
      Registry is a reliable source of information, valid for carrying out specific and exhaustive&#xD;
      analysis that may lead to high quality publications in indexed journals. It is also expected&#xD;
      to generate a high impact based on the large number of cases included in the Registry,&#xD;
      favoring new research projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance. The standardization of the data collection is essential to compare outcomes&#xD;
      between different centers, regions and countries. This study will allows us to verify the&#xD;
      integrity of the collected data as well as its accuracy, a critical aspect to gain&#xD;
      credibility for future studies using the Registry data.&#xD;

      The overall objective of the project is to verify and validate the data collected in the&#xD;
      Spanish EURECCA Esophagogastric Cancer Registry through an audit process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is divided into two sub-studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For sub-study 1 (data audit) the specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To verify the integrity of the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To check the accuracy of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For sub-study 2 (descriptive analysis) the specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform a descriptive analysis of the outcomes of the Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare our information and outcomes with the outcomes of other European registries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EURECCA project (European Registration of Cancer Care) began in 2007 with the aim of&#xD;
      improving the quality of care for patients with rectal cancer in different European&#xD;
      countries. The EURECCA Upper GI Cancer Registry was created in 2013, focusing exclusively on&#xD;
      esophagogastric cancer. At first, a consensus was reached among several European registries&#xD;
      (England, Ireland, Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, Poland and Italy), about a basic list of&#xD;
      data that any esophagogastric cancer registry needs to collect (de Steur 2014). Since then,&#xD;
      two studies developed within the EURECCA Project have been published analyzing and comparing&#xD;
      the data of these registries (Messager M: 116-122, 2016; Messager M: 1432-47, 2016) and&#xD;
      showing variations within countries. A review of the literature shows how the implementation&#xD;
      of the registries has evolved over the years, for example, Denmark initiated the national&#xD;
      registry of esophagogastric cancer in 2003 (Jensen 2010; Kjaer 2017) and Sweden in 2006&#xD;
      (Linder 2016). In 2007, the Dutch Cancer Society concluded that by analyzing and auditing the&#xD;
      data collected in the registries it is possible to minimize the variation between centers,&#xD;
      leading to an improvement in the overall quality of patient care (Wouters 2010). In 2011, the&#xD;
      National Oesophagogastric Cancer Audit (NOGCA) of England started collecting prospective&#xD;
      information of every diagnosed and treated case of esophageal and stomach cancer, and since&#xD;
      then has reported its results annually (https://digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB21561). In 2011,&#xD;
      the Dutch Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer Audit (DUCA) initiated a national registry of all&#xD;
      patients with esophageal and stomach cancer undergoing surgery with curative intent.&#xD;
      Participation in this registry is mandatory since 2012 and represents a quality standard&#xD;
      whose preliminary results have allowed the optimization of cancer diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      (Busweiler 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The centralization of esophageal and gastric cancer surgery in Spain is now a reality in&#xD;
      Catalonia and Navarre since 2011 and 2012 respectively. Since 2013, the Spanish EURECCA&#xD;
      Esophagogastric Cancer Registry has been collecting data in both Autonomous Communities&#xD;
      (Allum 2016) and, furthermore, it is important to point out that since the beginning there&#xD;
      has been a consensus on the required variables with their respective definitions. An example&#xD;
      of this has been the description and reporting of post-operative complications following the&#xD;
      recently validated recommendations of the Esophageal Complications Consensus Group (ECCG)&#xD;
      (Low 2015; Low 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verifying and validating the collected data is crucial to ensure the reliability of the&#xD;
      information (Bray 2009; Parkin 2009). In Norway, an audit of the data collected in the&#xD;
      Norwegian Registry of Rectal Cancer (NRCR) created in 1993 (Sunniva 2015) has been published,&#xD;
      demonstrating a high degree of validity and an improvement in the quality of the treatment&#xD;
      over the years. Since June 2012, this registry also has an electronic version. In relation to&#xD;
      esophagogastric cancer surgery, periodic audits on the diagnostic process and the results of&#xD;
      the treatment are carried out in England, Sweden (Linder 2016), and the Netherlands&#xD;
      (Busweiler 2016). All these publications conclude that audits are an important strategy used&#xD;
      in health care to maintain quality standards and improve patient care. Audits provide a way&#xD;
      to identify deficiencies in clinical practice, to assess trends and provide constructive&#xD;
      feedback to surgeons and others health care workers. The validity of any audit is based on&#xD;
      the accuracy of its data. For this reason, is considered vital to carry out an &quot;in situ&quot;&#xD;
      audit of the data collected in the EURECCA on-line Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EURECCA Registry&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EURECCA online Registry collects data of esophageal, esophagogastric junction and gastric&#xD;
      cancer resectable patients undergoing surgery. It was launched with the initial participation&#xD;
      of 2 Spanish Autonomous Communities, Catalonia and Navarra, with 21 participating centers. In&#xD;
      March 2017, the Basque Country joined the Registry, incorporating other 9 hospitals. More&#xD;
      recently La Rioja joined as well with a single hospital. It is important to highlight that,&#xD;
      to date, there are 30 participating centers in the Spanish EURECCA Esophagogastric Cancer&#xD;
      Registry, which collect information of more than 10 million people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this specific project, only the cases of the two first Autonomous Communities that&#xD;
      initiated the project will be analyzed: Catalonia and Navarre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality measure and data set For this specific study the data collection was closed on&#xD;
      December 31, 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online form contains 93 variables distributed in 4 categories of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient characteristics: Patient data (7) and Comorbidities (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Care process: Diagnosis and staging (10), Preoperative optimization (4), Neoadjuvant&#xD;
           treatment (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery and histopathology: Surgery (17), Histopathology (24).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative period: Hospital stay and Complications (14), Follow-up (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection of these variables was established in accordance with a general consensus of&#xD;
      the Spanish EURECCA group. Multidisciplinary quality standards have been introduced (surgery,&#xD;
      oncology and histopathology) and all the PIs (Principal Investigators) were sent the&#xD;
      definitions of many of the variables: for instance lymphadenectomies (D0, D1, D1+, D2) and&#xD;
      complications (Pneumonia, Acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, acute&#xD;
      delirium, generalized sepsis, pancreatic fistula). In addition, pathologists from all Units&#xD;
      participating in the EURECCA project agreed to follow standardized histopathology protocols&#xD;
      for esophageal, esophagogastric junction and gastric cancer in order to describe and report&#xD;
      their findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audit and validation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The on-line form itself is considered as an internal filter/audit for data collection.&#xD;
      Several data fields inform if they seem implausible when saving them, according to previously&#xD;
      established ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the Data Manager (DM) monthly provides a feedback to each center, summarizing&#xD;
      the missing variables (blank) and potentially erroneous ones, to be reviewed by the PIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the experience of the Dutch Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer Audit (DUCA) (Busweiler&#xD;
      2016), the validation of the data collected in our Registry will be carried out at two&#xD;
      levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First level: Integrity. To ensure that patients are collected consecutively&#xD;
           (non-selected) and the Registry includes all cases of resectable Esophageal,&#xD;
           Esophagogastric junction and Stomach Cancer operated on, a cross-check with the data&#xD;
           from the Clinical Documentation Service of each center will be carried out. Each&#xD;
           Clinical Documentation Service will be requested to perform a search in its hospital&#xD;
           discharge database of all cases codified by the International Classification of Diseases&#xD;
           (ICD-9-CM International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical&#xD;
           Modification for Catalonia and ICD-10-CM International Classification of Diseases, Tenth&#xD;
           Revision, Clinical Modification for Navarra) with the main diagnosis associated with&#xD;
           Esophageal, Esophagogastric junction and Stomach Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second level: Accuracy. A small group of researchers (2 doctors or 1 doctor + 1 Data&#xD;
           manager), from a different center to the one evaluated, will visit the audited center&#xD;
           and will carry out an exhaustive review of a list of selected variables included in the&#xD;
           Registry. A random sample of patients will be selected in each participating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For those centers where the total number of cases is less than or equal to 20, the&#xD;
                entire sample (100%) will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For those centers where the total number of cases is between 21 and 100, a sample&#xD;
                of 20 patients will be taken, randomly chosen (minimum 20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For those centers that exceed 100 cases, a sample of 20% of the total number of&#xD;
                patients included in that hospital will be selected, up to a maximum of 50&#xD;
                patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidities: ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) score, Charlson Comorbidity&#xD;
           Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis and stage: Date of diagnosis, Location of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neoadjuvant treatment: Start date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery: Date of the surgery, Access, Surgical technique (type of gastrectomy and&#xD;
           esophagectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histopathology: Histological type, Radicality of the resection (R0, R1, R2), No. of&#xD;
           lymph nodes examined, Pathological stage (pTNM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative period: Complications, Transfusion, Pneumonia, Anastomotic leak,&#xD;
           Clavien-Dindo classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up: Last follow up, Readmission, Recurrence, Date of recurrence, Patient status,&#xD;
           Date of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A concordance process between the extracted data during the &quot;in situ&quot; review and the data&#xD;
      contained in the EURECCA Registry will be established. The reviewers will prepare an audit&#xD;
      report with the errors and/or blank fields detected and this will be sent to the PIs of this&#xD;
      audit for its analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univariate descriptive analysis will be performed, presenting the results as means (with&#xD;
      standard deviation and range) for the continuous variables and as numbers and percentages for&#xD;
      the categorical variables. In addition, bivariate analysis will be carried out among the&#xD;
      variables of interest to describe their level of correlation and evaluate the possible&#xD;
      differences between them. To evaluate the differences between the continuous variables, the&#xD;
      comparison of means based on the T-Student will be used, and for the comparison of&#xD;
      differences in the categorical variables, the Chi-square test will be used. Finally, linear&#xD;
      regression models and generalized linear models (as appropriate depending on the response&#xD;
      variable) will be used to study the dependence of the variables of interest, with other&#xD;
      factors of study. Statistical analysis will be carried out using the SPSS (Statistical&#xD;
      Package for the Social Sciences) Software (IBM SPSS Statistics 22). All tests will be&#xD;
      bilateral with a level of significance of 5%. 100% of the data recorded from 01/01/2014 to&#xD;
      06/30/2017 will be analyzed, and the proportion of values lost in the variables of interest&#xD;
      will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, it is proposed to carry out the following descriptive and comparative analysis&#xD;
      between hospitals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor location: Stomach, Esophagus, Esophagogastric junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients characteristics and comorbidities: Age (≤70 o &gt;70), Sex (Ratio M:F), BMI (&lt;20,&#xD;
           20-24, 25-29, ≥30), Weight loss %, ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) score, ASA&#xD;
           score (1-2 or ≥3), Charlson Comorbidity index (0, 1, ≥2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor characteristics: Tumor localization, Histological type, Clinical tumor stage, CEA&#xD;
           (carcinoembryonic antigen), Ca 19.9, Preoperative study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment: Preoperative optimization (transfusions, hemoglobin (Hb) at diagnosis,&#xD;
           preoperative Hb, iron therapy), Neoadjuvant treatment, Surgery (type, approach, type of&#xD;
           anastomosis, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative period and follow-up: Length of hospital stay, Complications (types and&#xD;
           Clavien-Dindo classification), Readmission, Adjuvant treatment, In-hospital mortality,&#xD;
           30 and 90 days mortality, Recurrence.&#xD;
