  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decades, advances in treatment have led to an increasing number of children who&#xD;
      survive cancer, resulting in a growing population of childhood cancer survivors. After end of&#xD;
      cancer treatment on common protocols survivors are enrolled in non-harmonized follow-up&#xD;
      programs with frequent visits and blood samples. However, the evidence for the value of these&#xD;
      follow-up programs with respect to the effect on detecting relapse and the effects on overall&#xD;
      survival is scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to give a comprehensive description of the detection mode of relapsed&#xD;
      acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), including symptoms and blood test results. Further, we&#xD;
      aim to evaluate if the mode of detection affects survival.&#xD;

      Investigators have identified a cohort of children with B-precursor ALL and T-ALL enrolled in&#xD;
      the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL-92, ALL-2000 and&#xD;
      ALL-2008 trials and experienced a relapse or an SMN as the first event after cessation of&#xD;
      maintenance therapy (368 patients). From medical charts and blood test results it will be&#xD;
      decided whether the relapse/SMN was diagnosed at a routine visit (including routine blood&#xD;
      tests) or if the relapse was diagnosed because of symptoms at a non-scheduled visit or blood&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the NOPHO database probably is one of the most complete databases globally, it is an&#xD;
      advantage to perform this study as a NOPHO study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of this population based relapse study will provide an evidence-based background for&#xD;
      planning optimal and relevant follow-up programs for children after therapy of ALL treated&#xD;
      according to contemporary Nordic ALL protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is important and relevant in the light of today's high ALL cure rates and a need&#xD;
      for optimal follow-up programs after cessation of ALL treatment and possible prediction of&#xD;
      relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timing of the project is an increased focus on the clinical relevance of routine clinical&#xD;
      follow-up of patients treated for cancer.&#xD;
