  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After sustaining severe trauma to the chest, patients will often bleed into the chest cavity&#xD;
      (pleural space) which is called hemothorax or they may also experience air leakage within the&#xD;
      chest cavity in combination with the bleeding (hemopneumothorax). These conditions are&#xD;
      treated with the insertion of a tube into the chest called a chest tube (CT). Insertion of&#xD;
      the CT is very painful for the patient due to the size or diameter of the tube. Alternative&#xD;
      to CT is a small percutaneous catheter (PC), pigtail or non-pigtail. At Banner-University of&#xD;
      Arizona Tucson Campus (B-UATC) investigator prefers inserting a small pigtail catheter for&#xD;
      the management of hemothorax or hemopnuemothorax. The primary purpose of our study is to see&#xD;
      if the use of the PC is just as effective as CT in terms of removing leaked blood and/or air&#xD;
      from the chest cavity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for traumatic hemothorax (HTX) and hemopneumothorax (HPTX) has been an&#xD;
      insertion of a large-bore chest tube (CT) (French 28-40). The procedure is associated with&#xD;
      significant patient's pain and discomfort. Our institution has taken a lead role to replace&#xD;
      chest tube insertion with percutaneous (pigtail) catheter (PC) (14F) insertion. The&#xD;
      investigators have previously published that, not only PC works just as well as the&#xD;
      traditional CT for both pneumothorax (1) and hemothorax( 2), but it is also associated with a&#xD;
      significant less insertion pain and tube site pain (3). In that hemothorax study,&#xD;
      investigator reported 36 patients who received PC for HTX (2) with the same success as 32F&#xD;
      chest tube in term of initial output and success rate; success rate was defined as no further&#xD;
      intervention was needed. Since the completion of that study (December 2011), our division has&#xD;
      inserted probably 100 PC for hemothorax and hemopneumohthorax Therefore, investigator now&#xD;
      believes that it is time for us to demonstrate the efficacy of the PC for hemothorax with a&#xD;
      prospective and randomized study as investigators have done previously for traumatic&#xD;
      pneumothorax (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator hypothesizes that PC will be just as effective as CT in patients with&#xD;
      traumatic HTX and HPTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aim is to demonstrate the efficacy of the PC in a prospective and randomized&#xD;
      fashion as we have done previously in pneumothorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary end point is the success/failure rate. Failure is defined as patient require a&#xD;
      second intervention i.e., second tube, video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS), etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary end points are the amount of initial tube drainage (1-hour), 24-hour, 48-hour,&#xD;
      72-hour; tube insertion-related complications, hospital length of stay, and patient's&#xD;
      experience during CT/PC insertion (if patient can provide the information).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, most trauma surgeons prefer CT over PC for the management of traumatic HTX. The&#xD;
      study will provide a level 1 scientific evidence that PC works as well as CT for traumatic&#xD;
      HTX/HPTX, and we have already shown that PC is less painful than CT.&#xD;
