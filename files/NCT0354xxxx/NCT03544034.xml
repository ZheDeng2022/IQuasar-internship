  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is to develop, implement, pilot evaluate, and disseminate a medication safety&#xD;
      program (HomeTeam) that consolidates strategies to help patients by partnering with patients&#xD;
      and their informal caregivers during transitions from hospital to home. Care transitions,&#xD;
      especially from hospital to home, are high-risk periods for medication errors, and are&#xD;
      frequently associated with serious adverse drug events (ADEs) and preventable readmissions.&#xD;
      Older adults with multi-morbid conditions who have complex medication regimes are especially&#xD;
      prone to these risks. Patients and family caregivers may experience a dramatic transition in&#xD;
      roles and responsibilities immediately after hospital discharge. Patients and family&#xD;
      caregivers are relatively passive recipients in their care and medication management in the&#xD;
      hospital, but when patients arrive at home, patients have the primary responsibility for&#xD;
      their care and medication use (with professional care providers switching to a 'supporting'&#xD;
      function). Although this significant transition in the nature and intensity of patient work&#xD;
      needs to be managed actively, often patients and family members are not adequately engaged&#xD;
      and prepared in the hospital, and not effectively supported for safe medication use after&#xD;
      hospital discharge. More specifically, patients and family members may not understand&#xD;
      essential steps in the management of their condition, and have difficulty contacting&#xD;
      appropriate health care practitioners for guidance. Although most organizations deploy&#xD;
      multiple layers of interventions for improving care transitions, reducing postdischarge&#xD;
      adverse drug events (ADEs), 30-day readmissions and emergency department (ED) visits, their&#xD;
      impact to date has been small, and there remains significant and urgent need to fundamentally&#xD;
      redesign the hospital-to-home care transition process. Investigators believe that one&#xD;
      practical and potentially effective way for this 'much-needed' redesign is through engaging&#xD;
      and supporting patients and families in safe medication use. Investigators' proposed program&#xD;
      'HomeTeam' will contain evidence-based tools and methods for engaging patients and shifting&#xD;
      culture towards a truly patient-centered care for medication safety.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The 'HomeTeam will be developed and evaluated by completing 3 specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1: Develop components of a multi-faceted program (HomeTeam) that consolidates&#xD;
      evidence-based practices in patient and family activation and engagement related to&#xD;
      medication safety, with the goal to adequately and reliably support transitions from the&#xD;
      hospital to the patient home &quot;work system&quot; for medication management. Inpatient stays and the&#xD;
      hospital discharge periods will be targeted as opportunities in activating, engaging, and&#xD;
      enabling patients and family members to improve medication safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1a) Identify evidence-based practices in patient and family activation and engagement&#xD;
      related to medication safety during care transitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. b) Develop program components (e.g., action-oriented patient/ family education, improved&#xD;
           medication reconciliation, patient-centered rounds, learning systems through systematic&#xD;
           feedback from home care professionals)-including tools to assess, prioritize,&#xD;
           streamline, and integrate existing practices- aimed at engaging patients and families&#xD;
           and supporting medication use safety during care transitions from hospital to home with&#xD;
           a participatory design (PD) approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim #2: Refine and implement the HomeTeam program in two organizations (one academic,&#xD;
           one community hospital), with a peer-to-peer assessment methodology to identify and&#xD;
           refine patient and family engagement practices for transitional care medication safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a) Refine HomeTeam program through participatory design approach and peer-to-peer&#xD;
           assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2b) Implement and pilot test HomeTeam in all participating sites&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #3: Evaluate the implementation process and the impact of the toolkit 'HomeTeam' on&#xD;
      medication safety after hospital discharge. Investigators will use a pre-post design to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of the toolkit over a one year period, focusing on 65 years of age and&#xD;
      older medicine patients. The primary outcome is preventable and ameliorable adverse drug&#xD;
      events (ADEs) after discharge. Secondary outcomes include 30-day post-discharge readmissions&#xD;
      and ED visits due to medication-related issues process improvement assessment,&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes, and toolkit adoption assessment (e.g., acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility). Qualitative methods (post-implementation interviews with clinicians and&#xD;
      patient/ family members) will be used as part of the evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Investigators hypothesize that the HomeTeam Medication Safety Program will reduce&#xD;
      preventable and ameliorable post-discharge 30-day ADEs in the following subpopulations: older&#xD;
      adults with at least 5 medications discharged from hospital to home on (H01) anticoagulants,&#xD;
      (H0b) opioids, (H0c) diabetes agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be conducted in two hospitals: Bayview Medical Center (academic) and Howard&#xD;
      County Medical Center (community). Dissemination plans include national medication safety&#xD;
      organizations (e.g., Institute for Safe Medication Practices), patient safety organizations&#xD;
      (e.g., Batz Patient Safety Foundation), and professional societies (e.g., Society of Hospital&#xD;
      Medicine). Different dissemination modalities are planned, including story-telling through&#xD;
      social media and short videos targeted for patients and clinicians.&#xD;
