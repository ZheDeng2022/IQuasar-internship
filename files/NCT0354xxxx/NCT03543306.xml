    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, non-randomized, open-label study to assess the efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      tolerability of dabrafenib and trametinib in stage IV disease to subjects with BRAF V600E&#xD;
      mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Subjects will receive dabrafenib 150 mg bid and&#xD;
      trametinib 2 mg once daily in combination therapy and continue on treatment until disease&#xD;
      progression, death, or unacceptable adverse event.&#xD;
