  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are a costly and burdensome health concern, affecting over 15&#xD;
      million adults each year in the United States. Several FDA-approved medication-assisted&#xD;
      therapies (MATs) are used for the treatment of AUD, with disulfiram (Antabuse) the oldest and&#xD;
      one of the most common. Disulfiram acts as a &quot;psychological deterrent&quot; and causes&#xD;
      physiological reactions when taken with alcohol. Despite demonstrated efficacy for decreasing&#xD;
      relapse, disulfiram is underutilized: efficacy is best demonstrated under monitoring or&#xD;
      supervision, creating a barrier for use. Additionally, disulfiram adherence rates are low.&#xD;
      The most common reason for non-adherence is that an individual is contemplating or planning a&#xD;
      relapse, which typically occurs within 50 hours. Thus, disulfiram non-adherence can be a&#xD;
      marker for relapse, providing a very short window for intervention. Technological advances&#xD;
      now allow for electronic medication monitoring: devices are designed to objectively track&#xD;
      adherence. The Wisepill device is an electronic medication monitoring system that pairs&#xD;
      real-time monitoring with a triggered text message (SMS) when doses are late. The Wisepill&#xD;
      device plus medication reminder SMS messages are associated with increased adherence to&#xD;
      antiretroviral or diabetic therapy. Though the capability exists, potentially therapeutic SMS&#xD;
      messages paired with Wisepill objective monitoring have yet to tested in any population.&#xD;
      Indeed, previous research suggests that supportive and relapse prevention/coping skills SMS&#xD;
      message interventions are effective in reducing alcohol use. Thus, given that disulfram&#xD;
      non-adherence can signify a critical clinical concern (i.e., impending relapse), the delivery&#xD;
      of a tailored, relapse prevention-focused, just-in-time SMS soon after disulfiram&#xD;
      discontinuation could have a significant impact on AUD treatment outcomes. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to develop an intervention capitalizing on the Wisepill technology to pair real-time&#xD;
      medication monitoring with tailored (a) real-time triggered reminders, (b) real-time&#xD;
      abstinence support, and (c) relapse prevention SMS texts for individuals with AUD being&#xD;
      treated with disulfram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to develop a 12-week Wisepill+SMS intervention for individuals in&#xD;
      alcohol treatment on disulfiram. This will include: 1) an in-person Wisepill orientation&#xD;
      session to introduce the device and generate tailored relapse prevention messages; 2) use of&#xD;
      the Wisepill device during the intensive treatment program and after discharge; 3) tailored&#xD;
      SMS messages paired with use of the Wisepill device: a) supportive messages with medication&#xD;
      compliance, b) reminder messages for early non-adherence (e.g., 1 hour late) and c)&#xD;
      relapse-prevention messages after longer periods of non-adherence (e.g., several hours). The&#xD;
      goal of this application is to develop the Wisepill+SMS intervention with the aid of focus&#xD;
      groups (n=20), then test the Wisepill+SMS intervention in a RCT (n=75) comparing Wisepill+SMS&#xD;
      to Wisepill only (i.e., no SMS) and disulfiram only (i.e., no Wisepill, no SMS). The Wisepill&#xD;
      device, and its associated real-time monitoring and messaging systems, are relatively&#xD;
      low-cost, easy to program, and can deliver an intervention that would reduce barriers to&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excessive alcohol use is associated with a host of economic and health problems, with an&#xD;
      estimated annual burden of over $249 billion. One-third of the population will meet&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD) in their lifetime. Among those who become&#xD;
      abstinent, relapse rates are high, particularly in the first 90 days of sobriety.&#xD;
      Pharmacotherapy continues to be an effective treatment approach. Several FDA-approved&#xD;
      medication-assisted therapies are used, commonly disulfiram (Antabuse) 5. Disulfiram acts as&#xD;
      a &quot;psychological deterrent&quot; and causes physiological reactions when taken with alcohol.&#xD;
      Despite demonstrated efficacy for decreasing relapse, disulfiram is underutilized, primarily&#xD;
      because of the supervision and monitoring required for its most efficacious use. In addition,&#xD;
      disulfiram adherence rates are low. Reasons for non-adherence may be non-deliberate (i.e.,&#xD;
      forgetfulness), but often are deliberate (i.e., contemplating or planning a relapse to&#xD;
      alcohol use). Indeed, individuals who discontinue disulfiram relapse approximately 50 hours&#xD;
      after a missed dose 4. Thus, disulfiram discontinuation may be a proxy for a return to&#xD;
      drinking. Identifying this window before relapse, through medication monitoring and&#xD;
      implementing a just-in-time intervention, may reduce risk of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous methods used to monitor adherence have been subject to self-report bias, have been&#xD;
      constrained by the need for observer reports, have measured prescription refills as a proxy&#xD;
      for adherence, or have relied on participant attendance at later assessment sessions to&#xD;
      collect data. Technological advances now offer the opportunity to objectively measure&#xD;
      adherence in real time through opening of the medication bottle. The Wisepill device is an&#xD;
      electronic medication event monitoring systems that can pair real-time monitoring with a&#xD;
      triggered text message (Short Message Service; SMS) when doses are late. Studies utilizing&#xD;
      Wisepill plus medication reminder SMS messages find increased adherence to antiretroviral or&#xD;
      diabetic therapy. Though the capability exists, potentially therapeutic SMS messages paired&#xD;
      with Wisepill objective monitoring have yet to tested. Given that disulfram non-adherence can&#xD;
      signify a potentially critical clinical concern (i.e., impending relapse), the delivery of a&#xD;
      tailored, relapse prevention-focused, just-in-time message soon after a disulfiram dose has&#xD;
      been missed could have a significant impact on AUD treatment outcomes. Indeed, previous&#xD;
      research suggests that supportive and relapse prevention/coping skills SMS message&#xD;
      interventions are effective in reducing rates of alcohol use. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      develop an intervention capitalizing on the Wisepill technology to pair real-time medication&#xD;
      monitoring with tailored (a) real-time triggered reminders, (b) real-time abstinence support,&#xD;
      and (c) relapse prevention SMS texts for individuals with AUD being treated with disulfram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To develop a 12-week Wisepill+SMS intervention for individuals in intensive outpatient&#xD;
      alcohol treatment who are prescribed disulfram. This will include: 1) an in-person Wisepill&#xD;
      orientation session to introduce the device and generate relapse prevention messages that can&#xD;
      be later delivered during non-adherent windows; 2) use of the Wisepill device during the&#xD;
      intensive treatment program and after discharge; and 3) three forms of tailored SMS messages&#xD;
      paired with Wisepill device use: a) supportive messages with medication compliance, b)&#xD;
      reminder messages for early non-adherence (e.g., 1 hour late) and c) relapse-prevention&#xD;
      messages after longer periods of non-adherence (e.g., several hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a. The investigators will conduct 4 focus groups (total n=20) with patients previously (2&#xD;
      groups) and currently (2 groups) prescribed disulfram to help identify barriers to the&#xD;
      Wisepill+SMS intervention, inform the types of SMS messages to be delivered, and determine&#xD;
      strengths and limitations of the proposed intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1b. The investigators will modify and finalize the Wisepill+SMS intervention, based on data&#xD;
      from focus groups, as well as barriers limiting its utility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To conduct a preliminary RCT with 75 individuals with AUD utilizing disulfiram in early&#xD;
      recovery, comparing (a) Wisepill+SMS intervention, (b) monitoring by Wisepill only (i.e., no&#xD;
      SMS texts delivered), and (c) disulfiram use only (i.e., no Wisepill). The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize: 2a. Relative to the Wisepill-only and disulfiram-only conditions, the&#xD;
      Wisepill+SMS condition will demonstrate improved outcomes with regard to the primary outcome&#xD;
      of interest (i.e., alcohol use), specifically greater percent days abstinent at end of&#xD;
      intervention (3-months) and at 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2b. Relative to the Wisepill-only and disulfiram-only conditions, the Wisepill+SMS condition&#xD;
      will result in greater adherence to medication, increased coping, increased self-efficacy,&#xD;
      and increased perceived social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2c. The investigators hypothesize that these mechanisms (i.e., medication adherence, coping&#xD;
      strategy utilization, abstinence self-efficacy, and perceived social support) will be&#xD;
      significantly associated with alcohol outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that this project will lead to the development of a&#xD;
      well-specified, novel, technology-supported medication adherence/relapse prevention&#xD;
      intervention for individuals with AUD utilizing disulfiram in early recovery that can be&#xD;
      subsequently tested in a future fully-powered randomized controlled treatment trial.&#xD;
