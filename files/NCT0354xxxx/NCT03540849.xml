  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite a high recovery rate with chemotherapy and radiation therapy treatment, 15 to 30% of&#xD;
      patients suffering from Hodgkin lymphoma are refractory or relapsed. Standard rescue&#xD;
      treatment for these patients is chemotherapy followed by a hematopoietic stem cell auto-SCT.&#xD;
      Despite a very good rate of complete sustainable response in 50% of the patients, another 50%&#xD;
      of the patients relapse after increased therapy and require additional treatment.&#xD;
      Consequently, one option for these patients is to offer a novel rescue therapy, enabling them&#xD;
      to have partial or complete response, and offer them a hematopoietic stem cell allo-SCT. In&#xD;
      the only prospective phase 2 study published by Sureda et al. assessing this therapeutic&#xD;
      approach, the rate of mortality not linked to relapse was 8% at 100 days and 15% at 1 year.&#xD;
      The progression-free survival rate was 48% at 1 year and 24% at 4 years. Relapse occurred&#xD;
      between 3 and 35 months with a median of 6 months in 51% of the patients out of a total of 78&#xD;
      patients. Cumulative incidence of relapse was 37% at 1 year and 59% at 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brentuximab Vedotin (Bv) is an anti-CD30 antibody-drug conjugate. This drug has shown its&#xD;
      efficacy with very acceptable toxicity in patients suffering from advanced-stage Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma. Bv was consolidatively evaluated after an auto-SCT. 329 patients, at high risk of&#xD;
      relapse after auto-SCT, received Bv (n=165) in a dose of 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks or a placebo&#xD;
      (n=164) for 16 cycles. The progression-free survival median (validated by a panel of&#xD;
      independent experts) was 42.9 months (95% CI 30,4-42 ; 9) for patients in the Bv group and&#xD;
      24.1 months (11.5 not reached) in the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our study is to reduce relapse rate by carrying out maintenance with Bv after&#xD;
      allografting hematopoietic stem cells in a population of patients suffering from Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma with high risk of relapse after auto-SCT. Fifty eight patients have been slated for&#xD;
      inclusion over a period of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, prospective, multicenter, phase II trial consisting of post allo-SCT&#xD;
      maintenance Bv for Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited over 24 months and be followed for 3 years after allo-SCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 58 patients will be included in the study. The duration of the treatment period is&#xD;
      approximately 10.7 months for 12 cycles of Bv.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study: end of study is defined by the last visit planned by the protocol of the last&#xD;
      patient in follow-up, which means 3 years after allo-SCT.&#xD;
