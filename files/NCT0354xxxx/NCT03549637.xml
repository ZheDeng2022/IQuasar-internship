  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The links between low LDL-C levels and psychologic symptoms (psychotic disorders, mood&#xD;
      disorders, aggressivity, suicidal risk, etc.) and cognitive deficits (mainly executing&#xD;
      functioning) are debated. The PARTITION study aims at estimating the prevalence of&#xD;
      hypobetalipoproteinemia (HBL), defined as a LDL-C level ≤ 0,50 g/L, in a psychiatric&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some forms of hypobetalipoproteinemia (HBL) are associated with a longevity syndrome and&#xD;
      cardiovascular protection due to prolonged exposure to low levels of LDL-C. However, while&#xD;
      LDL-C reduction has been studied extensively for its beneficial effect on cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk, other studies have reported that low levels of LDL-C (either spontaneous or&#xD;
      artificially occurring with low-fat diets or lipid-lowering drugs) may be associated with&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms (psychotic or mood disorders, aggression, suicidal attempts, etc.) or&#xD;
      altered cognitive performance (particularly executive functioning). These studies have led to&#xD;
      contradictory results, and the possible link between low LDL-C levels and psychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms remains highly controversial so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PARTITION study aims at estimating the prevalence of hypobetalipoproteinemia (HBL),&#xD;
      defined as a LDL-C level ≤ 0,50 g/L, in a psychiatric population. Moreover, the study&#xD;
      includes the characterization of psychiatric disorders as well as psychological and personal&#xD;
      characteristics associated with HBL. The evolutionary profile of patients with and without&#xD;
      HBL will be studied. Genetic characteristics and biomarkers of HBL will also be studied.&#xD;

    <description>At inclusion: Patients will have A Lipid Panel Test, other biological analyzes and a clinical assessment. In case of a low LDL-C level (≤ 0, 50 g/L), genetic analyzes will be performed to screen for genetic forms of hypobetalipoproteinemia (HBL).&#xD;
At 2- 4 weeks: for patients with HBL (LDL-C ≤ 0,50 g/L with no secondary cause of LDL-C reduction), another Lipid Panel Test will be performed to confirm the maintenance of the low LDL-C level.&#xD;
At 6 months : Patients with a HBL will perform a full biological examination, and the LDL-C levels and genetic analyzes will be confirmed. A dietary survey will be performed, together with a psychiatric assessment. The same numbers of matched controls will performed a quick telephone interview to collect the psychiatric characteristics.</description>
