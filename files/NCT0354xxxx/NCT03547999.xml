  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center Phase II randomized study. We plan to enroll 78 patients with&#xD;
      biopsy-proven hepatic-limited metastatic colorectal cancer deemed resectable after&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary discussion. Eligible patients must have confirmed isolated liver&#xD;
      metastases by radiographic imaging of the investigators' choosing. Imaging must include the&#xD;
      chest, abdomen, and pelvis regardless of imaging modality chosen. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      to either the control arm or the experimental arm. The control arm will receive mFOLFOX6&#xD;
      every 2 weeks for 4 cycles concurrently with Nivolumab. The experimental arm will first be&#xD;
      treated with 2 vaccinations of MVA-BN-CV301 given two weeks apart (Days -28, -14)&#xD;
      concurrently with Nivolumab followed by 4 vaccinations of FPV-CV301 given two weeks apart&#xD;
      concurrently with mFOLFOX6 and Nivolumab, which will again be administered every 2 weeks for&#xD;
      4 cycles (FPV-CV301, mFOLFOX6 and Nivolumab) After Cycle 4, patients will be re-evaluated for&#xD;
      surgical resection by re-staging CT chest, abdomen and pelvis (C/A/P). Patients still&#xD;
      considered resectable will undergo surgical resection with the goal of complete resection.&#xD;
      Patients who cannot be completely resected will continue to be followed on study, and an&#xD;
      additional appropriate candidate will be randomized to the corresponding arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect peripheral blood and tumor tissue at the time of surgical resection, if&#xD;
      applicable, or by re-biopsy if resection is not possible. Post-operative therapy will begin&#xD;
      when patients are deemed ready by their surgical oncologist team. Patients in the control arm&#xD;
      will then undergo another 8 cycles of mFOLFOX6 with Nivolumab administered concurrently.&#xD;
      Nivolumab will then be administered every four weeks. The experimental arm will receive the&#xD;
      same post-operative regimen but including FPV-CV301 boosters given concurrently with mFOLFOX6&#xD;
      and Nivolumab. FPV-CV301 will then be administered every 12 weeks, and Nivolumab every 4&#xD;
      weeks. We will collect peripheral blood for evaluation of correlates upon the completion of&#xD;
      therapy. The vaccination approach of initial immunization during the neoadjuvant period&#xD;
      followed by FPV-CV301 boosters for two years postoperatively was chosen to optimize the&#xD;
      induction of a long-lasting tumor-specific host response. Neoadjuvant vaccination will also&#xD;
      allow for analysis of the tumor microenvironment in resection specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-therapy patients will be under surveillance per NCCN guidelines with repeat CEA every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years followed by every 6 months for 3 years, repeat CT of the C/A/P every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years followed by every 6 months for up to 5 years, and colonoscopy at one year&#xD;
      with repetition based on findings at the time of the procedure.&#xD;
