  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to evaluate pain and muscle strength in the upper extremities after&#xD;
      treatment with cervical transforaminal injection of glucocorticoid vs. transforaminal&#xD;
      injection of local anesthetic injection in patients with cervical radiculopathy. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesizes that there are correlations between radiculopathy and muscle&#xD;
      weakness.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previously published studies have not shown a difference in outcome between cervical&#xD;
      transforaminal injections with cortisone or local anesthetic in a short term, 6-week,&#xD;
      follow-up after using a series of three injections of cervical transforaminal glucocorticoid&#xD;
      vs. local anesthetic. No study available thus far has evaluated and compared the long-term&#xD;
      effect of these two treatments (glucocorticoid vs. local anesthetics). The investigators aim&#xD;
      is to verify if there are responders and non-responders to this type of steroid injections.&#xD;
      100 patients with MRI-verified nerve root compression caused by spondylosis or disc&#xD;
      herniation and a history of radiculopathy with or without neck pain and muscle weakness will&#xD;
      be included. The participants will be included if they showed at least 50% pain reduction in&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS) within 30 min of a diagnostic nerve root block with local&#xD;
      anesthetic only. The participants will be blinded and randomized to each treatment group.&#xD;
      Pain, muscle weakness, disability and quality of life will be evaluated. Follow-up will be&#xD;
      made at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Neck disability index</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neck disability index (NDI), is a patient self-reported questionnaire which contains 10 items including pain, personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concertation, work, driving, sleeping and recreation. The patient scores each section from 0 to 5. Zero indicates 'no pain' and five indicates 'worst imaginable pain'. The highest possible score of the test is 50 which means complete absence from activity.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>An questionnaire that measures and value changes in health-related quality of life. The 3-level version of EuroQol five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D-L3) evaluates mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems (1), some problems (2), and extreme problems (3). The stated value from each dimension converts to a single summary index from 0-1. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'.</description>

    <description>The Odum´s criteria is a patient self-reported evaluation in outcome after degenerative cervical disc surgery. A four graded scale from Excellent (No complaints referable to cervical disc disease; able to continue daily occupation without impairment) to Poor (No improvement, or worse compared with the condition before the operation).</description>

    <measure>The European Myelopathy Score (EMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The European Myelopathy Score (EMS) measures the severity of cervical myelopathy. The questionnaire has five sections divided into different functional criteria, which do not need a baseline or prior examination. Section A evaluates gait and has five levels from &quot;not walking, need wheelchair&quot; to &quot;good gait, climb stairs&quot;. Section B evaluates hand function (four levels,) Section C evaluates proprioception and coordination (three levels), Section D evaluates bladder and bowel function (3 levels) and finally Section E evaluates sensory function (3 levels). The maximum sum score for a normal subject is 18 points.</description>
