      -The limited treatment varieties of decompensated cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus (HCV)&#xD;
      remain a challenge. In patients with reduced hepatic reserve, DAAs may be associated with&#xD;
      complications as worsening decompensation. The impact of DAAs therapy on mortality in&#xD;
      decompensated cirrhosis was not investigated.&#xD;

      An observational case-control study which was conducted from June 2015 till the first of&#xD;
      January 2018 in the Hepatology clinic - Zagazig University hospital-Egypt which is a tertiary&#xD;
      referral center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out of 422 patients presented with decompensated cirrhosis due to HCV, 342 patients were&#xD;
      excluded due to Hepatocellular carcinoma (n=61), cirrhotic cardiomyopathy (n=21), renal&#xD;
      impairment (n=34), ischemic heart disease (n=37), active gastrointestinal bleeding (n=42),&#xD;
      avoided treatment with DAAs and preferred conservative therapy (n=147); finally 80 patients&#xD;
      with decompensated cirrhosis who were willing to be treated and showed frequent hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy (HE) or difficult to treat ascites were selected to receive DAAs and included&#xD;
      if they had chronic HCV proved by the positivity of HCV RNA and elevated transaminases. Their&#xD;
      CTP score was &gt;9, MELD score was &lt;29 Patients were excluded if they had compensated cirrhosis&#xD;
      or HCV without cirrhosis; exposure to previous antiviral therapy; hepatocellular carcinoma;&#xD;
      other causes of liver diseases or mixed causes as excessive alcohol consumption, autoimmune&#xD;
      liver disease; previous liver transplantation; patients with risk factors of myocardial&#xD;
      dysfunction as abnormal T wave in electrocardiogram, ejection fraction (EF) less than 50%,&#xD;
      left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group included 80 patients; they sought medical care at the Hepatology outpatient&#xD;
      clinic-Zagazig University hospital. They had decompensated liver disease and preferred to be&#xD;
      managed conservatively; they desired to avoid treatment by DAAs by themselves (n=43) or by&#xD;
      their relatives (n=37) as they were concerned about the potential risk of liver cancer after&#xD;
      direct antiviral agents. They were age, sex, CTP and MELD scores matched with the same&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria and had been chosen from the patients who refused the&#xD;
      treatment with DAAs (n=147) after their consent to participate in the study, while the&#xD;
      remaining patients refused to be enrolled (n=67).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-Baseline laboratory investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigations preliminary to antiviral therapy as liver function tests, Prothrombin&#xD;
           time, Prothrombin concentration (%), kidney function tests, complete Blood Count,&#xD;
           fasting blood sugar, HBA1c if diabetes was present and serum AFP. For each patient, CTP&#xD;
           and MELD scores were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative assessment of HCV load in the serum by real-time Quantitative PCR (COBAS&#xD;
           Ampliprep/Taqman HCV monitor version 2.0, with a detection limit of 15 IU/ml; Roche&#xD;
           Diagnostic Systems, just before the study in both groups and after the first month, at&#xD;
           the end of treatment and 3 months post-treatment to detect SVR 12th in DAAs treated&#xD;
           group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genotyping for HCV using INNO-LiPA II, based on genotype-specific oligonucleotides from&#xD;
           the 5' UTR that are immobilized on a nitrocellulose strip. The probe reactivity patterns&#xD;
           were interpreted according to the manufacturer instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C- Abdominal Ultrasonography (USG) The patients were evaluated for criteria of decompensated&#xD;
      cirrhosis including shrunken cirrhotic liver and ascites, patients with HCC were excluded.&#xD;
      Criteria of portal hypertension as portal vein diameter &gt; 13mm or cavernous transformation,&#xD;
      splenic bipolar diameter &gt;13 cm, splenic vein diameter &gt;8 mm or the presence of splenic&#xD;
      collaterals. After treatment termination; USG was done every 6 months for a period of 20&#xD;
      months for early detection of HCC or worsening of hepatic decompensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D- Treatment exposure and outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medications The study patients will be given Sofosbuvir 400mg, ribavirin 400mg, and&#xD;
           daclatasvir 60 mg for 3 months and will be evaluated for the development of sustained&#xD;
           virological response (SVR), the occurrence of complications after DAAs and the effects&#xD;
           of SVR on the frequency of hepatic encephalopathy, improvement in ascites control or&#xD;
           difficult to treat ascites defined as ascites that rapidly recurs after paracentesis or&#xD;
           cannot be completely mobilized despite maximal medications (sodium restriction of less&#xD;
           than 2 g/day with maximal dose of furosemide (160 mg) or spironolactone (400 mg) or&#xD;
           inability to reach maximum diuretic dose due to emergence of side effects, and after&#xD;
           confirming compliance with sodium restrictions if the 24-hour urine sodium level is &lt;78&#xD;
           mEq, also the impact of therapy on Survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the patients will have regular biweekly visits in the first 6 months then every 2&#xD;
           months for 20 months. Every visit a full history taking, laboratory evaluation which&#xD;
           included complete blood count (CBC), serum creatinine, total and direct bilirubin, serum&#xD;
           albumin, serum transaminases, coagulation profile and AFP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who did not complete the follow-up will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
