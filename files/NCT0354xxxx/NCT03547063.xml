      The aim of this study is to gain insight into brain structure and the neural networks that&#xD;
      control taste and eating behaviour in patients with severe obesity undergoing a primary&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or a lifestyle intervention for weight loss compared with normal&#xD;
      weight individuals, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&#xD;

      This is an observational study aiming to gain insight into brain structure and the neural&#xD;
      networks that control taste and eating behaviour in patients with severe obesity undergoing a&#xD;
      primary sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or a lifestyle intervention for weight loss compared with&#xD;
      normal weight individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Drops of liquid&#xD;
      foods and a control solution will be delivered to the participants' mouth during fMRI&#xD;
      scanning. Body weight, gut hormones from serial blood samples, appetite scores and taste will&#xD;
      be assessed at each study visit.&#xD;
