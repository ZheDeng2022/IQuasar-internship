    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody&#xD;
      response against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W following a 3-dose series of MenACYW&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine compared to a 3-dose series of a licensed meningococcal vaccine when each&#xD;
      vaccine is given concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines (10-valent pneumococcal&#xD;
      vaccine and diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and Haemophilus&#xD;
      influenzae type b [DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine]) to infants and toddlers 6 weeks to 18 months&#xD;
      old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody response against meningococcal&#xD;
           serogroups A, C, Y, and W following the administration of 2 doses in infancy of MenACYW&#xD;
           conjugate vaccine compared to 2 doses of a licensed meningococcal vaccine when each&#xD;
           vaccine is given concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines (10-valent pneumococcal&#xD;
           vaccine and DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine) to infants and toddlers 6 weeks to 18 months old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the antibody responses against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W when&#xD;
           MenACYW conjugate vaccine is administered in a 3-dose series concomitantly with the&#xD;
           routine pediatric vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the antibody responses against the antigens of the routine pediatric&#xD;
           vaccines administered in a 3-dose series concomitantly with MenACYW conjugate vaccine or&#xD;
           a licensed meningococcal vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and a licensed meningococcal&#xD;
           vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy infants and toddlers will receive MenACYW conjugate vaccine or a licensed&#xD;
      meningococcal vaccine, and routine pediatric vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be assessed for immunogenicity before and after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed throughout the study period, and includes solicited injection site&#xD;
      and systemic reactions as well as unsolicited adverse events after each vaccine injection,&#xD;
      and serious adverse events occurring throughout the study.&#xD;
