      Multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled, partially blinded trial comparing the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation versus placebo both delivered by rectal&#xD;
      enema in subjects 18 years of age or older with recurrent Clostridium difficile Associated&#xD;
      Disease (CDAD). 162 male or female subjects will be enrolled in the study. Enrolled subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized at each site to receive either FMT by enema or placebo by enema in a 2:1&#xD;
      ratio. Study duration is 3 years, subject participation duration is approximately 1 year. The&#xD;
      primary study objectives are: 1) to evaluate the safety of FMT(s) delivered by enema vs.&#xD;
      placebo delivered by enema and 2) to determine efficacy of FMT delivered by enema vs. placebo&#xD;
      delivered by enema.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled, partially blinded trial comparing the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation versus placebo both delivered by&#xD;
      rectal enema in subjects 18 years of age or older with recurrent Clostridium difficile&#xD;
      Associated Disease (CDAD). 162 (108 in the FMT group, 54 in the placebo group) male or female&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects must have had treatment for most recent CDAD&#xD;
      with at least 10 days of either metronidazole po/IV (500 mg tid), oral vancomycin (at least&#xD;
      125 mg qid), or oral fidaxomicin (200 mg bid) and have no diarrheal symptoms (&lt;3 unformed&#xD;
      stools per 24 hour period) off antibiotics during the washout period. Enrolled subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized at each site to receive either FMT by enema or placebo by enema in a 2:1 ratio.&#xD;
      The study is described as partially blinded because by design subjects are to be blinded only&#xD;
      to a certain point. Subjects will be followed for clinical response (efficacy) and safety.&#xD;
      The study duration is 3 years, subject participation duration is approximately 1 year. The&#xD;
      primary study objectives are: 1) to evaluate the safety of FMT(s) delivered by enema vs.&#xD;
      placebo delivered by enema and 2) to determine efficacy of FMT delivered by enema vs. placebo&#xD;
      delivered by enema. Secondary objectives: 1) to evaluate the sustained clinical response rate&#xD;
      of FMTs delivered by enema vs. placebo delivered by enema, 2) to evaluate the rate of&#xD;
      recurrent CDAD, and 3) to evaluate the time to recurrent CDAD.&#xD;
