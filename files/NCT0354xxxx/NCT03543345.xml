      Proximal RCA occlusions were very often found among men with fatal pre-hospital MI; whereas&#xD;
      left-sided coronary occlusions were significantly more frequent in hospital-admitted&#xD;
      survivors of MI. Left-sided coronary occlusions may be associated with a more favorable&#xD;
      pre-hospital phase of acute MI compared to proximal RCA occlusions. Proximal RCA occlusion&#xD;
      increases the risk of arrhythmia and shock leading to increase the mortality. Sinus&#xD;
      bradycardia and cardiogenic shock accounts for the majorities of the mortalities of RCA&#xD;
      occlusion&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Myocardial infarction is a common presentation of coronary artery disease. The World Health&#xD;
      Organization estimated in 2004, that 12.2% of worldwide deaths were from ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease; with it being the leading cause of death in high- or middle-income countries and&#xD;
      second only to lower respiratory infections in lower-income countries. Worldwide, more than 3&#xD;
      million people have STEMIs and 4 million have NSTEMIs a year . STEMIs occur about twice as&#xD;
      often in men as women .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial infarction means that the tissue ischemia caused tissue death, as a result of&#xD;
      diminished blood supply to a part of the heart muscles. The blood supply of the heart is&#xD;
      coronary arteries (right and left). Proximal RCA occlusions were very often found among men&#xD;
      with fatal pre-hospital MI; whereas left-sided coronary occlusions were significantly more&#xD;
      frequent in hospital-admitted survivors of MI. Left-sided coronary occlusions may be&#xD;
      associated with a more favorable pre-hospital phase of acute MI compared to proximal RCA&#xD;
      occlusions .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The right coronary artery (RCA) supplies the right ventricle, 25% to 35% of the left&#xD;
      ventricle and SA node in 60% of people. Proximal RCA occlusion increases the risk of&#xD;
      arrhythmia and shock leading to increase the mortality. Sinus bradycardia and cardiogenic&#xD;
      shock accounts for the majorities of the mortalities of RCA occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sinus bradycardia is more frequent when the infarct-related artery is the RCA than other&#xD;
      arteries involvement. Proximal occlusions of the RCA presented sinus bradycardia more than&#xD;
      medial and distal occlusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality of cardiogenic shock due to right ventricular infarction (55%) was comparable to&#xD;
      that due to left ventricular infarction (59%) in spite of patients being younger and a&#xD;
      greater incidence of single vessel disease. The worse prognosis in patients with RV&#xD;
      myocardial involvement may be related to the increased risk of life-threatening ventricular&#xD;
      arrhythmias in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately one half of patients who present with signs and symptoms of acute inferior&#xD;
      myocardial infarction have proximal occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery (RCA) and&#xD;
      also show ECG signs of RV wall ischemia or infarction. Occlusion sufficiently proximal to&#xD;
      cause RV free wall injury also frequently compromises the blood supply to the sinoatrial&#xD;
      node, atrium and atrioventricular (AV) node, producing such effects as sinus bradycardia,&#xD;
      atrial infarction, atrial fibrillation and AV block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transthoracic echocardiography is the most common method to assess the function of the&#xD;
      right ventricular function as it non-invasive, inexpensive and available in most of the&#xD;
      hospitals. The presence of RV dysfunction on early echocardiography is an important predictor&#xD;
      of an adverse prognosis, both short-and long-term, in STEMI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Tissue Doppler Imaging method depicts myocardial motion (measured as tissue velocity) at&#xD;
      specific locations in the heart. Tissue velocity indicates the rate at which a particular&#xD;
      point in the myocardium moves toward or away from the transducer. Integration of velocity&#xD;
      over time yields displacement or the absolute distance moved by that point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of right ventricular function by echocardiography is challenging and often ignored&#xD;
      in clinical practice. Tricuspid annular velocity correlates with right ventricular ejection&#xD;
      fraction . Tricuspid annular excursion (tricuspid displacement) predicted 2-year survival in&#xD;
      patients with pulmonary hypertension . Isovolumic acceleration, derived from tissue velocity,&#xD;
      is a load-independent measure of contractility and correlates with right ventricular&#xD;
      end-systolic elastance. This correlation is less pronounced in clinical studies . More recent&#xD;
      experimental data suggest a weak relationship between isovolumic acceleration and regional&#xD;
      contractility. Systolic velocity and strain best correlated with invasively determined right&#xD;
      ventricular stroke volume and dynamically tracked changes in right ventricular function&#xD;
      during vasodilator infusion. Strain rates and strain quantitate regional right ventricular&#xD;
      systolic function in various pathologies&#xD;
