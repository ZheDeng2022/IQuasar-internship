      In the literature, the relationship between fibromyalgia and disease activity has been&#xD;
      assessed in a few studies without discrimination between women and men.In this study, it was&#xD;
      aimed to evaluate the relationship between fibromyalgia and disease activity in women with&#xD;
      Behçet's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are only a few studies in the literature evaluating the association of fibromyalgia&#xD;
      with disease activity and clinical findings in Behçet's disease. In the literature, the&#xD;
      relationship between fibromyalgia and disease activity has been assessed without&#xD;
      discrimination between women and men. Behçet's disease is more active in men and fibromyalgia&#xD;
      is more frequent in women. Evaluating the relationship between fibromyalgia and disease&#xD;
      activity in Behçet's disease without gender discrimination may not be objective.There is not&#xD;
      any study in literature evaluating relationship between fibromyalgia and disease activity in&#xD;
      women with Behçet's disease.In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the relationship between&#xD;
      fibromyalgia and disease activity in women with Behçet's disease.&#xD;

    <measure>Fibromyalgia 2013 criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fibromyalgia 2013 criteria were derived from the 10-item symptom score from the Symptom Impact Questionnaire (SIQR) symptoms and the 28-area pain location inventory (PLI). If the patients PLI score is above 17 (range 0-28) and an SIQR symptom score is above 21 (range 0-50), the participant will be diagnosed with fibromyalgia</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behcet's disease current activity form</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Twelve items on the Behcet's disease current activity form, a potential unidimensional scale, will be used for the analysis as well as the two questions which assess disease activity from the patient's and clinician's perspective. These items are: a Likert scale, represented by 'smiley' faces ranging from very bad to very good, to indicate how the patient or the clinician felt the disease had been over the past 4 weeks, and the presence or absence (over the last 4 weeks prior to the clinic visit) of arthralgia, arthritis, diarrhoea, erythema nodosum, eye inflammation, genital ulcers, headaches, mouth ulcers, nausea/vomiting, new central nervous system involvement, new major vessel inflammation, and pustules.</description>
