  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections continue to be a major public health problem worldwide.&#xD;
      More than 400 million people worldwide are currently infected with hepatitis B virus.&#xD;
      Approximately 20% of HBV patients will develop chronic hepatitis, and are at significant risk&#xD;
      of developing cirrhosis or liver hepatocarcinoma. HBV is the prototype of hepadnaviridae, a&#xD;
      family of small enveloped hepatotropic DNA viruses that can infect the liver of human.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, researches on antiviral treatment of chronic hepatitis B has made remarkable&#xD;
      progress, interferon and nucleoside analogues which are the synthetic reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      inhibitors can attenuate liver inflammation and fibrosis. However, HBsAg and HBeAg&#xD;
      seroconversion ratio is merely 7% and 21%, respectively. To completely clear HBsAg is very&#xD;
      difficult, the main reason is that HBV cccDNA (a covalently closed circular form of the viral&#xD;
      genome through DNA repair of the relaxed circular replicative HBV DNA inside the nuclei of&#xD;
      hepatocytes in the HBV life cycle), the template for viral and pregenomic messenger RNA&#xD;
      cannot be eliminated, lead to the continuous replication of the virus. Apart from that, none&#xD;
      of these therapies are completely safe and effective. Although direct antiviral therapy could&#xD;
      efficiently control chronic active hepatitis B, drug resistance or renal toxicity could&#xD;
      develop progressively several months after the initiation of therapy. It is thus still&#xD;
      urgently required to identify effective anti-HBV agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pegylated IFN-α (pegIFN-α) is effective in achieving sustained virologic response, defined as&#xD;
      HBeAg seroconversion and/or hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels below 20,000 copies/mL at 6&#xD;
      months after completion of the therapy, in only 30% of hepatitis e antigen (HBeAg)-positive&#xD;
      and 40% of HBeAg-negative cases. However, the pegIFN-α therapy does promote HBsAg clearance&#xD;
      or seroconversion in a small, but significant fraction of treated patients. Hence, we should&#xD;
      develop feasible antiviral therapeutics target cccDNA in liver cells to cure chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resveratrol, a grape polyphenol, is representative of a group of diet-derived putative cancer&#xD;
      chemopreventive agents encompassing, among others, curcumin, tea polyphenols and apigenin,&#xD;
      which have attracted a lot of interest in the cancer chemoprevention community. It has shown&#xD;
      considerable promise as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of liver ailments. Recent study&#xD;
      found that SITR1 activators can inhibit cccDNA, and resceratrol is a member of SIRT1&#xD;
      activator family. Apart from that, several studies have highlighted the hepatoprotective&#xD;
      properties of resveratrol. Resveratrol has been shown to prevent hepatic damage because of&#xD;
      free radicals and inflammatory cytokines, induce antioxidant enzymes and elevate glutathione&#xD;
      content. Resveratrol has also been shown to modulate varied signal transduction pathways&#xD;
      implicated in liver diseases. For instance, resveratrol can inhibit Th17 proliferation and&#xD;
      function, and many researches found that increasing Th17 in patients with hepatitis B.&#xD;
      Importantly, in vitro, we found that resveratrol can significantly reduce both HBsAg and&#xD;
      HBeAg in a dose-depend manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, increasing studies focus on natural materials in the application of the treatment,&#xD;
      and there are many health care products used resveratrol as main ingredient. Report on trial&#xD;
      of resveratrol in healthy volunteers after daily doses of up to 5g per day administered for&#xD;
      29 days suggests that it is safe, as borne out by the lack of serious adverse reactions&#xD;
      detected by clinical, biochemical or hematological analyses during the study and study&#xD;
      follow-up. Besides, in our country, the traditional Chinese medicine also used giant knotweed&#xD;
      (main ingredients is resveratrol) to treat viral hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, We aim to use entecavir combined with other drug such as resveratrol and&#xD;
      peg-interferon to treat patients with hepatitis B, which may provide a novel therapy target&#xD;
      hepatitis B.&#xD;
