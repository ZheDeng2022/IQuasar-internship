  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, prospective, open-label, single-arm, first-in-man clinical&#xD;
      investigation. The patients enrolled in this clinical trial will undergo elective surgery for&#xD;
      pelvic fusion. Following harvesting of autologous bone graft form the iliac crest, the donor&#xD;
      site will be reconstructed with a new scaffold known as GreenBone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GreenBone is a ceramic reabsorbable scaffold which is obtained by the transformation of wood.&#xD;
      It has a very similar structure to bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety of using the GreenBone in humans and also to&#xD;
      evaluate its capacity to promote new bone formation at the donor site.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone defects can result from high-energy traumatic events, bone resection due to different&#xD;
      pathologies such as tumors or infection, or from the treatment of complex non-unions, all&#xD;
      very challenging conditions in orthopaedic practice. Defects of pelvic iliac crest most&#xD;
      frequently result from harvesting of iliac bone graft for bone grafting and fusion procedures&#xD;
      and can be associated with significant morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current reconstruction options of the bone defects usually imply the use of bone grafts&#xD;
      and/or biocompatible materials, to create a scaffold that bridges the defect, favouring the&#xD;
      migration of cells from the neighbouring tissues to fill the gap. Autografts and allografts&#xD;
      are the most commonly used bone grafts currently used for large bone defects. However, the&#xD;
      use of both types of grafts has significant disadvantages. For iliac crest reconstruction in&#xD;
      particular, different types of synthetic materials and xenografts have been used. However, at&#xD;
      the moment, there is not any ideal bone substitute with the necessary osteoinductive,&#xD;
      osteoconductive and mechanical properties. GreenBone is a synthetic, acellular, reabsorbable,&#xD;
      new generation bone graft, being suitable for surgical reconstruction of bone defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When autologous bone graft is needed for the treatment of non-unions or bone defects, it is&#xD;
      harvested from the pelvic iliac crest in the form of either tricortical graft material or&#xD;
      cancellous bone. Harvested tricortical graft blocks are used to facilitate fusion of joints&#xD;
      (i.e. pubis symphysis, sacroiliac joint), to structurally support metaphyseal areas of&#xD;
      articular impaction injuries (i.e. tibial plateau) and to fill in metaphyseal bone voids. The&#xD;
      GreenBone device, with its inherent physical and biomimetic properties, possesses similar&#xD;
      structural properties to bone, and thus, it can be considered the ideal bone graft.&#xD;
      Reconstruction of the donor site restores the pelvic anatomy and minimises the risk of&#xD;
      chronic pain, haematoma formation and herniation of the abdominal contents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of the use of GreenBone in patients&#xD;
      undergoing iliac crest reconstruction to restore bone defects. In particular, this study will&#xD;
      evaluate the progression of bone healing and regeneration of the donor site throughout a&#xD;
      6-month observation period, it will evaluate the postoperative pain related to iliac crest&#xD;
      graft harvesting, and it will evaluate the health related quality of life of patients at 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient who will be enrolled in the study will receive exactly the same operation that they&#xD;
      would receive normally for pelvic fusion with the only difference that instead of having&#xD;
      xenograft (bone obtained from cows) applied to the donor site (the site in your pelvis from&#xD;
      where the surgeon will harvest the bone graft), you will receive the GreenBone material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery patients will be followed-up for 6 months. At each follow-up visit, the&#xD;
      safety of the use of the GreenBone implant will be assessed and patients will complete a&#xD;
      pain-scale and quality of life questionnaires. Moreover, incorporation of the Bone graft into&#xD;
      the iliac crest will be assessed radiologically.&#xD;
