      -  Type of Study: A randomized double-blind controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Setting: IVF unit in Maternity Hospital of Ain Shams University.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Population: A total of 88 women with endometriosis will be enrolled in the study&#xD;
           divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group A (N=44): women will receive intrauterine infusion of G-CSF on the day of&#xD;
                ovum-pick up during IVF cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group B (N=44): women will receive placebo intrauterine infusion of saline on the&#xD;
                day of ovum-pick up during IVF cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allocation and Concealment: Eighty eight envelopes will be numbered serially and in each&#xD;
           envelope the corresponding letter which denotes the allocated group will be put&#xD;
           according to randomization table. When the first patient arrives, the first envelope&#xD;
           will be opened and the patient will be allocated according to the letter inside&#xD;

             -  Sample Size: 88 patients, 44 in group A (the cases) and 44 in group B (the&#xD;
                controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sample Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The required sample size was calculated using the G*Power Software (Universitӓt Düsseldorf,&#xD;
      Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the clinical pregnancy rate. Currently, there is no adequate&#xD;
      information regarding the effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy rate in patients with endometriosis undergoing in-vitro fertilization; therefore,&#xD;
      the present exploratory study would target an effect size that could be clinically relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, it is estimated that the inclusion of 44 patients in each of the 2 study groups (total,&#xD;
      88 patients) would achieve a power of 80% (type II error, 0.2) to detect a statistically&#xD;
      significant difference between the 2 groups as regards the clinical pregnancy rate for a&#xD;
      medium effect size corresponding to a w coefficient of 0.3 using a two-sided chi-squared test&#xD;
      with 1 degree of freedom and the targeted test confidence set at a level of 95% (type I&#xD;
      error. 0.05). The effect size (w) is calculated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      w = , where is the chi-squared statistic and N is the total sample size (Chow et al., 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The targeted effect size of w = 0.3 has been selected as it could be regarded as a clinically&#xD;
      relevant difference to seek in this exploratory study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethical Considerations: A written informed consent will be obtained from all&#xD;
           participants prior to screening and enrollment. Participants will participate&#xD;
           voluntarily in the research and their confidentiality will be respected. Benefits from&#xD;
           participation in the research will be explained to all participants. Participation in&#xD;
           the research will cause no harm to participants after approval of research ethical&#xD;
           committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be subjected to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Detailed medical history including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Menstrual history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Past and obstetric history&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Physical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After history taking and fulfillment of both inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical&#xD;
      examination will be done including: general abdominal and pelvic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Laboratory investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine investigations including: fasting and postprandial blood sugar and complete blood&#xD;
      count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) Induction of ovulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On day 3 of spontaneous cycles, all patients will have basal hormonal profile (FSH, LH,&#xD;
           E2, TSH and prolactin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transvaginal (TV) ultrasound (U/S) on day 3 of non-stimulated cycles will be done by&#xD;
           transvaginal probe of 5-9 MHZ. Any patient found to have uterine abnormalities will be&#xD;
           excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ovarian hyper stimulation protocol will be held according to a long GnRH agonist&#xD;
           protocol starting from midluteal phase by daily subcutaneous injection of triptoreline&#xD;
           acetate (Decapeptyl 0.05 mg, Ferring Pharmaceutical, Kid, Germany). Then on day 3 of&#xD;
           next cycle ovarian hyper stimulation will be started by daily injection of HMG (Menogon&#xD;
           75 lU/amp &quot;Ferring Pharmceutical, Kid, Germany &quot;or Merional 75 IU/amp&quot; IBSA,&#xD;
           Switzerland&quot;). The starting dose of gonadotropines will be prescribed according to the&#xD;
           age and body weight of the subjects, then the dose will be adjusted according to the&#xD;
           ovarian response that will be assessed by transvaginal folliculometry which will be done&#xD;
           on cycle day six.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  According to the ovarian response, every other day TV U/S will be performed and at the&#xD;
           moment when the leading follicle reaches 16mm, daily TV U/S will be performed till the&#xD;
           largest follicle reach a diameter of &gt;18mm. The maximum duration of HMG will not be&#xD;
           allowed to exceed day 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HCG (Choriomon 10,000 lU/amp. &quot;IBSA, Switzerland&quot;) will be administered for triggering&#xD;
           ovulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E) Sonography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transvaginal sonography will be performed in the day of HCG administration to measure&#xD;
      endometrial thickness and pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endometrium pattern will be classified as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proliferative when echogenicity is hypo echoic in relation to the myometrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peri-ovulatory when it is trilaminar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secretory when it is hyperechoic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F) Ovum pick up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  36 hours after HCG injection, the transducer will be connected to the ultrasound system.&#xD;
           The direction of the guide beam will be checked. The puncturing needle will be connected&#xD;
           to an aspiration apparatus attached by a fixation ring to the front and rear ends of the&#xD;
           vaginal transducer, thereby defining the direction of puncture corresponding to the&#xD;
           guide beam on the ultrasound image.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The aspiration will be checked using test tubes. The uterus, both ovaries and iliac&#xD;
           vessels will be identified by the visualization in both planes. The distance between the&#xD;
           upper pole of the vagina and the ovary will be closely evaluated (care will be taken to&#xD;
           avoid intestinal or vascular interposition).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depth localization of the closest accessible follicle (distance from the upper vaginal&#xD;
           pole to the center of the follicle) will be done. Needle will be pushed forcefully to&#xD;
           the center of the follicle (Aspiration pressure 90-100mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      G) IVF- ICSI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Intracytoplasmic sperm injection will be performed on metaphase II oocytes using the direct&#xD;
      penetration technique, fertilization results will be assessed 16 to 19 hours after ICSI.&#xD;
      Fertilization will be considered normal by the presence of two pronuclei. Oocyte degeneration&#xD;
      will be identified by collapse of cytoplasmic contents and separation from the zona. Failed&#xD;
      fertilization will be defined by the absence of the pronuclei.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H) Embryo transfer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Embryo transfer will be done on day 5 using cook catheter under ultrasound guide at a&#xD;
           distance about 1-1.5 cm from the fundus by the same gynecologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of embryos transferred 2-3 embryos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) Finally:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serum βhCG will be performed 12 days after embryo transfer and repeated after 48h. followed&#xD;
      by US 6 weeks after embryo transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Interventions: In G-CSF group at the day of oocyte retrieval, after oocytes&#xD;
           collection, 30 mU (300 mcg/0.5 ml) of G-CSF (NeupogenTM, Filgastrim, Amgen Inc.,&#xD;
           Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) was administered by slow transcervical intrauterine infusion&#xD;
           with IUI catheter (AINSEGREY, RIMOS, Italy). In controls, normal saline was used for&#xD;
           intrauterine infusion instead of G-CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical Analysis: Data will be analyzed using IBM© SPSS© Statistics version 22 (IBM©&#xD;
           Corp., Armonk, NY). Normally distributed numerical data will be presented as mean and&#xD;
           SD, and skewed data as median and interquartile range. Qualitative data will be number&#xD;
           and percentage. Comparison of normally distributed numerical data will be done using the&#xD;
           unpaired t test. Skewed data will be compared using the Mann-whitney test. Categorical&#xD;
           data will be compared using the Pearson chi-squared test or fisher's exact test, if&#xD;
           appropriate. A two-sided p-value ˂0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
