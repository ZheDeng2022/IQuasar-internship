    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic anovulation presenting to the IVF clinic for subfertility treatment are&#xD;
      at increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma.They are often subjected to&#xD;
      endometrial biopsy to rule out any underlying changes such as endometrial hyperplasia or&#xD;
      carcinoma before commencing any further treatment. Literature shows that these group of&#xD;
      patients have higher possibility of having underlying uterine abnormality (uterine polyp,&#xD;
      fibroid, septum, or adhesion) and if we perform only endometrial biopsy, these structural&#xD;
      abnormalities will remain undetected. And presence of uterine abnormalities lead to&#xD;
      difficulty in implantation, which eventually leads to lower success rate of infertility&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WE propose that performing simultaneous office hysteroscopy followed by endometrial biopsy in&#xD;
      such patients will lead to higher detection of uterine structural abnormalities and obtaining&#xD;
      endometrial tissue to rule out hyperplasia or carcinoma. The concern for clinicians at times&#xD;
      is that performing both the procedures together will lead to higher pain perception during&#xD;
      the procedure. But with the introduction of flexible hysteroscope which has a diameter of 3.5&#xD;
      mm we hypothesize that the pain of performing office hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy and&#xD;
      performing endometrial biopsy alone will be equivalent. Meanwhile, hysteroscopy will lead&#xD;
      lead to detection of underlying uterine pathology and help us in taking directed biopsies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with subfertility due to hormonal disorders are at increased risk of endometrial&#xD;
      cancer and hyperplasia . Such conditions are associated with chronic anovulation, obesity&#xD;
      and/or hyperinsulinemia. Presumably, the mechanism relates to constant, unrelenting estrogen&#xD;
      stimulation of the endometrium, predisposing to abnormal patterns of growth. Hence, patients&#xD;
      with long standing anovulation presenting for infertility evaluation, are often subjected to&#xD;
      endometrial biopsy to rule out any underlying hyperplasia or malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most obvious and common condition associated with&#xD;
      chronic anovulation. It is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and&#xD;
      polycystic ovarian morphologic features. Based on National Institutes of Health (i.e.&#xD;
      hyperandrogenism plus ovulatory dysfunction), &quot;classic&quot; polycystic ovary syndrome affects 10%&#xD;
      of women of reproductive age but the prevalence may be twice under the broader Rotterdam&#xD;
      criteria . Women with PCOS are at increased risk of infertility, endometrial hyperplasia and&#xD;
      cancer. The risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with PCOS is reported to be 2.7 times&#xD;
      higher than someone without this syndrome. Other uncommon conditions associated with chronic&#xD;
      anovulation are Cushing's syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia secondary to 21&#xD;
      hydroxylase deficiency, thyroid or liver disorder leading to decreased clearance of estrogen&#xD;
      from the body. Similarly, obese postmenopausal women are also at increased risk for&#xD;
      developing endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these patients, elevated plasma levels of androgen precursors increase estrogen level&#xD;
      through aromatization of androgens in adipose tissue. In addition, it has been seen that non&#xD;
      cycling patients with grossly increased endometrial thickness (greater than 12 mm) are also&#xD;
      at high risk of endometrial hyperplasia. So these are the indications, which warrants&#xD;
      patients to undergo endometrial biopsy. Literature shows that the prevalence of minor&#xD;
      intrauterine abnormalities identified at hysteroscopy in cases with a normal transvaginal&#xD;
      sonography (TVS) can be as high as 20-40%. Similarly, the prevalence of unsuspected uterine&#xD;
      cavity abnormalities, diagnosed in an unselected group of patients undergoing IVF can be 11%.&#xD;
      In this study, they identified endometrial polyps in 6% women, submucous myomas in 1%,&#xD;
      intrauterine adhesions (2%), and septa (2%) . Another study also reports 16% intracavitary&#xD;
      lesion in patients with infertility. It has been seen that in an IVF population, obesity (BMI&#xD;
      &gt;30) is also an independent risk factor for developing endometrial polyps. The prevalence of&#xD;
      polyps in patients with BMI &gt; 30 is 52% as compared to 15% among patients with BMI &lt;30.&#xD;
      Similarly, PCOS patients also show a higher incidence of endometrial polyp (29%) diagnosed by&#xD;
      hysteroscopy as compared to the nonPCOS population and the presence of 2 or more such polyps&#xD;
      is associated with significant premalignant or malignant condition. So, missing the diagnosis&#xD;
      of polyps in PCOS patients renders them to higher risk of developing malignancy in future.&#xD;
      With this background, an important clinical question is if it is clinically justified to&#xD;
      combine office hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy as part of the comprehensive evaluation of&#xD;
      these patients? It is possible that prompt diagnosis and treatment of these unsuspected&#xD;
      uterine abnormalities could optimize the condition of the uterine environment and thereby the&#xD;
      outcome of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of all the advantages office hysteroscopy offers, one of the reasons for avoiding&#xD;
      office hysteroscopy has been the apprehension that adding office hysteroscopy will lead to&#xD;
      higher pain score. But based on our literature review we propose that adding flexible office&#xD;
      hysteroscopy to endometrial biopsy will not lead to any increase in pain score. In routine&#xD;
      practice, endometrial biopsy is usually performed with &quot;Pipelle&quot; and is a simple office&#xD;
      procedure. It is an excellent tool for evaluating the histopathology of the endometrium. The&#xD;
      mean pain score during endometrial biopsy is 3 in a VAS scale of 1-10 with only 6.7% patients&#xD;
      reporting severe pain . In a more recent study, the pain score during endometrial biopsy has&#xD;
      been reported to be 6.2, which is higher than the previous reports. Similarly, office&#xD;
      hysteroscopy is also a simple procedure with high patient acceptability and safety. The pain&#xD;
      score reported during office hysteroscopy using flexible scope range from 2.3 -3. During&#xD;
      traditional hysteroscopy where speculum and tenaculum is used, the pain score has been&#xD;
      reported to be as high as 5.3. In fact, a comparative study of endometrial biopsy and office&#xD;
      hysteroscopy showed that the pain score is higher during endometrial biopsy (5.1) as compared&#xD;
      to diagnostic hysteroscopy (2.7). Hence, it seems very reasonable to add office hysteroscopy&#xD;
      to endometrial biopsy for patients undergoing endometrial evaluation. This combined approach&#xD;
      will have better diagnostic yield without increasing the pain perception.&#xD;
