  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumours continually shed DNA into the circulation, where it can be accessed. This circulating&#xD;
      tumour DNA (ctDNA) directly reflects tumour burden and has great potential to be a sensitive&#xD;
      biomarker for treatment recurrence. These &quot;liquid biopsies&quot; could give a more real-time&#xD;
      picture of the genomic status and evolution of a tumour and can be easily assessed for&#xD;
      measurement of different biomarkers. However, in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      (HNSCC) patients treated with primary curative radiotherapy, data regarding ctDNA kinetics&#xD;
      and its correlation with outcome are scarce. A new or additional tool for response evaluation&#xD;
      next to or instead of conventional imaging after treatment would be beneficial to detect&#xD;
      recurrences in an earlier stage, thereby increasing the chances of success of salvage&#xD;
      therapy. More importantly, an early response parameter during treatment could help to&#xD;
      identify patients that have a good treatment response and might benefit from treatment&#xD;
      adaptation. With this study, we aim to reveal ctDNA as an effective tool for future dose&#xD;
      (de)-escalation trials in HNSCC.&#xD;
