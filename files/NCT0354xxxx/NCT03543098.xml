      The purpose of this study is to investigate effects of timing of surgery (early vs. delayed)&#xD;
      and timing of post-operative rehabilitation (early vs. delayed) for the treatment of military&#xD;
      personnel and civilians that sustain a multiple ligament knee injury. To achieve this overall&#xD;
      objective of this project, we will conduct two parallel randomized clinical trials. For the&#xD;
      first study we will randomize individuals to timing of surgery and timing of post-operative&#xD;
      rehabilitation. We hypothesize that early surgery, early rehabilitation and the combination&#xD;
      of early surgery with early rehabilitation will lead to an earlier and more complete return&#xD;
      to pre-injury military duty, work and sports and better patient-reported physical function.&#xD;
      In the second study, those whose timing of surgery can not be randomized, will be only&#xD;
      randomized to early or delayed rehabilitation. For this study, we hypothesize that early&#xD;
      rehabilitation will lead to an earlier and more complete return to pre-injury military duty,&#xD;
      work and sports activity and better patient-reported physical function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple ligament knee injuries (MLKIs) represent a spectrum of injury ranging from&#xD;
      disruption of two ligaments to all four major ligaments of the knee. Concomitant injuries may&#xD;
      include fractures and injuries to vessels, nerves, tendons, menisci and/or articular&#xD;
      cartilage. As such, the treatment of MLKIs creates multiple complex problems fraught with&#xD;
      complications such as poor wound healing, arthrofibrosis, neurovascular injuries, persistent&#xD;
      pain and instability, and post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Following MLKI, individuals are&#xD;
      frequently limited with higher demand activities such as in military training, physical labor&#xD;
      and sports. Return to duty after combat-related MLKIs has been reported to be as low as 41%&#xD;
      and substantially lower than return to work reported for civilians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is controversy related to the optimal timing of surgery and post-operative&#xD;
      rehabilitation for the treatment of MLKIs. Early surgical intervention for MLKIs has been&#xD;
      advocated, however this may be associated with an increased risk for arthrofibrosis.&#xD;
      Conversely, delayed surgery may be associated with persistent instability. The best evidence&#xD;
      for timing of rehabilitation is based on evidence following ACL reconstruction, where early&#xD;
      post-operative rehabilitation is the current standard of care. However, because of the&#xD;
      frequency of soft tissue repair procedures, post-operative rehabilitation after surgery for a&#xD;
      MLKI typically involves a period of non-WB and delayed ROM exercises. Due to the lack of&#xD;
      evidence for the timing of surgery and post-operative rehabilitation, a large scale trial is&#xD;
      needed to optimize the outcomes for these potentially devastating injuries. Therefore, this&#xD;
      multicenter clinical trial will investigate the effects of timing of surgery and post-op&#xD;
      rehabilitation to optimize return to military duty, work and sports for military personnel&#xD;
      and civilians with a MLKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives, Aims and Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this project is to investigate the effects of timing of surgery&#xD;
      (early vs. delayed) and timing of post-op rehabilitation (early vs. delayed) for treatment of&#xD;
      MLKIs. To achieve this objective, we will conduct two parallel randomized clinical trials.&#xD;
      The related aims and hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 and Hypothesis: Determine the effects of timing of surgery and post-op&#xD;
      rehabilitation on time to return to pre-injury level of military duty, work and sports and&#xD;
      patient-reported physical function. We hypothesize that early surgery, early rehabilitation&#xD;
      and the combination of early surgery with early rehabilitation will lead to an earlier and&#xD;
      more complete return to pre-injury military duty, work and sports and better patient-reported&#xD;
      physical function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 and Hypothesis: For those individuals whose timing of surgery can not be&#xD;
      randomized, determine the effects of timing of rehabilitation on time to return pre-injury&#xD;
      level of military duty, work and sports and patient-reported physical function. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that early rehabilitation will lead to an earlier and more complete return to&#xD;
      pre-injury military duty, work and sports activity and better patient-reported physical&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Research Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female military personnel and civilians between the ages of 16 and 55 with a MLKI&#xD;
      without a history of prior knee ligament reconstruction that do not have a vascular injury,&#xD;
      poly-trauma or a traumatic brain injury will be eligible to participate. After obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent, subjects will undergo a preoperative evaluation, including collection of&#xD;
      baseline demographics, activity level, and a physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address Aim 1, 392 individuals with a MLKI that present within 6 weeks of injury will be&#xD;
      randomized to early (within 6 weeks of injury) or delayed (12 to 16 weeks after injury)&#xD;
      surgery and early (WB and unrestricted ROM exercises starting first week after surgery) vs.&#xD;
      delayed (knee brace locked in extension, no range of motion exercises and non-weightbearing&#xD;
      gait for the first 4 weeks after surgery). To address Aim 2, 298 individuals with a MLKI that&#xD;
      present greater than 6 weeks after injury, have an injury that precludes randomization to&#xD;
      early or delayed surgery as well as those that refuse surgical randomization will be eligible&#xD;
      to participate in the trial that compares only early vs. delayed rehabilitation.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by study site and knee ligament injury pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Baseline Demographics and Activity Level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent and screening, baseline demographic and pre-injury level of military duty,&#xD;
      work and sports participation will be recorded. The demographic information to be recorded&#xD;
      includes age, sex, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), marital status, education level,&#xD;
      pre-injury military duty, work and sports, smoking history and insurance status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Military Duty - For military personnel, to measure military duty prior to injury we will&#xD;
      record the Military Occupational Specialty Physical Demand Classification and will ask three&#xD;
      questions from the Injury Surveillance Survey (ability to perform Annual Physical Fitness&#xD;
      Test; Deployability and Specific MOS Duties).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Activity - To measure work activity prior to injury, we will use the Cincinnati&#xD;
      Occupational Rating Scale. Additionally, we will record the individual's pre-injury&#xD;
      employment status (work regular duty full time, work regular duty part-time etc.) and&#xD;
      occupation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sports Activity and Participation - We will use the Marx Activity Rating Scale to measure the&#xD;
      subject's level of sports activity in the year prior to injury. To assess sports&#xD;
      participation, we will also record the type (very strenuous, strenuous etc.) and frequency&#xD;
      (4-7 times per week, 1-3 times per week etc.) of sports participation as well as the specific&#xD;
      sport(s) the individual participated in prior to injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Clinical Examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard of care baseline clinical examination will be performed by the individual's&#xD;
      attending orthopaedic surgery. The examination will include assessment of pain, range of&#xD;
      motion (ROM), ligament laxity, sensory and neurovascular status (pulses, sensory &amp; motor&#xD;
      nerve function). Additionally, standard of care radiographs and MRI will be reviewed to&#xD;
      identify fractures and document the ligament injury. The information from the baseline&#xD;
      clinical examination will be used to confirm final eligibility in the surgical and&#xD;
      post-operative rehabilitation trial or the post-operative rehabilitation only trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 - Randomization to Early vs. Delayed Surgery and Post-Operative Rehabilitation -&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in the clinical trial for Aim 1 will be randomized to one of four groups:&#xD;
      early surgery/early rehabilitation, early surgery/delayed rehabilitation, delayed&#xD;
      surgery/early rehabilitation or delayed surgery/delayed rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those randomized to early surgery will undergo surgery within six weeks of injury and those&#xD;
      that are randomized to delayed surgery will undergo surgery 12 to 16 weeks after injury. In&#xD;
      all cases, surgery will be in accordance with the principles of anatomic&#xD;
      repair/reconstruction of injured structures in a manner that will allow for early range of&#xD;
      motion. Surgical reconstruction with allograft or autograft will be performed for&#xD;
      mid-substance tears of the ACL and/or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). Repair or&#xD;
      reconstruction will be performed for injury to the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and the&#xD;
      posterolateral corner (PLC) structures (fibular collateral ligament, popliteus tendon, and&#xD;
      popliteofibular ligament). Injuries to the biceps femoris tendon or iliotibial band will be&#xD;
      addressed as necessary. Medial and lateral meniscus tears will be repaired or debrided at the&#xD;
      time of surgery. Neuropraxic nerve injuries will not necessitate early intervention; however,&#xD;
      if a neurotmesis injury is discovered on MRI, then early intervention for primary repair,&#xD;
      grafting or benign neglect may be warranted. All surgical findings and procedures will be&#xD;
      documented on electronic surgical case report forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two post-operative rehabilitation protocols have been created, differing only in the time to&#xD;
      begin weightbearing (WB) and ROM exercises. After surgery, all individuals will be placed in&#xD;
      a hinged brace that is locked in extension. Individuals randomized to early rehabilitation&#xD;
      will begin WB as tolerated (WBAT) with the brace locked in full extension and unrestricted&#xD;
      ROM approximately 1 week after surgery at the time of the first post-operative visit.&#xD;
      Individuals in this group will unlock the brace for ROM exercises, but will keep the brace&#xD;
      locked at all other times until the criteria to unlock the brace are met. Weightbearing will&#xD;
      be gradually progressed to full WB no earlier than 3 weeks after surgery pending achievement&#xD;
      of the criteria for doing so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those allocated to delayed rehabilitation will be placed in a knee brace locked in extension,&#xD;
      with no range of motion exercise and will utilize a non-weightbearing gait for the first 4&#xD;
      weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after surgery both groups will begin isometric quadriceps exercises with the knee&#xD;
      in full extension (quad sets, straight leg raises) and high intensity neuromuscular&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (NMES) for the quadriceps will be utilized. Use of the post-op brace&#xD;
      will be discontinued no earlier than 6 weeks after surgery pending achievement of the&#xD;
      criteria to do so. In the Motor Control and Functional Optimization phases of rehabilitation,&#xD;
      progression to increasingly demanding activities will be time- and criterion-based to ensure&#xD;
      that the individual is advanced safely to reduce the risk of further injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 - Randomization to only Early vs. Delayed Rehabilitation - Subjects enrolled in the&#xD;
      trial for Aim 2 will undergo anatomic surgical repair/reconstruction of the injured&#xD;
      structures as described above, however the timing of surgery will be determined by the&#xD;
      surgeon and patient after consideration of the individual's specific circumstances related to&#xD;
      the nature and extent of the MLKI, associated injuries and timing of presentation. Following&#xD;
      surgery, individuals will be randomized to undergo either early or delayed rehabilitation as&#xD;
      described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information gathered during standard of care clinical follow-up visits will be prospectively&#xD;
      collected at 1 week and 1, 3, 6 and 9 to 12 months after the date of surgery. This&#xD;
      information will be documented and will serve to provide additional outcomes related to&#xD;
      post-operative recovery. The information will include pain, pain medication usage, joint&#xD;
      effusion, wound and neurovascular status, ROM, WB status, use of a post-op rehabilitation&#xD;
      brace, imaging and/or laboratory tests ordered and completed, complications and adverse&#xD;
      events, additional surgical procedures and military duty, work and sports status. Knee laxity&#xD;
      will also be assessed 3, 6 and 9 to 12 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in all studies will be followed for 24 months. The primary outcome will be time to&#xD;
      return to pre-injury military duty, work and sports. To precisely determine the time to&#xD;
      return to military duty, work and sports, we will administer a brief Return to Activity&#xD;
      Monitoring Survey on a monthly basis starting 6 months after randomization and continuing&#xD;
      through the 24-month follow-up. Patient-reported physical function as measured with the&#xD;
      Activity Limitation Scale of the Multiple Ligament Quality of Life (MLQoL) Questionnaire will&#xD;
      serve as a co-primary outcome and will be assessed 6, 12 and 24 months after randomization.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will include additional knee-specific and general patient-reported&#xD;
      measures of physical function and health-related quality of life. We will also collect&#xD;
      measures of kinesiophobia, resiliency and functional comorbidities because these constructs&#xD;
      may affect return to military duty, work and sports.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        For the clinical trials for both aims, male and female military personnel and civilians&#xD;
        between the ages of 16 and 55 with a MLKI (defined as a complete grade III injury of two or&#xD;
        more ligaments) will be eligible to participate. Individuals with a nerve injury or biceps&#xD;
        or popliteus tendon rupture or avulsion will not be excluded from participation in either&#xD;
        trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals will be excluded from both trials if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior knee ligament surgery of the involved knee;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Torn or avulsed patellar or quadriceps tendon;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Periarticular or long bone fracture that is anticipated to preclude weight-bearing&#xD;
             after surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Require use of an external fixator for greater than 10 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Planned staged surgical treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Unable to weight bear on the contralateral uninjured leg;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) that limits their ability to participate in their&#xD;
             post-operative care;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Surgical procedures that precludes early weight-bearing or range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any condition that would preclude the ability to comply with post-operative&#xD;
             guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Eligibility Criteria for Participation in Aim 1 - Randomization to Both Timing&#xD;
        of Surgery and Post-Operative Rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible to participate in the study for Aim 1 individuals with a MLKI must present&#xD;
        to orthopaedic surgery in time to undergo definitive surgery within 6 weeks of injury if&#xD;
        randomized to the early surgery group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals will also be ineligible to participate in the study for Aim 1 if they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Vascular injury that dictates timing of surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Poly trauma that precludes surgery within 6 weeks of injury;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Skin or soft tissue injury that precludes early surgery and rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Eligibility Criteria for Participation in Aim 2 - Randomization to Only timing&#xD;
        of Post-operative Rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with a MLKI that present to orthopaedic surgery at a time that precludes&#xD;
        randomization to early surgery or have an injury that precludes randomizing the timing of&#xD;
        surgery (such as a vascular injury) as well as those that refuse randomization to the&#xD;
        timing of surgery will be eligible to participate in the study for Aim 2 which randomizes&#xD;
        subjects to only early vs. delayed rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals will also be excluded from the trial that randomizes only the timing&#xD;
        post-operative rehabilitation if they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Vascular surgery that precludes early rehabilitation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Polytrauma that limits ability to participate in post-operative care;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Skin or soft tissue injury that precludes early rehabilitation&#xD;
