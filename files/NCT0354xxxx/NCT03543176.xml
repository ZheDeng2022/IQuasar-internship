  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to assess the burden of illness for, COPD using both&#xD;
      patient-reported symptom burden and claims-based economic burden, among the subjects treated&#xD;
      with single-inhaler dual therapy treatments, Fluticasone/Salmeterol FLUT/SAL; Advair) or&#xD;
      Umeclidinium/Vilanterol (UMEC/VI; Anoro) to support Global Initiative for Chronic Lung&#xD;
      Disease (GOLD) category B recommendations. The study will use a health plan recruitment&#xD;
      strategy and subject's will be recruited using Optum's health plan recruitment strategy to&#xD;
      collect information relating to the subject's condition history, current treatment, smoking&#xD;
      history, symptoms and symptom severity (Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale&#xD;
      [mMRC] and COPD Assessment Test [CAT]), and demographic and sociodemographic characteristics.&#xD;
      A total of 2700 subject's, are planned to be enrolled in the study to reach the target&#xD;
      evaluable sample size, n=770 subjects. Following completion of data collection, results of&#xD;
      the survey, will be merged with claims data, covering the 12-month Baseline period for&#xD;
      analysis. Pharmacy and medical claims data, will be used to calculate all-cause and&#xD;
      COPD-related health care utilization and costs, treatment patterns, and Baseline clinical&#xD;
      characteristics. The study duration is estimated to be of 12-months.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants That Reported COPD Symptom Burden- Measured Using COPD Assessment Test (CAT) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The CAT questionnaire is an 8-item questionnaire on a 0-5 point scale with higher values indicating greater impact of COPD. The item response values of CAT are summed to produce a single score that ranges from 0-9 (low impact), 10-20 (medium impact), 21-30 (high impact) and 31-40 (very high impact). Respondents were allowed to have up to two missing CAT items. If one or two items were missing, the total score was set to the average of the non-missing item scores. Percentage of participants reporting low, medium, high and very high impact COPD symptom burden on CAT scale has been presented. All enrolled Population comprises of all participants with claims &gt;= 1.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants That Reported COPD Symptom Burden- Measured Using Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Breathlessness was assessed using the mMRC, a single item (0-4) scale assessing current level of dyspnea. The mMRC comprised of five statements that describe almost the entire range of respiratory disability from none (Grade 0) to almost complete incapacity (Grade 4). The score (Grade) was the number that best fit the participant's level of activity. The mMRC categorized participants into low dyspnea (Grades 0-1) and high dyspnea (Grades 2-4).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants That Reported COPD Symptom Burden- Measured Using COPD Assessment Test (CAT) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The CAT questionnaire is an 8-item questionnaire on a 0-5 point scale with higher values indicating greater impact of COPD. The item response values of CAT are summed to produce a single score that ranges from 0-9 (low impact), 10-20 (medium impact), 21-30 (high impact) and 31-40 (very high impact). Respondents were allowed to have up to two missing CAT items. If one or two items were missing, the total score was set to the average of the non-missing item scores. Percentage of participants reporting low, medium, high and very high impact COPD symptom burden on CAT scale has been presented. All enrolled Population comprises of all participants with claims &gt;= 1.</description>

        <description>Breathlessness was assessed using the mMRC, a single item (0-4) scale assessing current level of dyspnea. The mMRC comprised of five statements that describe almost the entire range of respiratory disability from none (Grade 0) to almost complete incapacity (Grade 4). The score (Grade) was the number that best fit the participant's level of activity. The mMRC categorized participants into low dyspnea (Grades 0-1) and high dyspnea (Grades 2-4).</description>
