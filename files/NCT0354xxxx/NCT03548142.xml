      Palliative and hospice care in advanced dementia: experiences of care givers and benefit of a&#xD;
      brochure serving as a decision-making aid&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Designing a brochure serving as an information tool and decision-making aid used to&#xD;
           answer questions concerning palliative and hospice care for care-givers of persons with&#xD;
           advanced dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The brochure shall demonstrate the possibilities and offerings of palliative and hospice&#xD;
           care and shall serve to inform about the advanced stages of dementia, the legal basic&#xD;
           principles in decision making and ethical problems, treatment options and (palliative)&#xD;
           treatment goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Survey of the palliative, palliative medical and hospice care of persons with advanced&#xD;
           dementia in ambulatory settings, as well as in residential geriatric care and the&#xD;
           experiences of the care-givers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           By examining persons with dementia and inspecting the care documents and where&#xD;
           applicable the medical files it is to be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  which procedures of palliative and hospice care are practically implemented in&#xD;
                ambulatory care and in residential geriatric care,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  which symptoms the persons with dementia suffer from and how those symptoms are (or&#xD;
                are not) treated,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  to what extend caregivers are informed about relevant aspects&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  how caregivers assess care and which problems, needs and requests exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Piloting phase for the brochure. To test the comprehensibility and the acceptance of the&#xD;
           brochure a study is planned. The caregivers are asked for their opinion whether the&#xD;
           brochure is helpful. It is recorded if the reading of the brochure gets the caregivers&#xD;
           to engage actively in the participative decision making process.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two visits at home or in the residential geriatric care at intervals of eight to twelve weeks&#xD;
      are scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data is collected at enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent of the caregiver and of the patient or rather the caregiver with powers&#xD;
           of attorney&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sociodemographic data (caregiver and person with dementia), e.g. age, sex, education,&#xD;
           degree of relationship&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interview of the caregiver using standardized&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination of the person with dementia, recording of the treatment and the care&#xD;
           situation, cognitive status: Mini-Mental-Status-Test, severity of dementia: Clinical&#xD;
           Dementia Rating Scale, performance in basic activities of daily living:&#xD;
           Barthel-Index,communication competence, diagnosis, (palliative) medical and hospice care&#xD;
           (including specialists in palliative care, specialists in hospice care, general&#xD;
           practioners, domiciliary care services, Allgemeine Ambulante Palliativversorgung [AAPV],&#xD;
           Spezielle Ambulante Palliativversorgung [SAPV], AAPV and SAPV both being a specific&#xD;
           ambulatory palliative care of the statutory health insurance system in Germany,&#xD;
           cognitive/neurological/physical symptoms, symptom Management including pharmacological&#xD;
           and non-pharmacological treatment, interventions, existence and phrasing of advanced&#xD;
           directives and durable power of attorney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment the brochure is handed and explained to the caregivers and they are&#xD;
      encouraged to read it. It is pointed out that they are contacted after two to three months to&#xD;
      answer questions concerning comprehensibility, acceptance, practical consequences and to give&#xD;
      a personnel review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study end after two to three months standardized interviews are conducted to gather&#xD;
      information about comprehensibility and acceptance of the brochure, how it is reviewed by the&#xD;
      caregivers and if the reading had direct consequences with regard to knowledge of the&#xD;
      caregiver, communicating with nursing staff/physicians, decision making and implementing&#xD;
      those decisions.&#xD;
