  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PET (positron emission tomography) scans combined with a radioactive tracer will be used to&#xD;
      identify and analyze tumors. Currently, the most common tracer used to analyze neuroblastoma&#xD;
      tumors is called 123I-mIBG. However, the picture it provides is not always clear enough to&#xD;
      see the very small areas of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-DA (18F-fluorodopamine) has been shown to be safe and more effective than 123I-mIBG in&#xD;
      analyzing the tumor pheochromocytoma, which is closely related to neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this research study, the investigators plan to meet the following goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate to see if 18F-DA is safe to administer to pediatric patients with known or&#xD;
           suspected neuroblastoma or pheochromocytoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine where in the body 18F-DA goes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain information comparing 18F-DA to 123I-mIBG to see if 18F-DA could replace&#xD;
           123I-mIBG in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 20 people, with known or suspected neuroblastoma or pheochromocytoma, will take part in&#xD;
      this Pilot study at St. Jude.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial malignant tumor of childhood. Nuclear imaging&#xD;
      with 123I-mIBG is the standard test to follow and manage these patients. Because of the&#xD;
      inherent imaging characteristics of I-123, there is suboptimal resolution within the images,&#xD;
      causing them to appear somewhat blurry, which reduces our ability to find small areas of&#xD;
      disease. A chemical that uses positron emission tomography should allow much better&#xD;
      resolution of the images, which could improve patient care by allowing us to find small areas&#xD;
      of disease that, if untreated, could result in tumor relapse. We have developed&#xD;
      18F-fluorodopamine (18F-DA) for PET imaging in our patients with neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to explore the safety of 18F-DA in patients with known or suspected&#xD;
      neuroblastoma or pheochromocytoma. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the&#xD;
      biodistribution of 18F-DA in patients with neuroblastoma and compare the biodistribution of&#xD;
      18F-DA with the biodistribution of 123I-mIBG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive an intravenous injection of a small (tracer) dose of 18F-DA. Approximately 1&#xD;
      hour later, patients undergo PET scanning of the entire body to evaluate the localization of&#xD;
      the tracer.&#xD;

    <description>The adverse events will be recorded and monitored up to two days after the injection of radiotracer 18F-DA. The 95% CI for the adverse event rate will be calculated and reported. If one adverse event grade 2 or above, attributable to study drug, the study will be stopped until completion of IRB review and a decision about whether the study should be modified or closed.</description>

    <description>The localization of 18F-DA throughout the whole body will be described descriptively in different organs such as salivary glands, heart, liver, kidneys, bladder, and bowel. The frequency of the localization of 18F-DA in those regions will be listed. Unexpected sites of uptake, such as bone or focally within soft tissue, are not normal and will be considered abnormal and documented descriptively as well.</description>

    <description>Standardized uptake values of soft tissue and tumor (SUV) will be generated by drawing regions of interest on the images scaled to SUV. Descriptive statistics of SUV values, such as max SUV, from 18F-DA and 123I-mIBG PET will be provided.</description>

    <description>The Curie scoring of 18F-DA and 123I-mIBG imaging will be scored for each participant. The difference of the Curie scoring between the two imaging will be calculated for each patient. Summary statistics of the difference such as mean and standard deviation would be calculated. One sample t test or signed rank test may be used to test whether the difference is equal to 0 depending on whether the distribution of the difference is normal or not.</description>
