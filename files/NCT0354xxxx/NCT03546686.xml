      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of pre-operative cryoablation,&#xD;
      ipilimumab and nivolumab on 3-year Event Free Survival (EFS), in women with triple negative&#xD;
      breast cancer after taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our strategy combines two&#xD;
      interventions: induced activation and maturation of dendritic cells and tumor-specific T&#xD;
      cells by cross-presentation of tumor antigens via local destruction of tumor tissue by&#xD;
      cryoablation. Second, we administer ipilimumab, a CTLA4 blocking antibody that enhances the&#xD;
      magnitude and potency of the tumor specific T cell response, with nivolumab, a PD-1 blocking&#xD;
      antibody that interferes with PD-1 mediated T-cell regulatory signaling. Women with residual&#xD;
      triple negative resectable breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be treated with&#xD;
      tumor cryoablation and pre-operative nivolumab and ipilimumab followed post-operative&#xD;
      nivolumab. Women undergoing either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery are eligible.&#xD;

                  immunosuppressive drugs). Note: Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or&#xD;
                  physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary&#xD;
                  insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the&#xD;
                  investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Chronic use of immunosuppressants and/or systemic corticosteroids (used in the&#xD;
                  management of cancer or non-cancer-related illnesses). Brief periods of steroid&#xD;
                  use, for example for the management of chemotherapy-associated toxicities, are&#xD;
                  allowed. The use of corticosteroids on study is allowed for the treatment of&#xD;
                  immune related adverse events (irAEs) and other medical conditions including&#xD;
                  adrenal insufficiency.&#xD;

               -  Any non-oncology live vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases&#xD;
