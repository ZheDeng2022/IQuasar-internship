      Phase I / II randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of melatonin administration combined with ocrelizumab in patients with&#xD;
      Progressive Multiple Primary Sclerosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system&#xD;
      in young adults, has a huge social and health interest, especially the primary progressive&#xD;
      (PP-) course, in which the disability is very fast accumulated and currently there are no&#xD;
      available treatments in Spain. PP-MS is characterized by neuro-inflammation and, especially,&#xD;
      by neurodegeneration, with brain atrophy as key feature. It has been proposed that PP-MS&#xD;
      therapies should combine anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities. The investigators&#xD;
      have shown that melatonin, an immunomodulatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective compound,&#xD;
      ameliorates the disease and modulates the pathogenic/protective immune responses in a MS&#xD;
      animal model. Moreover, melatonin caused a long-term improvement of disability on a PP-MS&#xD;
      patient. Thus, melatonin could be of interest in the therapy of PP-MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, ocrelizumab, recently authorized by the European Medicines Agency and incorporated&#xD;
      into the portfolio of the Spanish National Health System in December 2018, is the only&#xD;
      therapy that has shown some therapeutic efficacy on the decrease in long-term disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of using melatonin combined with&#xD;
      ocrelizumab to treat PP-MS. Thus, the investigators propose a randomized, single-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study on the safety and efficacy of melatonin combined with ocrelizumab on&#xD;
      PP-MS patients. The investigators will assess the daily administration to patients treated&#xD;
      with ocrelizumab for at least 9 months of one oral dose of melatonin containing 300mg during&#xD;
      24 months on patients safety and its effects over brain atrophy progression, Expanded&#xD;
      Disability Status Scale scores, quality of life, MS symptoms, circadian impairment and levels&#xD;
      of markers of central nervous system inflammation, axonal damage, Blood-brain barrier&#xD;
      disruption and oxidative stress.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rates of neurological impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Individualized rates of disease progression will be quantified using the rates of neurological impairment (Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale). The scale provides a total score on a scale that ranges from 0 to 10. The first levels 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with a high degree of ambulatory ability and the subsequent levels 5.0 to 9.5 refer to the loss of ambulatory ability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rates of disability</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Individualized rates of disease progression will be also quantified using the rates of disability (Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite - MSFC scale).The MSFC measures are administered in person by a trained examiner. The MSFC can produce scores for each of the three individual measures (measure leg function/ambulation, arm/hand function, and cognitive function) as well as a composite score. Total administration time for all three measures should be approximately 20-30 minutes. Scores on component measures are converted to standard scores (z-scores), which are averaged to form a single MSFC score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>In every study visit, assessed up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale scale (MFIS), a modified form of the Fatigue Impact Scale (Fisk et al, 1994b) based on items derived from interviews with multiple sclerosis patients concerning how fatigue impacts their lives. The total score for the MFIS is the sum of the scores for the 21 items. Items on the MFIS can be aggregated into three subscales (physical, cognitive, and psychosocial), as well as into a total MFIS score. All items are scaled so that higher scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue on a person's activities.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life using the Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life scale</measure>
    <time_frame>In every study visit, assessed up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life (MusiQoL) scale, a self-administered and multidimensional questionnaire designed to reflect the point of view held by patients with MS on how the disease affects their daily life. Questionnaire comprises 31 items describing nine dimensions: Activities of Daily Living, Psychological Well-Being, Symptoms, Relationships with Friends-Family-Healthcare System, Sentimental and Sexual Life, Coping and Rejection. Each item was scored on a six-point Likert scale: score of 1 (never ⁄not at all), 2 (rarely ⁄a little), 3 (sometimes ⁄somewhat), 4 (often ⁄ a lot), 5 (always ⁄ very much) and 6 (not applicable).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spasticity</measure>
    <time_frame>In every study visit, assessed up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Spasticity will be analyzed using the Ashworth scale that tests resistance to passive movement about a joint with varying degrees of velocity.&#xD;
Scores range from 0-4, with 5 choices. A score of 1 indicates no resistance, and 5 indicates rigidity.&#xD;
0 (0) - No increase in tone&#xD;
(1) - Slight increase in tone giving a catch when the limb was moved in flexion or extension&#xD;
(2) - More marked increase in tone but limb easily flexed&#xD;
(3) - Considerable increase in tone - passive movement difficult&#xD;
(4) - Limb rigid in flexion or extension.</description>
