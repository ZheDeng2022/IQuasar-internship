  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure causes a large patient and financial burden on the health care system. Pocket&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging devices are utilized to improve time to correct diagnosis. Telemedicine is&#xD;
      used in a variety of medical professions today. A combination of focused handheld ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging performed by general practitioners and dedicated nurses in a heart failure&#xD;
      population, utilizing telemedicine for support, has not yet been studied. The aim of the&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the feasibility, reliability and clinical influence of implementing&#xD;
      handheld focused cardiac ultrasound by general practitioners and nurses for diagnostics and&#xD;
      health-related expenditure in outpatients referred with suspected heart failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Handheld focused cardiac ultrasound in diagnosis of suspected heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic ultrasound is more frequently used by clinicians in different scenarios.&#xD;
      Echocardiography (cardiac ultrasound) is the most frequently method used when diagnosing&#xD;
      heart failure (HF), cardiomyopathies, valvular pathology and cardiac tamponade, as well as&#xD;
      other diseases affecting the heart, great vessels and pleural cavity. Ideally, the diagnostic&#xD;
      workflow should conclude with a correct diagnosis as soon as possible, as this is important&#xD;
      for preserving health and quality of life for the patients, as well as for total health care&#xD;
      expenditure and the diagnostic workflow logistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the last 6-7 years smaller and cheaper ultrasound scanners have become available. These&#xD;
      pocket-sized (or handheld) imaging devices (PSIDs) have allowed for more inexperienced users,&#xD;
      at locations outside the dedicated ultrasound laboratories, to perform ultrasound&#xD;
      diagnostics. PSIDs fits in the &quot;white coat&quot; pocket and may be brought to the patient, and&#xD;
      thus, allowing diagnostic imaging examinations to be performed at the patients'&#xD;
      point-of-care. PSIDs from different vendors are available on the market. Large efforts are&#xD;
      made in developing dedicated software helping the inexperienced users to maximize the&#xD;
      diagnostic gain of including PSIDs in the diagnostic workflow. Experts have launched the&#xD;
      PSIDs as the next generation stethoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cardiac research groups at Levanger Hospital and NTNU (Norway) have recently evaluated&#xD;
      the PSID Vscan® from GE Ultrasound in several studies where the PSID has been tested on&#xD;
      cardiac patients by different users. The PSID allow for improved diagnostics by both experts,&#xD;
      residents, general practitioners (GPs), as well as medical students and dedicated nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the inpatients setting the population is selected and the prevalence of disease is high.&#xD;
      Research has shown that by using the PSIDs the diagnosis was corrected in up to 1 of 5&#xD;
      medical inpatients. With less experienced users the diagnostic impact may be reduced. Studies&#xD;
      from outpatient hospital settings have shown that the PSIDs may allow for diagnostic gain&#xD;
      both in cardiac and non-cardiac care. Studies evaluating the influence of using PSIDs by GPs&#xD;
      or other health care personnel outside the hospitals are scarce. Thus, there is a need for&#xD;
      studies evaluating the use of PSIDs or other imaging modalities performed by the GPs in the&#xD;
      outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Education&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all inexperienced users, that are non-experts, dedicated training and education is&#xD;
      mandatory to optimize gain and minimize misdiagnosis and subsequent imaging procedures. The&#xD;
      gain of including PSIDs in the diagnostic workflow largely depends on the population&#xD;
      examined. In the latest recommendation from the European Association of Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Imaging (EACVI) no specific numbers are given for the training program, neither regarding&#xD;
      time nor number of examinations. However, it is stated that &quot;since the competency in FoCUS&#xD;
      (Focused Cardiac UltraSound) should be the minimal net result of the training process, the&#xD;
      number of required hours/studies might be adjusted for each trainee according to the results&#xD;
      of the competency evaluation incorporated into the ongoing training process&quot;. The training&#xD;
      program should aim to educate the user in the specific use of the PSIDs relevant for the&#xD;
      planned scenarios to &quot;ensure that the operators are aware of their own capacity and&#xD;
      limitations, given the specific equipment and different situations&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemedicine The health care system of today has implemented a variety of technical tools&#xD;
      that are based on advanced technological innovations. Such advances usually require highly&#xD;
      technical and medical skills of the users, for optimization of the use and outcome of the&#xD;
      advances. The advances in information technology, communication bandwidth capacities of both&#xD;
      wired and non-wired networks have made the basis for performing the diagnostics at one place&#xD;
      and interpret the diagnostic tests at another location. According to the World Health&#xD;
      Organization, telemedicine is defined as &quot;the delivery of health care services, where&#xD;
      distance is a critical factor, by all health care professionals using information and&#xD;
      communication technologies for the exchange of valid information for diagnosis, treatment and&#xD;
      prevention of disease and injuries, research and evaluation, and for the continuing education&#xD;
      of health care providers, all in the interests of advancing the health of individuals and&#xD;
      their communities&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemedicine has among others been implemented in radiology, where teleradiology is a common&#xD;
      and accepted form in the diagnostic process. The methodology was first implemented in&#xD;
      clinical scenarios where the need for a physical meeting between the patient and the&#xD;
      physician was lower than the need for the specific tests. Traditionally, ultrasound&#xD;
      examinations have been performed by highly specialized personnel and interpreted by the&#xD;
      specialist more or less real time and at the same location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      User support Technological advances with the invention of easy-to-use, cheap and attainable&#xD;
      ultrasound devices has allowed for a broader spectrum of users to implement ultrasound&#xD;
      diagnostics. From the health care providers' point of view, this may allow for moving&#xD;
      diagnostics to the patients' point-of-care, in contrast to moving the patients to the&#xD;
      diagnostic laboratories. To implement ultrasound diagnostics outside the dedicated&#xD;
      diagnostics laboratories, education and support of the users is mandatory. Even though&#xD;
      inexperienced users easily can be trained to perform ultrasound images with indices, the&#xD;
      interpretation of the images of anatomical structures and cardiac function indices requires&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The more inexperienced users can be supported in different ways. Beyond the obligatory&#xD;
      theoretical support by literature and possibility to discuss findings with experts, there is&#xD;
      need for qualitative feedback on the ultrasound recordings. Telemedicine may offer secure&#xD;
      transmission of the ultrasound recordings for interpretation by experts and allowing for&#xD;
      discussion as well. The outpatient ultrasound recordings may also be included in hospital&#xD;
      referrals. In addition, our research group has been involved in development of an algorithm&#xD;
      which can automatically interpret ultrasound recordings of the function of the left&#xD;
      ventricle. Such software can give quick feedback which may be helpful for training and&#xD;
      education of the user, as well its possibility to improve the diagnostic ability of the&#xD;
      ultrasound examination performed by the inexperienced user.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart failure Heart failure (HF) affects 15 million Europeans; incidence in Norway is 11.000&#xD;
      per year. The prevalence is increasing due to improvements in diagnostics and therapy, not to&#xD;
      mention the increased age of the population. Health care expenditure related to management of&#xD;
      heart failure is significant, both with respect to the financial costs and patient burden.&#xD;
      Thus, early and correct diagnosis is important to improve patient care and reduce the&#xD;
      financial burden on the health care system. Heart failure patients often have comorbidities,&#xD;
      and hospitalization is common if not optimally monitored and treated. Today approximately 50%&#xD;
      of heart failure patients are readmitted within 6 months after hospitalization for&#xD;
      decompensated heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyper- and hypovolemia can both lead to decompensated HF and secondary organ failure caused&#xD;
      by inadequate perfusion. However, pleural effusion is easy assessable by ultrasound and in a&#xD;
      recent study we found that pleural effusion was present in 42% of the patients.&#xD;
      Non-cardiologists may have a growing role in diagnostics and follow-up of outpatient HF&#xD;
      patients, and adding ultrasound diagnostics to the consultations may improve care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemedicine in follow-up of patients with chronic heart failure The most advanced way of&#xD;
      monitoring chronic HF patients by telemedicine is the use of implantable devices for&#xD;
      haemodynamic monitoring, where invasive pressures were automatically uploaded from implanted&#xD;
      devices through a patient home monitoring system and used to guide treatment. The Remote&#xD;
      monitoring has become appealing, and is a potentially cost-effective method of home&#xD;
      management and prevention of readmission.&#xD;
