  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fat is the most energy dense macronutrient and consuming fat has been positively correlated&#xD;
      to obesity. Individuals afflicted with obesity crave fat more frequently, have a higher&#xD;
      preference for fatty taste, and consume a higher quantity of fatty foods. People who have&#xD;
      undergone Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) or Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) weight-loss surgeries&#xD;
      dramatically decrease their fat preferences and consumption of fat, at least within the first&#xD;
      year after surgery. These surgeries are very effective in helping people lose weight over the&#xD;
      first couple of years; however, approximately 30% of those who undergo these surgeries start&#xD;
      regaining weight after the second year mark. Why some people are able to keep the weight off&#xD;
      long-term but others are unable to is unclear. In addition, it is well-known that fat can&#xD;
      modify the flavor of foods and flavor plays a critical role in consumption, as well as in&#xD;
      responses that gear up the body to consume the food. These are known as cephalic phase&#xD;
      responses and include neural, physiological, and hormonal aspects. The main goals of the&#xD;
      study are twofold: 1) To test the immediate effects of RYGB surgery, SG surgery, and&#xD;
      laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB) surgery (a weight loss control group) on fat preferences&#xD;
      and sensory perception, and 2) to compare fat preferences and sensory perception between&#xD;
      those who are able to achieve sustained weight loss 2-5 years after RYGB or SG surgery and&#xD;
      those who either regained weight or did not lose the desired amount.&#xD;

      For the first goal, the investigators will assess a longitudinal group of subjects both&#xD;
      before RYGB surgery (n=15) SG surgery (n=15), and LAGB surgery (n=15), and then again after&#xD;
      they lose ~16% of their body weight post-surgery in the fed and the fasted state. the&#xD;
      investigators will also study the same variables in a cross-sectional design consisting of&#xD;
      two groups: a weight success group (n=30) and a weight failure group (n=30) 2-5 years post&#xD;
      RYGB or SG surgery. The weight success group will include subjects who lost ≥40% body weight&#xD;
      by 2-5 years post-surgery and the weight failure group will include subjects who lost &lt;25%&#xD;
      body weight by 2-5 years post-surgery. In addition, the investigators will also explore the&#xD;
      extent to which fat preferences and sensory perception in these subjects are affected by&#xD;
      flavor related genes.&#xD;
