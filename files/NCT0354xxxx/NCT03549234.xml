  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following painful surgical procedures of the breast, postoperative analgesia is often&#xD;
      provided with a paravertebral nerve block (PVB). For intense, but shorter-duration acute&#xD;
      pain, a single-injection of local anesthetic is used with a duration of approximately 12&#xD;
      hours. The PVB has several limitations: it can decrease blood pressure, and very rare-but&#xD;
      serious-complications have occurred, including neuraxial injection, neuraxial hematoma, and&#xD;
      pleural puncture. An alternative block has been described: the erector spinae plane block.&#xD;
      The theoretical benefits include ease of administration since it is a plane superficial to&#xD;
      the PVB and therefore easier to identify and target with ultrasound (therefore increasing&#xD;
      success rate); and an increased safety margin: there are few anatomic structures in the&#xD;
      immediate area which could be injured with the needle; and, the target plane is much further&#xD;
      from the intrathecal/epidural space relative to the PVB. Lastly, the plane may be easier to&#xD;
      catheterize for continuous peripheral nerve blocks relative to the relatively-small volume&#xD;
      PVB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are therefore multiple theoretical reasons to prefer the erector spinae plane block.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, it remains unknown if the analgesia provided by this new technique is&#xD;
      comparable to that provided with the PVB. The investigators therefore propose to compare&#xD;
      these two techniques with a randomized, subject-masked, active-controlled, parallel-arm,&#xD;
      human subjects clinical trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This investigation will be a randomized, subject-masked, active-controlled parallel-arm,&#xD;
      human subjects clinical trial. Of note, the investigators will be using standard-of-care&#xD;
      local anesthetic under an FDA-approved purpose and do not plan to research a possible change&#xD;
      of indication or use of these medications as part of this research project. The treatments in&#xD;
      both groups are currently used at the study institution and there is true clinical equipoise&#xD;
      at this time. The only difference in treatment between subjects who enroll versus those not&#xD;
      enrolled in this study will be those who enroll will have the decision between which anatomic&#xD;
      block location determined randomly, as opposed to the physician simply choosing him/herself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment. Consenting adults undergoing breast surgery with a planned single-injection&#xD;
      regional analgesic will be offered enrollment. Patients undergoing breast surgery with a&#xD;
      planned perineural catheter regional analgesic will be excluded. Study inclusion will be&#xD;
      proposed to eligible patients prior to surgery. If a patient desires study participation,&#xD;
      written, informed consent will be obtained using a current University of California San Diego&#xD;
      (UCSD) Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved Informed Consent Form (ICF). Selection for&#xD;
      inclusion will not be based on gender, race, or socioeconomic status. The study population of&#xD;
      interest includes men and women of all races and socioeconomic status. Inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are listed in another section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Procedures. Following written, informed consent, the investigators will collect&#xD;
      baseline anthropomorphic information (e.g., age, sex, height, and weight). All subjects will&#xD;
      have a peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter inserted, standard noninvasive monitors applied,&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen administered via a nasal cannula or face mask, and placed in the sitting&#xD;
      position. Midazolam and fentanyl (IV) will be titrated for patient comfort, while ensuring&#xD;
      that patients remain responsive to verbal cues. Both possible block locations will be viewed&#xD;
      with ultrasound. If one or both of the locations is unacceptable for block placement in the&#xD;
      clinician's opinion, the subject will not be randomized and will not proceed further with the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then be randomized using a computer-generated list and opaque, sealed envelopes&#xD;
      to one of two treatment groups: (blocks of 4, stratified for unilateral vs. bilateral&#xD;
      surgery): (1) erector spinae plane or (2) paravertebral block. All blocks will be placed by a&#xD;
      regional anesthesia fellow or resident under the direct supervision and guidance of a&#xD;
      regional anesthesia attending (or by the attending him/herself).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The area of needle insertion will be cleaned with chlorhexidine gluconate and isopropyl&#xD;
      alcohol. All blocks will be placed using standard UCSD ultrasound-guided techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ropivacaine 0.5% (with epinephrine 1:200,000-400,000) will be administered via the needle&#xD;
      into the target plane. For erector spinae plane blocks, this will be at the T3 level for&#xD;
      surgery involving the axilla and the T4 level for surgery not involving the axilla (20 mL of&#xD;
      local anesthetic for unilateral surgery; 16 mL of local anesthetic each side for bilateral&#xD;
      surgery). For PVBs without axillary work, this will be at the T3 and T5 levels. For PVBs with&#xD;
      axillary work, this will be at the T2 and T4 levels. For unilateral PVBs, 10 mL of local&#xD;
      anesthetic will be injected per level. For bilateral PVBs, 8 mL of local anesthetic will be&#xD;
      injected per level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-injection blocks will be considered successful if, within 30 minutes, the subject&#xD;
      experiences decreased sensation to cold temperature with an alcohol pad over the approximate&#xD;
      level of the ipsilateral 4th thoracic dermatome. Misplaced blocks will be replaced&#xD;
      successfully, or the patient excluded from further study participation. For subjects&#xD;
      undergoing bilateral surgical procedures, a block using the same protocol will be&#xD;
      administered on the contralateral side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperatively, all subjects will receive a general anesthetic using inhaled and&#xD;
      intravenous anesthetic and oxygen. Intravenous fentanyl will be administered for&#xD;
      cardiovascular responsiveness to noxious stimuli at the discretion of the anesthesia&#xD;
      provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postop: Subjects will be discharged with a prescription for oxycodone 5 mg tablets for&#xD;
      supplementary analgesia and instructed to record the time at which subjects take their first&#xD;
      opioid tablet as well as the time at which subjects believe the block starts to wear off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements (end points). Pain scores will be recorded using the Numeric Rating&#xD;
      Scale (NRS). Within the recovery room, pain scores, opioid requirements, and antiemetic&#xD;
      administration will be recorded by nursing staff masked to treatment group. The morning&#xD;
      following surgery, all subjects will be contacted by phone or in person [if hospitalized] to&#xD;
      record lowest, average, highest, and current pain scores; sleep disturbances, and nausea&#xD;
      using a 0-10 Likert scale (0 = no nausea; 10 = vomiting). For outpatients, opioid&#xD;
      requirements will be recorded while inpatients will have opioid requirements extracted from&#xD;
      the electronic medical record. In addition, the investigators will extract antiemetic use&#xD;
      from the electronic record. The investigators will collect the times at which subjects felt&#xD;
      their block resolve and subjects consumed their first opioid analgesic pills following&#xD;
      recovery room discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Following breast surgery, analgesia will be non-inferior in the recovery room&#xD;
      with an erector spinae plane block compared with a paravertebral block as measured with the&#xD;
      Numeric Rating Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: For breast surgery, opioid consumption will be non-inferior in the operating&#xD;
      and recovery rooms with an erector spinae plane block compared with a paravertebral block&#xD;
      (primary: cumulative intravenous morphine equivalents).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point: In order to claim that erector spinae plane blocks are non-inferior to&#xD;
      paravertebral blocks, both Hypotheses 1 and 2 must be at least non-inferior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods. Descriptive statistics will be provided by arm and in aggregate.&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics of arms will be compared using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and&#xD;
      Fisher's Exact tests. Key characteristics that are significantly different (p&lt;0.05) will be&#xD;
      included as covariates in the analysis models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim. The investigators will test the noninferiority of the erector spinae nerve block&#xD;
      compared to the paravertebral nerve block. The 95% confidence interval (CI) associated with&#xD;
      the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test will be derived for the group difference (paravertebral minus&#xD;
      erector spinae) in median pain scores within the recovery room. If the lower limit of the 95%&#xD;
      CI is greater than -1.25, the investigators will conclude noninferiority. If there are&#xD;
      significant differences between the groups in any key characteristics, these characteristics&#xD;
      will be included as covariates in a linear model. The same noninferiority margin (-1.25) will&#xD;
      be applied to the 95% CI for the covariate adjusted group difference in mean pain derived&#xD;
      from the linear model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The noninferiority of the erector spinae nerve block with regard to total opioid consumption&#xD;
      within the operating and recovery rooms will be tested in the same manner as pain, i.e.&#xD;
      comparing the limits of a 95% CI associated with the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test to a&#xD;
      predefined noninferiority margin (in this case 2 mg). Covariate adjusted linear models will&#xD;
      again be applied in the event that key characteristics are significantly different between&#xD;
      the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size justification. Power for the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney derived noninferiority testing&#xD;
      is based on 10,000 simulated trials. The investigators simulated pain scores from a discrete&#xD;
      distribution with median (interquartile range) 3 (2-5) [Kairaluoma, 2004]. Between the&#xD;
      quartiles, the probability of each score was assumed constant. The distribution for each&#xD;
      group was assumed to be the same. The sample size of n=50 per group provides 82% power to&#xD;
      detect noninferiority in pain with a margin of 1.25. Similarly, opioid consumption was&#xD;
      assumed to follow a truncated normal distribution with mean 2.5 mg and standard deviation 2&#xD;
      mg, and minimum value 0 mg. The sample size of n = 50 per group provides at least 95% power&#xD;
      to detect noninferiority with margin 2 mg. Therefore, the investigators will enroll 50&#xD;
      subjects for each of two treatments with a total enrollment of 100 subjects. To allow for&#xD;
      dropouts, the investigators will request a maximum enrollment of 120 subjects. Noninferiority&#xD;
      in pain is tested first, and if significant, noninferiority in opioid consumption is tested.&#xD;
      Under this hierarchical testing framework, no adjustment in alpha is necessary to control&#xD;
      Type 1 error [Mascha, et al 2012].&#xD;

            <groups_desc>We hypothesized that 1) analgesia would be noninferior in the recovery room as measured on a Numeric Rating Scale with ESPB (erector spinae plane block), and 2) opioid consumption would be noninferior in the operating and recovery rooms with ESPB. We simulated pain scores from a discrete distribution with median (interquartile range) 2 (0-3). The sample size of 50 per group provided 81% power to detect noninferiority in pain.</groups_desc>
