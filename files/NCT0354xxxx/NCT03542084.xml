  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes currently affects 25.8 million people in the U.S. Patients with diabetes are&#xD;
      generally managed, at least initially, by a primary care practitioner (PCP). As the&#xD;
      prevalence of diabetes continues to rise, PCPs are under increased pressure to achieve&#xD;
      recommended glycemic targets. Failure to achieve these targets has been shown to increase&#xD;
      clinical complications and cost of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endocrinology referral is common for those patients not meeting A1c goals. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      access to specialty endocrinology care is limited and patients routinely wait weeks or months&#xD;
      before being seen. Electronic consultation (e-consult) is a new and innovative delivery model&#xD;
      that has the potential to provide greater access to specialty care. The current system at&#xD;
      Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) allows PCPs to electively place an e-consult to solicit&#xD;
      specialist input. Specialists in turn review the patients chart, relevant data and the&#xD;
      clinical question and respond within the electronic medical record. E-consults have been well&#xD;
      received by both patients and physicians, not only at MGH, but also across many centers in&#xD;
      the US. With that said, the e-consult system remains in its infancy and current literature&#xD;
      largely focuses on process metrics without hard clinical end-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One way to optimize care for patients with diabetes is to automatically trigger an&#xD;
      endocrinology e-consult for those not meeting A1c targets. The goal of this project will be&#xD;
      to conduct a rigorous scientific evaluation of auto-triggered e-consults across Massachusetts&#xD;
      General Hospitals affiliated primary care practices. The e-consults will be unsolicited and&#xD;
      triggered based on inclusion criteria that include a1c and date of last PCP visit. This&#xD;
      project will leverage an existing diabetes population health registry that is being used&#xD;
      currently for ongoing diabetes care initiatives.&#xD;
