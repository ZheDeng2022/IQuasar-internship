    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, single treatment study in subjects with normal&#xD;
      renal function and varying degrees of renal impairment. Each subject will receive a single&#xD;
      oral dose of lorlatinib administered in the fasted state. Subjects with mild, moderate, and&#xD;
      severe renal impairment will be enrolled and normal healthy subjects will be enrolled as&#xD;
      matched controls.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered a product or medical device; the event did not need to have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage.

      <recruitment_details>The mild renal impairment participants were recruited first. After lorlatinib was tolerated in at least 3 mild impairment participants, moderate impairment participants were enrolled. After dosing of 3 moderate impairment participants for at least 1 week, the remaining moderate impairment participants and the severe impairment participants were enrolled. The enrollment of normal renal function participants began after all renal impairment participants completed the PK collection.</recruitment_details>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered a product or medical device; the event did not need to have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs included both SAEs and AEs. TEAEs were AEs occurred following the start of treatment or AEs increasing in severity during treatment.

Hematology evaluation included hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, platelet count, white blood cell count, total neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, basophils, lymphocytes, erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume, erythrocyte mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and erythrocyte mean corpuscular hemoglobin. Chemistry evaluation included blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, total bicarbonate, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, uric acid albumin, total protein, lipase and amylase. Urinalysis evaluation included decimal logarithm of reciprocal of hydrogen ion activity [pH], glucose, protein, blood, ketones, microscopy, ketones, nitrite, leukocyte esterase, urobilinogen, urine bilirubin and bacteria.
