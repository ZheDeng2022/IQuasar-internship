      Tuberculosis (TB) is an ancient disease, with evidence of skeletal TB found in mummies in&#xD;
      both the Old and New World. The causative agent is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a fastidious,&#xD;
      aerobic, acid-fast bacillus Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health problem. It ranks&#xD;
      as the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide, after the human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The latest estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      reported that there were 9 million new cases in 2011 and 1.4 million TB deaths . Moreover, it&#xD;
      is one of the top 10 causes of global mortality and affects low-income countries in&#xD;
      particular. About half a million children (0-14 years old) are ill with TB, and 64,000&#xD;
      children died from the disease in 2011 . In Egypt, TB is considered the third most important&#xD;
      public health problem after schistosomiasis and hepatitis C .&#xD;
&#xD;
      TB in children is often missed or overlooked due to non-specific symptoms and difficulties in&#xD;
      diagnosis. This has made it difficult to assess the actual magnitude of the childhood TB&#xD;
      epidemic, which may be higher than currently estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an urgent need for public attention, prioritisation, commitment and funding for this&#xD;
      disease that today should never take the life of a child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine : a live attenuated vaccine that has been in use since&#xD;
      1921, is the most widely used vaccine worldwide . BCG is efficacious against the most severe&#xD;
      forms of tuberculosis (TB) such as tuberculosis meningitis (73% protection) and miliary TB&#xD;
      (77% protection) in children younger than 5 years .&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is one of the mandatory vaccines recommended by the ministry of health(MOH) of Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BCG vaccination became compulsory in all governorates of Egypt since 1974 . the recommended&#xD;
      schedule of BCG is eight weeks postnatal. The usual response to administer BCG vaccine is the&#xD;
      development of erythema or a papule at around 2 weeks, followed by an ulcer and healing with&#xD;
      a scar at 6 weeks at the site of the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the size of reaction after vaccination is not generally thought to influence the&#xD;
      degree of protection offered by BCG, the presence of the BCG scar has been used as a&#xD;
      criterion to assess the uptake of vaccination .&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the sensitivity of BCG scar as an index of vaccination status is still the subject&#xD;
      of controversy. Failure to form scar may be related to factors such as lack of maturation of&#xD;
      the immune system, faulty technique or unipotent vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse effects of Bcg vaccine: were classified, according to World Health Organization&#xD;
      definitions , as injection-site abscess, lymphadenitis, severe local reaction, and&#xD;
      disseminated BCG infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuberculin skin test response:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reaction is read by measuring the diameter of induration (palpable raised, hardened area)&#xD;
      across the forearm (perpendicular to the long axis) in millimeters. If there is no&#xD;
      induration, the result should be recorded as &quot;0 mm&quot;. Erythema (redness) should not be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 mm or more is positive in&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An HIV-positive person&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persons with recent contacts with a TB patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persons with nodular or fibrotic changes on chest X-ray consistent with old healed TB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with organ transplants, and other immunosuppressed patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 mm or more is positive in&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent arrivals (less than five years) from high-prevalence countries&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Injection drug users&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Residents and employees of high-risk congregate settings (e.g., prisons, nursing homes,&#xD;
           hospitals, homeless shelters, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mycobacteriology lab personnel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persons with clinical conditions that place them at high risk (e.g., diabetes, prolonged&#xD;
           corticosteroid therapy, leukemia, end-stage renal disease, chronic malabsorption&#xD;
           syndromes, low body weight, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children less than four years of age, or children and adolescents exposed to adults in&#xD;
           high-risk categories&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 mm or more is positive in&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persons with no known risk factors for TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the study aims to• Estimate the frequency of children without BCG scar after bcg vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate factors which may affect scar formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tuberculin skin test response in children without BCG scars if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of vaccine adverse effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants with skin lesion on the left forearm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infant treated with steroids or intravenous immune globulins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants with immunodeficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants with congenital anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cases included in the study will be subjected to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full clinical history including: Birth weight, nutritional status, gender, gestational&#xD;
           age, weight at time of vaccination, mother awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed clinical examination: including site of bcg scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tuberculin test in negative BCG scar children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Revaccination of negative BCG scar children.&#xD;
