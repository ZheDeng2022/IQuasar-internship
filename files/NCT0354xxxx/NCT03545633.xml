    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective multi-center open-label single-arm study. The subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled and assigned into a single study group. Subjects will be required to complete four&#xD;
      (4) treatment visits and three follow-up visits, 2 months, 6 and 12 months after the final&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit photographs of the abdomen will be taken. In addition, adipose/muscle&#xD;
      layer thickness will be measured with the magnetic resonance imaging and the subject's weight&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety measures will include documentation of adverse events (AE) including subject's&#xD;
      experience of pain or discomfort after the procedure. Following each treatment administration&#xD;
      and at the follow-up visits, subjects will be checked for immediate post-procedure adverse&#xD;
      event assessment. In addition, at the last therapy visit, subjects will receive Subject&#xD;
      Satisfaction and Therapy Comfort Questionnaires to fill in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-procedure evaluation (follow-up visits) will be conducted 2, 6 and 12 months after the&#xD;
      final treatment. During those visits, magnetic resonance imaging, photographing and weight&#xD;
      measure will be conducted. Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire will be given at every&#xD;
      follow-up visit.&#xD;

    <description>The 5-point Likert scale Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire will be used for an analysis of the subject's opinion of the therapy results. Subjects will be evaluating agreement with three different statements (concerning satisfaction with therapy results and appearance of abdominal area after therapy) by choosing an answer on a scale between 1 (Strongly disagree) and 5 (Strongly agree). Minimally 80% of the treated subjects should report the agreement with all three statements given in the questionnaire (answers &quot;Agree&quot; and &quot;Strongly agree&quot;) in order to claim subject's satisfaction with the therapy outcome.</description>

    <description>Therapy comfort will be noted at the last therapy visit. Subjects will be asked to evaluate the agreement with the statement concerning the conformity of the study treatment. Subjects will be evaluating the agreement by choosing an answer on a scale between 1 (Strongly disagree) and 5 (Strongly agree). Based on a given answers, the therapy comfort will be calculated.</description>
