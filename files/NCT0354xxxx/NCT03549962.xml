  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition has long been linked to postoperative complications and adverse outcomes in a&#xD;
      variety of surgical fields , such as increased susceptibility to infection, delayed wound&#xD;
      healing, and increased frequency of decubitus ulcers. In particular, it is a modifiable risk&#xD;
      factor, as evident by studies that have associated optimization of preoperative nutrition&#xD;
      with improved surgical outcomes. Therefore, it is important to identify these patients who&#xD;
      are at risk so that appropriate nutritional support can be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A range of options for nutritional status assessment have been proposed; a comprehensive&#xD;
      assessment may include measurements of dietary intake, clinical assessment, anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements, and biochemical measurements of serum protein, micronutrients and metabolic&#xD;
      parameters . Many of the signs of malnutrition, however, only manifest in extreme cases. Thus&#xD;
      it is crucial to identify sensitive markers that can be utilized to screen for clinical as&#xD;
      well as subclinical malnutrition patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In orthopaedic patients, the prevalence of clinical and subclinical malnutrition has been&#xD;
      reported to be up to 42.4%. Common markers of malnutrition that have been studied include low&#xD;
      serum albumin as a marker of protein status, low total lymphocyte count (TLC), and&#xD;
      excessively high or low body mass index (BMI). They have been compared against various&#xD;
      adverse surgical outcomes, including surgical site infections (SSI), delayed wound healing,&#xD;
      unplanned intubation and ICU admission , postoperative anemia and cardiac complications , and&#xD;
      length of hospital stay. However, conflicting results have been reported; for example, while&#xD;
      hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin &lt;3.5mg/dL) have been associated with increased risk of SSI and&#xD;
      longer than average hospital stay, its effect on wound healing is less clear - Marin et al.&#xD;
      reported no significant predictive value of hypoalbuminemia on wound healing, yet Greene et&#xD;
      al. reported a 5-time increase in frequency of major wound complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to identify biomarkers of malnutrition in&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective total knee arthroplasty (TKA) that are predictive of adverse&#xD;
      in-hospital postoperative complications, which would facilitate the identification of at risk&#xD;
      patients for nutritional optimization before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six-hundred and twenty-six patients who underwent elective TKA between 2013 and 2017 in the&#xD;
      Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong were reviewed; the preoperative serum albumin, TLC, and&#xD;
      BMI were compared against in-hospital postoperative complications.&#xD;
