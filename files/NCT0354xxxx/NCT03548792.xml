    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled clinical and RSA study, comparing 2 knee implants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. NexGen CR cemented total knee arthroplasty&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Persona CR cemented total knee arthroplasty&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 hospitals will participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Helse Bergen HF, Kysthospitalet i Hagavik (KIH)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Helse Førde HF, Lærdal sykehus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Helse Bergen HF, Haukeland universitetssykehus (HUS) 1-3 surgeons in each hospital will&#xD;
           perform the operations. There will be 80 patients in the 2 groups; a total of 160 study&#xD;
           patients will be included. 30 in each group will be included for RSA. Radiostereometric&#xD;
           analysis (RSA) will be used to measure migration and subsidence of components in&#xD;
           addition to regular radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3 different knee scoring systems will be used to evaluate satisfaction and function. An&#xD;
           activity monitor will be used to assess real-life physical behavior and walking speed to&#xD;
           assess objectively measured mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register will be used to investigate the risk of&#xD;
      revision.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple factors may affect the outcome of total knee arthroplasty (1-5), and the patient&#xD;
      satisfaction has been reported up to 90% (6). Also the physical behavior of a person may&#xD;
      affect how much strain that is put on the prosthesis after surgery. Whether more strain is&#xD;
      caused by a more physically active profile or by a more sedentary profile is uncertain.&#xD;
      Obtaining real-life information about physical behavior is therefore important, and is made&#xD;
      possible by using activity monitors measuring physical behavior continuously over longer&#xD;
      time-periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Arthroplasty Registers worldwide has extensive data on knee and hip implants&#xD;
      used over several years. Some are documented over 20 years, whereas newer implants appear&#xD;
      with shorter follow-up. The Norwegian Arthroplasty Register has a registration completeness&#xD;
      of 96% in the 2015 annual report (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NexGen is a total knee arthroplasty implant that has been used at great numbers in numerous&#xD;
      countries and is well documented in several registries (Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register,&#xD;
      Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persona is a new implant from the same company that produces NexGen, with several changes and&#xD;
      modernizations regarding instrumentation and surgical technique. There are a wider range of&#xD;
      sizes available, both on the tibia and femur, as well as the menisceal insert. This should&#xD;
      allow optimized component fit and less compromise on soft tissue balancing. The tibia is&#xD;
      anatomical, with a more medialized keel stem, which should allow for a more accurate fit&#xD;
      securing less risk of malrotation and better fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tibial component in the new Persona design, is anatomical, to achieve a better fit than&#xD;
      in the old design. Additionally it facilitates proper rotation of the tibia. When a larger&#xD;
      surface of bone is covered, it is expected a lesser risk of subsidence and early loosening of&#xD;
      the implant. The new Persona also has a Vitamin E Highly Crosslinked polyethylene insert&#xD;
      option for lower wear and improved strength than the regular polyethylene. However, the&#xD;
      advent of newer highly crosslinked polyethylene has shown improved wear rates in hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty, but not to the same degree in knee arthroplasty (8, 9). The investigators&#xD;
      therefore will use conventional polyethylene in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In theory, the new design will lessen the compromises experienced today with the older&#xD;
      designs. There have been no independent studies published yet to prove this possible&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most countries with well-functioning joint registers are cautious in implementing new designs&#xD;
      without studies comparing the new implant to older established implants. There have been&#xD;
      several examples of unsuccessful joint replacements introduced to the market without thorough&#xD;
      clinical investigation and trials, the hip resurfacing surgery being an example of this (10,&#xD;
      11). In Norway, the regional tender process usually demands either 10 years follow-up in&#xD;
      clinical or registry studies or alternatively 2 or 5 years RSA studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examples of previous randomized controlled clinical and RSA study where members of our study&#xD;
      group have participated and been project leader (12-16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the clinical outcome scores in the 4 study groups o KSS (Knee Society Score)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  EQ 5D&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FJS12 (Forgotten Joint Score 12)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Walking speed (4-m static walking speed test)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Objective monitoring of free-living physical behaviour (ActivPAL activity monitor)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anchor questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the migration patterns of the components with main focus on the tibia using&#xD;
           RSA. Our hypothesis is that early stability of the new Persona is improved with better&#xD;
           coverage of the bone plateau. Early stability corresponds to clinical performance at&#xD;
           medium term (17, 18).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate revision rates using the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOCUMENTATION OF THE COMPONENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NexGen CR implant has been well documented, as mentioned, in the last decades as&#xD;
      excellent total knee implants (7, 19, 20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Persona knee has just recently been introduced to the market as a more personalized&#xD;
      implant. The improvements with comprehensive sizing and side-specific kinematics have not yet&#xD;
      been investigated independently in studies to our knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      160 patients will be randomly allocated into 2 groups with 80 in each group, and 30 of the 80&#xD;
      in each group will be randomized for RSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL EVALUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation will be performed by independent physiotherapists preoperatively, using&#xD;
      EQ5D, Knee Society Score (KSS) and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The&#xD;
      scoring will be performed by a physiotherapist who is blinded with respect to the assigned&#xD;
      study group, and by the patients themselves. An orthopaedic surgeon is consulted in the case&#xD;
      of specific clinical problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be examined again at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years with EQ5D, KSS, KOOS, Forgotten&#xD;
      Joint Score 12 (FJS12) and Anchor questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preferred walking speed will be measured by timing a 4-meter walk with a stopwatch.&#xD;
      Instructions will be given to &quot;walk in your preferred speed&quot; Preferred walking speed has been&#xD;
      found valid, reliable, sensitive and specific, and correlates with functional ability and&#xD;
      balance confidence (21). Walking speed has also been found to be a consistent predictor of&#xD;
      adverse outcomes in different populations (22). Walking speed will be measured at pre-op, 3&#xD;
      months post-op and 1, 2, 5 and 10 years post-op.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ActivPAL3TM (AP) (PAL technologies Ltd., Glasgow, Scotland) will be used to record&#xD;
      free-living physical behavior. The AP is a small, light-weight, three axis accelerometer that&#xD;
      will be attached to the anterior aspect of the participants thigh with a hydrogel adhesive&#xD;
      (PALStickiesTM, PAL technologies Ltd., Glasgow, Scotland) and covered by waterproof band aid&#xD;
      to allow for showering. The AP will be worn continuously 24 h/day to provide seven&#xD;
      uninterrupted free-living days of physical behavior data. The participant will be asked to go&#xD;
      about their usual activities. A proprietary software-package (PAL Professional) will be used&#xD;
      to process acceleration data, and classify the free-living physical activity in sedentary&#xD;
      (sitting and lying) and upright (standing and walking) postures, number of transitions from&#xD;
      sitting to standing, and number of steps during walking. It has been found that the AP has&#xD;
      good accuracy for detecting postures and counting steps during walking in non-impaired people&#xD;
      (23-25) and community-dwelling non-impaired elderly (26). It has been found that the AP also&#xD;
      was a highly valid measure of postures and transitions in elderly with walking impairments&#xD;
      including patients post-stroke. Step counting however, was less accurate for this sample&#xD;
      underestimating steps at very slow walking speeds &lt;0.47 m/s (27). The AP monitor will be&#xD;
      given to the participant at pre-op, 3 months post-op and 1, 2, 5 and 10 years post-op. After&#xD;
      one week recording the participants will be asked to send the monitor back to the research&#xD;
      team in a pre-paid envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RADIOGRAPHY&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Standard x-rays&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperatively and at all followup consultations, x-rays will be taken as&#xD;
           Anteroposterior (AP) and Mediolateral (ML) views. In addition long axis view (HKA) and&#xD;
           patella 45° skyview will be evaluated preoperatively and at 1 year followup. Later these&#xD;
           values will be evaluated together with migration- and wear values.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Radiostereometric analysis (RSA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RSA is a highly accurate and precise method of evaluating implant migration and&#xD;
           polyethylene wear (17, 28-31). The precision usually is about 0.1mm (translational&#xD;
           migration) and 0.1 degrees (rotation). The radiation dose is low compared to plain&#xD;
           x-rays (10-20%). During surgery, tiny spheres of Tantalum are implanted in&#xD;
           periprosthetic bone. On day 5-10 postoperatively, two simultaneous exposures of the knee&#xD;
           and a co-ordinate system are taken. These films allow three-dimensional definition of&#xD;
           the implant and bone relative to the co-ordinate system. Implant migration and rotation&#xD;
           are measured on repeat examinations over time. The high precision allows us to detect&#xD;
           small differences between groups, and also means that the number of subjects in each&#xD;
           group can be restricted. The precision (repeatability) of the measurements in this study&#xD;
           will be evaluated by double examinations at the 1-year RSA-visit. Limits for significant&#xD;
           differences are calculated as the 99% confidence intervals of the absolute mean values&#xD;
           of the double examinations. RSA will be done at day 5-10 post-operatively, at 3months,&#xD;
           and at 1,2 and 5 years postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The tibia will have 9 tantulum beads of 1.0 mm spread from the cut tibia proximal&#xD;
                to distal and anteroposterioly.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The insert will have 6 beads; 3 x 1.0mm beads placed anteromedially,&#xD;
                posterolaterally and anteriorly. 3 x 0.8mm beads placed posteomedially,&#xD;
                anterolaterally and anteriorly.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The holes are then covered with bonewax.&#xD;
&#xD;
                160 patients are included after oral and written information. Included patients&#xD;
                give their written consent to participation in the study. 80 patients are included&#xD;
                in each group by drawing envelopes assigning the patients randomly to one of the 2&#xD;
                groups. Block randomisation is arranged so that each participating surgeon operates&#xD;
                an equal number of TKA in each group. The randomization is done by the statistician&#xD;
                using a computer-generated randomization. The randomization protocol is kept at the&#xD;
                registry office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is singled-blinded; the patients will not receive information on implant specifics&#xD;
      until the end of the study. Each patient receives a patient number (1 through 160) on&#xD;
      inclusion. 30 patients in each of the 2 groups will be included for the RSA study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOWUP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preop: KSS, KOOS, walking speed, ActivPAL activity monitor, standard x-rays,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postop: RSA, standard x-rays&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 weeks pain and function assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 months: RSA, walking speed, ActivPAL activity monitor,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1, 2 and 5 years: RSA, standard x-rays, KSS, KOOS and FJS12, walking speed, ActivPAL&#xD;
           activity monitor, 10 years: RSA, standard x-rays, KSS, KOOS, walking speed, ActivPAL&#xD;
           activity monitor, All RSA examinations will be anonymised and done at the biomaterial&#xD;
           laboratory at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Haukeland University Hospital. The&#xD;
           results of the RSA-examinations and clinical outcome measures will be collected in&#xD;
           electronic files under the respective patient numbers. Data obtained on previous&#xD;
           occasions will not be accessible when examining the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient list A list will be made coupling patient name and personal identification number to&#xD;
      a number on the patient list (1 through 160). The project leader is responsible for the safe&#xD;
      handling of the list. Other forms with patient information are labelled with the patient&#xD;
      number only for identification. The sponsors of the study will have access to the anonymised&#xD;
      data. Application to Ethical committee (REK-Vest) has been accepted. The registry study is&#xD;
      covered by the concession of the Norwegian Arthroplasty Registers concession from 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of variance on repeated measurements (ANOVA) will be used on the RSA- and on the&#xD;
      clinical data if the data are normally distributed. In our earlier RSA studies, the data have&#xD;
      displayed normal distribution. If however, the data are not normally distributed, the&#xD;
      investigators will use non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon matched-pairs&#xD;
      test). A power analysis for the student t-test for independent samples showed that group&#xD;
      sizes of 24 would give a power of 80 % to detect a 0.1 mm difference in subsidence of the&#xD;
      tibial component with a two-sided significance level of 0.0125 and an assumed SD of 0.1 mm.&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate exclusion of some patients and, therefore, include 30 patients&#xD;
      in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A difference of ten units in an aggregated and averaged subscale of KOOS was chosen as a&#xD;
      minimum important change, as suggested by the developers of KOOS. With a standard deviation&#xD;
      (SD) of 20, a sample size of 64 patients per group was necessary to achieve a power of 80%&#xD;
      and a 5% level of significance. With possible exclusion of patients, the investigators will&#xD;
      include 80 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power=80% gives N=80 in each group. Type I error rate, alpha=5%. Kaplan-Meier survival&#xD;
      percentages will be reported at 5 and 10 years. Cox regression model will be used to&#xD;
      calculate risk ratios (RR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Separate randomization lists will be created for each of the surgeons. Block randomization&#xD;
      for each participating surgeon with randomly varying block sizes will be generated to achieve&#xD;
      equal numbers in the treatment groups at all times. A central randomization office will&#xD;
      perform the computer-generated allocation to the trial groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse effects, side effects, and unfortunate effects of the surgery will immediately be&#xD;
      reported to the project leader and to the sponsors. Abortion or abruption of the study will&#xD;
      be considered in the case of unexpected complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will end 10 years after inclusion of all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An approximate time schedule is presented below:&#xD;
