    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well a diabetes prevention program with or without hunger&#xD;
      training works in helping to lower breast cancer risk in obese participants. A diabetes&#xD;
      prevention program involves learning about and receiving materials on different strategies to&#xD;
      encourage weight loss, and hunger training involves learning how to recognize hunger. It is&#xD;
      not yet known whether adding hunger training to a diabetes prevention program helps&#xD;
      participants control their weight that could reduce the risk of some cancers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the feasibility of adding hunger training to the Diabetes Prevention Program&#xD;
      (DPP) using the following criteria: accrual rates &gt; 50%, attrition rates &lt; 20% and, in the&#xD;
      DPP-plus-hunger training (HT) group, training protocol adherence rates &gt; 75%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate the magnitude of effect sizes and variation in outcome variables for the DPP-only&#xD;
      and DPP-plus-HT interventions on changes in weight; in metabolic and breast cancer risk&#xD;
      biomarkers (e.g., fasting insulin and blood glucose [BG] levels, levels of glycosylated&#xD;
      hemoglobin, insulin resistance, adiponectin, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein); and in&#xD;
      proposed behavioral mediators (e.g., reduction in total energy intake, overall eating&#xD;
      frequency, percent of eating events occurring at or below the average fasting blood BG&#xD;
      level).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Examine the mediation effects of proposed mechanisms of the interventions related to&#xD;
      individual-level behavioral measures of eating self-regulation on the proposed outcomes using&#xD;
      a multimodal approach of validated questionnaires and reliable ecological momentary&#xD;
      assessment method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP A: Participants take part in DPP once a week over 1 hour for 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP B: Participants take part in DPP once a week over 1 hour for 16 weeks and hunger&#xD;
      training once a week during weeks 2-6.&#xD;
