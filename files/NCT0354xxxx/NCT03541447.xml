  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a leading cause of End Stage Kidney&#xD;
      Disease (ESKD) worldwide. Elevated levels of 3', 5' - cyclic AMP (cAMP) play a central role&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease. Vasopressin antagonists and somatostatin&#xD;
      analogues, which indirectly reduce adenyl cyclase 6 activity, have been found to markedly&#xD;
      reduce renal tubular cell proliferation and cyst growth in experimental models of ADPKD. In&#xD;
      combination, the two treatments show a clear additive effect and may significantly reduce&#xD;
      renal cystic and fibrotic volume as well as cAMP levels to wild type levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vasopressin antagonist Tolvaptan and the somatostatin analogue Octreotide share a similar&#xD;
      renoprotective effect also in human disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both medications effectively slow total kidney and cystic volume (TKV and TCV, respectively)&#xD;
      growth and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline in patients with ADPKD. The short-term&#xD;
      effect of both medications appear to be larger when the GFR is normal or even higher than&#xD;
      normal and kidney volumes are still relatively stable. On the basis of experimental data, it&#xD;
      is conceivable that Tolvaptan and Octreotide LAR should have an additive effect also in human&#xD;
      disease, during initial treatment as well as in the long-term. To address the working&#xD;
      hypothesis of an additional short-term effect of Tolvaptan and Octreotide, we propose to run&#xD;
      a pilot, explorative, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial with a Cross-Over Design&#xD;
      to compare the short-term effects of Tolvaptan monotherapy and Tolvaptan plus Octreotide LAR&#xD;
      combination therapy on TKV as assessed by MRI, and on GFR as directly measured by the iohexol&#xD;
      plasma clearance technique in ADPKD patients with normal (80 to 120 ml/min/1.73m2) kidney&#xD;
      function or even kidney hyperfiltration (GFR ≥120 ml/min/1.73m2).&#xD;
