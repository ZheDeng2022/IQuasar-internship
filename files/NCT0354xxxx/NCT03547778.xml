    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that use of vaginal misoprostol will help in reducing the pain scores when&#xD;
      used prior to concurrent office hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy in a particular subgroup&#xD;
      of women who are anticipated to require cervical dilatation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Office hysteroscopy (OH) and endometrial biopsy (EMB) is increasingly performed for&#xD;
      evaluation of various gynecologic conditions. It has replaced traditional dilatation and&#xD;
      curettage for evaluation of intrauterine pathology. It is more acceptable to most women as it&#xD;
      is quick, safe and cost effective with higher diagnostic accuracy. However, pain encountered&#xD;
      at the time of procedure is a major limitation and at times lead to incomplete procedure. The&#xD;
      variables that influence women's experience of pain during these procedures are nulliparity,&#xD;
      menopausal status, pre-existing anxious state, use of tenaculum, presence of synechiae in the&#xD;
      cervical canal, and duration of procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The average pain score recorded at the end of procedures when OH and EMB were performed&#xD;
      simultaneously was 7 on a 10 cm VAS scale (Visual analogue scale) 5 among pre and post&#xD;
      menopausal women who received pre-procedure analgesia in the form of oral Non-Steroidal Anti&#xD;
      Inflammatory drug (NSAID) and application of local anesthetic gel. Among patients where only&#xD;
      intracervical topical anesthetic injection was used, the pain score at the end of OH and EMB&#xD;
      was 9.22 (low pain) and 11.52 (moderate pain), respectively, on a 20cm VAS. Most women&#xD;
      describe EMB as &quot;moderately&quot; or &quot;severely&quot; painful6. A significant source of pain during&#xD;
      endometrial sampling is placement of tenaculum on the cervix. Interventions that have been&#xD;
      studied to reduce pain with EMB include misoprostol for cervical ripening, intrauterine&#xD;
      lidocaine infusion, paracervical block, and pre-procedure NSAIDs. The results are variable&#xD;
      with modest benefit on pain with only an intrauterine lidocaine infusion with or without&#xD;
      NSAID or/and misoprostol. Similarly, during OH also, there are multiple points where women&#xD;
      experience pain. It can be during tenaculum placement, introduction of the hysteroscope,&#xD;
      distension of uterine cavity, intrauterine procedures, and withdrawal of scope. Out of many&#xD;
      interventions evaluated, local anesthesia via paracervical block provided consistent&#xD;
      decreases in intraoperative and postoperative pain scores. There were mixed data on efficacy&#xD;
      of intracervical blocks and no evidence to support the use of intrauterine anesthesia or&#xD;
      topical gels, sprays, or creams. Premedication with opioid analgesics or NSAIDs do not confer&#xD;
      benefit in pain management during office hysteroscopy. Misoprostol for cervical ripening&#xD;
      prior to diagnostic hysteroscopy neither reduce pain nor facilitate the procedure for&#xD;
      hysteroscopes with diameters of less than 6 mm in premenopausal women, but there may be a&#xD;
      benefit in postmenopausal women. In contrast, another systematic review examining use of&#xD;
      misoprostol before hysteroscopy found that misoprostol given to premenopausal women reduced&#xD;
      the need for cervical dilatation and the incidence of cervical laceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analog that was first marketed in the 1980s to prevent&#xD;
      gastric ulcer. It can be administered sublingually, orally, vaginally, or rectally. Peak&#xD;
      serum levels are achieved after vaginal administration. The plasma concentration increases&#xD;
      gradually after vaginal administration, reaching its maximum level after 70-80 minutes.&#xD;
      Misoprostol is commonly used in gynecology for inducing dilatation of the cervix for&#xD;
      termination of pregnancy and removing retained products of conception. It helps in&#xD;
      non-pregnant women to dilate the cervix and provides easy access to the uterine cavity for&#xD;
      transcervical procedures such as hysteroscopy and intrauterine device placement. To evaluate&#xD;
      the optimal dose of vaginal misoprostol for cervical priming before operative hysteroscopy,&#xD;
      low dose (200mcg) and high dose (400 mcg) misoprostol was compared in a recent randomized&#xD;
      control trial. They found no difference in perioperative dilatation time, and subjective&#xD;
      difficulty of cervical dilatation assessed by surgeons. However, the incidence of misoprostol&#xD;
      related adverse events such as abdominal pain, pre-insertion nausea and cramping were less in&#xD;
      the group who received 200 mcg misoprostol. But it is important to note that even 200 mcg&#xD;
      misoprostol is associated with 50% incidence of abdominal cramping. Since we would be&#xD;
      conducting outpatient diagnostic procedures only, we propose that use of 50 mcg misoprostol&#xD;
      would lead to adequate cervical dilatation to successfully complete the OH and EMB with lower&#xD;
      incidence of associated complications (abdominal cramping, vaginal bleeding, and nausea).&#xD;
      Moreover, it is important to note that the standard operating procedure of the fibroid and&#xD;
      endometriosis center has been the administration of 50 mcg misoprostol to patients undergoing&#xD;
      simultaneous OH and EMB. This practice that has been ongoing for over 12 months has provided&#xD;
      very favorable results. No other study has evaluated the efficacy of such a low dose and it&#xD;
      would be interesting to explore the minimal effective dose, which can be used for&#xD;
      simultaneous OH and EMB to yield effective results in terms of lower pain scores and lower&#xD;
      incidence of associated complications. As mentioned previously, studies evaluating the role&#xD;
      of misoprostol in alleviating overall pain during OH and EMB had mixed reviews. But those&#xD;
      studies have been performed in the general population. It is important to note that there are&#xD;
      subgroups of women (previous cesarean section, nulliparous, postmenopausal, previous loop&#xD;
      surgery) who more often need dilatation of the cervix to facilitate passage of the&#xD;
      hysteroscope. Therefore, this trial will focus on these subgroups to assess whether the use&#xD;
      of prostaglandin analogue provides clinically significant reduction in pain, reduces the need&#xD;
      for dilatation and incidence of genital trauma and whether these benefits outweigh the&#xD;
      potential harms (bleeding, laceration, abdominal cramping, fever etc.)&#xD;
