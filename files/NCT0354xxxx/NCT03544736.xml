          -  Adequate organ function based on clinical examination and lab values as defined in the&#xD;
             below:&#xD;
&#xD;

        Creatinine ≤ 1,5 upper limit normal (ULN) OR measured/calculated GFR≥60 mL/min Albumin ≥ 30&#xD;
        g/L Total bilirubin ≤ 1,5 ULN ASAT and ALAT ≤ 2,5 ULN, or ≤ 5 ULN for subjects with liver&#xD;
        mets. International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1,5 ULN and Activated Partial Thromboplastin&#xD;
        Time (TT) ≤ 1,5 ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy. Such therapy (if&#xD;
        indicated) should be converted to adequate therapy with low-molecular weight heparin such&#xD;
        as Dalteparin before chemotherapy or treatment with IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             the start of study drug (screening phase). Women must not be breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP should use highly effective adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30&#xD;
             days plus the time required for Nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last&#xD;
             dose of investigational drug. Adequate methods are described in Appendix I.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for&#xD;
