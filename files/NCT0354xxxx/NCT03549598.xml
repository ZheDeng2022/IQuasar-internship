    <textblock>
      The Researchers are trying to determine if 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging will have a similar&#xD;
      accuracy as 18FDG PET/CT in diagnosing cardiac sarcoidosis and if it will be able to do so&#xD;
      without the need for complex patient dietary preparation that is required with 18FDG PET/CT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective study of 15 consecutive patients with suspected or newly diagnosed cardiac&#xD;
      sarcoidosis (CS) who are referred for a clinically indicated 18FDG (and 13NH3) PET/CT scan&#xD;
      for cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) will be approached to undergo a 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scan.&#xD;
      Comparison will then be made between the 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and the 18FDG and 13NH3 PET/CT&#xD;
      to determine if 68Ga-DOTATATE detects CS.&#xD;
