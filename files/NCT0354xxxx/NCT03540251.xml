      Patients and Methods A randomized controlled trial is conducted by comparing effectiveness of&#xD;
      sticking and massaging auricular points relieving hot flashes in women with breast cancer&#xD;
      versus placebo auricular points. A total of 92 women(still recuiting) with breast cancer, who&#xD;
      were under hormonal therapy were randomly assigned and the allocation ratio was 1:1. Both&#xD;
      groups received a booklet with information about self-care indications, auricular points and&#xD;
      its management, and patients can record their hot flash score each day for 12 weeks in the&#xD;
      booklets.In addition, both group received 8 treatment sessions of sticking and pressing&#xD;
      predefined auricular points or placebo auricular points treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was hot flash score(HFS)at the end of treatment (week 12), calculated as&#xD;
      the frequency multiplied by the average severity of hot flashes.The secondary outcomes were&#xD;
      climacteric symptoms and quality of life, measured by the Greene Climacteric Scale(GCS)and&#xD;
      Menopause Quality of Life scales(MenQoL)as well as serum estradiol(E2), follicle-stimulating&#xD;
      hormone(FSH) and beta-endorphin(β-EP).Expectation and satisfaction of treatment effect and&#xD;
      safety were also evaluated.&#xD;
