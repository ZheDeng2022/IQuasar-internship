  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scientific evidence has shown that, over the past two decades, the combination of cockroach&#xD;
      allergy and cockroach exposure is one of the most important factors contributing to the&#xD;
      dramatic increase in asthma morbidity seen in inner city children with asthma. Therefore, a&#xD;
      major goal of the Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC) is to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      cockroach immunotherapy in inner city asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine if the response to nasal allergen&#xD;
      challenge (NAC) will be changed with treatment with cockroach subcutaneous immunotherapy&#xD;
      (SCIT) treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Mean Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) After 12 Months of Assigned Subcutaneous Immunotherapy (SCIT) Therapy-by Treatment Group</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-treatment) to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>TNSS is a sum of the nasal symptom score for sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and nasal itching. Each symptom is scored on a scale from 0 to 3; the range of sums for TNSS is 0 to 12. The analysis will compare the mean TNSS Area Under the Curve (AUC) at the follow-up Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-treatment) to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) involves the direct application by trained clinical research staff of one or more defined doses of allergen onto the participant's nasal mucosa using a nasal drug delivery system.&#xD;
TNSS (0-12) is a participant rated score computed as the sum of four subscale scores (0-3) measuring nasal congestion and blockade, rhinorrhea, itching, and sneezing. Participants indicate a score on each subscale of 0, 1, 2, or 3, indicating none, mild, moderate, or severe symptoms, respectively. Higher scores indicate more severe nasal symptoms.</description>

    <description>Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) involves the direct application by trained clinical research staff of one or more defined doses of allergen onto the participant's nasal mucosa using a nasal drug delivery system.&#xD;
Responsive dose is defined by the dose of allergen that elicits the threshold response of a Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) ≥ 6 or a sneeze score ≥ 3 at the 12-month NAC by treatment group.</description>
