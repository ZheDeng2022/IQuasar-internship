      Vitiligo is a common depigmented skin disease characterized by destruction of functional&#xD;
      melanocyte.The recent therapies to vitiligo are including oral or external glucocorticoids,&#xD;
      antioxidants, calcineurin inhibitors or phototherapy. However, long treatment period and&#xD;
      unsatisfactory curative effects still exist, which confer long-term psychological burden to&#xD;
      patients. As above concerns, it is of great value to explore therapeutic methods that can&#xD;
      effectively control disease, improve appearance, relieve patients' pain and improve their&#xD;
      quality of life. Current problem is the lack of a vitiligo life quality evaluation scale with&#xD;
      Chinese characteristics for us. Therefore, it is necessary for the investigator to compile a&#xD;
      vitiligo quality of life scale that is simple, feasible and applicable to China's national&#xD;
      conditions. Meanwhile the reliability analysis must be carried out to bring better quality of&#xD;
      life assessment tools to patients with vitiligo in China. Previous studies recommended that&#xD;
      CapulinTM showing a good cover effect on vitiligo, but the effects of camouflage on the QoL&#xD;
      of patients with vitiligo in Chinese population is unknown. Thus, the investigators undergo a&#xD;
      randomized open-label controlled study to estimate the effects of CapulinTM on QoL of&#xD;
      patients with vitiligo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a common depigmented skin disease characterized by destruction of functional&#xD;
      melanocyte. The global incidence is about 0.5-2.0% and prevalence be about 0.8-1.5% in China.&#xD;
      Studies showed that almost half of vitiligo patients had developed depigmentation before 20&#xD;
      years old. Lesions involving exposed skin such as face, hand or mucous always make patients&#xD;
      feeling embarrassment, so the impaired quality of life (QoL) have greater impact on patients&#xD;
      with vitiligo than the disease itself. Besides, Vitiligo is also a psychosomatic disease as&#xD;
      its cause stress or depression which can induce dysfunction of endocrine system or immune&#xD;
      system in patients, finally resulted in poor curative effects and relapse of the disease&#xD;
      which further aggravates stress and depression in patients. Furthermore, traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine suggested that uneasiness would be a cause of vitiligo as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is of great value to explore therapeutic methods that can effectively control disease,&#xD;
      improve appearance, relieve patients' pain and improve their quality of life. Dermatologists&#xD;
      of Japan and European suggested that camouflage would be a proper way to improve patients'&#xD;
      appearance and it should be an effective supplement to the treatments of vitiligo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the transformation of the medical model from a simple biomedical model to a&#xD;
      bio-psychological-social medical model, observing changes of lesion in vitiligo may not fully&#xD;
      reflect the impact of vitiligo on patients. Therefore, it is necessary to develop some&#xD;
      evaluation methods to reflect the impact of vitiligo in patients. Among the various&#xD;
      measurement tools, universality scales have a wide range of measurement and can be applied to&#xD;
      different groups of people to understand the general health status of the general population.&#xD;
      But there are some limitations due to the unspecifically designed for a disease group. When&#xD;
      the universal scale is applied to a specific disease, it does not have specificity. Some&#xD;
      clinically significant information on quality of life may be omitted, and the QOL cannot be&#xD;
      sensitively reflected. The scales in the dermatology area were developed for patients with&#xD;
      dermatological diseases and reflect the differences between skin diseases and other system&#xD;
      diseases. However, the specificity and sensitivity of specific diseases are still not strong&#xD;
      enough.The problem is the lack of a vitiligo life quality evaluation scale with Chinese&#xD;
      characteristics for us. Therefore, it is necessary for the investigator to compile a vitiligo&#xD;
      quality of life scale that is simple, feasible and applicable to China's national conditions.&#xD;
      Meanwhile the reliability analysis must be carried out to bring better quality of life&#xD;
      assessment tools to patients with vitiligo in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Camouflage is an emerging solution to improve patients' appearance which showing a great&#xD;
      potential in treatment of vitiligo. Diagnosis and treatment of vitiligo consensus (2014&#xD;
      edition) made by the dermatological department of the Chinese medical association also&#xD;
      suggest that camouflage can be used on exposed skin such as face, neck, hands or feet.The&#xD;
      first commercial camouflage agent in China is CapulinTM by 2004, Its formula contains natural&#xD;
      plant extracts, moisturizers, emollients and natural pigments. The regimented mechanism is to&#xD;
      combine the camouflage with the free protein on the cuticle and finally format the mimic&#xD;
      human natural melanin, which is extremely similar to normal skin tone. Previous studies&#xD;
      recommended that CapulinTM showing a good cover effect on vitiligo, but the effects of&#xD;
      camouflage on the QoL of patients with vitiligo in Chinese population is unknown. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigators undergo a randomized open-label controlled study to estimate the effects of&#xD;
      CapulinTM on QoL of patients with vitiligo.&#xD;
