    <measure>Percent of Subjects With Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale 4-point Responder at Week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>During the study, Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) assessments were reported by the subject via eDiary once daily from screening/mid-screening visit through the follow-up visit. The Itch NRS is a validated, self-reported, instrument for measurement of itch intensity and subjects were asked to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable); higher scores indicated greater itch intensity. Subjects were considered responders if they had at least a 4-point reduction from baseline in weekly average WI-NRS at Week 10.</description>

    <time_frame>At Weeks 2, 4, and 10</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA PN-A is an instrument used to assess the overall activity of PN lesions at a given time point, as determined by the investigator. It consists of a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). Higher scores indicate severe prurigo nodularis.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) to Week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a dermatology specific quality of life (QoL) instrument designed to assess the impact of the skin disease on a subject's QoL over the prior week. It is a ten item questionnaire that assesses overall QoL and six aspects that may affect QoL (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment). The DLQI questions are rated by the subject as 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). Scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating poor QoL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in DLQI Question 1 to Week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is a dermatology specific QoL instrument designed to assess the impact of the skin disease on a subject's QoL over the prior week. It is a ten item questionnaire that assesses overall QoL and six aspects that may affect QoL (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment) The DLQI question 1 is to measure how itchy, sore, painful or stinging the subject's skin had been. It is rated by the subject as 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). Scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating poor QoL.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>35 days (+3 days) after Week 10 or Early Treatment Discontinuation</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded from the first study drug administration through the follow-up visit. Severity of all AEs were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03. During the period between informed consent and first study drug dose, only SAEs caused by a protocol-mandated intervention were collected.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 49 sites in United States from 02 May 2018 to 14 February 2020. All subjects who met the study entry criteria were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive once-daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg or placebo for 10 weeks.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>During the screening period (2-4 weeks), all subjects were evaluated for eligibility and assessed for conditions associated with chronic pruritus. Subjects were to complete an electronic diary (eDiary) during screening visit.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percent of Subjects With Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale 4-point Responder at Week 10</title>
        <description>During the study, Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) assessments were reported by the subject via eDiary once daily from screening/mid-screening visit through the follow-up visit. The Itch NRS is a validated, self-reported, instrument for measurement of itch intensity and subjects were asked to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable); higher scores indicated greater itch intensity. Subjects were considered responders if they had at least a 4-point reduction from baseline in weekly average WI-NRS at Week 10.</description>

        <description>During the study, WI-NRS assessments were reported by the subject via eDiary once daily from screening/mid-screening visit through the follow-up visit. The Itch NRS is a validated, self-reported, instrument for measurement of itch intensity and subjects were asked to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable); higher scores indicated greater itch intensity. For the 3-point responder rate, subjects were considered responders if they had at least a 3-point reduction between baseline and the corresponding week.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) to Week 10</title>
        <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a dermatology specific quality of life (QoL) instrument designed to assess the impact of the skin disease on a subject's QoL over the prior week. It is a ten item questionnaire that assesses overall QoL and six aspects that may affect QoL (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment). The DLQI questions are rated by the subject as 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). Scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating poor QoL.</description>

      <desc>Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded from the first study drug administration through the follow-up visit. Severity of all AEs were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03. During the period between informed consent and first study drug dose, only SAEs caused by a protocol-mandated intervention were collected.</desc>
