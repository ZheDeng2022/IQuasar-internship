  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All persons with type 1 diabetes are at risk for developing hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).&#xD;
      This is a life-threatening condition that leads to profound fear of hypoglycemia and reduced&#xD;
      quality of life. Fear of hypoglycemia results in glucose fluctuations (from high to low&#xD;
      glucose levels). Young adults are particularly at risk because they report high levels of&#xD;
      fear of hypoglycemia and poor glucose control. Currently, no diabetes self-management&#xD;
      programs specifically address how to cope with fear of hypoglycemia. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to pilot test a fear reduction intervention (Fear Reduction Efficacy Evaluation&#xD;
      [FREE]) and its effects on fear of hypoglycemia, diabetes self-management, glucose control,&#xD;
      and glucose variability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In persons with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), hypoglycemia is the major limiting factor in&#xD;
      achieving optimal blood glycemic control. All persons with T1DM are at risk for hypoglycemia&#xD;
      (blood glucose level &lt; 70 mg/dl), which is life-threatening and accompanied by serious&#xD;
      physical and psychological symptoms, resulting in a profound fear of hypoglycemia (FOH) and&#xD;
      reduced quality of life. Young adults with T1DM are at greater risk for FOH and have worse&#xD;
      glycemic control and self-management behavior than other age groups with T1DM. The&#xD;
      investigator's preliminary research identified that 77% of young adults with T1DM reported&#xD;
      FOH, and FOH resulted in increased glycemic variability. Glycemic variability (GV) is the&#xD;
      minute-to-minute fluctuation in blood glucose that can be missed if looking only at A1C, a&#xD;
      longer-term measure. Increased GV is dangerous because it is associated with cardiovascular&#xD;
      events and diabetes complications. A major gap exists in how to manage FOH as a component of&#xD;
      diabetes self-management. The Investigators specifically aim to: (1) determine the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of a fear reduction program in young adults with T1DM, who&#xD;
      experience FOH; and (2) determine the impact of an 8-week cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      (CBT)-based intervention on the outcomes: FOH, self-management behavior, glycemic control,&#xD;
      and GV. To achieve these aims, the investigators propose a randomized controlled trial in 50&#xD;
      young adults aged 18 to 35 years with T1DM. At completion, FOH will be measured and glycemic&#xD;
      patterns will be analyzed to determine differences between the FREE and control groups.&#xD;
      Findings from this proposed pilot study will serve as the foundation for a larger clinical&#xD;
      trial to reduce FOH and improve self-management, glycemic control, and GV. This program of&#xD;
      research promises to reduce the development of diabetes complications and improve quality of&#xD;
      life for young adults with T1DM.&#xD;
