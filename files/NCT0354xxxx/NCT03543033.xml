  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized control trial will compare opioid use, pain, and functional outcomes&#xD;
      following decompression surgery for single-level lumbar radiculopathy in patients who undergo&#xD;
      placement of corticosteroid epidural injection within 2 weeks prior to surgery compared to&#xD;
      those who do not. The hypothesis of this study is that patients who receive the preoperative&#xD;
      corticosteroid injection will have less reduced postoperative opioid use, as well as earlier&#xD;
      mobilization, reduced length of stay, and faster return to work compared to control patients&#xD;
      who do not receive the injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control study that will be completed within the Department of&#xD;
      Neurosurgery at Lahey Hospital &amp; Medical Center. Patients will undergo their recommended&#xD;
      surgery to treat single-level lumbar radiculopathy. Patients who are randomized to and&#xD;
      consent to receiving a preoperative corticosteroid injection will report to clinic within 2&#xD;
      weeks prior to date of surgery to receive a corticosteroid injection. These subjects will&#xD;
      first receive a topical anesthesia to the skin and underlying tissue in a maximum amount of 5&#xD;
      ml of 1% Lidocaine. Following this application, an 18-20 gauge epidural needle will be used&#xD;
      to inject a solution containing 80 mg Depo-Medrol in 1 ml of 1% PF Lidocaine and 5ml of&#xD;
      sterile PF saline. To assure the injection is epidural, we will be using loss of resistance&#xD;
      technique under fluoroscopy and epidural placement will be confirmed with the live-image&#xD;
      instillation in the AP and lateral positions of dye, with pattern confirming epidermal needle&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will complete health outcome questionnaires (VAS, EQ-5D, ODI) at baseline&#xD;
      (treatment cohort: prior to injection, control cohort: prior to spine surgery), 1 week&#xD;
      post-op, 1 month post-op, and 3 months post-op. Patients will be instructed to bring all&#xD;
      condition-related pain medication containers to each follow-up for research measuring&#xD;
      purposes. Research personnel will record number of pills remaining in container, number of&#xD;
      opioid prescription refills, and respective dates. Opioid usage for each subject will be&#xD;
      tracked and converted to mg oral morphine equivalents using a standard table. Research&#xD;
      personnel will capture additional clinic information such as length of stay, length of time&#xD;
      before ambulation, and occurrence of any complications (i.e. DVT, infection). Opioid use,&#xD;
      muscle relaxants, and other pain medication use will be followed for 3 months. At baseline&#xD;
      and at each post-op follow up, patients will be asked to define their use of illicit drugs&#xD;
      over the past 6 months (heroin, cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine, other). Return to work&#xD;
      date and work status will be captured out to 3 months. Patients will submit a health-cost&#xD;
      diary at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months, and this data will be combined with hospital-based&#xD;
      cost information to generate a cost analysis. This diary will capture costs such as&#xD;
      medication costs, copayments, travel, etc. Additionally, all patient surgery cancelations as&#xD;
      well as reason for cancelation will be recorded. No additional medical testing will be&#xD;
      required by the patient.&#xD;

    <measure>Disability - Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week post-op, 1 month post-op, and 3 months post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) will be used to measure disability associated with their spinal condition. The ODI contains 10 questions; each with 6 choices and each answer choice ranges from 0 to 5 points. The minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 50; the higher the score, the greater the disability indicated. Each question is 5 points each and is summed then divided by total possible point. Scores from each cohort will be compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain - Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week post-op, 1 month post-op, and 3 months post-op</time_frame>
    <description>VAS will be used to measure pain and discomfort. The scale is a horizontal line numbered 0 through 10 with &quot;0&quot; indicating no pain, &quot;5&quot; indicating moderate pain, and 10 indicating worst pain. Patients will be instructed to mark an &quot;X&quot; on the number corresponding to their level of back pain over the past week. They will also be asked to indicate their leg pain on a similar, but separate scale. Scores from each cohort will be compared.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life - EuroQol-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week post-op, 1 month post-op, and 3 months post-op</time_frame>
    <description>EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) will be used to measure quality of life. The EQ-5D includes 5 multiple-choice questions with 3 choices each; each choice corresponding to a value of 1,2,or 3. Each value is entered into an algorithm that computes a score. The score can range from &quot;1&quot; = high quality of life&quot; and &quot;0&quot; = poor quality of life. Scores will be compared between both cohorts.</description>
