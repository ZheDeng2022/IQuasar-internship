  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic HSCT is potentially curative for numerous high risk hematologic malignancies and&#xD;
      offers several advantages over traditional chemotherapy. First, higher doses of cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy and/or irradiation can be given since patients are subsequently rescued from the&#xD;
      severe myelosuppression induced by the pre-transplant conditioning regimen by the infusion of&#xD;
      healthy hematopoietic stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second and perhaps more importantly, mature T cells contained in the graft are able to mount&#xD;
      immune responses against residual cancer cells surviving the conditioning regimen due to&#xD;
      major and/or minor MHC disparities between the donor and recipient. Unfortunately, the&#xD;
      allo-immune responses driving the GVL effect are typically not specific for malignant cells.&#xD;
      As a consequence, donor immune cells attack normal host tissues resulting in a process known&#xD;
      as acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Acute GVHD is primarily T cell driven, usually&#xD;
      occurs within the first few months after transplant, and results in skin rash, diarrhea,&#xD;
      cholestatic liver damage, and, on occasion, acute lung injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current proposal explores the use of a novel imaging modality, FLT PET/MRI, to correlate&#xD;
      allogeneic transplant outcomes with FLT and MRI findings during early stem cell engraftment&#xD;
      and at a later time point following stable count recovery. Specifically, this study will&#xD;
      determine if the strength of the early FLT signal within the bone marrow correlates with&#xD;
      engraftment success and if isolated areas of cellular proliferation within the marrow at a&#xD;
      later time point might predict for leukemia relapse. In addition, based on the important role&#xD;
      that host lymphoid tissues are known to play in GVHD pathogenesis in mice, this study will&#xD;
      determine if the FLT signal within host SLT after transplant can predict for the development&#xD;
      of GVHD in human BMT patients. Because FLT imaging by itself cannot distinguish between bone&#xD;
      marrow engraftment/proliferation and the allo-immune driven T cell expansion that ultimately&#xD;
      results in GVHD, this study will image autologous transplant patients as a comparator arm.&#xD;
      Autologous HSCT like allogeneic transplantation involves the administration of very high&#xD;
      doses of chemotherapy to high risk cancer patients in order to achieve better tumor kill.&#xD;
      However, in this situation patients are administered their own cryopreserved stem cells to&#xD;
      reconstitute the ablated hematopoietic system. Under those circumstances there is no&#xD;
      allo-immune reactivity to drive T cell activation and expansion after transplant, and as a&#xD;
      result there is no GVHD in the autologous transplant setting. Thus, these patients will help&#xD;
      us to elucidate how much of the FLT signal seen in the allogeneic setting is the result of&#xD;
      allo-immune driven T cell expansion.&#xD;
