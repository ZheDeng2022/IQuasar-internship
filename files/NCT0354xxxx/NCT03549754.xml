      The registry intends to provide real world data on patient management and quality of care for&#xD;
      patients with T2DM, heat failure and chronic kidney disease in clinical practice in many&#xD;
      countries. To bridge this gap an observational voluntary registry is set up to capture real&#xD;
      world data on patient characteristics, disease management, healthcare utilization, and&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes, Heart Failure and Chronic Kidney Disease.&#xD;
      Multinational, observational registry utilizing a cloud-based eCRF, for prospective and&#xD;
      retrospective data collection, accessible to investigators and Scientific Committee. This&#xD;
      registry will be open to all physicians managing T2DM, HF or CKD across the world.&#xD;
