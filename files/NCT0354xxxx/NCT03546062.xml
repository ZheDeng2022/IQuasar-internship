      Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) is defined by the presence of left ventricular&#xD;
      systolic dysfunction in the absence of an abnormal loading condition or significant coronary&#xD;
      artery disease. IDC is the main cause of end-stage heart failure (HF) and is responsible for&#xD;
      half of all heart transplants (HTx). Endocrine disorders, including diabetes, are known to be&#xD;
      associated with IDC. Diabetes mellitus (DM), which is present in 75% of patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic IDC, is an independent risk factor for the development of heart failure and death&#xD;
      in IDC. Therefore, DM can exacerbate the need for HTx, in addition, diabetic patients are&#xD;
      less suitable for HTx and DM remains an independent risk factor for death even after HTx.&#xD;
      Recent studies have revealed the presence of diabetic cardiomyopathy, a condition of&#xD;
      myocardial dysfunction without coronary artery disease. This term was introduced for the&#xD;
      first time by Rubler et al. in 1972 which highlighted patients with diabetes and congestive&#xD;
      heart failure with normal coronary arteries. The pathophysiological mechanisms through which&#xD;
      diabetes affects the development and progression of diabetic heart disease are not known.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of our study will be to evaluate, in the explanted diabetic heart, the&#xD;
      presence of possible cellular alterations attributable to the diabetic disease. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the progression of these lesions in the transplanted heart in diabetic patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Heart failure (HF) is an increasing disease, with a prevalence and incidence of&#xD;
      about 1% and 0.15% of the general population respectively, affecting at least 300,000&#xD;
      patients in the USA. However, in cases of advanced heart failure, refractory to maximal&#xD;
      medical therapy, and to devices supporting the heart rhythm and cardio-circulatory function,&#xD;
      the only valid therapeutic option remains the cardiac transplant. Diabetic patients with&#xD;
      advanced heart failure seem to benefit from this therapy not differently as compared to&#xD;
      non-diabetics. On other hand, in patients with advanced heart failure and selected for heart&#xD;
      transplantation, the diabetes may condition a different degree of structural and molecular&#xD;
      pathology that is not present, or present at least in a different way in non-diabetics&#xD;
      selected for same HF etiology, clinical features, and HF stage. Therefore, in this study&#xD;
      authors will study the anatomical-pathological, cellular, and molecular characteristics, as&#xD;
      the pathways of inflammatory, oxidative, apoptotic and epigenetic expression in diabetics vs.&#xD;
      non diabetics affected by idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) and therefore in the&#xD;
      absence of ischemic heart disease, and referred to Heart Center for cardiac transplantation.&#xD;
      Authors' study hypothesis is that diabetes can condition a different degree of structural,&#xD;
      cellular, and molecular pathology in patients with IDCM Vs. non-diabetic patients, due to&#xD;
      excessive metabolic activity, with increased synthesis and release of inflammatory,&#xD;
      oxidative, and apoptotic molecules. These investigations will be focused on microscopic,&#xD;
      histological and functional analysis of the cellular metabolism of cardiac tissue extracted&#xD;
      from diabetics vs. non diabetics IDCM patients, and removed during cardiac transplantation.&#xD;
      However, in a subsequent ex vivo phase authors will evaluate cellular, molecular,&#xD;
      inflammatory and epigenetic effectors related to the different microscopic tissue pattern&#xD;
      obtained from myocardial tissue samples. From authors' investigations, these new identified&#xD;
      targets of the HF molecular and cellular processes in diabetics vs. non diabetics, may be&#xD;
      used in the future as specific therapeutic targets to improve clinical outcomes in IDCM&#xD;
      diabetics with advanced heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS Study population Authors will enroll a population of IDCM diabetics and&#xD;
      non diabetics selected to receive a heart transplant. This study will be conducted at the&#xD;
      Department of Medical Sciences, at the Department of Cardiac Surgery, and at the Department&#xD;
      of Biochemistry of the University of Campania &quot;Luigi Vanvitelli&quot;. Selection, randomization&#xD;
      and enrollment of patients will be carried out at the Department of Medical Sciences,&#xD;
      followed by clinical follow up; Cardiac transplantation and cardiac tissue sampling will be&#xD;
      performed at the Cardiosurgery Department; Molecular and cellular studies will be conducted&#xD;
      at the biochemistry department. The follow-up will be 12 months. The diabetic pathology will&#xD;
      be diagnosed according to the international guidelines of the American Heart Association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: patients aged &gt; 18, &lt;75 years, with indication to receive a heart&#xD;
      transplant (survival score for accepted heart failure accepted (HFSS) at high risk, peak VO2&#xD;
      &lt;10 ml / kg / min after reaching the anaerobic threshold; arrhythmias recurrent symptomatic&#xD;
      ventricles refractory to medical treatment, ICD and surgical), affected by IDCM with heart&#xD;
      failure in NYHA class III / IV refractory to maximal medical therapy; diabetic and&#xD;
      non-diabetic patients Exclusion criteria: contraindication to receiving cardiac&#xD;
      transplantation; non-idiopathic dilated cardiopathy (valvulopathies, ischemic-infarct&#xD;
      cardiopathy, etc.), acute myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, neoplastic disease, and&#xD;
      chronic diseases that may influence the inflammatory profile both systemic and cardiac&#xD;
      (cancer, chronic intestinal inflammation, hepatitis, AIDS) , and a life expectancy &lt;6 months.&#xD;
      All patients will be included in the study after signing informed consent to participate in&#xD;
      the study. Routine analysis will be performed upon enrollment in the study, before cardiac&#xD;
      transplantation and follow-up. During the follow-up (figure 1) clinical examinations, routine&#xD;
      ecg and echocardiography will be performed regularly. Molecular study and cell study will be&#xD;
      performed on myocardial tissue from explanted hearts. The study will be performed according&#xD;
      to the Helsinki declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention In this observational study, authors will evaluate a cohort of consecutive&#xD;
      patients (diabetic vs. non-diabetic) affected by IDCM and heart failure in class III / IV&#xD;
      NYHA refractory to maximal medical therapy and treated at the Division of Cardiac Surgery of&#xD;
      the University of Campania &quot;Luigi Vanvitelli &quot;by cardiac transplantation. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in three different parts: human study, ex vivo cell study, molecular study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human study: conducted in the Department of Medical Sciences and Cardiac Surgery, the&#xD;
      enrolled patient will be treated by heart transplant, according to the international&#xD;
      guidelines governing cardiac transplantation. After cardiac transplantation, a biopsy of&#xD;
      myocardial tissue of the removed heart will be performed. The intervention will be conducted&#xD;
      at the Cardiosurgery Division of the &quot;Luigi Vanvitelli&quot; University of Campania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac tissue analysis A portion of muscle tissue (50 grams) will be removed from the&#xD;
      explanted heart, from which 3 portions will be obtained: a portion will be incorporated in&#xD;
      the OCT compound and frozen in liquid nitrogen for immunohistochemical analysis, a second&#xD;
      portion will be immediately frozen in nitrogen liquid and stored at -70 째 C for the isolation&#xD;
      of RNA, and a third portion will be weighed, cut into small pieces (2 mm3) and transferred to&#xD;
      a 12-well plate. Based on the weight of the tissue, serum-free DMEM (2 ml / g) will be added&#xD;
      to the well and incubated at 37 째 C in a mild-fluctuated CO2 incubator. At 3 hours, the&#xD;
      conditioned soils will be collected and centrifuged at 4 째 C for 10 minutes. The supernatants&#xD;
      from cultures of epiphonic and subcutaneous adipose tissue will be stored in aliquots at -70&#xD;
      째 C for the measurement of inflammation mediators released by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection will be carried out on the morning of surgery and during the follow-up&#xD;
      phases by peripheral venous blood taken in tubes without pyrogen with or without EDTA as&#xD;
      anticoagulant. For plasma, the EDTA tubes will be placed on melted ice, then centrifuged&#xD;
      within 20 minutes at 1500 g for 10 minutes at 4 째 C. The plasma will be stored in aliquots at&#xD;
      80 째 C for all ELISA tests. Serum glucose, lipid panels and inflammatory markers will be&#xD;
      analyzed in the University of Campania's Biochemistry Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory markers&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors will analyze the mediators of plasma and cardiac inflammation with ELISA (R &amp; D&#xD;
      systems) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. ELISA standard kit they&#xD;
      will be used for IL-6 measurements, and highly sensitive ELISA kits for TNF-alpha and IL-1&#xD;
      measurements. Intra-assay variability will be set at 10%, while inter-assay variability will&#xD;
      be 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA analysis and Real-Time Reverse Transcription&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of myocardial tissue will be minced in a TriZol reagent (Invitrogen) and homogenized&#xD;
      completely on ice. The total RNA will be extracted from the chloroform and purified twice&#xD;
      through the mini RNAasy columns. After the DNase treatment on a column, the RNA will be&#xD;
      eluted with RNase-free water. Transcripts encoding various inflammatory mediators will be&#xD;
      measured by the TaqMan real-time reverse-polymerase-RT (PCR) chain reaction with the TaqMan&#xD;
      Gold RT-PCR and the PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). PCR primers&#xD;
      and TaqMan probes will be obtained from Applied Biosystems and optimized according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's protocol. The PCR reaction conditions will be at 48 째 C for 30 minutes, at 95&#xD;
      째 C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95 째 C for 15 seconds and 60 째 C for 1 minute.&#xD;
      The GAPDH transcripts will be amplified in a separate tube to normalize the variance in the&#xD;
      input RNA. The mRNA in various samples will be estimated by the relative standard method with&#xD;
      a series of dilutions of RNA from human vascular cells or from leukocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemistry The authors will obtain frozen sections (10 m), which will be air-dried&#xD;
      for 15 minutes and immersed in xylene for 10 minutes to remove the fat. The sections will&#xD;
      then be hydrated in decreasing degrees of alcohol and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The&#xD;
      selected serial sections will be immunosimochemical with the Universal Elite ABC (Vector&#xD;
      Laboratories) kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the sections will be&#xD;
      incubated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 minutes, followed by a block with horse serum or&#xD;
      5% goat. After washing in PBS, the sections will be incubated with primary antibodies for 1&#xD;
      hour in a wet chamber. Subsequently, the slides will be incubated with secondary antibodies&#xD;
      for 30 minutes followed by avidin-biotin for 30 minutes. The sections will then be exposed to&#xD;
      DAB and counterstained with hematoxylin. The following antibodies will be used: CD3&#xD;
      (Tlymphocyte, 1:50, Novocastra), CD68 (monocytes / macrophages, 1: 100, Dako) and triptases&#xD;
      (mast cells, 1:50, Novocastra).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up After being discharged from the hospital, all patients will be required to carry&#xD;
      out control visits, as indicated by the authors on the management of patients post-transplant&#xD;
      cardiac, at the Division of Cardiac Surgery of the University of Campania &quot;Luigi Vanvitelli&#xD;
      &quot;and the sixth division of Internal Medicine of the University of Campania&quot; Luigi Vanvitelli&#xD;
      &quot;. All patients will be monitored for 12 months after follow-up, by clinical evaluation (ECG,&#xD;
      stress test, echocardiogram) to maintain HbA1c levels &lt;7%, fasting glycemia between 90 and&#xD;
      140 mg / dl and post-prandial glycemia &lt;180 mg / dl, as indicated in the guidelines for the&#xD;
      management of diabetic and post-CABG patients. In the 12 months of follow-up, patient&#xD;
      management will be conducted by telephone interview, physical examination (at discharge and&#xD;
      3, 6 and 12 after cardiac transplantation), ecg and echocardiography (at discharge and 3, 6&#xD;
      and 12 after cardiac transplantation); CMRI will be conducted at baseline and 12 months after&#xD;
      CABG. Similarly, the bio-humoral evaluation will be conducted during all the follow-up&#xD;
      phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The study population groups (diabetics vs. non-diabetics) will be&#xD;
      compared using the Pearson test for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for&#xD;
      continuous variables. Candidates for admission to the multivariate model will be identified&#xD;
      by focusing on factors that will differ significantly (P value &lt;0.05) in the univariate&#xD;
      analysis between diabetics vs. non-diabetics. Cox regression will be used to construct the&#xD;
      predictive model of mortality. The risk ratio for mortality will be adjusted for age, BMI,&#xD;
      cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides and aspirin, ticlopidine, anti-aggregating agents,&#xD;
      beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors or sartans, antidiabetic drugs, statins, etc. present at the&#xD;
      time of hospitalization for cardiac transplantation. Analysis of survival after cardiac&#xD;
      transplantation will be performed using the Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression method.&#xD;
      Mortality curves will be obtained separately for diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic&#xD;
      patients, and then compared using the log-rank test. All tests will be considered significant&#xD;
      if with a value of p &lt;0.05. All analyzes will be conducted in 2 populations: diabetic vs&#xD;
      non-diabetic patients after cardiac transplantation. For all analyzes the SPSS program will&#xD;
      be used (version 21, IBM SPSS).&#xD;
