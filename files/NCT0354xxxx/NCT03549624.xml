  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to handle patients with the need for an acute laparotomy&#xD;
      according to a standardised perioperative protocol and to document the measurement as they&#xD;
      are performed (i.e. adherence to the protocol) and to measure the outcome with regard to both&#xD;
      short- (30 days) and long-term (3 and 12 months) mortality. Several secondary endpoints will&#xD;
      be measured, such as: hospital stay, length of stay at an Intensive Care Unit (ICU),&#xD;
      readmission to ICU and surgical complications according to the Clavien-Dindo score. These&#xD;
      results will then be compared to published rates of mortality from the literature and to&#xD;
      similar outcomes for a cohort of all patients operated at NÄL on the same indication the&#xD;
      years prior to the project/study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      200-250 acute laparotomies are performed annually at NÄL. The operations are performed for a&#xD;
      number of reasons, where operation due to ileus; with- or without bowel strangulation;&#xD;
      operation for acute peritonitis due to different kinds of stomach- or bowel perforation and&#xD;
      re-operations for complications to elective surgery are the most common. A common trait for&#xD;
      all these patients is that they are all susceptible to negative effect on organ functions on&#xD;
      virtually all organ systems due to the underlying condition/disease for which they are being&#xD;
      operated. This impact on organ functions include negative effects on circulation&#xD;
      (cardiovascular system), respiration, renal function, hepatic function, coagulation and&#xD;
      central nervous system. Sepsis is common and causes/contributes to the impaired organ&#xD;
      functions. Multi Organ Failure (MOF) is sometimes present both pre- and postoperatively.&#xD;
      Hence these patients are critically ill, and the outcome with regard to morbidity is severe&#xD;
      and mortality rates are high with numbers between 14% to 90% in different populations with&#xD;
      different age and comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard care for these patients in a Swedish setting is a rapid anesthesiological assessment&#xD;
      of the patient, preoperative resuscitation - if deemed necessary - followed by surgical&#xD;
      intervention. Postoperative care and monitoring dependent on local facilities/routines and&#xD;
      individual assessment of the patient and the patients postoperative needs by the surgeon and&#xD;
      anaesthetist together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies from the United Kingdom indicate that at more standardised protocol with&#xD;
      emphasis on six different measures have the possibility to improve postoperative outcome with&#xD;
      regard to short term (30 days) mortality. The measures at hand are not new nor untried but&#xD;
      the combination of measures including the shortened time to surgery are shown to be&#xD;
      beneficial for the patients. The measures are: 1. early so called NEWS-monitoring (measuring&#xD;
      of standard physiological parameters); 2. Early start of antibiotics; 3. Rapid (within 6&#xD;
      hours) start of operation; 4. Goal-directed fluid therapy; 5. Intensified post-operative&#xD;
      monitoring; 6. The presence of both surgical and anesthesiological specialists in the early&#xD;
      care of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This kind of standardised perioperative protocols has not yet been implemented in Swedish&#xD;
      health-care.&#xD;
