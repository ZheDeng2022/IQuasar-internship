  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of treatment with radiation therapy is to deliver as high of a dose as possible to&#xD;
      the target (tumor), while minimizing the dose to the normal tissues where late-side effects&#xD;
      can drastically affect patient quality of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation will be delivered twice per week for 5 fractions (42.5 Gy cohort, low-risk) or&#xD;
      daily for 16 fractions (58.08 Gy cohort, moderate-risk).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-risk is defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Planning target volume (PTV) less than 10 cc, AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No reported smoking within 1 month from registration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderate-risk is defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Planning target volume (PTV) greater than or equal to 10 cc, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking within 1 month from registration (no more than 1 pack per day)&#xD;
