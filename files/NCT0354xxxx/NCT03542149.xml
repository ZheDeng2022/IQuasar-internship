      A single-centre Phase 1b study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile,&#xD;
      and antimalarial activity of single doses of coadministered artefenomel (OZ439) and&#xD;
      piperaquine phosphate (PQP) against early Plasmodium falciparum blood stage infection in&#xD;
      healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, open-label, adaptive, study using the P. falciparum induced blood&#xD;
      stage malaria (IBSM) inoculum as a model to characterise the pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of&#xD;
      combined single dose administration of OZ439 and PQP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in a maximum of three cohorts (up to 8 subjects per cohort) using&#xD;
      up to 4 different doses of OZ439 and PQP in each cohort. Subjects will be malaria naïve&#xD;
      healthy males or females, aged between 18-55 years old, who meet all of the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first cohort will be composed of 4 groups of 2 subjects each. Subjects will be randomised&#xD;
      into one of 4 dose groups and administered single oral doses of OZ439 and PQP in combination&#xD;
      The combined dose of OZ439 and PQP will be different for each of the 4 groups in this cohort&#xD;
      as shown in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1 OZ439 and PQP Cohort 1 Dose Drug Dose group&#xD;
&#xD;
      1A 1B 1C 1D OZ439 (mg) 200 200 400 400 PQP (mg) 480 640 480 640&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data captured from this first cohort will be used to determine the relationship between&#xD;
      OZ439 and PQP concentrations and parasitaemia levels. Based on safety and tolerability data&#xD;
      up to Day 35 post-dose, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis outcomes (based&#xD;
      on PD data up to Day 35 and PK data up to Day 28 post-dose) of the drugs given in&#xD;
      combination, the dose(s) for the subsequent cohort will be determined. A similar analysis&#xD;
      will be done at the end of cohort 2 combining cohorts 1 and 2 data to decide the dose(s) to&#xD;
      be tested in cohort 3. This will be decided by the funding sponsor and the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator following review of the data by the Safety and Data Review Team (SDRT) and&#xD;
      scientific evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doses used in all cohorts will not exceed the maximum acceptable doses predefined for&#xD;
      this study (800 mg for OZ439 and 1440 mg for PQP) as determined in previous safety, pilot&#xD;
      efficacy and phase 2 studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be inoculated on Day 0 with approximately 2,800 viable parasites of P.&#xD;
      falciparum-infected human erythrocytes administered intravenously. Subjects will be followed&#xD;
      up daily via phone call or text message on Days 1 to 3 post-inoculation to solicit any AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then come to the clinical unit once daily from Day 4 until presence of asexual&#xD;
      parasites is established by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting the 18S&#xD;
      rRNA gene (referred to hereafter as malaria 18S qPCR). Once qPCR becomes positive and until&#xD;
      OZ439 and PQP administration, subjects will come to the clinical unit twice-daily, separated&#xD;
      by approximately 12 hours, for clinical evaluation and blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit for single dose administration of OZ439 and&#xD;
      PQP 8 days after malaria inoculation or at Investigators discretion (i.e. as per parasitaemia&#xD;
      levels). Subjects will be followed up as inpatients for at least 72 hours to ensure tolerance&#xD;
      of the investigational treatments and clinical response, then if clinically well on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis for safety and clearance of malaria parasites via qPCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge from the clinical unit, subjects will be followed up regularly for safety&#xD;
      assessments, PK sampling, clinical evaluation, and malaria qPCR blood sampling until 35 days&#xD;
      after OZ439 and PQP administration. All subjects will receive a standard course of therapy&#xD;
      with Riamet® (artemether-lumefantrine) 34 days after OZ439 and PQP administration, or earlier&#xD;
      in the event of failure of clearance of parasitaemia or recrudescence of parasitaemia. The&#xD;
      presence of gametocytes in subjects' blood will be determined by parasite lifecycle stage&#xD;
      qRT-PCR or by the presence of stable low level parasitaemia. If gametocytes are present at&#xD;
      the time of treatment with Riamet®, Primacin™ (primaquine) will also be administered as a&#xD;
      single oral dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AEs (AEs) will be monitored via telephone, within the clinical unit, and on outpatient review&#xD;
      after malaria challenge inoculation and antimalarial study drugs administration. Blood&#xD;
      samples for safety evaluation, malaria monitoring, and red blood cell antibodies will be&#xD;
      drawn at screening and/or baseline and at nominated times after malaria challenge.&#xD;

             Abstinent male subjects must agree to start a double-barrier method if they begin&#xD;
             sexual relationships during the study and up to 90 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Male subjects with female partners that are surgically sterile, or male subjects who&#xD;

             illness, history of suicide attempt, or confinement for danger to self or others.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of serious psychiatric condition that may affect participation in the study or&#xD;
             preclude compliance with the protocol, including but not limited to past or present&#xD;

             episode of major depression during the 5 years preceding screening.The Beck Depression&#xD;
             Inventory (Appendix 4) will be used as an objective tool for the assessment of&#xD;
             depression at screening. In addition to the conditions listed above, subjects with a&#xD;
             score of 20 or more on the Beck Depression Inventory and/or a response of 1, 2 or 3&#xD;
             for item 9 of this inventory (related to suicidal ideation) will not be eligible for&#xD;
             participation. These subjects will be referred to a general practitioner or medical&#xD;
             specialist as appropriate. Subjects with a Beck score of 17 to 19 may be enrolled at&#xD;
             the discretion of the Investigator if they do not have a history of the psychiatric&#xD;
             conditions mentioned in this criterion and their mental state is not considered to&#xD;
             pose additional risk to the health of the subject or to the execution of the study and&#xD;
