             ligation) confirmed by medical history or menopause (ie, no menstrual bleeding for&#xD;

             be using a highly effective method of contraception from the time of Screening until 6&#xD;
             months following the last dose of Oraxol. Note: Highly effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception that result in a low failure rate (ie, &lt;1% per year) when used&#xD;
             consistently and correctly include combined (estrogen and progestogen containing)&#xD;
             hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or&#xD;
             transdermal), progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of&#xD;
             ovulation (oral, injectable, or implantable), intrauterine device, intrauterine&#xD;
             hormone-releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner, or sexual&#xD;
             abstinence. True abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
             the subject, is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining&#xD;
             from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of study participation and for&#xD;
             6 months post-Oraxol administration. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be&#xD;
             evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and&#xD;
             usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
             symptothermal, and post-ovulation method) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;

             P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate within 24 hours prior to treatment administration&#xD;

             reaction to Cremophor® or history of hypersensitivity-type reaction to polysorbate 80&#xD;
             or other components of the formulation of Oraxol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical (including bone marrow suppressive diseases) or&#xD;
             psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated&#xD;
             with study participation, impede the ability of the subject to complete all&#xD;
             protocol-specified activities, or may interfere with the interpretation of study&#xD;
             results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the subject inappropriate&#xD;
