  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate levels of circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA), circulating tumor&#xD;
      DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTC) and immunological changes after self-expanding&#xD;
      metal stent (SEMS) placement for malignant obstruction in the colon, and interpret these&#xD;
      levels in relation to overall- and disease-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, we intend to study the opportunity to identify patients with a higher risk of&#xD;
      recurrence due to the SEMS placement by monitoring cfDNA and ctDNA-levels, as it may be a&#xD;
      potential biomarker to initiate or optimize chemotherapy and thereby ensure a better&#xD;
      prognosis for the patients.&#xD;

      Study design This prospective study will include 20 patients undergoing SEMS placement as a&#xD;
      bridge to elective surgery at Koege- and Slagelse Hospital. Baseline blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected before the procedure. After the procedure blood samples will be collected 1, 4, 12&#xD;
      and 24 hours after SEMS placement. After elective surgery a tumor sample will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to SEMS placement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When potential candidates are admitted to the hospital they will be presented to the study by&#xD;
      the relevant surgeon. The investigators will be contacted, when the patient is admitted to&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
