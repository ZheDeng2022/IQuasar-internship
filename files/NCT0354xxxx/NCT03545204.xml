  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pakistan has a high neonatal mortality rate (55/1000 live birth)(1) and each year more than&#xD;
      200,000 newborns die. In rural Pakistan, more than 50% deliveries occur at home and majority&#xD;
      by unskilled birth attendants(2). The country has a high proportion of preterm births and&#xD;
      according to unpublished data it ranges between 15-20% of all live births. Prematurity is one&#xD;
      of the 3 main causes of neonatal deaths (14.1%)(3). While many interventions exist to save&#xD;
      the preterm newborns, KMC is considered as a simple, close to nature and cost-effective&#xD;
      intervention. There are evidence to suggest that KMC, compared to incubator care, lowers the&#xD;
      neonatal mortality by 51% for stable babies weighing &lt;2,000 g if started in the first week.&#xD;
      In this study; early, prolonged and continuous direct skin-to-skin contact is provided to&#xD;
      preterm newborn by the mother or another family member to provide warmth and to encourage&#xD;
      frequent and exclusive breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to evaluate the impact of a KMC Package on the uptake of KMC in the&#xD;
      community and its effect on neonatal mortality , exclusive breastfeeding rates , weight gain,&#xD;
      neurodevelopment outcomes. This will be a cluster randomized controlled trial to be&#xD;
      implemented in the rural union councils of District Dadu. The unit of randomization will be&#xD;
      union councils.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 450,000 infant deaths can be prevented each year with the universal&#xD;
      implementation of KMC at facility and community levels. The &quot;Every Newborn Action Plan&quot;&#xD;
      endorsed and launched by the World Health Assembly in May 2014 includes the goal of scaling&#xD;
      up KMC to 50% of babies weighing under 2000 grams by 2020, and to 75% of these babies by&#xD;
      2025(7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the availability of KMC as a cost-effective intervention its acceptance and uptake in&#xD;
      Pakistan has been negligible. A situation analysis carried out by WHO of 12 countries in Asia&#xD;
      and Africa to explore health system bottlenecks affecting the scale-up of KMC revealed&#xD;
      Pakistan to be far behind other countries(8).Community ownership and health financing&#xD;
      bottlenecks were significant challenges cited for majority of Asian countries in implementing&#xD;
      KMC. The important barriers to KMC implementation highlighted for Pakistan were health&#xD;
      financing, community births, lack of awareness of KMC at health care providers level,&#xD;
      presence of sociocultural barriers, experiential and lack of effective resources including&#xD;
      trained staff and absence of a National policy for implementation of KMC(8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the other socio-cultural factors identified at facility and community level included&#xD;
      specific garments that most women wear which does not facilitate KMC administration, lack of&#xD;
      support for KMC by elder members of the household. Facility bottlenecks that contributed to&#xD;
      reduced uptake of KMC were lack of space and privacy, shortage of staff, early discharges.&#xD;
      Majority of delivered women and babies were discharged within 6 to 12hours of childbirth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown KMC as an effective intervention for the baby and mother dyad.&#xD;
      However, majority of these studies are hospital based and require substantial investment in&#xD;
      human resources and health system infrastructure in the Low-and Middle-Income Countries&#xD;
      (LMIC). Currently, WHO recommends initiation of KMC in hospitals with continuation at home&#xD;
      after discharge. However, community-initiated KMC (cKMC) is not currently a part of WHO&#xD;
      because of lack of research into its effectiveness. For this reason, one of the top global&#xD;
      research priorities by WHO for 2015-2025 is to assess the efficacy of community-initiated&#xD;
      kangaroo mother care(9). Only a few studies have been conducted to address this question. One&#xD;
      such community-based randomized controlled trial in India reported that in babies with low&#xD;
      birthweight and no significant comorbidities, community-initiated kangaroo mother care&#xD;
      substantially improved survival compared with usual care. (10). The study also highlighted&#xD;
      the need for more implementation research studies in other low-income and middle-income&#xD;
      countries to assess the feasibility of delivering the intervention effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another RCT on community-based application of KMC in rural Bangladesh did not report any&#xD;
      difference in neonatal or infant mortality rates (11). Studies in Pakistan have been&#xD;
      conducted to assess and review the barriers and enablers for practicing KMC in rural&#xD;
      areas(12, 13) however, to the best of our knowledge no trial has been conducted to evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of cKMC on newborn survival in Pakistan, where a large proportion of deliveries&#xD;
      still take place at home. Hence it is important to evaluate efficacy and barriers to&#xD;
      implementation of cKMC in a well-conducted community-based trial. We therefore propose to&#xD;
      implement community Kangaroo Mother care (cKMC) in our socio-cultural context and design&#xD;
      strategies to overcome system and community challenges. This proposed implementation trial&#xD;
      will take a deep dive to further explore socio-cultural barriers and develop a model that can&#xD;
      be implemented and scaled up in Pakistan. For this purpose, a cKMC package will be developed.&#xD;
      The cKMC Package will consist of strategies to overcome socio-cultural barriers for families&#xD;
      to practice KMC in a sustained manner in the community. The strategies include creation of&#xD;
      KMC champions within the communities, community mobilization to create awareness using&#xD;
      powerful IEC tools including video messages, and capacity building of health care providers&#xD;
      on KMC and essential newborn care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will carry out a cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a community&#xD;
      based &quot;KMC intervention package&quot; on neonatal mortality among the low birth weight infants.&#xD;
      The study will have 2 phases: a formative study, followed by community-based cluster&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (cRCT) in a rural district of Pakistan. The formative study&#xD;
      (manuscript under development) was done to develop a robust model of cKMC intervention&#xD;
      package that was acceptable to the community and would be easily scaled up in the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that implementation of KMC through a &quot;community based KMC Package&quot; at&#xD;
      community level will result in 30% decrease in neonatal mortality rates among low birthweight&#xD;
      infants at 28 days of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop, implement and evaluate a community Kangaroo Mother Care cKMC package in rural&#xD;
      district of Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the impact of cKMC on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Growth measured as weight gain at 14th, 28th, 59th, 120th, 180th, and 365th day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) and referral to hospital at&#xD;
           14th, 28th and 59th day of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusive breast feeding at 14th, 28th, 59th, 120th, 180t, and continued breast feeding&#xD;
           at 365th day of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurodevelopmental assessment in a subset of recruited LBW babies at 12 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve the objectives, we propose a community-based Cluster Randomized&#xD;
      Controlled Trial (cRCT). The study will be carried out in the selected Union councils (UC) of&#xD;
      the two Talukas of district Dadu (Taluka Johi and Khairpur Nathan Shah). The duration of&#xD;
      trial intervention would be for 2 years. A total of 18 union councils (9 UCs from each&#xD;
      Taluka) have been selected from the 62 union councils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A union council is the smallest administrative unit of a district. Nine UCs will be allocated&#xD;
      to the intervention clusters from 2 Talukas; remaining 9 union councils will serve as&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering Union Councils as a unit of randomization, a total of 9 union councils (clusters)&#xD;
      per arm is required to achieve 90% power and 5% level of significance in order to reduce 30%&#xD;
      neonatal mortality among LBW babies in intervention arm. (ANNEX 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Baseline survey will be conducted at pre-assessment phase in the two Talukas and its&#xD;
      selected union councils to capture baseline indicators. This will be a one-time activity. A&#xD;
      line listing process will be done to capture all households having at least one alive WRA&#xD;
      i.e. (mother and her alive offspring less than 1 year). This will be followed by a survey to&#xD;
      capture baseline indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline indicators are: prevalence of low birth weight babies, neonatal mortality, KMC&#xD;
      practices, skin-skin contact, breast feeding practices, immediate and essential newborn care&#xD;
      practices, special care of low birth weight babies provided by families and care seeking&#xD;
      behavior for newborns. This phase requires three months duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A restricted randomization scheme was used to assign allocation, based on population size of&#xD;
      each Union Council, live births, LHW coverage and neonatal mortality. The allocation of&#xD;
      intervention was based on clusters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria for participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mother or family consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stable small babies weighing between ≥1200-&lt;2500 grams born in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stable babies as those: tolerating oral feeds, absence of respiratory distress or any&#xD;
           danger signs and absence of congenital anomaly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newborn babies less than 1200 grams and baby ≥ 2500 will be excluded. Whereas, babies&#xD;
      presenting with danger signs (such as fast breathing, chest in-drawing, temperature &lt;35o C or&#xD;
      &gt;38o C, unable to take feed, cyanosis, no movement and convulsions) will be excluded and&#xD;
      referred to advance care facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention Package: KMC intervention Package The KMC package will include creation of&#xD;
      KMC Champions from within the community, social mobilization to create awareness and its&#xD;
      acceptance with families using powerful IEC tools such as docudrama, flip charts, pictorials&#xD;
      in local languages; engagement of community and community leaders, capacity building of&#xD;
      health care providers on Kangaroo mother care, essential newborn care ENC, policy dialogues&#xD;
      with stake holders in the public and private sectors and delivery of a &quot;KMC kit &quot; to the&#xD;
      pregnant female by the Implementation team&#xD;
&#xD;
      KMC Kit for Implementation of cKMC:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study implementation team will also provide KMC kit to the enrolled mothers comprising of&#xD;
      diapers, cap, socks, towel, soap and sanitary pads for mothers. This kit will ensure the&#xD;
      practice of KMC by families and will give confidence to mothers to practice KMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions implemented in the study will be the administration of KMC, defined as&#xD;
      prolong and continuous skin-to-skin contact of baby with mother or a replacing caregiver&#xD;
      along with exclusive breast feeding. KMC will be initiated in community (cKMC) within 48&#xD;
      hours after birth. Mothers and family members will be trained for KMC at home by study staff&#xD;
      (Implementation team). Participating mothers will be taught KMC by the implementation team&#xD;
      and will be advised to practice KMC until newborn is 28 days of age or as long as they are&#xD;
      comfortable doing it(14). A KMC training module has been developed in local language in&#xD;
      adherence with the WHO guidelines and findings of formative KMC for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, implementation team will also teach mothers and other family members to use KMC&#xD;
      calendars to record the time duration of KMC administration. Hours that they practice KMC&#xD;
      will assist us to evaluate dose related impact of KMC as well. This would be a daily/weekly&#xD;
      record for 4 weeks post-partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A supervisory team at the level of 2 Taluka comprising of study managers will oversee the&#xD;
      monitoring of KMC practices in the community. In case of any disruption in KMC practices&#xD;
      after enrollment, the household will be visited and troubleshooting done. Lost to follow-ups&#xD;
      will be tracked and reasons will be recorded.&#xD;
