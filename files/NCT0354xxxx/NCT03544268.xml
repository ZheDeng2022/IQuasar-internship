      Purpose: The primary objective of this single arm study is to compare the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of acoustic angiography with traditional b-mode ultrasound in the distinction of&#xD;
      malignant versus benign breast lesions. Secondary objectives include a comparison of area&#xD;
      under the curve (AUC) for acoustic angiography versus b-mode ultrasound, and comparison of&#xD;
      radiologist preference for the two imaging techniques for each of 3 lesion characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Sixty patients who are to have a clinical surgical breast biopsy based on&#xD;
      results from pre-study standard of care (SOC) imaging will be recruited from the UNC Breast&#xD;
      Clinic for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): This is a one arm single center study of patients with suspicious&#xD;
      breast lesions (BIRADS 4 or 5) from the UNC Breast Clinic that consent to undergo an acoustic&#xD;
      angiography in conjunction with b-mode ultrasound prior to their scheduled biopsy.&#xD;

      Increasing the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic imaging in patients at high risk for&#xD;
      breast cancer could provide substantial clinical benefit by improving diagnosis, preventing&#xD;
      over-treatment, and reducing healthcare costs. Acoustic angiography is a new type of contrast&#xD;
      enhanced ultrasound imaging which is specifically sensitive to microvascular structure and&#xD;
      density. It evaluates tumor micro-vasculature and may provide a powerful prognostic tool for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of breast cancer, and eventually for treatment evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>Acoustic angiography imaging involves a research high frequency ultrasound scanner and a prototype transducer as well as conventional b-mode ultrasound to guide the location of the imaging. The conventional ultrasound will be conducted just prior to the acoustic angiography for localization. The imaging also requires administration of Definity ultrasound contrast agent.&#xD;
Acoustic angiography imaging will be performed by trained medical personnel using mild compression to eliminate motion. Total imaging time is estimated to be less than 15 minutes.</description>

    <description>Baseline B-mode US will be performed to confirm the lesions being imaged (unless it is a subject with no lesions, then a basic B-mode US will be performed). Perflutren is a diagnostic drug that is intended to be used for contrast enhancement. The vial contains a clear, colorless, sterile, non-pyrogenic, hypertonic solution which is activated by mechanical agitation with Vialmix®.It will be dispensed in inactivated form to a study team member. The contrast agent will be activated just prior to administration (ideally to be used within 5 minutes of activation). Contrast agent Definity will be activated according to package insert instructions, including use of VialMix®, the device used to activate Definity. Administration will occur IV in coordination with staff trained specifically in contrast ultrasound imaging.The total imaging time is anticipated to be less than 30 minutes.</description>
