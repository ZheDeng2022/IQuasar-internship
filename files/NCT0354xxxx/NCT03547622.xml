  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing a randomized pilot feasibility study to evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of galantamine versus placebo on preventing relapse to opioid use following tapering from&#xD;
      methadone or buprenorphine maintenance (Medication Assisted Treatment, or MAT) among adults&#xD;
      with opioid use disorder, with additional behavioral therapy (web-based cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy) provided across all conditions to help individuals successfully transition from MAT&#xD;
      to a drug-free state.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized pilot study to examine the potential use of galantamine as an adjunct to&#xD;
      the standard buprenorphine or methadone taper in the context of behavioral support. Early&#xD;
      abstinence from opioids is associated with high relapse rates and there is a great need to&#xD;
      develop interventions that will prevent relapse to opioid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized pilot, 30 adults enrolled in the methadone or buprenorphine maintenance&#xD;
      programs at the APT Foundation and who have sought a medically supervised, voluntary taper&#xD;
      from these medications will be offered participation in a double-blind, placebo controlled,&#xD;
      randomized trial of galantamine as an adjunct to standard tapering procedures at this clinic&#xD;
      along with the combined approach utilizing concurrent behavior therapy. Primary outcomes will&#xD;
      be: (1) successful completion of taper (achieving a methadone/buprenorphine dose of 0), (2)&#xD;
      opioid withdrawal symptoms, and (3) opioid use, assessed by self-report and urine samples&#xD;
      during and up to 3 months after the end of opioid taper. The investigators will also closely&#xD;
      monitor patient comfort and safety (assessed by opioid withdrawal symptoms, adverse events,&#xD;
      with measures of stress, sleep and pain) as well as cognitive function (assessed by the&#xD;
      CANTAB).&#xD;
