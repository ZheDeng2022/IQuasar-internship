    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants with urothelial cancer (UC) previously treated with platinum-based and/or checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) will receive sacituzumab govitecan-hziy 10 mg/kg intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants with UC who are ineligible for platinum-based therapy and failed therapy with previous immune CPI therapy will receive sacituzumab govitecan-hziy 10 mg/kg intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Cohort 3: Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy + Pembrolizumab</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants who have had progression or recurrence of UC following a platinum-containing regimen in the metastatic setting, or progression or recurrence of UC within 12 months of completion of platinum-based therapy as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy will receive sacituzumab govitecan-hziy 10 mg/kg intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle and pembrolizumab at the standard approved dose (200 mg) only on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Lower doses of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy may be tested based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed to determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy in combination with pembrolizumab.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Cohort 4: Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy + Cisplatin + Avelumab</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants with UC who have never received therapy with platinum in the metastatic setting or for unresectable locally advanced disease will first receive cisplatin (either at 70 mg/m^2 on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle or at a split dose of 35 mg/m^2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle with a maximum body surface area of 2) and sacituzumab govitecan-hziy with maximum dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle for up to 6 cycles. Based on DLTs observed, two additional lower doses may be tested to determine RP2D of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy in combination with cisplatin. If premature termination of 1 agent occurs due to toxicity, the other agent may be continued to complete up to 6 cycles of therapy. For participants who have not progressed, maintenance therapy will begin with infusions of avelumab 800 mg every 2 weeks beginning on Cycle 1, Day 1 and every 2 weeks thereafter and sacituzumab govitecan-hziy 10 mg/kg on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days.</description>

    <description>Participants with UC who have never received therapy with platinum in the metastatic setting or for unresectable locally advanced disease will first receive cisplatin (either at 70 mg/m^2 on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle or at a split dose of 35 mg/m^2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle with a maximum body surface area of 2) and sacituzumab govitecan-hziy RP2D determined in Cohort 4 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, and avelumab 800 mg every 2 weeks beginning on Cycle 1, Day 1 and every 2 weeks. For participants who have not progressed after completion of up to 6 cycles of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy, cisplatin, and avelumab, maintenance therapy will be permitted with 800 mg of avelumab every 2 weeks and sacituzumab govitecan-hziy at the 10 mg/kg dose on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days. Maintenance therapy can start 4 to 6 weeks after the last dose of induction chemotherapy and will be permitted to continue until loss of clinical benefit.</description>
