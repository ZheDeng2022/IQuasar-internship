  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two year study will evaluate the effects of giving belimumab (Benlysta) to patients with&#xD;
      Early Lupus. Early lupus is a diagnosis of lupus within 2 years. Subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive belimumab or placebo during the first year. During the second year, subjects who&#xD;
      were randomized to belimumab will be rerandomized to continue to receive belimumab or to&#xD;
      receive placebo. The study will look at clinical effects as well as effects on the immune&#xD;
      system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol proposes that early treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematous (SLE) may prevent&#xD;
      tissue damage and may even lead to long-term remission of disease. This concept is supported&#xD;
      by reports of SLE-associated autoimmunity that are detected serologically many years prior to&#xD;
      any constitutional symptoms or specific tissue inflammation and immune dysregulation precedes&#xD;
      the development of clinically apparent SLE. Belimumab (Benlysta) is an FDA approved&#xD;
      medication and is a monoclonal antibody directed against B cell-activating factor (BAFF)/ B&#xD;
      Lymphocyte Stimulator (BLyS). B cells maturing in environments with high BAFF levels are more&#xD;
      likely to be autoreactive B cells. This is a double-blind placebo controlled trial of&#xD;
      belimumab, in patients with early lupus, ie lupus diagnosed within 2 years. Thirty subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized (2:1) to receive subcutaneous belimumab weekly or placebo. After a year of&#xD;
      treatment, subjects receiving belimumab will be rerandomized (1:1) to receive belimumab or&#xD;
      placebo. The primary outcome is B cell autoreactivity. Clinical efficacy including disease&#xD;
      activity, flares, attainment of low disease activity or remission as well as surrogate&#xD;
      cardiovascular biomarkers will also be assessed.&#xD;
