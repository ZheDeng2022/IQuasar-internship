    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. HIV-1 infection, as documented by a positive 4th generation assay or by any licensed&#xD;
             ELISA test kit confirmed by Western blot at any time prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age ≥18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. HIV-1 RNA BLQ (e.g., &lt;20 copies/mL or other threshold based on the local viral load&#xD;
             assay used) for at least 12 months prior to study entry excluding blips (i.e., a&#xD;
             single measurement &lt;200 copies/mL preceded and followed by measurements BLQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. On a stable TAF-containing ART that also includes at least 2 other antiretrovirals,&#xD;
             with no changes in the 12 months prior to entry (except for a switch to a&#xD;
             co-formulated tablet from the component tablets or a switch from ritonavir to&#xD;
             cobicistat)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Lumbar spine, femoral neck or total hip BMD T-score ≤-1.0 from a DXA scan within the&#xD;
             past 48 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. If receiving testosterone or estrogen replacement therapy, on a stable dose for ≥3&#xD;
             months prior to enrollment without plan to change dose during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Acceptable blood laboratory values at screening visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CD4+ T-cell count ≥200 cells/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Phosphate ≥2mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  25-hydroxyvitamin D level ≥10 ng/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥50 mL/min as estimated by the&#xD;
                  Cockcroft-Gault equation*:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  For men = CrCl (mL/min) = (140 - age in years) x (body weight in kg) ÷&#xD;
                       (serum creatinine in mg/dL x 72)&#xD;
&#xD;
             For women, multiply the above result by 0.85&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For women of reproductive potential, negative serum or urine pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
             screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at the entry visit prior to&#xD;
             randomization and agreeable to using a contraceptive of choice during the study&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        &quot;Women of reproductive potential&quot; are defined as women who have not been post-menopausal&#xD;
        for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., who have had menses within the preceding 24&#xD;
        months) and have not undergone surgical sterilization (i.e., hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
        oophorectomy, or tubal ligation; participant report sufficient)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current systemic glucocorticoid use&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Lumbar spine, femoral neck or total hip BMD T-score &lt;-3.0&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Previous, current pharmacologic treatment, or plan for initiation of therapy for&#xD;
             osteoporosis (i.e., bisphosphonates, teriparatide, denosumab, tamoxifen or raloxifene)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Previous fragility fracture (i.e., any fall from a standing height or less that&#xD;
             resulted in a fracture)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of genotypic resistance or phenotypic resistance to either DTG or 3TC. The&#xD;
             interpretation of genotypic resistance is based on output from the Stanford HIV&#xD;
             Resistance Database (available at https://hivdb.stanford.edu). Isolates with an&#xD;
             interpretation of low-level resistance or higher are considered resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of virologic failure (i.e., confirmed HIV-1 RNA level ≥200 copies/mL after&#xD;
             over 6 months of therapy) while on an integrase inhibitor (i.e., raltegravir,&#xD;
             elvitegravir, bictegravir, or dolutegravir) or on lamivudine/emtricitabine prior to&#xD;
             study enrollment. Any antiretroviral history (even before routine virologic monitoring&#xD;
             became standard of care) that would suggest the presence of the M184V mutation should&#xD;
             be considered exclusionary&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. ALT ≥5 X ULN, OR ALT ≥3xULN and bilirubin ≥1.5xULN (with &gt;35% direct bilirubin)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Anticipated need for antiviral therapy for HCV&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Hepatitis B surface antigen positive or Hepatitis B DNA positive&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Weight &gt;300 pounds, precluding safe DXA testing&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Breastfeeding, pregnancy, or plans to become pregnant during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Known allergy/sensitivity to DTG or 3TC.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Receipt or planned receipt of prohibited concomitant medications (See section 5.4)&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site&#xD;
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study procedures and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that, in the opinion of the site&#xD;
             investigator, precludes safe participation or adherence to study procedures.&#xD;
