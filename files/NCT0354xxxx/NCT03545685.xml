  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will develop a culturally sensitive smart phone application to enhance&#xD;
      neurocognitive function (memory and attention in particular) of participants with attenuated&#xD;
      psychosis syndrome (APS).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator will conduct a pilot study of 80 APS subjects (age 18-45). Forty subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly put in the SMART plus routine care (RC) group and 40 to RC group only. At&#xD;
      baseline and 3-month follow-ups, all subjects will complete questionnaires including Mobile&#xD;
      App Rating Scale SMART feasibility and engagement. 1:1 in-depth interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      at the two time points to cross-validate the findings obtained from the questionnaires. The&#xD;
      questionnaires and in-depth interviews for APS subjects for the RC group seek to explore&#xD;
      their preference and likelihood to use SMART given the opportunity. Examine Cognitive&#xD;
      Function Change. In order to prepare for future large scale randomized clinical trials, the&#xD;
      investigator will examine the effectiveness of SMART in improving working memory and&#xD;
      attention of APS subjects. At baseline and 3-month follow-ups, all subjects will complete&#xD;
      MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) subtests measuring working memory (Spatial Span)&#xD;
      and attention (Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs). A between and within group&#xD;
      design allows examining change of outcome variables over time and group differences. Enhance&#xD;
      mHealth research capacity of SMHC at individual and organization levels.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects in SMART training group will receive add-on SMART intervention for 3 months. Subjects will play cognitive games for 1 hour per day, five days per week. SMART will track game time, resource use, and text messaging information on a daily basis, which allows researchers/clinicians to monitor subjects' daily SMART activities. Daily end-of-day RedPocket incentives will be delivered to subjects' designated account based on their resource use and game time. Top 5 APS subjects who play the game for the most time in a week will be rewarded</description>

    <description>The investigator will conduct a pilot study of 80 APS subjects (age 18-45). The investigator will examine SMART feasibility and user engagement using a randomized control trial research design. Using a simple random method, 40 APS subjects will be randomly assigned to the experimental group to receive add-on SMART intervention for 3 months and 40 APS subjects will just get naturalistic treatment with no SMART intervention. At baseline and 3-month follow-up, subjects will complete questionnaires on app use habits and attitudes towards SMART feasibility and engagement. In-depth interviews will be conducted at both time points to cross-validate the findings obtained from the questionnaires.</description>

                  psychosis or subject with Schizotypal Personality Disorder and a 30% drop in GAF&#xD;

          -  Meet criteria for current or lifetime Axis I psychotic disorder, including affective&#xD;
             psychoses and psychosis NOS.&#xD;

             depression, anxiety disorders, Axis II Disorders), as long as the disorder does not&#xD;
             account for the diagnosis of prodromal symptoms.&#xD;
