  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, with the increasing intensities of the tobacco industry and air pollution in&#xD;
      China, the incidence and mortality of lung cancer have become the most important issue that&#xD;
      threatens human health.Over the past two decades, the treatment of SCLC still stays in the&#xD;
      mode of treatment based on radiotherapy and chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single-center, one-arm clinical study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of apatinib plus chemotherapy for second-line and above treatment of&#xD;
      advanced SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients will receive apatinib 500mg qd orally, if the patient has a grade 3/4 adverse&#xD;
      reaction during apatinib treatment, it can be reduced to apatinib 250mg qd orally.The dose&#xD;
      was later reduced from 500 mg to 250 mg per day based on a recommendation of the principal&#xD;
      investigator to reduce the adverse events. Chemotherapeutic agents are limited to irinotecan&#xD;
      or docetaxel alone.The primary outcome endpoint was progression-free survival&#xD;
