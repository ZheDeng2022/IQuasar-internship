  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of belantamab mafodotin when&#xD;
      administered in combination with approved regimens of either Lenalidomide Plus Dexamethasone&#xD;
      [Len/Dex (Arm A)] or Bortezomib Plus Dexamethasone [Bor/Dex (Arm B)] in participants with&#xD;
      RRMM, i.e., those who have relapsed or who are refractory to at least 1 line of approved&#xD;
      therapy. Part 1 of the study will be a dose escalation phase to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of up to 3 dose levels and up to 2 dosing schedules of belantamab mafodotin in&#xD;
      combination with the two standard of care (SoC) regimens. Part 2 will further evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and preliminary clinical activity of belantamab mafodotin at selected dose levels and&#xD;
      dosing schedules in combination with Len/Dex or Bor/Dex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 152 evaluable participants will be enrolled in the study with up to 27 in Part 1&#xD;
      and up to 125 in Part 2. Participants receiving treatment Arm A, may continue combination&#xD;
      treatment until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD), intolerable adverse events (AEs&#xD;
      ), consent withdrawal, death or end of study. The participants receiving treatment Arm B, may&#xD;
      continue combination treatment for a total of up to 8 cycles. After 8 cycles of combination&#xD;
      therapy, the participants will continue treatment with belantamab mafodotin, as a monotherapy&#xD;
      until the occurrence of PD, intolerable AEs, consent withdrawal, death or end of study.&#xD;

    <description>The OSDI, is a 12-item questionnaire designed to assess both the frequency of dry eye symptoms and their impact on vision-related functioning. The OSDI has demonstrated good reliability, validity, sensitivity, and specificity, and can be used as a complement to other clinical and subjective measures of dry eye disease by providing a quantifiable assessment of dry eye symptom frequency and the impact of these symptoms on vision-related functioning. The OSDI will be measured at every 4-weeks, for Treatment A and every 3-weeks, for Treatment B.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Up to 4.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30, is a 30-item questionnaire containing both single- and multi-item measures. These include five functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, and Social Functioning), three symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, and Nausea/Vomiting), a Global Health Status/QoL scale, and six single items (Constipation, Diarrhea, Insomnia, Dyspnea, Appetite Loss, and Financial Difficulties). Scores for each scale and single-item measure. A high score for functional scales and for Global Health Status/QoL, represent better functioning ability or HRQoL, whereas a high score for symptom scales and single items represents significant symptomatology.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in HRQoL as measured by EORTC, 20-Item Multiple Myeloma Module (QLQ-MY20), Part 1 and 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Up to 4.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>QLQ-MY20, module comprises 20 questions that address four myeloma-specific HRQoL domains: Disease Symptoms, Side Effects of Treatment (DSSE), Future Perspective, and Body Image (FPBI). Three of four QLQ-MY20 domains, are multi-item scales: Disease Symptoms (bone aches or pain, back pain, hip pain, arm or shoulder pain, chest pain, and pain increasing with activity); Side effects of treatment (drowsiness, thirst, feeling ill, dry mouth, hair loss, upset by hair loss, tingling hands or feet, restlessness/agitation, acid indigestion/heartburn, and burning or sore eyes); and Future perspective (worry about death and health in future, and thinking about illness). The Body Image scale is single-item scale that addresses physical attractiveness. A high score for DSSE, represents a high level of symptomatology or problems, whereas high score for FPBI, represents better outcomes.</description>

          -  Participants with a history of autologous SCT, are eligible for study participation&#xD;
             provided the following eligibility criteria are met: Autologous SCT was &gt;100 days&#xD;

             during the intervention period and for at least 4 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             belantamab mafodotin and agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of&#xD;
             reproduction during this period. The investigator is responsible for review of medical&#xD;
             history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for&#xD;
             inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        WOCBP Participants Assigned to Arm A:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to lenalidomide being a thalidomide analogue with risk for embryo-fetal toxicity&#xD;
             and prescribed under a pregnancy prevention/controlled distribution program, WOCBP&#xD;
             participants will be eligible if they commit either to abstain continuously from&#xD;
             heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control (one&#xD;
             method that is highly effective; beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with&#xD;
             lenalidomide, during therapy, during dose interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks&#xD;
             following discontinuation of lenalidomide treatment. Thereafter, WOCBP participants&#xD;
             must use a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of &lt;1%&#xD;
             per year) for a further 3 months, and agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the&#xD;
             purpose of reproduction during this period: Two negative pregnancy tests must be&#xD;
             obtained prior to initiating lenalidomide therapy. The first test should be performed&#xD;

             lenalidomide therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        WOCBP Participants Assigned to Arm B&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP assigned to Arm B must have a negative highly sensitive serum pregnancy test&#xD;

        belantamab mafodotin 4 weeks after the last dose of lenalidomide, whichever is longer, to&#xD;
        allow for clearance of any altered sperm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Arm B: from the time of first dose of study until 6 months after the last dose of&#xD;
        belantamab mafodotin or 4 months from the last dose of bortezomib (whichever is the longer)&#xD;
        to allow for clearance of any altered sperm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male participants must agree to refrain from donating sperm and either be abstinent&#xD;
             from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a&#xD;
             long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent OR Must agree to use&#xD;
             contraception/barrier as detailed below.&#xD;

             female partner to use an additional highly effective contraceptive method with a&#xD;
             failure rate of &lt;1% per year when having sexual intercourse. Male participants should&#xD;
             also use a condom with pregnant females. If the female partner of the male participant&#xD;
             is pregnant at the time of enrollment, or becomes pregnant during the trial, the male&#xD;
             participant must agree to remain abstinent (if it is consistent with their preferred&#xD;
             and usual lifestyle) or use a male condom.&#xD;
