    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to determine how aspects of adiposity and age influence&#xD;
      ultrasound features of the ovaries which are used to diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome&#xD;
      (PCOS). The study will also compare anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels against ultrasound&#xD;
      features of the ovary to predict PCOS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop ultrasound criteria for polycystic ovaries for women&#xD;
      with PCOS across early, mid and late adulthood and to assess the impact of body composition&#xD;
      on these ultrasound criteria.. The study will also compare ultrasound features of the ovary&#xD;
      against or in combination with AMH (a hormonal biomarker) in predicting PCOS. This research&#xD;
      will help improve the diagnosis of PCOS by considering multiple markers (i.e., ultrasound&#xD;
      features and AMH levels) and multiple modifiers of those markers (i.e., age and adiposity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the name implies, the primary ultrasound feature used to diagnose PCOS is polycystic&#xD;
      ovaries (PCO). However, PCO have frequently been observed in healthy women, calling into&#xD;
      question the specificity of PCO to the condition of PCOS, as well as its ability to inform&#xD;
      progression of the disease and/or response to treatment. The Lujan laboratory recently showed&#xD;
      that the most widely accepted ultrasound criteria for PCO overlap with features of the normal&#xD;
      ovary, and their laboratory proposed new thresholds to redefine PCO. These new criteria&#xD;
      represented a significant change in the definition of PCO owing to the improved resolution of&#xD;
      new technology. That said, these new criteria are still limited. They do not account for&#xD;
      factors known or suspected to influence ovarian morphology. For example, follicle counts and&#xD;
      ovarian size increase at puberty and decrease with age. Additional results from the Lujan&#xD;
      laboratory showed that follicle number per ovary (FNPO) thresholds for women in later&#xD;
      adulthood (35-38y) were substantially lower than those in early (18-25y) and mid-adulthood&#xD;
      (26-34y). Furthermore, the new criteria for PCO do not account for a potential impact of&#xD;
      adiposity on ovarian morphology. In the same study, conducted by the Lujan laboratory,&#xD;
      overweight women exhibited more 6-9mm follicles than lean women, irrespective of androgen&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, there is significant interest in determining whether AMH can serve as a surrogate to&#xD;
      sonographic measures to define PCO. AMH is a peptide hormone produced by the granulosa cells&#xD;
      of growing follicles and circulating levels represent secretions by antral follicles ≤8mm.&#xD;
      Accordingly, serum AMH is increased in women with PCOS, reflecting the accumulation of 2-5mm&#xD;
      antral follicles and greater production by granulosa cells of PCO compared to normal ovaries.&#xD;
      Excess AMH is thought to inhibit follicle growth and selection. Unlike discrete aspects of&#xD;
      ovarian morphology (i.e. follicle number or size),85 AMH levels remain largely constant&#xD;
      throughout the normal menstrual cycle.Such stability may make AMH a more advantageous&#xD;
      functional and surrogate morphological indicator of ovarian status compared to morphologic&#xD;
      features. Further, some have argued that the variability in ultrasound assessments, and&#xD;
      unsuitability of transvaginal approaches in certain clinical populations, justify the pursuit&#xD;
      of a less onerous biomarker of PCO. However, there is significant bias across AMH assays and&#xD;
      a consensual threshold for AMH to define PCO has not been determined. Proposed thresholds&#xD;
      were hindered by heterogeneity in assay performance and in the clinical cohorts assessed.&#xD;
      Ultimately, the ability of AMH to serve as a surrogate marker for PCO remains unknown and&#xD;
      should be evaluated against sonographic measures in well-defined cohorts with improved&#xD;
      assays. In this study, the researchers plan to refine the sonographic definition of PCO by&#xD;
      establishing age-specific criteria that maintain sensitivity and specificity for PCOS in both&#xD;
      lean and overweight populations. They will also clarify any ability of anti-Müllerian hormone&#xD;
      (AMH) to better inform the diagnosis of PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish these objectives, the investigators plan to recruit 120 women with regular&#xD;
      ovulatory cycles and 120 women with PCOS. Within each of these categories, the investigators&#xD;
      plan to recruit 20 lean and 20 overweight women in each age group: 18-24y (early), 25-34y&#xD;
      (mid), ≥35y (later adulthood). Ultrasound scans of the ovaries will be assessed for the total&#xD;
      number, size, and distribution of follicles using both two- and three-dimensional imaging&#xD;
      techniques. Additionally, participants will have blood samples collected to determine serum&#xD;
      concentrations of AMH. Because features of the ovaries are expected to be different in lean&#xD;
      and overweight women, the researchers hope to develop ultrasound criteria that will help&#xD;
      healthcare providers to diagnosis specific ovulation problems in women across all body sizes&#xD;
      and ages. This project addresses the need to improve methods and criteria used to define PCO&#xD;
      across clinical populations.&#xD;
