  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impairments in postural control are linked to low back pain and reductions in physical&#xD;
      function in the elderly. Unfortunately, many techniques to assess the neural control of&#xD;
      movement are not feasible, or directly applicable, to the trunk musculature. In a prior pilot&#xD;
      study, we developed and optimized innovative approaches to study these muscles. We will&#xD;
      continue to develop a reliable, fMRI protocol that investigates the activity of the motor&#xD;
      cortical networks of selected trunk muscles (specific aim 1). We will also continue the&#xD;
      development a reliable muscle functional MRI (mfMRI) protocol to assess the spatial muscle&#xD;
      activation patterns of the deeper lumbopelvic muscles (specific aim 2). We will examine the&#xD;
      test-retest reliability of these approaches in four distinct target populations: healthy&#xD;
      adults, adults with chronic low back pain, older adults, and older adults with high levels of&#xD;
      trunk muscle control (i.e., individuals with expertise in Pilates). By enrolling groups of&#xD;
      various levels of trunk muscle control, pathology state and age, we will be able to not only&#xD;
      determine the intra-individual reliability, but also the inter-individual reliability as we&#xD;
      expect the variability of the measures to be influenced by physical ability, pain state and&#xD;
      age. Lastly, in an exploratory aim we will examine the association of our novel&#xD;
      neurophysiological measures from Aim 1 and 2 with classic biomechanical and muscle function&#xD;
      measures (e.g., trunk extensor strength and trunk extensor steadiness). Successfully&#xD;
      developing reliable techniques of this nature will result in new and improved research tools&#xD;
      for conducting rigorous studies of therapeutic approaches, such as spinal manipulation and&#xD;
      yoga, within the context of trunk muscle control and function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Impairments in postural control are linked to low back pain and reductions in physical&#xD;
      function in the elderly. Unfortunately, many techniques to assess the neural control of&#xD;
      movement are not feasible or directly applicable to the trunk musculature. We have developed&#xD;
      an innovative approach to study these muscles. Further development of these techniques will&#xD;
      have applicability for the study of the physiological effects and mechanisms of many&#xD;
      complementary and integrative health practices (e.g., mind and body approaches). Many of&#xD;
      these approaches are used to target back pain (e.g., spinal manipulation, acupuncture) and/or&#xD;
      involve therapeutic strategies that have a large focus on postural control (e.g., yoga, Tai&#xD;
      Chi). Thus, developing novel and reliable techniques to study the neural control of the trunk&#xD;
      muscles will have broad impact to the complementary and integrative health field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. To develop a reliable neurophysiological technique to examine activity of the&#xD;
      motor neural networks of selected trunk muscles. Approach: We have previously conducted pilot&#xD;
      testing exploring the feasibility of obtaining high quality MRI data with various&#xD;
      standardized trunk tasks and biofeedback variations. Once we identified the most promising&#xD;
      tasks and MRI compatible data collection techniques, we conducted an optimization study in&#xD;
      order to ascertain which method of task performance resulted in the highest level of image&#xD;
      quality. We will now conduct a test-retest reliability experiment to determine the&#xD;
      reproducibility of our targeted outcome measures. We will focus our reliability analysis on&#xD;
      the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortex (Brodmann area 4a, 4b, 1, 2, 3a and 3b) and&#xD;
      premotor cortex (Brodmann area 6). In addition, contrasts between two testing sessions will&#xD;
      be completed to determine if any brain regions activated significantly more or less between&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. To develop a reliable neurophysiological technique to examine spatial muscle&#xD;
      activity of selected lumbopelvic musculature (e.g., psoas, iliacus, multifidus, erector&#xD;
      spinae, quadratus lumborum). Approach: We have conducted pilot testing that explored the&#xD;
      feasibility of obtaining high quality MRI data of various muscles under resting conditions as&#xD;
      well as following different standardized tasks. We first identified the most promising&#xD;
      muscles to evaluate and then explored which tasks (or tasks sequences) resulted in increased&#xD;
      transverse relaxation times (T2) of these muscles. We refined our pulse sequence protocol to&#xD;
      optimize our ability to detect an increase in T2 associated with task performance. We will&#xD;
      now conduct a test-retest reliability experiment to determine the reproducibility of the&#xD;
      primary outcome measures of interest (resting T2 and percent increase in T2 following task&#xD;
      performance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Specific Aim 3. To examine the association of the novel neurophysiological&#xD;
      measures from Aim 1 and 2 with classic biomechanical and muscle function measures (e.g.,&#xD;
      trunk extensor strength, trunk extensor force-matching steadiness). The neurophysiological&#xD;
      assessments developed as a part of Aim 1 and 2 provide unique information regarding the&#xD;
      mechanisms of motor control related to trunk musculature that have typically been very&#xD;
      difficult to quantify. This mechanistic approach is bolstered by the ability to correlate the&#xD;
      underlying neurophysiology of trunk function with the more traditional clinical measures of&#xD;
      performance. Such an approach bolsters the translational capability of this investigation as&#xD;
      the neurophysiology of low-cost clinical measures are established in addition to the&#xD;
      development of novel intervention outcome tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants: Up to 50 individuals will participate in the reliability experiments. To&#xD;
      increase the generalizability of our findings and allow for preliminary data for effect size&#xD;
      estimates for future work, we will enroll four cohorts of study participants: healthy young&#xD;
      adults, young adults with chronic low back pain, healthy older adults and healthy older&#xD;
      adults with expertise in trunk muscle control (i.e., individuals with expertise in Pilates).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes: We anticipate being able to demonstrate test-retest reliability utilizing&#xD;
      two newly developed neurophysiological imaging techniques that will permit 1) examination of&#xD;
      the activity of the motor cortical networks during an active trunk task, and 2) examination&#xD;
      of muscle activation patterns of small and deep trunk extensor muscles that are very&#xD;
      difficult, if not impossible, to study with more classical techniques such as&#xD;
      electromyography. Our goal is to demonstrate an association with outcomes of these new&#xD;
      imaging techniques with more classic neurophysiological motor outcomes for broad&#xD;
      applicability to numerous patient populations that we believe, in the long term, will advance&#xD;
      our understanding of trunk muscle control and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this application we propose to perform the test- retest reliability experiments for the&#xD;
      fMRI and mfMRI techniques that were previously developed in the pilot testing.&#xD;
