&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy of the urinary tract and radical&#xD;
      cystectomy remains the gold standard for management of muscle invasive disease.(1) Despite&#xD;
      improvement in perioperative period it remains associated with a greater morbidity and more&#xD;
      prolonged inpatient stay than other urological studies. Bowel complications particularly&#xD;
      ileus are amongst the commonest problems that patients experience.)2,3) Pain is common after&#xD;
      major abdominal surgeries.Uncontrolled postoperative pain increases the incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative complications.Multimodal analgesia can improve pain control in postoperative&#xD;
      period and reduces complications that may arise from using a single mode of analgesia.(4)&#xD;
      Effective regional anesthesia techniques for abdominal surgery include epidural,paravertebral&#xD;
      , transverses abdominis plane (TAP) block .multiple approaches have been used for TAP block&#xD;
      with ultrasound guided midaxillary approach but are sometimes patchy with variable wound&#xD;
      coverage . the use of ultrasound approach at the level of quadratus lumborum muscle is new&#xD;
      and may provide wider spread of the local anesthetic ( T5-L1) than TAP and paravertebral&#xD;
      blocks.(5) Studies of quadratus lumborum block show its use in postoperative analgesia in&#xD;
      major abdominal surgery. Results have shown widespread and long-lasting analgesic effect&#xD;
      after ovarian surgery and resulted in lower peak arterial concentrations of injected&#xD;
      bupivacaine as compared to lateral TAPB.(6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, thoracic paravertebral block (PVB) has been demonstrated to provide effective&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing minor and major abdominal surgery by blocking&#xD;
      sensory innervations of the abdominal wall. PVB significantly reduces the need for&#xD;
      supplemental opioid administration, reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and in&#xD;
      some patient groups shortens length of hospital stay. Although PVB has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      be effective in patients undergoing abdominal and thoracic surgery, its analgesic efficacy&#xD;
      after major gynecological surgery has not, as yet, been reported .(7,8) Studies have shown&#xD;
      that regional anesthetic technique for cancer surgery could affect recurrence or metastasis.&#xD;
      This retrospective study suggests that paravertebral anaesthesia and analgesia for breast&#xD;
      cancer surgery reduces the risk of recurrence or metastasis during the initial years of&#xD;
      follow up. (9)&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM OF THE WORK The aim of the study to compare between intraoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      analgesic effect of ultrasound guided continuous quadratus lumborum block and continuous&#xD;
      thoracic paravertebral block in patients operated for radical cystectomy (primary outcome).&#xD;
      Side effects, length of hospital stay and patient satisfaction(secondary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After approval of Local Ethics Committee, and written informed consent from each patient&#xD;
           or oral consent if illiteracy prevent a written consent, The present study will be&#xD;
           carried out in the Urosurgery department at Alexandria Main University hospital on 60&#xD;
           adult patients scheduled for radical cystectomy, males and females.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be randomly assigned into two equal groups (30 patients each) according to&#xD;

      each side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coagulopathy/ thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Localized infection at the proposed site of injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inability to comprehend the scoring systems to be employed due to mental problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  known allergy to the drugs to be used (local anesthetics, opioids)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Opioid tolerance/ dependence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Back abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological deficits&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative assessment and preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. History taking ,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical examination ,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All needed laboratory investigations. The technique ofanaesthesiawill be explained to&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premedication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be premedicated with midazolam 0.05 mg/kg IV 30 min before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthetic technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multichannel monitor will be connected to the patient to display continuous&#xD;
      electrocardiography monitoring for heart rate (beat/min) and detection of dysrhythmias,&#xD;
      noninvasive arterial blood pressure (mmHg), respiratory rate and arterial oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (SpO2) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline monitoring data (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation)&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction of anaesthesia will be carried out with fentanyl citrate (1µ/kg)i.v, propofol&#xD;
      2mg/kg i.v will be injected till loss of verbal communication and endotracheal intubation&#xD;
      will be facilitated by rocuronium bromide 0.6mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilation will be maintained with Drager fabius plus ventilator as IPPV volume control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia will be maintained with Isoflurane in 100% oxygen, intermittent boluses of&#xD;
      Rocuroniun (0.1mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique of QL block group After induction of general anesthesia,the patient will be&#xD;
      positioned for lateral position to obtain appropriate view of QL and thoracic PV&#xD;
      block.Aseptic measures will be taken by wearing sterile gown and sterile drapes .Ultrasound&#xD;
      will be used with linear probe covered with sterile elastic sheath. Probe will be placed&#xD;
      horizontally between the costal margin and iliac crest. The 3 muscle layer of the abdominal&#xD;
      wall will be identified as external oblique, internal oblique , transverses abdominis muscles&#xD;
      .The fascia surrounding transverses abdominis will be tracked until its origin, where&#xD;
      transverses abdominis muscle merge with thoracolumbar fascia surrounding quadratus lumborum&#xD;
      muscle .&#xD;
&#xD;
      18 G 3 inch long non stimulating echoic needle will be inserted in plane with the ultrasound&#xD;
      probe and targeted toward fascia transversalis . Normal saline 3 ml will be used to identify&#xD;
      the splitting of the fascia .Then injection of 0.3 ml/kg bupivacaine 0.25% in the same plane&#xD;
      after negative aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be seen spreading around quadratus lumborum muscle. Echogenic catheter will be&#xD;
      advanced 7 cm beyond the tip of the needle with minimal resistance.(10) Maintenance will be&#xD;
      0.1 ml\kg\hr. The procedure will be repeated on the other side after placing the patient in&#xD;
      the opposite position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique for thoracic paravertebral block After general anesthesia, the patient will be&#xD;
      positioned to lateral position. Under strict aseptic technique, Ultrasound will be used with&#xD;
      linear probe covered with sterile elastic sheath .Probe is applied longitudinal at level of&#xD;
      T10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For most of patients, the depth of field is set to 3 cm to start scanning. The transverse&#xD;
      processes and ribs are shown as hyperechoic structures with acoustic shadowing between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the transverse processes and ribs are identified, the transducer is moved slightly&#xD;
      cauded into the intercostals space between adjacent ribs to identify the thoracic PVS and&#xD;
      adjoining intercostal space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PVS appears as a wedge shaped hypoechoic layer demarcated by the hyperechoic reflections&#xD;
      of the pleura below and internal intercostal membrane above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hyperechoic line of the pleura and underlying hyperechoic air artifacts move with&#xD;
      respiration .the goal of the technique is to insert the needle into PVS to inject 0.3ml∕kg&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.25% .(11) Echogenic catheter is advanced 7 cm beyond the tip of the needle with&#xD;
      minimal resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance will be 0.1ml\kg\hr. The same procedure will be repeated on the other side after&#xD;
      placing the patient in the opposite position .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be measured :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A- Hemodynamic parameters :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate (beat per minute )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean arterial blood pressure (mmHg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry . All previous parameters will be continuously&#xD;
           monitored and recorded at the following periods : preoperative , every 30 minutes&#xD;
           intraoperative till the end of surgery and every 12 hrs postoperative for 3 days .&#xD;
&#xD;
      B - Intensity of postoperative pain :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to quantify their pain on a visual analogue scale between 0 - 10 with&#xD;
      (0) representing no pain and ( 10 ) representing the worst imaginable pain .(12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be measured postoperative every 12hrs for 3 days .&#xD;
&#xD;
      C - Analgesic requirements :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First request of analgesia .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rescue analgesia in the form of nalbuphine 0.1 mg / kg will be given when VAS score ≥4 .&#xD;
           VAS to be assessed every 12 hrs and give rescue analgesia accordingly .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total dose of analgesia given .&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS OF RESEARCH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research on human or human products:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective study: Informed consent will be taken from patients. In case of incompetent&#xD;
      patients the informed consent will be taken from the guardians.&#xD;
