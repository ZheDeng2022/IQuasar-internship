      This research study aims to evaluate the relation between non-invasive ventilation and&#xD;
      feeding tolerance in preterms with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this purpose a multicenter randomized controlled trial was designed. It will involve 13&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in Italy and will be coordinated by the NICU of the&#xD;
      University of Turin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study focuses on the impact of two non-invasive respiratory support techniques (NCPAP and&#xD;
      HHHFNC) on feeding intolerance and gastrointestinal complications to identify which technique&#xD;
      is the most effective and safe in preterms with RDS. Further aim is to identify which&#xD;
      technique could be the most suitable for full enteral feeding achievement and acquisition of&#xD;
      oral feeding. Improving enteral feeding tolerance and promoting oral feeding could improve&#xD;
      clinical outcomes and reduce risks and costs of prolonged hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further aim is to evaluate the response to NCPAP and HHHFNC in the treatment of RDS, focusing&#xD;
      on a population of extremely low preterms.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a common condition in premature infants and one of the&#xD;
      major cause of neonatal mortality. For many years, preterm infants with RDS have been treated&#xD;
      with mechanical ventilation increasing risks of acute lung injury and long-term morbidity, as&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Early nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP)&#xD;
      treatment combined with surfactant replacement therapy decreases the need for mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and has been recommended as first line treatment for RDS. However, NCPAP has&#xD;
      significant limitations, mainly related to the type of interface needed. Excessive leak&#xD;
      around the prongs or mask and through the mouth can lead to inadequate support, whereas&#xD;
      excessive pressure may result in pneumothorax and damage of the nose and face. Moreover, the&#xD;
      bulky fixation devices obscure the infant's face both interfering with feeding and&#xD;
      positioning. In recent years, heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) has been&#xD;
      studied as an alternative non-invasive respiratory supports (NIReS). HHHFNC became popular&#xD;
      partially thanks to some perceived advantages related to the type of interface used. Cannulae&#xD;
      are easier to apply than NCPAP prongs or mask, may be more comfortable for infants, and may&#xD;
      enable easier access to babies' faces, thus facilitating feeding and parental bonding.&#xD;
      Whereas practical advantages seem to be established there is controversy about HHHFNC&#xD;
      efficacy as respiratory support. Recent studies support that HHHFNC is as effective as NCPAP&#xD;
      for the primary treatment of RDS, but evidences are still insufficient and data are still&#xD;
      lacking, especially for the extremely preterm population (&lt;28 weeks of gestation). A recent&#xD;
      Cochrane comparing HHHFNC with other NIReS showed equivalent rates of treatment failure and&#xD;
      similar rates of BPD when used as a post-extubation support in preterm infants. With&#xD;
      equivalent effectiveness, the choice of the most adequate NIReS should consider the impact on&#xD;
      the health status of the premature evaluating, above all, the effect on nutrition and growth.&#xD;
      Along with RDS, feeding intolerance (FI) represents a relevant issue in preterm infants and&#xD;
      the coexistence of the two represents a great challenge for the neonatologist. Because of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal immaturity, almost 1:3 preterm infants develops clinical symptoms of FI&#xD;
      causing interruptions of feeding which delays the establishment of adequate enteral nutrition&#xD;
      and prolongs the need for parental nutrition thus increasing the risk of infections and&#xD;
      prolonging hospital stay. Avoiding FI and its complication, as necrotizing enterocolitis&#xD;
      (NEC), is a priority for the neonatologist, who often faces the challenge of interpreting the&#xD;
      clinical and prognostic significance of common and aspecific signs of FI. Clear&#xD;
      identification of the parameters that should be evaluated to identify FI is still lacking in&#xD;
      literature, although, among controversy, the presence of gastric residuals, vomits and/or&#xD;
      regurgitations, abdominal distension and the onset of crises of apnea/bradycardia are&#xD;
      considered the most frequent signs. Literature and clinical practise suggest that a&#xD;
      correlation between non-invasive ventilation and the occurrence of FI and NEC exists even if&#xD;
      the mechanisms through which ventilation may induce FI and its incidence in ventilated&#xD;
      infants are still unclear. Considering NIReS, the most common hypothesis is that pressurized&#xD;
      gasses, that are not completely conveyed to the airways, could cause bowel distension. Bowel&#xD;
      distension in infants on CPAP was described by Jaile et al. as CPAP belly syndrome but no&#xD;
      inferences about feeding tolerance and risk of NEC was drawn. More recent studies evaluated&#xD;
      the effect of CPAP on mesenteric flow and gastric emptying suggesting a role of CPAP as a&#xD;
      risk factor for FI. No specific studies have been designed to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      different NIReS on FI and the occurrence of NEC, which are generally evaluated as secondary&#xD;
      outcomes, susceptible to data analysis and patient selection biases. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      different techniques of NIReS may have different impact on feeding issues in preterm infants.&#xD;
      Therefore, our study will focus on the impact that the two most common NIReS (NCPAP and&#xD;
      HHHFNC) have on feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT AIMS AND DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study is to evaluate the effects on feeding tolerance of different NIReS&#xD;
      techniques (NCPAP vs HHHFNC) in preterm infants with RDS and to evaluate their impact on full&#xD;
      enteral feeding achievement and acquisition of oral feeding. Further aim is to evaluate the&#xD;
      response to NCPAP and HHHFNC as treatment for RDS in extremely preterm infants. To these&#xD;
      purposes a multicenter randomized controlled trial was designed. The research project will&#xD;
      involve 13 neonatal intensive care units (NICU) in Italy and will be coordinated by the NICU&#xD;
      of the University of Turin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basing on a population of infants with a gestational age &lt;30 weeks and consecutively admitted&#xD;
      to the NICUs of each research unit from January to June 2017 (mean time of FEF: 19.6 days,&#xD;
      delta: 5.7) and considering a ratio between the subjects of the two arms of 1:1, the sample&#xD;
      size to observe a difference of 30% between the 2 arms has been set at 141 patients per arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization each infant will be subsequently enrolled into the study and treated with&#xD;
      NCPAP or HHHFNC as per randomization. Each research unit will refer to its own protocols for&#xD;
      ventilation and nutrition, although respecting some minimal standard criteria and&#xD;
      indications, common and approved by all research units. Common criteria for ventilation&#xD;
      regard the suggested initial setup of NCPAP and HHHFNC and the indications suggested to try&#xD;
      weaning and define failure and are listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suggested initial setup:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPAP between 5 and 7 cmH2O if on NCPAP and flow between 4 and 7 L/min if on HHHFNC; FiO2 is&#xD;
      set as to reach pO2 = 50 - 60 mmHg and SatO2 TC = 90 - 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria to try weaning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPAP &lt; 4 cmH2O if on NCPAP and flow &lt; 2 if on HHHFNC with FiO2 &lt; 25% to maintain pO2 = 50 -&#xD;
      60 mmHg and SatO2 TC = 90 - 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FiO2 &gt; 40%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pH &lt; 7.2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pCO2 &gt; 65 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ≥ 3 episodes of desaturations (SatO2 TC ≤ 80%) per hour&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ≥ 3 episodes of apnea (&gt; 20 sec) and/or bradycardia (FC ≤ 80 bpm) per hour&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Silverman score &gt; 6&#xD;
&#xD;
      The indications for the interruption of feeding are based on abdominal examination, on the&#xD;
      occurrence of vomits/regurgitations and crises of apnea/bradycardia and on the evaluation of&#xD;
      alvus and gastric residual volumes, if required by the protocol of the unit. The maximum&#xD;
      cut-off for feeding progression is set at 30 mL/Kg/day. Data on ventilation, nutrition,&#xD;
      growth and clinical events will be collected from enrollment to discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed according to an intention-to-treat model. Therefore, data from all&#xD;
      infants enrolled into the study will be considered for the analysis. Death and transfer to&#xD;
      another hospital, before reaching full enteral feeding, are the only two reasons for&#xD;
      exclusion. The primary outcome will be evaluated by a survival analysis with non-parametric&#xD;
      distribution. Secondary outcomes will be evaluated by Fisher's exact test or appropriate&#xD;
      generalized linear models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS AND IMPACT ON CLINICAL PRACTICE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of the most suitable NIReS for preterm infants with RDS and FI could&#xD;
      reduce gastrointestinal complications, improve growth and reduce hospital stay, thus&#xD;
      improving quality of life of infants and their family and reducing health costs. The&#xD;
      evaluation of the timing of oral feeding could be useful to understand the influence that&#xD;
      NIReS techniques have on the development of sucking-swallowing coordination. The evaluation&#xD;
      of the response to NCPAP and HHHFNC could clarify their efficacy as treatment for RDS in&#xD;
      extremely preterm infants.&#xD;
