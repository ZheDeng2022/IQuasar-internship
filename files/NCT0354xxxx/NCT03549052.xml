  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatic heart disease remains a major health problem in developing countries. It is the&#xD;
      most important sequel of rheumatic fever and occurs in about 30% of patients with rheumatic&#xD;
      fever.Rheumatic heart disease presents with different degrees of pancarditis and associated&#xD;
      valve failure. Involvement of the mitral leaflets can cause mitral regurgitation (MR) or&#xD;
      stenosis and eventually can lead to heart failure. Mitral repair or replacement is therefore&#xD;
      recommended before left ventricular (LV) dysfunction develops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives/Specific Aims Overall Goal: To determine the benefit the patient with&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension will get from mitral valve replacement as regard function improvement&#xD;
      and remodeling of the right ventricle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective1: Identify risk factors that are predictive of outcomes.(Type and severity of&#xD;
           Mitral valve pathology , severity of pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid regurge,&#xD;
           preoperative RV dysfunction)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective2: Determine the value of management strategies (Mitral valve replacement in&#xD;
           pulmonary hypertension i.e. : decrease RV pressure overload and enhance RV remodeling)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective3: Assessment of the outcomes clinically &amp; Echocardiographically :&#xD;
           postoperative results during hospital stay and follow up (short term up to 3 months).&#xD;

      In 1994, it was estimated that 12 million individuals had RF and RHD worldwide , and at least&#xD;
      3 million had congestive heart failure (CHF) that required repeated hospital admissions. A&#xD;
      large section of the individuals with CHF required cardiac valve surgery within 5-10 years .&#xD;
      The mortality rate for RHD varied from 0.5 per 100 000 population in Denmark, to 8.2 per 100&#xD;
      000 population in China , and the estimated annual number of deaths from RHD for 2000 was&#xD;
      332000 worldwide . The mortality rate per 100 000 population varied from 1.8 in the WHO&#xD;
      Region of the Americas, to 7.6 in WHO South-East Asia Region. The disability-adjusted life&#xD;
      years (DALYs)1 lost to RHD ranged from 27.4 DALYs per 100 000 population in the WHO Region of&#xD;
      the Americas, to 173.4 per 100 000 population in the WHO South-East Asia Region. An estimated&#xD;
      6.6 million DALYs are lost per year worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE PATHOLOGY OF RHEUMATIC MITRAL VALVE DISEASE Rheumatic mitral valves shows a different set&#xD;
      of lesions by comparison with degenerative valves, because of the characteristic inflammatory&#xD;
      process, which results in thickening of the leaflets and other components of the mitral valve&#xD;
      apparatus, of variable degrees, and distorts and impairs the movements of the valve. So, the&#xD;
      disease appears here in two forms - stenosis and regurgitation, or a combination of both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of valve regurge, the most frequent lesion is prolapse of the anterior leaflet,&#xD;
      which is present in more than 90% of young patients and is most often caused by elongated&#xD;
      chordae to its central and medial areas (A2 and A3). In contrast to degenerative disease,&#xD;
      posterior leaflet prolapse is practically not found, except in cases with ruptured chordae&#xD;
      due to infective endocarditis. On the contrary, this leaflet is often shortened in its width,&#xD;
      sometimes resumed to a very narrow and thick strip of tissue. In more complicated cases, the&#xD;
      chordae may be thick and retracted, as may also be the papillary muscles, and the commissures&#xD;
      may be fused in varying degrees. Often, the leaflets and subvalvular apparatus are a&#xD;
      continuous mass of fibrous tissue. Lastly, the annulus is dilated in 95% of the patients. It&#xD;
      is widely accepted that dilatation occurs essentially in the posterior segment of the&#xD;
      annulus, although there is some evidence that it may also occur in the anterior segment,&#xD;
      especially in dilated cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary hypertension and valvular heart disease Valvular Heart Disease VHD is a common&#xD;
      etiology of pulmonary hypertension, which may result from many mechanisms as an increase in&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary blood flow, or pulmonary venous pressure. The&#xD;
      chronic rise in pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) often leads to right ventricular (RV)&#xD;
      pressure overload and subsequent RV failure. When present, PH is a marker of poor outcome in&#xD;
      VHD. Assessment of the presence and severity of Pulmonary hypertension thus has an important&#xD;
      role in the risk stratification and therapeutic management of VHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sure diagnosis of PH related to VHD is based on the following criteria: mean PAP 25 mm Hg&#xD;
      together with an abnormally high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) &gt;15 mm Hg or left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure &gt;18 mm Hg in the context of significant VHD. When&#xD;
      pulmonary venous congestion is the main determinant of PH, PH is named isolated&#xD;
      post-capillary PH or pulmonary venous hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Increase in LV filling pressure and left atrial (LA) pressure leads to a&#xD;
      passive rise in backward pressure of the pulmonary vein. Persistently elevated pulmonary&#xD;
      venous pressure can favor fragmentation of the structure and result in &quot;alveolar capillary&#xD;
      stress failure,&quot; accompanied by capillary leakage and acute alveolar edema. This acute phase&#xD;
      is reversible, but long-term persistence of high pulmonary venous pressure may provocate some&#xD;
      degree of irreversible remodeling of the alveolar capillary membrane, with excessive&#xD;
      deposition of type IV collagen. Plus, chronic elevated pulmonary venous pressure&#xD;
      progressively and passively increases PAP and concomitantly produces pathological changes in&#xD;
      pulmonary veins. and arteries, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance . The&#xD;
      pathophysiology of PH in VHD thus involves progressive structural alteration of the pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular bed mediated by the potent vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 . An increase in&#xD;
      pulmonary-arterial vasoconstriction and systolic PAP results into RV dilation and&#xD;
      hypertrophy. The RV failure is associated with tricuspid annulus dilation and an increase in&#xD;
      tricuspid regurgitation severity, which further acerbates RV dysfunction. At the&#xD;
      decompensated phase, systolic PAP can decrease despite the increase in pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      resistance, due to the fall in RV stroke volume related to advanced RV failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, the reversibility of PH depends on the type, severity, and chronicity of&#xD;
      VHD, as well as the underlying pathophysiological adaptations. For instance, in mitral&#xD;
      stenosis (MS), a rapid decrease in PAP is observed after relief of the stenosis, whereas a&#xD;
      longer time could be required in other VHDs, especially when PH is linked to volume overload,&#xD;
      as in mitral regurgitation (MR). Right ventricular function assessment The right ventricle&#xD;
      has long been neglected, yet it is RV function that is strongly associated with clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in many conditions. Although the left ventricle has been studied extensively, with&#xD;
      established normal values for dimensions, volumes, mass, and function, measures of RV size&#xD;
      and function are lacking. The relatively predictable left ventricular (LV) shape and&#xD;
      standardized imaging planes have helped establish norms in LV assessment. There are, however,&#xD;
      limited data regarding the normal dimensions of the right ventricle, in part because of its&#xD;
      complex shape. The right ventricle is composed of 3 distinct portions: the smooth muscular&#xD;
      inflow (body), the outflow region, and the trabecular apical region. Volumetric&#xD;
      quantification of RV function is challenging because of the many assumptions required. As a&#xD;
      result, many physicians rely on visual estimation to assess RV size and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basics of RV dimensions and function were included as part of the ASE and European&#xD;
      Association of Echocardiography recommendations for chamber quantification published in 2005.&#xD;
      This document, however, focused on the left heart, with only a small section covering the&#xD;
      right-sided chambers. Since this publication, there have been significant advances in the&#xD;
      echocardiographic assessment of the right heart. In addition, there is a need for greater&#xD;
      dissemination of details regarding the standardization of the RV echocardiographic&#xD;
      examination .&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERIOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE RV In cardiac surgery, right heart catheterization and&#xD;
      echocardiography play an essential and complementary role in the assessment of RV structure&#xD;
      and function. Both provide useful information that may help tailor the anesthetic and&#xD;
      surgical approach and provide guidance in the management of hemodynamically unstable&#xD;
      patients. Hemodynamically, Right ventricular dysfunction or failure is usually recognized in&#xD;
      the presence of a right atrial pressure (RAP) _8-10 mm Hg or a RAP to pulmonary capillary&#xD;
      wedge pressure _0.8 (isolated RV failure) and/or a low cardiac index (_2.2 L _ min_1 _ m_2).&#xD;
      Increasing RAP may also be a sign of impeding RV failure. echocardiography also provides&#xD;
      useful information on RV and pulmonary structure, valvular function and pericardial&#xD;
      physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The echocardiographic evaluation of the RV is more challenging than that of the left&#xD;
      ventricle. The main difficulties encountered may be explained by 1) the complex shape of the&#xD;
      RV, 2) heavy apical trabeculations of the RV, which limits endocardial surface recognition,&#xD;
      and 3) the marked load dependence of several indices of RV function. Despite these&#xD;
      limitations, a comprehensive assessment of the RV may provide important data into its&#xD;
      contractility, preload, and afterload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly and as recommended by the American society of Echocardiography Endorsed by the&#xD;
      European Association of Echocardiography, a registered branch of the European Society of&#xD;
      Cardiology, and the Canadian Society of Echocardiography in 2010 guidelines all studies, the&#xD;
      sonographer and physician should examine the right heart using multiple acoustic windows, and&#xD;
      the report should represent an assessment based on qualitative and quantitative parameters.&#xD;
      The parameters to be performed and reported should include a measure of right ventricular&#xD;
      (RV) size, right atrial (RA) size, RV systolic function (at least one of the following:&#xD;
      fractional area change [FAC], S', and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion [TAPSE];&#xD;
      with or without RV index of myocardial performance [RIMP]), and systolic pulmonary artery&#xD;
      (PA) pressure (SPAP) with estimate of RA pressure on the basis of inferior vena cava (IVC)&#xD;
      size and collapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So in this study we will focus on right ventricular function and performance after performing&#xD;
      Mitral valve replacement to the rheumatic heart disease patients associated with pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension either mild or severe, to put a hand on the extent of benefit the patient who&#xD;
      developed pulmonary hypertension will get from mitral valve replacement as regard function&#xD;
      improvement and remodeling of the right ventricle and the proper timing of surgery.&#xD;
