  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by local excision&#xD;
      and post-operative chemoradiotherapy in patients with early stage, low rectal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
      After completion of pre-treatment tests/procedures (including pelvic MRI/ERUS; MRI is&#xD;
      mandatory at baseline and other imaging is encouraged) and confirmation of eligibility,&#xD;
      systemic therapy with FOLFOX will be administered for 12 weeks. 2 to 4 weeks after the&#xD;
      chemotherapy, restaging of the primary tumor will be done to evaluate response to therapy&#xD;
      (Pelvic MRI and /or sigmoidoscopy). Patients with disease progression or inadequate response&#xD;
      to chemotherapy to allow local excision will continue with evaluation and treatment per the&#xD;
      current standard of care (chemoradiation followed by TME). These patients will be considered&#xD;
      failures for the primary endpoint of the study. Patients who respond to the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy will proceed with local excision (open, TEMS or TAMIS), 6-12 weeks after the&#xD;
      completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by 5-FU based chemoradiotherapy 4-12 weeks&#xD;
      after local excision. Patients with positive margins at the time of local excision will also&#xD;
      be treated as per standard of care and will be considered as failures. Number of patients who&#xD;
      can undergo successful local excision with this approach will define the success of the&#xD;
      strategy. After chemoradiation therapy post local excision, patients will be followed closely&#xD;
      every 3 months for the first 3 years and then every 2 months for the next 2 years&#xD;
      (history/physical, CEA and pelvic MRI). Patients who are deemed failures for the primary&#xD;
      end-point will be followed as per standard of care, off-study.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the lower rectum (lower border â‰¤6 cm from anal&#xD;
