  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies whether it is feasible to conduct a detailed molecular&#xD;
      profile of triple negative breast cancer as part of a treatment strategy that asks whether or&#xD;
      not we can lower the chance of breast cancer growing or spreading, by treating with a&#xD;
      combination of PARP inhibitor how well (olaparib) and immune therapy (durvalumab). Olaparib&#xD;
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Giving olaparib and durvalumab may work better in treating participants with&#xD;
      metastatic triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the feasibility of completing Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)&#xD;
      analytics on pre-treatment biopsy within a planned 4-week window for enrolled participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess safety and tolerability of the proposed therapy. II. Assess response to treatment.&#xD;
      III. Determine the time to disease progression following study therapy. IV. Determine&#xD;
      survival of participants enrolled on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Examine response rates depending on tumor characteristics. II. Identify predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers of sensitivity to therapy. III. Identify emerging mechanism of resistance to&#xD;
      therapy tumor markers of emergence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine changes in tumor cells induced by PARP inhibitors. V. Identify tumor markers&#xD;
      suggestive of combinatorial therapy that could r overcome resistance to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive olaparib orally (PO) twice a day (BID) for 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants then receive olaparib PO BID on&#xD;
      days 1-28 and durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28&#xD;
      days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Participants may continue on therapy beyond disease progression at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 6 months for 1 year.&#xD;

    <description>Using the feasibility analysis set, the proportion of the completed CLIA analytics within 4 weeks (i.e., from day 1, cycle 1 up to day 1 cycle 2 of on-study treatment regimen will be estimated relative to all screened participants who undergo a first biopsy with a 95% confidence interval.</description>

    <description>The incidence of having grade 3+ acute toxicity will be determined for participants with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) that received at least one dose of olaparib and durvalumab in combination. The 95% confidence interval will be reported with the point estimate of toxicity rate.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical benefit rate (CBR) for olaparib in combination with durvalumab</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>CBR is defined as the percentage of participants who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease (i.e., CR + Pr + SD) at 6 months post-treatment. The probability of having CBR will be measured and reported (if available) with 95% exact confidence interval.</description>

The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented. If a participant dies, irrespective of cause, without documentation of recurrent or progressive disease beforehand, then the date of death will be used to denote the response end date.</description>
