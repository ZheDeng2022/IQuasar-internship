    <textblock>
      Introduction. Heart failure (HF) is the most prevailing chronic illness in the world. In&#xD;
      Colombia, high morbidity and mortality rates because of HF are registered, as well as a&#xD;
      significant burden of symptoms, frequent hospitalizations, poor quality of life, significant&#xD;
      consumption of health resources and early mortality. It is necessary to propose novel&#xD;
      strategies that can change the current picture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: determine the efficacy of an intervention centered in decision taking for the&#xD;
      handling of symptoms in adults with HF who live in the department of Cordoba, Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis: the intervention Decision taking for the handling of symptoms in adults&#xD;
      with HF: 1) Increases self-care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis: 1) reduces clinical events: emergency care and hospitalizations, 3)&#xD;
      Improves quality of life related to health.&#xD;

      Intervention: The theoretic approach of the Theory of the Specific Situation Self-care in HF&#xD;
      was used for the design of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplier/dosage/duration. The intervention was given by the researcher (nurse trained in the&#xD;
      intervention protocol) in three doses, each contact lasts 60 minutes. Frequency: sessions are&#xD;
      given once a week during a one-month period (duration). Nurse controls are implemented after&#xD;
      the intervention after one month and three months. There is also telephonic accompaniment on&#xD;
      application of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery method/environment. Verbal: Individual face to face. Printed educational written&#xD;
      material type brochure, outpatient clinic of a health institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: inclusion criteria: adults (over the age of 18 years), more than two months of&#xD;
      having been diagnosed; functional New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II - III, left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction reduced (&lt;40%). Cognitive state conservation (Lobo cognitive&#xD;
      mini exam - MEC-35). Absence or low co-morbidity (Charlson index). Exclusion criteria: acute&#xD;
      HF, advanced HF&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: The study was designed to have a 90% output, (alpha = 0.05), an expected difference&#xD;
      of 0.5 in the outcome score of the management and maintenance evaluation in both groups, a&#xD;
      standard deviation of outcome scores of 1.0, a correlation average between the first and the&#xD;
      second evaluation of 0.2 and a rate of wear of 20%. Therefore, the required final sample size&#xD;
      was 124 (62 per group - theoretic sample).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study: 176 adults with HF were recruited. 114 entered the study. 62 were excluded (did&#xD;
      not meet the inclusion criteria (n=39), did not want to participate (=14), other reasons&#xD;
      (n=9)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. Table of random numbers without repetition. The Participants randomly assigned&#xD;
      to the control group CG (n=57) received the standard attention, including standard education&#xD;
      given by attention providers, and the ones assigned to the intervention group IG (n=57)&#xD;
      received the intervention protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information collection (research assistant). The study registers information in the following&#xD;
      time points: beginning (base line), follow up after a month (outpatient appointment), follow&#xD;
      up after 3 months (outpatient appointment). The study is classified as simple blind; the&#xD;
      research assistant, who is in charge of applying the instrument measuring the effect of the&#xD;
      intervention, will remain blinded during the whole study regarding the group assigned to each&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk control. Compliance with methodological recommendations used to guarantee reliability&#xD;
      and validity of the research studies proving a clinic intervention for behavioral changes. A&#xD;
      plan is being contemplated that includes goals and strategies to monitor and counter possible&#xD;
      threats to internal and external validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects. Compliance with universal ethical principles for research on humans,&#xD;
      according to international ethical guidelines - CIOMS, national regulations, informed consent&#xD;
      and deontological Nursing responsibilities in Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis framework Excel database - SPSS Program analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Descriptive analysis of the total sample and by groups (intervention and control):&#xD;
           absolute and relative frequency distributions; median and standard deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data normality analysis: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test Statistical analysis for independent&#xD;
           samples a) difference of proportions: X2, b) difference of means: t for student, c)&#xD;
           difference of medians: U test of Mann - Whitney. In all cases a statistic significance&#xD;
           will be assumed if the value p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intrasubject and intergroup analysis: ANOVA with repeated measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hypothesis proof: W of Mauchly test. When the sphericity premise is fulfilled, test F&#xD;
           will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Analysis of possible confusion and/or interaction effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Stratified analysis: X2 of Mantel-Haenszel (M-H),&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Logistic regression analysis. Stepwise method. Minimum change % considered as&#xD;
                favorable (≥20=1, ≤19=0).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Analysis of the magnitude of the intervention's effect. Improvement of at least 20% of&#xD;
           the score on the scale, with the analysis principle of the intention of trying. The&#xD;
           absolute increase in benefit and the necessary number for treatment (NNT) will be&#xD;
           calculated afterwards.&#xD;

    <description>The Self-Care of Heart Failure Index is a measure of self-care defined as a naturalistic decision making process involving the choice of behaviors that maintain physiologic stability and the response to symptoms when they occur. A score of ≥70 can be used as the cut-point to judge self-care adequacy.&#xD;
We strongly discourage users from calculating a total, combined SCHFI score. Instead, the data will be far more useful if the scales (maintenance, management, confidence) are used individually. Each scale is standardized to a score of 100.&#xD;
Use the following formula to compute a standardized:&#xD;
Maintenance: (sum of Section A items - 10) * 3.333 Management: (sum of Section B items - 4) * 5 Confidence: (sum of Section C items - 6) * 5.56</description>

    <description>The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire is one of the most widely used health-related quality of life questionnaires for patients with heart failure (HF). It provides scores for two dimensions, physical and emotional, and a total score. Comprising 21 items rated on six-point Likert scales, representing different degrees of impact of HF on quality of life related to health, from 0 (none) to 5 (very much). It provides a total score (range 0-105, from best to worst HRQoL), as well as scores for two dimensions, physical (8 items, range 0-40) and emotional (5 items, range 0-25). The other eight items (of the totalof 21) are only considered for the calculation of the total score.&#xD;
The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire has been translated into and validated in Spanish - Colombia.</description>
