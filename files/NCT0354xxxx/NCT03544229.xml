  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment with 2 dose&#xD;
      levels of TAK-906 in adult participants with gastroparesis compared with placebo during 12&#xD;
      weeks of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-906. TAK-906 is being tested to treat&#xD;
      people who have symptomatic idiopathic or diabetic gastroparesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 205 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by&#xD;
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups (in 1:1:1 ratio) which&#xD;
      will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an&#xD;
      urgent medical need):&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAK-906 Maleate 5 mg (After implementation of Amendment 8, participants will not be further&#xD;
      randomized to this arm) TAK-906 Maleate 25 mg TAK-906 Maleate 50 mg Placebo (dummy inactive&#xD;
      pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to Amendment 8, participants were randomized to receive TAK-906 5 mg. After&#xD;
      implementation of Amendment 8, participants will not be further randomized to this dose arm.&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to take one capsule twice daily, at approximately the same&#xD;
      time each day throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall study duration is&#xD;
      approximately 17 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be&#xD;
      contacted by telephone 30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
