      Dermoscopy is a non-invasive method that allows evaluation of colors and microstructures of&#xD;
      the epidermis, the dermoepidermal junction, and the papillary dermis not visible to the naked&#xD;
      eye. These structures are specifically correlated to histologic features. The identification&#xD;
      of specific diagnostic patterns related to the distribution of colors and dermoscopy&#xD;
      structures can better suggest a malignant or benign pigmented skin lesion. The use of this&#xD;
      technique provides a valuable aid in diagnosing pigmented skin lesions&#xD;

      Skin color affected by many agents as it is determined by several chromophores such as&#xD;
      melanin, hemoglobin and carotenoids. Among these, melanin is the main one responsible for&#xD;
      different skin colors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melanin is produced by special skin cells called melanocytes and packed in organelles called&#xD;
      melanosomes. Sometimes, human skin may present a non-uniform melanin distribution in two&#xD;
      different ways, leading to pigmentary disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first, melanin concentration increases to levels above normal resulting in&#xD;
      hypermelanosis. In the second, the melanin concentration decreases to levels below normal,&#xD;
      resulting in hypomelanosis.melanogenesis is acomplex process when disturbed ,it results into&#xD;
      various pigmentary disorders either hypo or hyper pigmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These disorders may be congenital or acquired, permenant or temporary, systemic or region&#xD;
      restricted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pigmentary disorders are include alarge number of heterogenous conditions that are usually&#xD;
      characterized by altered melanocyte density, melanin concentration, or both, and result in&#xD;
      altered pigmentation of the skin. Some of these disorders are extremely common such as&#xD;
      (melisma and vitiligo), whereas others are rare&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differential Diagnosis of Hyper and Hypopigmentation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperpigmentation Hypopigmentation Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (acne, psoriasis,&#xD;
      atopic and contact dermatitis, lichen planus, trauma, drugs, and fixed-drug eruptions)&#xD;
      Melasma Solar lentigines Ephelides (freckles) Caf√©-au-lait macules Nevi Melanoma and&#xD;
      precursors Acquired (common) Vitiligo Pityriasis alba Tinea versicolor Postinflammatory&#xD;
      hypopigmentation Congenital (uncommon) Albinism Piebaldism Tuberous sclerosis Hypomelanosis&#xD;
      of Ito&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that dermoscopy may come in very handy for assisting the&#xD;
      noninvasive diagnosis of various general dermatological disorders, including scalp/hair&#xD;
      diseases (trichoscopy) , nail/nailfold abnormalities (onychoscopy) , cutaneous&#xD;
      infections/infestations (entomodermoscopy) and inflammatory dermatoses (inflammoscopy) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dermoscopy is a non-invasive method that allows evaluation of colors and microstructures of&#xD;
      the epidermis, the dermoepidermal junction, and the papillary dermis not visible to the naked&#xD;
      eye. These structures are specifically correlated to histologic features. The identification&#xD;
      of specific diagnostic patterns related to the distribution of colors and dermoscopy&#xD;
      structures can better suggest a malignant or benign pigmented skin lesion. The use of this&#xD;
      technique provides a valuable aid in diagnosing pigmented skin lesions, This traditionally&#xD;
      consists of a magnifier , a non-polarised light source, a transparent plate and a liquid&#xD;
      medium between the instrument and the skin .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increasing use of dermoscopy in general dermatology can be partially explained by&#xD;
      commercially available new generations of handheld dermoscopes, which are small enough to be&#xD;
      easily placed in every dermatologist's pocket . It is a safe and rapid diagnostic tool that&#xD;
      assists in clinical examination and management decision in dermatology&#xD;
