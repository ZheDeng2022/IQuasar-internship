    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase II study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a large scale&#xD;
      trial which will evaluate the effectiveness of static magnetic field therapy as a treatment&#xD;
      for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. This preliminary study will determine which of three strength&#xD;
      magnets to use in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from three primary sources. 1) Patients with a possible&#xD;
      diagnosis of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome who have been referred to the Orthopaedic and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Clinics of OHSU for Nerve conduction studies. If after conducting these&#xD;
      studies a potential participant shows evidence of mild to moderate Carpal Tunnel Syndrome&#xD;
      s/he will be informed about the study and invited to participate in additional screening. B)&#xD;
      Patients seen at the National College of Natural Medicine (NCNM) Clinics who have a clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome will be informed about the study and invited to enter the&#xD;
      screening process for further eligibility. C) Participants will also be recruited from the&#xD;
      general public including staff and students at OHSU and NCNM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility will be determined through a stepwise process including telephone screening for&#xD;
      general eligibility, Nerve Conduction screening for electrodiagnostic eligibility, and Boston&#xD;
      Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire screening for symptom severity eligibility. Those potential&#xD;
      participants who meet all eligibility requirements will be randomized to one of three&#xD;
      magnetic field dosages. They will be provided with a Â¾&quot; diameter x 1/8&quot; thick magnet which&#xD;
      they will be required to apply for six weeks during the hours of sleep. Over the course of&#xD;
      the study participants will have four visits to the General Clinical Research Center of OHSU&#xD;
      and three visits to the Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Clinics of OHSU for Nerve Conduction&#xD;
      studies to be performed by either Dr. Nels Carlson or Dr. Hans Carlson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires to be completed during the course of the study include a general health&#xD;
      information and demographics questionnaire, the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire, which&#xD;
      will be completed on six occasions, a general symptoms checklist and a Post Treatment&#xD;
      Participant satisfaction questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment, retention, compliance and safety will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
      Effectiveness of the three different strength magnets will be assessed by comparing&#xD;
      participants' baseline scores on the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire with their scores&#xD;
      after six weeks of magnet use.&#xD;
