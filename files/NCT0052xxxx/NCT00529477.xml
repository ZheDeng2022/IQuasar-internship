      The objective of this study is to examine the functional effects of methacholine challenge on&#xD;
      small airways using three different nebulizers to generate particles with HMAD suitable for&#xD;
      distribution in small, intermediate and large airways.Pulmonary function will be assessed&#xD;
      using plethysmography and impulse oscillation techniques. Eight asthmatic subjects (&gt;18&#xD;
      years, both sexes) who are stable clinically and require only intermittent ß2-agonist&#xD;
      treatment will be recruited to undergo methacholine challenges for an in vivo, dose-finding&#xD;
      observational study. Three separate methacholine challenges will be carried out using each of&#xD;
      the three different nebulizers. After each challenge, pulmonary function tests will be&#xD;
      performed on subjects to assess functional changes in large and small airways. Results of the&#xD;
      tests will be compared between the three nebulizers. These experiments will demonstrate&#xD;
      whether or not functional changes occur in small airways in response to methacholine, as&#xD;
      measured by pulmonary function tests after selectively targeting small airways using the&#xD;
      nebulizer which generates small particles. The results from these experiments will give us a&#xD;
      better understanding of the role of small airways in methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction&#xD;
      in asthmatics, and will compare sensitivity of plethysmography compared to forced oscillation&#xD;
      for detecting changes in small airways.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will measure changes in small airways by plethysmography and impulse oscillation&#xD;
      following delivery of methacholine using nebulizers designed to deliver to the small&#xD;
      (Wright), intermediate (PARI LC® Plus) and large (PARI SinuStar™ ) airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of small airways involvement by plethysmography will include Residual Volume (RV),&#xD;
      Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Peak Inspiratory and Expiratory Flow rates (PIF and PEF,&#xD;
      respectively). Impulse oscillation will include measures of large and small airways&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Spirometry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline FEV1 and VC will be registered using a water spirometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methacholine Challenge (Screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methacholine inhalation will be performed as described by Cockcroft (1996). Subjects are&#xD;
      instructed to wear noseclips and to breathe normally from the mouthpiece during the 2-minute&#xD;
      inhalation period. Subjects inhale normal saline, then doubling concentrations of&#xD;
      methacholine from a Wright nebulizer for 2 minutes each. FEV1 is measured at 30, 90, 180 and&#xD;
      300 seconds after each inhalation. Spirometry is measured with a Collins water sealed&#xD;
      spirometer and kymograph. The test is terminated when a fall in FEV1 of 20% of the baseline&#xD;
      value occurs, and the methacholine PC20 is calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methacholine Challenge&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second visit, subjects will be randomized to inhale from a nebulizer that&#xD;
      generates particles with HMAD suitable for distribution either in small, intermediate or&#xD;
      large airways. Subjects will inhale doubling concentrations of methacholine for 2 minutes&#xD;
      each. Immediately after each inhalation, pulmonary function tests will be performed on the&#xD;
      subjects via plethysmography. Measurements will be made at intervals of 30 seconds, 60&#xD;
      seconds, 3 minutes and 5 minutes (or until a fall in FEV1 of 20% or more of baseline is&#xD;
      reached). The methacholine test is terminated when a fall in FEV1 of 20% or more of the&#xD;
      baseline value is reached. After a recovery time of 1 hour, the same doses will be&#xD;
      re-administered and pulmonary function tests will again be performed, this time via impulse&#xD;
      oscillation. The same procedure will be repeated for the third and fourth visits with the&#xD;
      remaining nebulizers (selected randomly). The nebulizers that will be used to target certain&#xD;
      airways are the Wright nebulizer (small), the PARI LC® Plus nebulizer (medium) and the PARI&#xD;
      SinuStar™ nebulizer (large).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plethysmography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function tests will be performed on subjects after methacholine challenges via&#xD;
      plethysmography. Various tests will be performed that will allow for different lung function&#xD;
      measures. To characterize which measurements are indicative of large or small airways&#xD;
      function, measurements from the three nebulizer groups will be compared. Potential measures&#xD;
      of small airway function include Functional Residual Capacity (FRC), Residual Volume (RV),&#xD;
      Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Peak Inspiratory and Expiratory Flow Rates (PIF and PEF,&#xD;
      respectively) (Knudson et al., 1980). Nitrogen washout will also be performed with the body&#xD;
      box to measure airway distensibility, or the relationship between airway caliber and lung&#xD;
      volume (Brown et al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impulse Oscillation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function tests will be performed on subjects after methacholine challenges via&#xD;
      impulse oscillation. This device uses a loudspeaker to generate pressure and flow and by&#xD;
      generating these at various frequencies, specifically differentiates between large and small&#xD;
      airways obstruction (Otis et al., 1956). Results will be compared between the three nebulizer&#xD;
      groups after specifically targeting certain airways.&#xD;
