      The primary objective of this research is to pilot test a brief mental heath treatment&#xD;
      specifically tailored to meet the needs of chronically ill patients with anxiety and/or&#xD;
      depression. Using an open-trial format, the proposed study will examine the feasibility of a&#xD;
      brief psychosocial intervention. Primary outcomes will assess intervention effects on patient&#xD;
      and clinician rated symptoms of anxiety and depression. If proven feasible and effective&#xD;
      among this group of participants, the intervention (due to its brief format and focus on&#xD;
      medically ill patient needs) will possess unique characteristics that will increase the&#xD;
      ability of medical care settings to implement mental health treatments, and will provide&#xD;
      valuable pilot data for the development of a larger research project to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of this intervention among a larger group of chronically ill patients relative to&#xD;
      usual care.&#xD;

      Select one category that most adequately describes your research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discuss the research design including but not limited to such issues as: probability of group&#xD;
      assignment, potential for subject to be randomized to placebo group, use of control subjects,&#xD;
      etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project is designed to pilot test the feasibility of a brief psychosocial&#xD;
      intervention among depressed and/or anxious medical patients with confirmed symptoms of COPD&#xD;
      and/or CHF causing significant impairment as ascertained by validated surveys. We will test&#xD;
      the intervention with an open-trial format. Therefore, all patients who meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria described below will receive the intervention. Group assignment, randomization, and&#xD;
      use of control subjects are not applicable to this pilot research project. Data will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline, post-treatment (8 weeks), and at 3 month follow-up. Trained members of&#xD;
      the study staff will conduct assessments, intervention and follow-up sessions following a&#xD;
      protocol. A licensed psychologist will supervise all members of the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F2. Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Procedures: Patients with COPD and CHF who meet criteria for clinically&#xD;
      significant physical and emotional symptoms will be recruited. Recruitment of potential&#xD;
      participants (detailed further in Section J) will occur through database extractions (e.g.&#xD;
      ICD-9 codes), primary care provider referrals, and specialty care provider referrals (e.g.&#xD;
      cardiology and pulmonology). Patients will then be contacted via letter, which provides basic&#xD;
      information about the study. If no response from the person is received within 5 days, a&#xD;
      study research assistant will contact the person via telephone to determine if they are&#xD;
      interested and eligible for participation in the study. These procedures are currently being&#xD;
      used in related IRB approved studies H#19681 &quot;Mental Health Treatment Engagement In CHF&#xD;
      Patients With Depression And Anxiety&quot;, and H-19629 &quot;Identifying Mental Health Treatment&#xD;
      Barriers in Medically Ill Older Adults&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone Screening: A trained research assistant will administer the 15 minute telephone&#xD;
      screen. Prior to the initiation of the telephone screen, patients will be provided with study&#xD;
      informed consent and patient verbal assent will be obtained. Following consent, patients will&#xD;
      be asked a series of questions to assess: patient information (e.g. demographic data),&#xD;
      symptoms of heart failure and/or symptoms of COPD, cognitive functioning (6-item screener),&#xD;
      and brief mental health service use history. The RA will also determine eligibility by&#xD;
      administering five items from the PRIME-MD to screen for anxiety and depression. Given its&#xD;
      high sensitivity to detect depression and anxiety, use of the PRIME-MD will reduce the number&#xD;
      of patients without symptoms of depression or anxiety unnecessarily attending in-person&#xD;
      interview. If the patient meets study eligibility, they will be invited to attend an&#xD;
      in-person study interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-person Screening: Initial screen eligible patients will be invited to an in-person&#xD;
      appointment where final eligibility will be determined and baseline assessment measures&#xD;
      completed. All appointments will take place at the designated research site. Demographic&#xD;
      information will be collected for: age, gender, ethnicity, household income, marital status,&#xD;
      education, employment status, and current/past smoking (e.g. pack years). Medical history&#xD;
      information will be collected for: date of onset/diagnosis of CHF and/or COPD, current&#xD;
      medication usage, and history of other significant illness. The MINI psychiatric interview&#xD;
      will be used to determine the presence of DSM-IV Axis I disorders. Symptoms of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression will be assessed using self-report and clinician rated instruments to determine&#xD;
      final eligibility. Other baseline measures will include assessments for psychiatric diagnoses&#xD;
      (semi-structured clinical interview), quality of life (disease specific and general), and&#xD;
      health service utilization (by patient self-report). All patients who meet the eligibility&#xD;
      requirements described in Section F will be invited to receive the intervention. A study&#xD;
      clinician will initiate contact with the patient via telephone and subsequently set up an&#xD;
      initial treatment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intervention is a psychosocial treatment that was specifically developed to&#xD;
      address the mental health and quality of life needs for chronically ill patients. As such the&#xD;
      intervention contains a number of unique characteristics that are designed to better address&#xD;
      the mental and physical health needs of these patients. It is a skills-based intervention&#xD;
      that matches patients' expressed desire for improved quality of life within focused&#xD;
      intervention modules based on their symptom profile and preferences for care. Modules are&#xD;
      guided by a symptom-based algorithm but ultimately patients choose the intervention focus&#xD;
      with the clinician serving as a consultant or guide. All patients receive two core modules&#xD;
      focused on increasing awareness and controlling symptoms that emphasizes the overlap and&#xD;
      distinction between mental health and physical heath symptoms. At the conclusion of the core&#xD;
      modules, patients work with their study clinician to set initial goals for improving quality&#xD;
      of life. Goals need not be restricted to &quot;mental health&quot; (e.g. reducing symptoms of&#xD;
      depression or anxiety) but can also focus on stress and concerns about their physical&#xD;
      condition (e.g. improving functioning and general quality of life by actively coping with a&#xD;
      chronic medical illness). Following the core modules, patients are provided with a series of&#xD;
      module choices from which they select skills training that matches their current and most&#xD;
      pressing needs. Collectively, the active treatment phase is provided over 6 weekly sessions&#xD;
      (2 core sessions and 4 elective module sessions). Each session is followed by a brief&#xD;
      telephone follow-up that occurs between 1 and 3 days before the next session. At the&#xD;
      conclusion of the active treatment phase, the participant will receive three follow-up&#xD;
      telephone calls at weeks 8, 10, and 12 (referred to as booster telephone calls) to review&#xD;
      skills, encourage continued practice, and facilitate consolidation of treatment gains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: Data will be collected at baseline, post-treatment (8 weeks), and at 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
