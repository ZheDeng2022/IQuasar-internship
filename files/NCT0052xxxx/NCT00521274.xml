  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of combination therapy with Trovax plus&#xD;
      Docetaxel or Docetaxel alone in patients with prostate cancer with a rising prostate specific&#xD;
      antigen (PSA).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel is the most active chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trovax is vaccine that targets 5T4 receptors on tumor cells. 5T4 has been detected in the&#xD;
      majority of primary prostate cancers. Based on pre-clinical and clinical data, it may be&#xD;
      advantageous to administer a cancer vaccine before chemotherapy to enhance immune responses,&#xD;
      thus leading to a more therapeutic approach for patients with metastatic androgen independent&#xD;
      prostate cancer (AIPC).&#xD;
