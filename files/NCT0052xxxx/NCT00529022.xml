      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if giving azacitidine with valproic&#xD;
      acid plus carboplatin can help control advanced cancer. The safety of this treatment will be&#xD;
      studied as well. Researchers will also collect some extra blood samples for molecular marker&#xD;
      studies (studies that may help researchers predict how participants respond to the combined&#xD;
      therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were to be two phases of this study: a Phase 1 portion to find acceptable doses of the&#xD;
      study drug combination, and a Phase 2 portion to study the response rates to the treatment&#xD;
      schedule. The study did not proceed to the Phase 2 portion.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if the combination of azacitidine, carboplatin, and valproic may work&#xD;
      better together to control advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Azacitidine is designed to activate (&quot;turn on&quot;) certain genes in cancer cells whose job&#xD;
           is to fight tumors, which may also make azacitidine work better with other anti-tumor&#xD;
           drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carboplatin is designed to block the growth of cancer cells by stopping cell division,&#xD;
           which may cause the cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Valproic acid is an anti-seizure medication that may also have cancer-fighting&#xD;
           abilities. This drug may be able to activate tumor-fighting genes, causing cancer cells&#xD;
           to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (Dose Escalation) and Phase 2 (Treatment):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled on Phase 1 of the study in groups of 3. Each group will receive&#xD;
      a different combination of the study drugs. If the first group of 3 tolerates the study drug&#xD;
      combination well, the next group of 3 will be enrolled, and their dose(s) of carboplatin&#xD;
      and/or valproic acid will be higher than the last group. Each new group will get a higher&#xD;
      dose of carboplatin and/or valproic acid. If 1 of the 3 participants has a serious side&#xD;
      effect at a certain dose level, 3 more participants may be added at that dose level to check&#xD;
      the safety of the combination. If no more participants at that dose level have serious side&#xD;
      effects, the next dose level will be tested. However, if a second participant has a serious&#xD;
      side effect, then the dose level before that one will be considered the &quot;maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose&quot; (MTD). Once the MTD is found, participants will be enrolled on Phase 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled on Phase 2 were to be given the MTD level of the study drug&#xD;
      combination; however, study did not progress to Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants on both phases were to have the same treatment schedule and study tests&#xD;
      performed. The only difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was to be the dose level of the&#xD;
      study drug combination being given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If eligible, participants received the study treatment on a 28-day treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle, they receive an injection of azacitidine just under the skin or by&#xD;
      vein over 30 minutes once a day for 5 days in a row.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 3 and Day 10 of each cycle, they receive carboplatin by vein over 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 5-11 of each cycle, they take valproic acid by mouth once a day with or without food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 12 of each cycle, they may receive an injection of NeulastaTM (pegfilgrastim) just&#xD;
      under the skin, depending on whether the study doctor thinks it is needed to help boost your&#xD;
      white blood cell count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 13-28 of each cycle, they have a &quot;rest period&quot; from the study drugs before beginning&#xD;
      a new 28-day cycle of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At certain time points, they have the following tests/procedure performed during study&#xD;
      visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 5 and Day 11 of Cycles 1-3, about 1 tablespoon of blood drawn before treatment for&#xD;
      molecular marker studies. These tests will be performed to look for a link between genetic&#xD;
      characteristics and response to the study drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the last 72 hours (3 days) of each cycle, blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon) and urine&#xD;
      collected for routine tests. After the start of each cycle, blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon)&#xD;
      once weekly for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 7 days before starting each new cycle, evaluation to see if you may be experiencing&#xD;
      any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of every 2 cycles (about every 8 weeks), an x-ray and either a CT scan or an&#xD;
      MRI scan to re-evaluate the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue to receive treatment on this study, as long as the disease does&#xD;
      not get worse and you do not experience any intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once treatment has ended for any reason, participants will come back for an end-of-treatment&#xD;
      visit to have the following tests/procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a complete physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have urine collected and blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon) for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may have a CT scan or an MRI scan to remeasure and re-evaluate the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 65 patients were eligible to take part in this study. All were to be enrolled at M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson. Study halted after Phase 1 without progressing to second phase.&#xD;
