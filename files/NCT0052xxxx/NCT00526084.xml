      Emerging results suggest that a cure rate of nearly 90 percent will be attained in the near&#xD;
      future. The advance was attributed to stringent application of prognostic factors for risk&#xD;
      factor-directed therapy. Early response to treatment has greater prognostic strength than&#xD;
      does any other biologic or clinical feature tested to dates. The measurement of minimal&#xD;
      residual disease(MRD) affords a level of sensitivity and specificity that cannot be attained&#xD;
      through traditional microscopic morphologic assessments. In Taiwan, detection for the most&#xD;
      recurrent fusion genes and the MRD were not commonly available, the TPOG(Taiwan Pediatric&#xD;
      Oncology Group) used clinical features, immunophenotypes, and cytogenetics to do risk group&#xD;
      classifications and protocol assignment. A successful rate of 60-70% has been reached. In&#xD;
      order to improve the cure rate of ALL in Taiwan, this project aims at establishing the&#xD;
      methods for better risk classifications and establishing MRD detection for risk-directed&#xD;
      therapy for childhood ALL in Taiwan.Intrinsic and acquired resistances to multiple anticancer&#xD;
      agents represent major obstacles and accounts for 10-20% of treatment failure in the&#xD;
      developed countries nowadays. Recent progress using DNA microarray identified differential&#xD;
      expression level of the genes known to implicate in cell cycle control, DNA repair and&#xD;
      apoptosis in different subsets of ALL patients, which were found to be related to drug&#xD;
      response. Genetic polymorphisms in the genes of drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters&#xD;
      or drug targets, can influence the efficacy or toxicity of antileukemic agents. Specific&#xD;
      genotype might be important in determining the pharmacokinetic effects of one population or&#xD;
      disease subtype from that in others. Recently, the expression profiles of relatively few&#xD;
      microRNAs (miRNAs) (~200 genes), was noted to accurately classify human cancers. These&#xD;
      informations hinted that expression of the genes in the leukemic cells might serve as&#xD;
      additional risk factors for treatment stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims and goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to establish better risk factors classification and use MRD to monitor early response to&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to establish the expression profiles of 12 genes associated with drug resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to unravel the pharmacogenetic background of pediatric ALL in Taiwan, so that will help&#xD;
           refine the therapy dose, achieve a better drug effect and avoid acute or chronic&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the 1990s, the five-year event-free survival rates for childhood ALL generally ranged from&#xD;
      70 to 83 percent in developed countries, with an overall cure rate of approximately 80&#xD;
      percent. Emerging results suggest that a cure rate of nearly 90 percent will be attained in&#xD;
      the near future. Progress in the treatment of ALL, however, has been made largely by the&#xD;
      optimization of the use of existing medicines rather than by the discovery of new agents.&#xD;
      These factors predicting clinical outcomes include treatment regime, clinical features,&#xD;
      global gene expression patterns and genetics of leukemia cells, host pharmacodynamics and&#xD;
      pharmacogenetics, early response to treatment. In Taiwan, detection the most recurrent fusion&#xD;
      gene occurred in ALL were not popular applied yet. Minimal residual disease (MRD) detection&#xD;
      is not commonly available for the evaluation of initial response to chemotherapy protocol we&#xD;
      have assigned. The TPOG (Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group) use only clinical features (age, PB&#xD;
      white blood counts, immunophenotypes, and cytogenetics) to assign the protocols. Only around&#xD;
      60-70% of patients were successful treated. The ultimate goal of this project is to establish&#xD;
      the methods for better risk classifications for pediatric ALL patients in Taiwan in order&#xD;
      increase cure rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classification of childhood ALL by molecular methods Risk factors based on a patient's&#xD;
      physical manifestations or hematologic and biochemical tests have been largely replaced by&#xD;
      more specific tests of the biologic features of leukemic cells. The recently introduced World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) classification takes into consideration of morphologic and&#xD;
      immunologic features plus well-studied, common nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities that&#xD;
      clearly influence the laboratory and clinical features of ALL. Genetic makeup of the leukemic&#xD;
      cells has been recognized as the most important prognostic factors in childhood ALL. The most&#xD;
      frequent fusion gene TEL-AML1 (about 25% of the childhood B-ALL) which was caused by t(12;21)&#xD;
      and hyperdiploidy (&gt;50 chromosomes)(accounts for about 25% of B-ALL) were noticed to be&#xD;
      associated with favorable prognosis. The recurrent chromosome translocation changes/fusion&#xD;
      genes t(4;11)/MLL-AF4, t(9:22)/BCR-ABL, t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1 were recognized as adverse&#xD;
      prognostic factors. Recently, treatment of t(1;19) B-ALL with high dose chemotherapy gave&#xD;
      successful results. Cytogenetic analysis has been the standard method for identifying&#xD;
      chromosomal translocations in childhood ALL for many years. However, this approach is&#xD;
      technically difficult and takes at least two weeks to obtain the results. Undetermined&#xD;
      results were inevitable in a substantial proportion of cases. This is most prevalent in&#xD;
      patients with t(12; 21), which is not visible by routine cytogenetics examinations. A&#xD;
      multiplex RT-PCR assay for the detection of common chimeric transcripts TEL-AML1, MLL/AF4,&#xD;
      BCR-ABL , and E2A-PBX1 has been designed to classify pediatric ALL patients. The application&#xD;
      of this assay to routine clinical screening will significantly improve the clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      of childhood ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediction of the therapy-resistant leukemia clones---global gene expression pattern of the&#xD;
      leukemic cells Recent work indicates that global gene expression profiling using DNA&#xD;
      microarrays can identify genes with levels of expression that are related to drug response.&#xD;
      Significant differences in the expression of genes involved in cell-cycle regulation, DNA&#xD;
      repair, and apoptosis were noticed between diagnostic and early relapse samples or between&#xD;
      therapy-sensitive and therapy-resistant samples. These discoveries provide means to enhance&#xD;
      classification systems based on relapse hazard and to identify signaling pathways that wound&#xD;
      be potentially targeted with novel therapies. Holleman A et al used microarrays to&#xD;
      investigate the expression of 70 apoptosis genes and revealed that BCL2L13 expression was an&#xD;
      independent prognostic factor. Flotho C et al analyzed gene expression of diagnostic&#xD;
      lymphoblasts and compared the findings with MRD levels on days 19 and 46 of remission&#xD;
      induction therapy. Seventeen genes were identified to be significantly associated with MRD.&#xD;
      Caspase 8-associated protein 2 gene(CASP8AP2) was studied further and showed a strong&#xD;
      relationship with prognosis. The study of Cario et al demonstrated that low expression of TTK&#xD;
      was associated with poorer treatment response and the presence of MRD on both days 19 and 46&#xD;
      after chemotherapy. These studies demonstrated the association of apoptosis pathways with&#xD;
      treatment prognosis and treatment failure. These genes may serve as functionally-defined risk&#xD;
      factor for treatment stratification in addition to the currently used risk factors.Recent&#xD;
      evidence indicates that small non-protein-coding RNA molecules, microRNAs (miRNAs), might&#xD;
      function as tumor suppressors and oncogenes. A recent report by Cimmino et al showed that&#xD;
      miR-15a and miR-16-1 negatively regulate anti-apoptotic gene BCL2. Therefore, it is thought&#xD;
      that the deletion or down-regulation of mir-15a and mir-16-1 promotes leukaemogenesis and&#xD;
      lymphomagenesis in haematopoietic cells. These studies hint the oncogenesis roles the miRNA&#xD;
      might play. A report by Sonoki et a. also linked mir-125b-1 with leukemia. A recent report&#xD;
      from Lu J et al. found that the expression profiles of relatively few miRNAs (~200 genes),&#xD;
      accurately classify human cancers. They examined the miRNA profiles of 73 bone marrow samples&#xD;
      obtained from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Hierarchical clustering revealed&#xD;
      non-random partitioning of the samples into three major branches. This patter is similar to&#xD;
      the classification drawn by microarray analysis. Therefore, we expect that different microRNA&#xD;
      profile could be associated with drug resistancein childhood ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Host pharmacogenetics and genetic polymorphisms associated with drug metabolism, disposition,&#xD;
      chemotherapy cross-resistance, and complications Genetic polymorphisms of the&#xD;
      drug-metabolizing enzymes (drug transporters) or drug targets in ALL patients can influence&#xD;
      the efficacy or toxicity of antileukemic agents. The most intriguing example of&#xD;
      pharmacogenomic application was thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT). The purine analogs&#xD;
      antimetabolites, Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), interfere with nucleic acid&#xD;
      metabolism and cell proliferation and used to treat leukemia. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase&#xD;
      (TPMT) is a cytosolic enzyme that preferentially catalyzes the S-methylation and inactivation&#xD;
      of the purine analogs. About 90% of white and black persons have high TPM activity, and 10%&#xD;
      have intermediate activity caused by heterozygosity at the TPMT locus. About 1 out of 300&#xD;
      persons inherits TPMT deficiency. Clinical studies have established an inverse correlation&#xD;
      between TPMT activity and accumulation of the active thioguanine nucleotide metabolites of&#xD;
      mercaptopurine and azathioprine in erythrocytes. Accumulation of nucleotides usually leads to&#xD;
      severe hematopoietic toxicity and possibly death, but this outcome can be averted if the&#xD;
      thiopurine dose is decreased substantially (an 8- to 15-fold reduction). Patients who have&#xD;
      intermediate TPMT activity were at an intermediate risk for toxicity. To avoid bone marrow&#xD;
      toxicity in TPMT deficiency patients, a prospective measurement of erythrocyte TPMT activity&#xD;
      prior to therapy was advocated. However, TPMT assays are not easily available. The genetic&#xD;
      basis for TPMT deficiency can be defined and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods,&#xD;
      and has been well established to diagnose TPMT deficiency and heterozygosity in Western&#xD;
      countries to the adjustment thiopurine dose. Recently, the TPMT genotype was linked to early&#xD;
      ALL treatment response (MRD on day 78 after remission-induction therapy including&#xD;
      mercaptopurine for 4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other germ line polymorphisms in the MTX associated genes are plausibly linked to drug&#xD;
      resistance or prognosis of childhood ALL under current regimes. It may also affect the&#xD;
      development of de novo or therapy-related leukemias. The polymorphisms in the folate-related&#xD;
      genes MTHFR, MTRR, and SHMT1 are reported to relate to resistance to methotrexate in&#xD;
      childhood ALL. Rocha JC et al. found that the GSTM1 non-null and TYMS 3/3 genotype are linked&#xD;
      to drug resistance. It is important to investigate these common polymorphisms of patients in&#xD;
      Taiwan. We will detect these polymorphisms in Taiwan pediatric patients and revealed their&#xD;
      relationship with outcome and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods to monitor the early response to chemotherapy Response to therapy reflects the&#xD;
      genetics of leukemia cells and the pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenetics of the host, has&#xD;
      greater prognostic strength than does any other biologic or clinical feature tested to date.&#xD;
      The measurement of minimal residual disease, with the use of either flow cytometry or&#xD;
      quantitative reverse transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (Q-RT-PCR) analysis, affords a&#xD;
      level of sensitivity and specificity that cannot be attained through traditional morphologic&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simplified flow cytometric assay of CD19, CD10, and CD34 antigens on bone marrow&#xD;
      mononuclear cells on day 14 or 21 of remission induction therapy would provide the means to&#xD;
      achieve the goal of MRD detection and could be readily applied in centers with only minimal&#xD;
      laboratory resources (Coustan-Smith E et al).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Experimental Design A total of 160 ALL patients will be recruited&#xD;
      to this study as well as age-matched controls. Patients with newly diagnosed ALL and enrolled&#xD;
      on the TPOG ALL 2002 protocols and those previously diagnosed patients in the past 3 years&#xD;
      will be recruited under theirs or their parents' informed consent. For each patient, we will&#xD;
      prepare their total RNA and genomic DNA samples form the blast cells in the initial&#xD;
      diagnostic samples (leukemic cells from bone marrow aspirations and peripheral blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiplex RT-PCR for recurrent BCR-ABL, MLL-AF4, E2A-PBX1, and TEL-AML1 fusion genes will be&#xD;
      setup for the more specific initial prognostic factors assignment ALL patients. We will also&#xD;
      analyze the relationships between the presence of the 16 genetic polymorphisms on the 6&#xD;
      important drug-metabolizing genes (CYP3A4*1B (A&gt;G at position -392) and CYP3A5*3 (G&gt;A at&#xD;
      position 22893); GSTP1 313A&gt;G, GSTM1 deletion and GSTT1 deletion; MDR1 exon 21 (2677G&gt;T/A)&#xD;
      and MDR1 exon 26 (3435C&gt;T); MTHFR 677C&gt;T and MTHFR 1298A&gt;C; NR3C1 1088A&gt;G; RFC 80G&gt;A; TPMT&#xD;
      238G&gt;C, TPMT 460G&gt;A, and TPMT 719A&gt;G; TYMS enhancer repeat; UGT1A1 promoter repeat&#xD;
      polymorphism; VDR intron 8 G&gt;A, and VDR FokI (start-site) T&gt;C) and their influences in the&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of anti-leukemic agents received by the ALL eill be investigated.After&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy, flow cytometric assay to detect the MRD levels will be applied to&#xD;
      reflect the early response to initial chemotherapy protocols. A residual disease level of&#xD;
      less than 0.01 percent during or on completion of initial remission-induction therapy&#xD;
      reliably identifies patients with an exceptionally good treatment outcome. By contrast,&#xD;
      patients with a level of 1 percent or more at the end of remission-induction therapy or those&#xD;
      with a level of 0.1 percent or more at later times have a very high risk of relapse. Patients&#xD;
      who have a residual leukemia level of 0.01 percent or more after six weeks of&#xD;
      remission-induction therapy will be managed with intensified therapy protocols or seek&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation donors.The expression profile of 12 genes associated&#xD;
      with prognosis will be assayed (CASP8AP2, PTTG1, BCL2L13 BIRC5 (survivin), HRK TOP2A, TTK,&#xD;
      CCNB1, TNF, RAB5C, BCL7A GRP58). MicroRNA array profiles will be applied also.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical courses such as acute or chronic complicationswill be followed and recorded to&#xD;
      assess the relationships between these polymorphisms and clinical courses.&#xD;
