    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of REMEMBER-fX (HT1001, an&#xD;
      extract of Panax quinquefolius) in a human sample using standard clinical neuropsychological&#xD;
      instruments and side effects rating scales.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Panax ginseng has been used in Asia for thousands of years to improve vitality, wakefulness,&#xD;
      respiration, angina, nausea, attention, memory, and diminished libido. More recently, Panax&#xD;
      extracts have become one of the most popular commercial herbal dietary supplements in the&#xD;
      West as well. Unfortunately, a limited understanding of the bioactive ingredients within the&#xD;
      Panax extracts resulted in a wide spectrum of available products with no guidelines for&#xD;
      standardization. The lack of standardization undermined any legitimate attempt to validate&#xD;
      the claimed health benefits of the extracts. However, recent advances in the identification,&#xD;
      quantification, and standardization of extract components with demonstrated systemic and&#xD;
      neurological actions in animals have created a novel opportunity for the controlled clinical&#xD;
      investigation of some Panax extracts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant improvement in the standardization of Panax extracts occurred approximately 20&#xD;
      years ago with the introduction of a 4% minimum ginsenoside content in a formulation of Panax&#xD;
      ginseng C V Meyer under the trademark G115 by Pharmaton in Lugano Switzerland. This prompted&#xD;
      a series of investigations of short-term cognitive, physical, emotional, and psychosocial&#xD;
      benefits from a single dose of G115. Idiosyncratic cognitive gains were reported, but no&#xD;
      reliable benefits were observed in physical, emotional, or psychosocial status. Several&#xD;
      studies have examined the cognitive, physical, emotional, and psychosocial benefits from&#xD;
      sustained exposure to G115, but these studies are few in number and often failed to include&#xD;
      standardized behavioural measures or controlled Panax extracts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past five years, refinements in high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) have&#xD;
      allowed greater precision in Panax constituent analysis, with significant implications to the&#xD;
      investigation of the safety and efficacy of Panax extracts in human populations. HPLC has&#xD;
      been used to identify and quantify several promising neuroactive ginsenosides that are likely&#xD;
      relevant to the human bioactive effect of Panax extracts. Most notable are the Rg1 and Rb1&#xD;
      ginsenosides from Panax quinquefolius L which show a number of interesting in vitro effects&#xD;
      on animal tissue from the central nervous system that have led to several positive results&#xD;
      from studies of animal learning. Most significant, however, was the introduction of HT1001, a&#xD;
      precisely standardized proprietary combination of Rg1 and Rb1 ginsenosides developed by CV&#xD;
      Technologies in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Each product lot of HT1001 from CV Technologies is&#xD;
      tested to ensure consistency of the ginsenoside composition. The introduction of a commercial&#xD;
      product with a precise standardized composition of Rb1 and Rg1 has created a unique&#xD;
      opportunity for investigating the safety and efficacy of Panax extracts.&#xD;
