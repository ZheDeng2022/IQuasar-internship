  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major cause of premature aging and the second leading cause of preventable&#xD;
      mortality in the United States, accounting for approximately 110,000 deaths per year.&#xD;
      Financial incentives have been effective in modifying a number of health behaviors but they&#xD;
      have rarely been applied to weight loss, and to the best of our knowledge never to weight&#xD;
      loss by low-SES obese veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose testing two different approaches to using financial incentives to encourage weight&#xD;
      loss. In the first, we build on previous work showing the effectiveness of 'deposit&#xD;
      contracts', in which subjects are given the opportunity to put their own money at risk if&#xD;
      they do not lose weight. In this incentive condition, subjects receive a direct payment&#xD;
      conditional on daily weight loss, and an optional additional payment based on their own&#xD;
      contributions to the deposit contract. We will match their contribution 1:1 to make the&#xD;
      option of depositing their own money attractive to this predominantly low SES population. In&#xD;
      the second approach we build on our own prior work using lotteries to promote drug adherence.&#xD;
      In this incentive condition, participants are entered into a daily lottery, and receive any&#xD;
      payoffs they earn from the lottery only if they stay on track with their weight-loss goal.&#xD;
      Given their popularity in the general population, lotteries hold the promise of providing a&#xD;
      cost-effective means of motivating weight loss and making efforts to lose weight more salient&#xD;
      to obese patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty-seven obese patients at the Philadelphia VAMC (BMI between 30-40) will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of three conditions: weight monitoring only (WM), deposit contract incentive&#xD;
      (DC$+WM), or lottery-based incentive (L$+WM). Exclusion criteria for the study will be&#xD;
      minimal to maximize generalizability, focusing only on exclusions that may make participation&#xD;
      unfeasible or unsafe (myocardial infarction within 6 months; uncontrolled hypertension,&#xD;
      defined as BP&gt;170 mm Hg systolic or BP&gt;110 mm Hg diastolic; metastatic cancer, self-report of&#xD;
      6 or more alcoholic beverages per day; schizophrenia; severe depression; active substance&#xD;
      abuse; inability to read or severe cognitive deficits that would preclude ability to read&#xD;
      consent form or fill out surveys). Patients with severe depression will be referred for&#xD;
      treatment and considered ineligible until effectively treated. This exclusion is appropriate&#xD;
      because those who are severely depressed are too ill to undertake weight reduction and&#xD;
      because weight loss is often a symptom of severe depression. Subjects will also be asked how&#xD;
      interested they are in losing weight (5 point scale, ranging from extremely uninterested to&#xD;
      extremely interested, minimum score of 3 for inclusion). Subjects will be required to be&#xD;
      between ages 30-70, as weight loss may be more difficult and less beneficial in the elderly.&#xD;
      No other exclusions will be applied, as we aim to make the study as generalizable as&#xD;
      possible. Initial screening of BMI's and comorbidities will be done using the VALOR data&#xD;
      system at CHERP. Subjects who on paper meet criteria will then be sent letters and asked to&#xD;
      call us if interested. The remaining eligibility criteria will be assessed over the phone,&#xD;
      and subjects who meet the criteria will be invited for an in-person intake visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial intake visit, study procedures will be explained, and staff will create a&#xD;
      linear graph depicting the course of weight loss required to lose 16 pounds over the course&#xD;
      of 16 weeks (see figure). Subjects who provide written consent to participate will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of the 3 arms at this visit. Participants randomized to one of the two&#xD;
      incentive arms will be informed of the incentive plan (described in detail below).&#xD;
      Physiologic measurements will be limited to weight and height which will be measured by our&#xD;
      staff. To minimize fluctuations in weight due to diurnal variation, subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      commit to having all morning appointments (e.g. between 8 and 1 pm) for both intake and f/u&#xD;
      visits if possible. For those who cannot come in mornings, they will be asked to commit to&#xD;
      coming in at approximately the same time in the afternoon for intake and f/u visits (e.g.&#xD;
      between 2 and 4 pm). As soon as possible, following the intake visit, all participants will&#xD;
      have a one-on-one consultation with a dietician (Kelly McBride) in which diet and exercise&#xD;
      will be discussed. During this session, participants will receive guidance on strategies for&#xD;
      weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this consultation, participants will be asked to return to PVAMC to see the&#xD;
      coordinator at CHERP once a month for each of four consecutive months to: be weighed (all&#xD;
      participants), receive any payment they have earned (DC$+WM) or (L$+WM), and complete a&#xD;
      follow-up questionnaire. Subjects will be instructed to drink only one 8 ounce glass of&#xD;
      liquid and have a small breakfast and/or lunch (Examples of a small breakfast would be 2&#xD;
      slices of whole grain toast with jelly or one serving of a whole grain cereal with skim milk&#xD;
      or a piece of fruit and glass of skim milk. Light lunch could include any of the ones listed&#xD;
      above, or a broth based soup or half of a turkey sandwich or half of a peanut butter) prior&#xD;
      to coming in for follow-up visits. To compensate subjects for their time and trouble, all&#xD;
      participants will receive a financial incentive each time they attend a monthly weigh-in,&#xD;
      regardless of whether or not they have attained their monthly weight loss goal. Subjects will&#xD;
      also receive a financial incentive for attending the initial intake visit and a financial&#xD;
      incentive for attending their appointment with the dietician (Kelly McBride) and for coming&#xD;
      to a f/u weigh in at 3 months after the incentives for weight loss cease. Those in the two&#xD;
      incentives conditions will be provided with daily feedback, as described below. All such&#xD;
      messages will be transmitted by text -enabled pagers that we will provide for the duration of&#xD;
      the study for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to measure their weight each morning upon awakening, after urinating,&#xD;
      but before eating or drinking and to transmit it to the study administrator by telephone (by&#xD;
      leaving a message). We will provide scales that are accurate to 0.1 pounds to each subject&#xD;
      for use for the duration of the study. We will tell participants at entry into the study that&#xD;
      the scale is theirs to keep if they remain enrolled in the study for the duration but that&#xD;
      they will be asked to return them if they drop out of the study before then. These scales&#xD;
      will be calibrated initially to match the weights recorded by the scale used at CHERP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned above, there will be two different financial incentive conditions that we will&#xD;
      be testing, both of which have a strong conceptual basis and for which there is suggestive&#xD;
      evidence in the literature that these could be effective approaches to help obese patients&#xD;
      lose weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the lottery financial incentives arm will be eligible for a daily&#xD;
      lottery prize with an expected value of $3/day (a rough estimate of the savings per day to a&#xD;
      health plan from reducing the incidence of type 2 diabetes and other consequences of obesity&#xD;
      by achieving weight loss of 10-20 lbs) only if, prior to the lottery being resolved, they&#xD;
      have reported a weight at or below their desired weight loss trajectory (see figure). The&#xD;
      lottery is tailored both to provide infrequent large payoffs (a 1 in 100 chance at a $100&#xD;
      reward) and frequent small payoffs (a 1 in 5 chance at a $10 reward). This is because lottery&#xD;
      players are motivated by both a forward looking element (fixation on large $ amounts) and a&#xD;
      backward looking element - how often did I win.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lottery is designed such that, each day, subjects who send their early morning weights&#xD;
      will receive rapid feedback about whether they won, and non-adherent subjects will receive&#xD;
      feedback about whether they would have won had they been adherent. Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      choose a 2-digit number upon entry into the study, e.g. &quot;27&quot;. Each morning subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to call in to report their weight from that morning. A two digit random number will be&#xD;
      generated for each day. If the last digit includes either a &quot;2&quot; or &quot;7&quot; (which has&#xD;
      approximately a 1 in 5 chance), and the subject reported a weight that was at or below their&#xD;
      target weight for that day, they would be eligible to win $10. If the number is &quot;27&quot; (a 1 in&#xD;
      100 chance) they would win $100. Information on whether they won would be transmitted to them&#xD;
      each day, via text message, so that they receive this feedback immediately. If a subject does&#xD;
      not report their weight that morning (by 12pm) or reports a weight that is above the target&#xD;
      weight (with an allowance for the inaccuracy of the scale), they will be informed that they&#xD;
      would have won the lottery that day had they been below target. We believe that a desire to&#xD;
      avoid the regret associated with not winning, but learning that one would have won had one&#xD;
      been adherent, will powerfully motivate subjects to adhere - beyond what one might anticipate&#xD;
      based only on the expected value of the rewards. Moreover, this effect will probably&#xD;
      strengthen with experience - i.e., after a given subject has experienced the remorse of&#xD;
      failing to obtain rewards that they would have received if they had been adherent. Subjects&#xD;
      who achieve a 20 pounds or more weight loss over the 16 weeks will be eligible for a one-time&#xD;
      bonus of at least $50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the above daily weights are all self-reported, we will inform patients that they will&#xD;
      only receive the calculated amount they are due if their weight at their monthly weigh-in is&#xD;
      at or below their target weight (typically a 4 pound weight loss over 1 month). A 0.2 pound&#xD;
      differential will be allowed between the office scale reading and the participant's reported&#xD;
      weight at the time of their monthly visit to account for 0.1 pound scale variances on either&#xD;
      the office or take home scales (e.g. if a subject loses 3.8 instead of 4.0 pounds per the&#xD;
      office scale, they will receive their full incentive). These payments would be provided using&#xD;
      the &quot;Authorization and Invoice for Medical and Hospital Services Form&quot; that allows&#xD;
      participants to be paid directly through VA Agent Cashier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deposit contract financial incentive ($+WM) participants will be paid a base amount&#xD;
      corresponding to $3 for each day they are on track toward losing 16 pounds of weight by the&#xD;
      end of the 16-week study. Specifically, they receive this payment for every day that their&#xD;
      weight is at or below the ideal threshold line (see figure). In addition, these participants&#xD;
      will be given the opportunity to contribute between $0-$3 per day of their own funds,&#xD;
      refundable at the end of the month only if they have met or exceeded their monthly weight&#xD;
      loss goal. As an incentive for participants to contribute to deposit contracts, we will match&#xD;
      their money 1:1. Thus, participants in this condition have the opportunity to earn as much as&#xD;
      $9 per day ($3 base payment plus their $3 plus our $3 match). Participants will decide at the&#xD;
      beginning of each month how much, if any, they wish to deposit for the upcoming month. They&#xD;
      can therefore change the amount of their deposit contracts from month to month. Any deposit&#xD;
      contract money that is forfeited by participants because they do not lose a sufficient amount&#xD;
      of weight will be contributed to a pool of money that will be divided equally among all&#xD;
      subjects who lose 20 pounds or more over the 16 weeks. The size of this bonus will be not&#xD;
      less than $50, with any shortfall to be made up by study funds. Because not all subjects will&#xD;
      complete the study at the same time we will give each subject who is eligible for this bonus&#xD;
      $50 at the final follow-up visit. If the eventual amount ends up being more, we will mail&#xD;
      them a money order or the &quot;Authorization and Invoice for Medical and Hospital Services Form&quot;&#xD;
      to make up the difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to self-monitor their weight on a daily basis and to transmit it&#xD;
      to the central office by phone. Each morning before eating or drinking and after urinating,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to a) weigh themselves in their pajamas, b) record their weights,&#xD;
      and c) transmit their weight to the central office before 12 noon. To maintain comparability&#xD;
      between the lottery and deposit contract groups, every afternoon, participants will receive a&#xD;
      text message telling them whether they are below their threshold weight for payment and, if&#xD;
      they are, how much they have received; if they are not at or below their threshold weight,&#xD;
      how much they would have received if they had been. At their monthly weigh-in, participants&#xD;
      will be given a report that captures how their report weights compare to the ideal weight&#xD;
      loss trajectory sketched in the initial consultation session and giving them information on&#xD;
      how much they will be paid if these weights are accurate, as well as how much they would have&#xD;
      received if they had stayed on target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The daily monitoring provides participants with a constant reminder of their weight loss&#xD;
      goals. This frequency was chosen based on the finding that people tend to adopt a narrow&#xD;
      (daily) frame of reference to diets, &quot;rededicating&quot; themselves to it at the start of each&#xD;
      day. The daily weigh-ins are designed to reduce binge eating by making participants&#xD;
      constantly &quot;accountable&quot; for their weight. The monthly feedback provides encouragement and a&#xD;
      symbolic reward for slow and steady weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Falsification of weights will be minimized because patients will only get paid the amounts&#xD;
      identified in the weekly reports if the degree of weight loss recorded at the monthly&#xD;
      weigh-ins done by our coordinator are consistent with their self reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key aspect of the weight loss trajectory is that it can be reset at monthly intervals. This&#xD;
      feature is critical in the likely event that a person falls short of attaining a monthly&#xD;
      weight loss goal. Disheartened at the prospect of having to lose double the weight in order&#xD;
      to get &quot;back on track&quot; by the end of the next month, such a person might drop out of the&#xD;
      study. To avoid this problem, each person who has not reached the weight loss for the&#xD;
      previous month will be given the opportunity for a &quot;fresh start.&quot; The overall weight loss&#xD;
      goal will stay the same, however, the slope of the trajectory will adjust (i.e. steepen) such&#xD;
      that the participant need not &quot;binge diet&quot; following a month of poor weight loss performance&#xD;
      (see &quot;Fresh start trajectory&quot; in figure, which assumes the subject lost 2 lbs. instead of 4&#xD;
      lbs. in first month). Keeping the overall weight loss goal constant makes the procedure fair&#xD;
      for those participants who maintain the ideal trajectory, while adjusting the slope of the&#xD;
      weight loss line allows for subjects who have occasional slip-ups to stay engaged and get&#xD;
      back on track.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our standard approach to receiving information from subjects will involve subjects calling us&#xD;
      by telephone. We will not require subjects to have access to a home computer and electronic&#xD;
      mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight Monitoring only participants (control group) will be given the goal of losing 16&#xD;
      pounds in 16 weeks but will receive usual care only, e.g. care provided by their regular&#xD;
      clinical providers. They will not be given any financial incentive to lose the weight. They&#xD;
      will be asked to come for a monthly f/u visit and weigh in, but will not receive any&#xD;
      communications between these visits from the study coordinator.&#xD;
