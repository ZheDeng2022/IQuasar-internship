      Walnuts include many potentially beneficial micronutrients and phytochemicals, in this study&#xD;
      we propose to examine the effects of walnuts independent of macronutrient content. The&#xD;
      purpose of this proposal is to study in depth the short-term effects of walnut consumption in&#xD;
      men and women with the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim 1: To investigate the effects of walnuts (48gms per day over 3 days) on insulin&#xD;
      resistance in subjects with the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim 2: To investigate the effects of 48gms per day of walnuts over 3 days on lipids and&#xD;
      inflammatory markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim 3: To assess the possible mechanisms of the biological effects of short-term walnut&#xD;
      consumption through assessment of adipokines, resting metabolic rate, gene expression in&#xD;
      white blood cells and the effect of walnuts when consumed as part of a mixed meal, on glucose&#xD;
      excursions, insulin secretion and the excretion of gut peptides and free fatty acids.&#xD;

      During the whole study period, you will be asked to maintain a constant body weight and you&#xD;
      will receive advice from the dietitian regarding a weight stable diet and exercise pattern.&#xD;
      You will also be asked to avoid walnuts during the entire study period. The intervention and&#xD;
      the measurements during each of the visits are described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to read and sign this consent form. After&#xD;
      you sign the consent form, the following things will happen:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening Procedures: Screening procedures are tests and procedures that will be done to&#xD;
           determine if you are eligible to take part in the research study. For this research&#xD;
           study, the screening procedures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. A detailed medical history and interview about lifestyle factors and medication use&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. A brief physical examination to document any abnormalities in your body appearance&#xD;
                and measurement of weight, height and waist circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Drawing of blood from the forearm for fasting blood glucose (blood sugar), lipid&#xD;
                profile (cholesterol and other fats in blood), creatinine (a measure of your kidney&#xD;
                function), and complete blood count (CBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Collection of urine for a HCG pregnancy test (women only)&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the blood tests, you will be asked not to eat or drink anything (except water) from&#xD;
           8 pm the previous evening until you arrive for the study visit the following morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Samples of your blood will be stored under code to be used for future research by the&#xD;
           BIDMC investigators but your name will not be identified. If for any reason you have&#xD;
           decided to withdraw from the study or if you have not met the criteria for enrollment&#xD;
           into the study, all the blood drawn at the screening visit will be discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Next, you will meet with a research dietician to receive instructions for the 2-week&#xD;
           run-in period (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomization Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           You will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to receive either walnut&#xD;
           containing milkshake or placebo containing milkshake on your first visit. Each&#xD;
           participant will receive walnut containing milkshake during one visit and a milkshake&#xD;
           that looks and tastes the same but without walnuts (placebo) on the other visit but the&#xD;
           order of the visits will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research Procedures: If you qualify to take part in this research study, you will&#xD;
           undergo these research procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Run-in period:&#xD;
&#xD;
           You will meet with a research dietician who will provide instructions about maintaining&#xD;
           your normal diet and physical activity pattern and about avoiding walnut-containing&#xD;
           foods and drinks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Visit 1 and 2 Each study visit involves a 4-day (4 overnight) stay at the General&#xD;
           Clinical Research Center. You will be admitted at 9pm the evening before the first day&#xD;
           of the visit. You will be asked to complete a hunger questionnaire each morning before&#xD;
           you have had anything to eat. You will receive a milkshake each morning containing&#xD;
           either with or without walnuts. We will repeat the hunger questionnaire before your&#xD;
           lunch each day. You will be provided with lunch and dinner based on what you like to&#xD;
           eat. The calorie content of the lunch and dinner will be controlled so that you will&#xD;
           neither gain or lose weight during your stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Day 1 The following morning the following tests will be performed; Measure your weight,&#xD;
           waist circumference, and blood pressure. Resting Metabolic Rate Fasting blood tests Body&#xD;
           composition Mixed meal challenge You will receive your first milkshake as part of the&#xD;
           mixed meal challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Day 2 On day 2 there is no testing but you will complete the hunger questionnaire and&#xD;
           receive another milkshake for breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Day 3&#xD;
&#xD;
           On day 3 you will have the following tests performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Insulin Suppression Test Fasting blood sample At the end of the insulin suppression&#xD;
           test, you will receive another milkshake.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Day 4 On the morning of your last day you will have repeat testing as on the first day&#xD;
           of the visit and will leave the hospital at mid-day after the testing is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Washout phase Between the 2 study visits you will enter a washout phase where you will&#xD;
           continue your normal healthy diet and exercise but avoid walnuts in your diet. After 1&#xD;
           month of washout you will return to the GCRC for your second study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Tests performed during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting Metabolic Rate RMR is the amount of calories you burn without doing any physical&#xD;
      work. Your RMR will be measured with a commonly used instrument. You will be asked to lie&#xD;
      quietly in bed and stay awake with a large plastic hood over your head and upper body for&#xD;
      about 20 minutes and breathe normally while the air you breathe out is being collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting blood tests Blood samples will be used to measure sugar, insulin levels, lipids (LDL,&#xD;
      HDL, and total cholesterol, triglycerides), hormones (such as leptin, resistin and&#xD;
      adiponectin) and blood markers of inflammation (such as TNF and CRP). We will also perform a&#xD;
      blood test to measure the expression of genes involved in metabolism in your white blood&#xD;
      cells. For the blood tests, you will be asked not to eat or drink anything (except water)&#xD;
      from 8 pm the previous evening until. In addition, you will be asked not to participate in&#xD;
      vigorous physical activity on the day before the visit. Samples of your blood will be stored&#xD;
      under code to be used for future related blood measurements by the BIDMC investigators but&#xD;
      your name will not be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition To measure the amount of fat in your body we will use bioelectrical&#xD;
      impedance analysis. During this procedure you will lie down and the speed of an electric&#xD;
      signal through your body will be measured. This signal is not painful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed meal challenge You will have a small catheter (a small plastic tube) placed in a vein&#xD;
      with a needle in your forearm to draw blood. This will prevent the need for multiple needle&#xD;
      sticks for the required blood draws. The catheter will be taped to stay in place for&#xD;
      approximately three hours. You will drink a milkshake and your blood will be drawn through&#xD;
      the catheter 15 min after the milkshake is given and then at 30-minute intervals for 3 hours&#xD;
      to measure how you metabolize the nutrient drink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin Suppression Test (also called Galvin's Index) This test consists of an overnight fast&#xD;
      (nothing to eat or drink after 11pm the night before), after which two IV lines will be&#xD;
      placed in your arms. Glucose, insulin,octreotide (a hormone commonly used in clinical&#xD;
      practice for treating several different diseases) and albumin ( a protein found in blood)&#xD;
      will be infused through the IV. Blood samples will be drawn through the other IV line at&#xD;
      times -10 minutes, 0 minutes, and every 30 minutes for two and a half hours, then every 10&#xD;
      minutes for an additional 30 minutes.&#xD;
