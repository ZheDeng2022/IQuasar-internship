  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the effect of a drug called mesna on the&#xD;
      removal of homocysteine from blood during dialysis. Homocysteine is an amino acid (protein&#xD;
      building block) found in the blood of all people, however it is considerably elevated in&#xD;
      dialysis patients. People with increased levels of homocysteine in their blood are at&#xD;
      increased risk of developing plaque buildup in their arteries and other related problems such&#xD;
      as heart attack and stroke. This study will determine if mesna can improve the rate of&#xD;
      homocysteine removal from blood during dialysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Homocysteine is a thiol amino acid derived from dietary methionine. Elevated plasma total&#xD;
      homocysteine (tHcy), termed hyperhomocysteinemia, is a graded, independent risk factor for&#xD;
      the development of atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma tHcy can be normalized by supplementation&#xD;
      with folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 in most patients with normal renal function and this&#xD;
      treatment has been shown to halt the progression of atherosclerotic plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 90% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis have elevated&#xD;
      plasma tHcy. The leading causes of morbidity and mortality in these patients are&#xD;
      cardiovascular-related pathologies such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Vitamin&#xD;
      supplementation consistently fails to normalize elevated plasma tHcy in patients with ESRD,&#xD;
      thus leaving them at increased risk. Plasma tHcy is 70 - 80% covalently protein bound&#xD;
      limiting the effectiveness of dialysis as a tHcy lowering treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesna (sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid) is a thiol-containing drug currently indicated&#xD;
      to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis associated with ifosfamide chemotherapy. Mesna has&#xD;
      incidentally been shown to deplete plasma thiols in cancer patients undergoing ifosfamide&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Mesna acts to exchange with thiols bound to plasma proteins enhancing their&#xD;
      renal excretion. In vitro studies in our laboratory have shown that mesna rapidly (within 5&#xD;
      minutes) exchanges with protein bound homocysteine yielding a significantly larger dialyzable&#xD;
      fraction of the thiol amino acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study recently completed by our group demonstrated a significant decrease in tHcy in&#xD;
      eight hemodialysis patients receiving 12 mg/kg mesna three times a week pre-dialysis for one&#xD;
      week. Although this therapy did cause a significant decline in tHcy, mesna failed to reduce&#xD;
      tHcy to normal levels. The cumulative effects of mesna administration over a longer treatment&#xD;
      period should be evaluated.&#xD;
