      This is a Phase IIa, open-label, randomized trial in treatment-naïve, sputum smear-positive,&#xD;
      subjects with pulmonary TB to assess the extended early bactericidal activity (eEBA) of&#xD;
      TMC207. The study population will consist of 60 treatment-naive subjects with M. tuberculosis&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive orally 25 mg TMC207 po q.d. (Treatment A), 100 mg TMC207 po q.d.&#xD;
      (Treatment B) or 400 mg TMC207 po q.d. (Treatment C) daily for 7 days. Subjects in treatment&#xD;
      group D will receive 600 mg rifampin po q.d. daily for 7 days and subjects in treatment group&#xD;
      E will receive 300 mg isoniazid po q.d. daily for 7 days. After 7 days, subjects in all&#xD;
      treatment groups will receive appropriate anti-TB therapy according to national standards of&#xD;
      country TB guidelines and culture and sensitivity results of the sputum specimens until&#xD;
      clinical and microbiological cures have been achieved. Three once-daily dose regimens of&#xD;
      TMC207, for 7 days, will be studied versus 2 comparator treatments, rifampin and isoniazid in&#xD;
      the present trial.TMC207 treatment groups: 25 mg TMC207 po q.d; 100 mg. TMC207 po q.d; 400 mg&#xD;
      TMC207 po q.d.; TMC207 will be administered as a 10 or 40 mg/mL oral solution. Comparator&#xD;
      groups: 600 mg rifampin po q.d. administered as capsules containing 300 mg rifampin; 300 mg&#xD;
      isoniazid po q.d. administered as tablets containing 300 mg isoniazid.&#xD;
