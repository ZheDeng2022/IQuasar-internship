      Low back pain is a usual conditions in the western countries and several treatments available&#xD;
      for patients with &quot;non-specific low back pain&quot;. According to the European guidelines are&#xD;
      exercise and cognitive intervention effective on pain and function(www.backpaineurope.org),&#xD;
      but it have no documented effect on return to work. In addition, there is no documentation&#xD;
      that treatments which focus on a single treatment, is effective with regard to return to work&#xD;
      for sick-listed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenges for health personnel is not cure of the patients back pain, but to build up&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs which focus on disability and work incapacity, in patients which are&#xD;
      at risk of loosing their work. Dr. P. Loisel, Montreal, Canada&quot;, has since 1995 treated&#xD;
      patients with back pain according to the &quot;The PREVICAP model - (PREVention of work&#xD;
      handICAP)&quot;, where the main purpose with work-related program is to prevent prolonged&#xD;
      disability and to help patients back to work. Loisel demonstrated that the PREVICAP models&#xD;
      accelerated the &quot;return to work&quot; factor by a factor 2.4 (p=0.01). The PREVICAP model have&#xD;
      also been evaluated in Amsterdam, by Dr. Anema with the same results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Back Clinic, Ullevål University Hospital we have evaluated several exercise programs&#xD;
      with good effect on pain and function, but not on the return to work rate. We are planning to&#xD;
      do a randomized controlled trial after the PREVICAP model. All included patients in both&#xD;
      groups, will have an clinical examination by specialist in Physical Medicine and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation and an exercise program. Patients will be randomized to a work-related&#xD;
      rehabilitations program or to usual care by the general practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Main hypothesis: Sick-listed patients with back pain, who will be randomized to&#xD;
      the work-related rehabilitation programs, will return to work faster than patients randomized&#xD;
      to usual care by the general practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second hypothesis: A cost-benefit analysis will favor the exercise program and work place&#xD;
      intervention&#xD;

      Background Low back pain is a usual conditions in the western countries and in Norway 40% of&#xD;
      the population report decreased function because of back pain. The disease has great economic&#xD;
      consequences, which in 2004 came to 15 billions to disability pension and 1,46 billions to&#xD;
      physical treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe incidence of back pain, like tumours, infections, fractures and pareses are rare and&#xD;
      represent less than 1 % of all cases. The main part is within the category of &quot;non-specific&#xD;
      low back pain&quot;, which is defined as back pain without specific pathology as known cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on scientific documentation the back-specialists consider non-specific low back pain as&#xD;
      a benign and self-limited condition, while patients expect to get treatment because they&#xD;
      experience the condition as painful and disabling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several treatments available for patients with &quot;non-specific low back pain&quot;.&#xD;
      According to the European guidelines exercise and cognitive intervention has good effects on&#xD;
      pain and function (www.backpaineurope.org), but it is not documented effect on return to&#xD;
      work. In addition it is not documented that treatments which focus on a single treatment&#xD;
      neither is effective regarding return to work for sick-listed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a usual myth that physical hard work cause back pain. However, only few studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated correlations between hard work and sick-leave. On the contrary several studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated that back pain is a multifactorial problem, which is not only due to&#xD;
      workers' characteristics, but is also closely related to environmental factors, such as the&#xD;
      workplace, the healthcare system, the compensation system and the interaction between all&#xD;
      stakeholders in the disability problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenges for health personnel is not cure of the patients back pain, but to build up&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs which focus on disability and work incapacity in patients which are&#xD;
      at risk of loosing their work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. P. Loisel, Montreal, Canada&quot;, has since 1995 treated patients with back pain according to&#xD;
      the &quot;The PREVICAP model - (PREVention of work handICAP)&quot;. The main purpose with work-related&#xD;
      program is to prevent prolonged disability and to help patients back to work. This approach&#xD;
      includes two steps: first identification of factors on the workplace which contribute to the&#xD;
      absence of work and second &quot;workplace intervention&quot;. Identification of factors at workplace&#xD;
      includes physical, ergonomic, psychosocial, interpersonal conflicts and administrative&#xD;
      problems. &quot;Workplace intervention&quot; is a rehabilitation program centred at the workplace,&#xD;
      allowing a graded transition from the clinical setting to the workplace. Parallel with the&#xD;
      workplace intervention the patients enter an exercise-program, adjusted to the workplace&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PREVICAP models have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials and has accelerated&#xD;
      return to work by a factor 2.4 (p=0.01). The most important effect came from the workplace&#xD;
      intervention, which alone accelerated the return to work with a factor 1.9 (p=0.01). Patients&#xD;
      randomized to the PREVICAP model had 60 days absence from work, compared to 120 days in the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PREVICAP model have been evaluated in Amsterdam, by Dr. Anema and he demonstrated a&#xD;
      significant difference in the return to work rate between patients randomized to &quot;Workplace&#xD;
      intervention&quot; and patients randomized to usual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Back Clinic, Ullevål University Hospital we have evaluated several exercise-programs&#xD;
      with good effect on pain and function, but not on the return to work rate. This raises an&#xD;
      important question: will the return to work rate increase by including workplace intervention&#xD;
      to the exercise program and it is possible to implement the PREVICAP model in Norway with the&#xD;
      same good results, despite differences between Canada, The Netherlands and Norway with regard&#xD;
      to culture, soc-economic conditions, working conditions and compensatory systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are planning to do a randomized controlled trial after the PREVICAP model, where patients&#xD;
      sick-listed for back pain will be randomized to either a workplace intervention plus an&#xD;
      exercise-program or to an exercise-program alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the project is to answer the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will more patients return to work and will they do it faster, when they will be included&#xD;
           in a work-related rehabilitations program than patients randomized to usual care by the&#xD;
           general practitioner, at the follow-up 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 and 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Was there significant difference in pain and function between the two groups at the&#xD;
           follow-up?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Which factors predict the return to work; medical, socioeconomic or factors at the&#xD;
           workplace?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At the 2 years follow-up- Had the patients had episodes with back pain and in case, how&#xD;
           many, of which duration and were they sick-listed for it or did they stay at work?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Is there a favorable cost benefit with the program?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective single-blind randomized study. The patients will be randomized by&#xD;
      block-randomisation. The randomization will be carried out at a separate locations concealed&#xD;
      from the clinical investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusions criteria: Patients with non-specific low back pain sick listed from 6-8 weeks and&#xD;
      who are permanently employed. Non-specific low back pain is defined as a back pain not&#xD;
      attributable to a recognizable, known specific pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusions criteria: Patients with infection, tumors, osteoporosis, fracture, structural&#xD;
      deformity, inflammatory disorder, radicular syndrome or cauda equina syndrome, spinal&#xD;
      stenosis or spondylolysis/ listesis, serious somatic disease and/or psychic disease and&#xD;
      patients with a poor proficiency in Norwegian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a clinical examination of a specialist and a an exercise program. The&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to workplace intervention or a control group. Patients randomized&#xD;
      to the workplace intervention will be referred to an occupational ergonomist for work site&#xD;
      evaluation and return to work program, which include ergonomic conditions and relations to&#xD;
      the employer and colleagues. The occupational task of the ergonomists is to organize contacts&#xD;
      and meetings between the employer and the patients and make a schedule for return to work.&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the control group will go back to their general practitioner for&#xD;
      planning return to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:all together 260 patients in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics The study will follow the ethic directions in the Helsinki Declaration and will not be&#xD;
      initiated before approval from the National Committee for Research Ethics in Norway. In&#xD;
      addition we will also ask for permission to collect and register the data from the Data&#xD;
      Inspectorate in Norway. Only patients giving informed consent will be included and they will&#xD;
      be informed that they can withdraw from the study at any time and that this will have no&#xD;
      otherwise consequences for their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registrations of drop-outs The moment time and the cause of drop-outs will be registered. We&#xD;
      will attempt to obtain a clinical examination from drop-outs at the 1-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses and statistic analyses All data will be anonymous coded and registered&#xD;
      electronic i SPSS. They will be unidentified in analyses and presentations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parametric analyses will be applied on data, which are normally distributed or else,&#xD;
      non-parametric statistic will be used. Survival analyses will be used for investigating&#xD;
      difference in reduction sickness leave between the two treatment groups. Multivariate&#xD;
      analyses will be used for identifying differences in pain, function and fear of avoidance&#xD;
      between the two groups. In addition to analysing the data from the patients who completed the&#xD;
      trial, the data from dropouts will be analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preconditions at the Back Clinic for conduction of the study The Back Clinic, Ullevål&#xD;
      University Hospital has collaboration with the Compensation system in Oslo, NAV (Norges&#xD;
      Arbeids-og Velferdsetat). The surplus from the Back Clinic will be used to employ an&#xD;
      occupational ergonomist. The physiotherapists are employees at the Back Clinic and they have&#xD;
      tried out the exercise program. Principal investigator (Anne Keller) is applying for grants&#xD;
      for a post doc fellowship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Back clinic has a test laboratory with a bicycle for testing submaximal oxygen uptake and&#xD;
      inclinometer for measuring range of motion of flexion of the back. We have collaboration with&#xD;
      Department of neuroradiology for MRI investigations.&#xD;
