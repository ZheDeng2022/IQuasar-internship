             1. Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage was documented by CT scanning within 24&#xD;
                     hours of the onset of symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Supratentorial location of hemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Older than 17 yrs&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Informed consent before study&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Planned surgical evacuation of hematoma within 24hrs&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Secondary ICH such as trauma or aneurysmal rupture&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Taking anticoagulation previously&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Pregnancy,known allergy to celecoxib, severe liver or kidney disease, or poor&#xD;
                     performance state were excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Other physical condition, making the patient difficult to participate in this&#xD;
                     study (decided by the neurologist or the physician).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OTHER THERAPY&#xD;
&#xD;
           -No limitation of other medications except NSAIDs, anticoagulation and antiplatelet&#xD;
           agent because of aggravating the symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY DESIGN Multicenter, prospective randomized, comparative open with blinded&#xD;
           endpoints (PROBE) trial to assess the safety and effectiveness of administration of&#xD;
           celecoxib for 14 days in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage&#xD;

    <measure>Change of volume of perihematomal edema as assessed by brain CT</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1st day of admission and repeated at 7th±1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Brain CT scanning for measurement of volumes of ICH and perihematomal edema was performed at 1st day of admission and repeated at 7th±1 day. Considering some possible errors in measurement of edema volume, at follow-up CT scan, the decrease more than 20% from the initial edema volume was coded as &quot;decreased&quot; edema volume; the increase more than 20% was coded as &quot;increased&quot;; the change between -20% and 20% was coded as &quot;unchanged&quot;.</description>

    <description>The secondary endpoints were neurological status at 90 day using E-GOS and mRS. Good outcome was defined as 6 or more in E-GOS score, and 2 or less in mRS score.</description>
