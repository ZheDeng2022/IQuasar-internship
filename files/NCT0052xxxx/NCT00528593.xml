      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of epoetin alfa on HIV-associated&#xD;
      neuropathy by measuring changes in nerve fiber density and pain ratings.&#xD;

      The Neurologic AIDS Research Consortium (NARC) designs and carries out clinical trials to&#xD;
      improve the therapy for HIV induced neurologic disease, and neurologic conditions associated&#xD;
      with the AIDS virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications of HIV are dynamically evolving over time. In general, neurologic complications&#xD;
      that typically occur in advanced disease stages are increasing in incidence while some of the&#xD;
      early complications associated with AIDS are less commonly found due to improved preventive&#xD;
      therapy. The impact of the new generation of antiretroviral drugs, and of predominantly&#xD;
      multi-drug therapy remain to be seen. Several key new drugs fail to penetrate the brain, thus&#xD;
      making it possible for the incidence of neurologic disease to continue to increase. NARC&#xD;
      develops studies based on the current challenges of the AIDS epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erythropoetin (also known as epoetin alfa or Procrit) is naturally produced in the body.&#xD;
      Procrit or epoetin alfa is an injectable form of synthetic erythropoietin. In this trial,&#xD;
      scientists will evaluate the effect of epoetin alfa on HIV-associated neuropathy by measuring&#xD;
      changes in nerve fiber density and pain ratings. The goal of the trial is to determine if&#xD;
      epoetin alfa increases the number of nerve fibers in the skin of people with HIV-associated&#xD;
      neuropathy, and improves symptoms of neuropathy. This study will also find out if Procrit is&#xD;
      safe and well-tolerated for treating the painful neuropathy associated with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After two screening visits, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:&#xD;
      group 1 will receive Procrit once every three weeks, and group 2 will receive Procrit every&#xD;
      week. Follow-up treatment visits will occur at weeks 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48. During the&#xD;
      visits, participants will have their blood pressure and heart rate measured. During several&#xD;
      of the follow-up visits participants will be asked to rate the intensity of their pain using&#xD;
      the Gracely Pain Scale and the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Duration of this trial for&#xD;
      participants is 52 weeks or 1 year.&#xD;
