  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not having people with stroke practice&#xD;
      performing tasks to auditory rhythm cues with their weaker arm and hand is any better at&#xD;
      promoting improved motor control than practicing the tasks in a typical way without the&#xD;
      rhythm cues&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of adult-onset disability in the United States, and 75% of those&#xD;
      presenting with UE deficits continue to have decreased UE function, despite rehabilitation.&#xD;
      Despite demonstrated efficacy that functional task practice promotes improved UE function&#xD;
      post-stroke,4-6 most subjects continue to have substantial disability, reporting less paretic&#xD;
      hand use than pre-stroke and having lower scores on motor tests. Auditory rhythm entrainment&#xD;
      of functional task practice may enhance therapy efficacy by facilitating the adoption of more&#xD;
      normal movement patterns. Thus, it is critical to public health that more effective&#xD;
      approaches to facilitate UE motor recovery are developed. This study would further the&#xD;
      mission of NCMRR to enhance independence of persons with disability and that of NICHD:&#xD;
      &quot;optimal well-being of all people through rehabilitation.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this pilot study is to gather preliminary data on the impact of auditory&#xD;
      rhythm entrainment of functional task practice (FTARC) on improvement in UE function compared&#xD;
      to functional task practice alone (FTP) in subjects with moderate hemiparesis from chronic&#xD;
      stroke. Our primary hypothesis is that after FTARC, subjects will demonstrate greater gains&#xD;
      in UE function compared to persons in the FTP group. Secondary aims are to understand 1) the&#xD;
      relative impact of FTARC on retention of motor skills 6 months after therapy and 2) to&#xD;
      understand how changes in more underlying elemental components of UE movement, (kinetic&#xD;
      parameters and multi-joint synergies) relate to this improvement in outcome. Our secondary&#xD;
      hypotheses are that the subjects with FTARC will demonstrate movement composition that is&#xD;
      closer to that of neurologically intact individuals and greater retention of functional gains&#xD;
      compared to subjects with FTP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a prospective, parallel group design in which subjects, after baseline&#xD;
      testing, will be adaptively randomized by UE motor severity into either the FTARC or the FTP&#xD;
      groups. Therapy will be 4 hours of task practice per weekday for 2 weeks. Subjects will wear&#xD;
      a mitt on their non-paretic hand for 90% of waking hours. Subjects will then complete&#xD;
      post-intervention and 6-month follow up testing.&#xD;
