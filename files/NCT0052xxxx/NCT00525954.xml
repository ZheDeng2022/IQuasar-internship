  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at up to 25 U.S. centers and will be a double-blind randomized&#xD;
      parallel group placebo controlled study among subjects with stable coronary artery disease&#xD;
      (CAD). Subjects will be randomized to receive either placebo tablets or one of 2 orally&#xD;
      active doses of A-002. The duration of study drug therapy will be 8 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A-002 represents a novel therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis and coronary artery&#xD;
      disease (CAD). Through the inhibition of activity A-002 may provide multifunctional activity&#xD;
      directed against key facets of the disease process, namely a) inflammation, b) atherogenic&#xD;
      lipid profiles and c) the atherosclerotic process. Non-clinical and clinical data from recent&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated the benefit of early and aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy to&#xD;
      reduce cardiovascular risk. Recent clinical studies have provided a strong association&#xD;
      between levels and cardiovascular event risk. The proposed Phase 2 clinical pharmacology&#xD;
      study (Study No. AN-CVD-2222) will examine the effects of 2 different doses of A-002 compared&#xD;
      with placebo, on enzyme levels and activity after 8 weeks of treatment. In addition, the&#xD;
      effect of treatment on inflammatory markers of cardiovascular risk (C-reactive protein&#xD;
      [CRP]), lipid levels and lipoprotein subclasses and other soluble biomarkers (e.g., ICAM-1,&#xD;
      VCAM-1, TNF, MCP-1 etc) will also be assessed.&#xD;
