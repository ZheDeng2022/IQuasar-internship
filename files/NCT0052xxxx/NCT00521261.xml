      RATIONALE: Giving high doses of chemotherapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the&#xD;
      donor's stem cells. Colony stimulating factors, such as aldesleukin and GM-CSF, may increase&#xD;
      the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help the immune&#xD;
      system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. The donated stem cells may replace the&#xD;
      patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor&#xD;
      effect). Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells that have been treated with antibodies&#xD;
      after the transplant may help increase this effect. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a&#xD;
      donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving tacrolimus and&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil after transplant may stop this from happening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of donor T cells given&#xD;
      together with low-dose aldesleukin and low-dose GM-CSF after donor stem cell transplant in&#xD;
      treating patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of donor-derived allogeneic anti-CD3 X anti-CD20&#xD;
           bispecific antibody (CD20Bi)-armed activated T cells (ATC) when given with low-dose&#xD;
           aldesleukin and low-dose sargramostim (GM-CSF) after allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
           transplantation in patients with relapsed or refractory CD20-positive non-Hodgkin&#xD;
           lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform trafficking studies using indium I 111-labeled unarmed ATC and ATC armed with&#xD;
           CD20Bi in patients with evaluable lymphoma sites to determine whether armed ATC&#xD;
           specifically traffic to tumor sites and correlate these data with CT and PET scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate immune responses and immune reconstitution of T and B cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: All patients receive high-dose chemotherapy that is standard of care for their&#xD;
      disease. Peripheral blood lymphocytes are obtained from the HLA-identical sibling donor and&#xD;
      cultured to obtain activated T cells (ATC), some of which are subsequently armed with CD20&#xD;
      bispecific antibody (CD20Bi) and cryopreserved for later use. Patients then undergo&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ATC-CD20Bi IV on days 40, 70, 100, 130, and 160 after SCT. Patients receive&#xD;
      low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) once daily for 7 days beginning within 24 hours&#xD;
      after each ATC-CD20Bi infusion and low-dose sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC every other day for 3&#xD;
      doses beginning within 24 hours after each infusion of ATC-CD20Bi. Patients also receive&#xD;
      tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil as standard graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis. Treatment&#xD;
      continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients with well-defined or evaluable masses receive indium I 111 (^111I)-labeled&#xD;
      ATC-CD20Bi IV and ^111I-labeled unarmed ATC and then undergo whole-body imaging for&#xD;
      trafficking studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 months, 12 months, and then&#xD;
      annually thereafter.&#xD;
