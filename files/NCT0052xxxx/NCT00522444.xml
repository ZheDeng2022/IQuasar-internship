  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nebulized Magnesium Sulfate has been shown to be of benefit in adults with acute asthma&#xD;
      exacerbations, though limited work has been done in the pediatric population. Current&#xD;
      therapeutic questions include the effect of more than one dose of nebulized magnesium, the&#xD;
      possibility of a sustained effect (greater than 20 minutes) after a treatment, the potential&#xD;
      benefit in children younger than 5 years of age, and the use of an asthma score to re-assess&#xD;
      patients after treatment with this medication. The purpose of this double-blind randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trial is the evaluate the effect of multiple doses of nebulized&#xD;
      magnesium sulfate versus saline in addition to standard asthma therapy on clinical asthma&#xD;
      score and FEV1 in children 7 to 18 years of age with a moderate to severe acute asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation. Our hypothesis is that nebulized magnesium sulfate, when added to traditional&#xD;
      bronchodilator therapy, will improve acute asthma exacerbations more rapidly than standard&#xD;
      therapy alone. The primary outcomes are asthma score and FEV1 values obtained after two&#xD;
      nebulized magnesium sulfate compared to placebo treatments. This therapy will be supplemental&#xD;
      to standard therapy of albuterol and ipratropium nebulized treatments and systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroids. The secondary outcome is patient disposition (discharge home or&#xD;
      hospitalization). Patients with known asthma will be approached for enrollment and informed&#xD;
      consent obtained if the asthma score after the first albuterol treatment is &quot;2&quot; or greater.&#xD;
      One hundred-seventy patients will be enrolled and randomized to either the treatment group or&#xD;
      the placebo group. The change from baseline in asthma scores and FEV1 values will be compared&#xD;
      among the control and treatment groups to assess for any benefit of the addition of nebulized&#xD;
      magnesium sulfate to the treatment regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute asthma exacerbations continue to be a growing heath care dilemma, even as increased&#xD;
      efforts are made in preventing such exacerbations. The standard of care for such&#xD;
      exacerbations typically involves inhaled beta-agonist therapy and oral steroids. Patients who&#xD;
      are refractory to these treatments may require intravenous access for the purposes of&#xD;
      delivering additional medications, including magnesium sulfate. Intravenous magnesium sulfate&#xD;
      has been shown to be beneficial in moderate and severe acute asthma exacerbations in adults&#xD;
      and children, and new research indicates a trend toward benefits from nebulized magnesium&#xD;
      sulfate, even in those with a mild exacerbation of asthma. Delivery of magnesium sulfate via&#xD;
      the inhalation route is less invasive than the intravenous route, which is preferable in the&#xD;
      pediatric population. The possible short-term benefits of the nebulized form of magnesium&#xD;
      sulfate include decreased ED length of stay and prevention of admission to the intensive care&#xD;
      unit if the patient must be hospitalized for further treatments. The specific aim of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the effect of the addition of nebulized magnesium sulfate to our&#xD;
      standard emergency department therapy by comparing the change from baseline of asthma scores&#xD;
      and FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) in children with acute asthma exacerbations.&#xD;
