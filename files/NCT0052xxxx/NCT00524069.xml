      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and capecitabine, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in&#xD;
      different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor&#xD;
      cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving gemcitabine and&#xD;
      capecitabine together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and how well giving gemcitabine and&#xD;
      capecitabine together with bevacizumab works in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that&#xD;
      can be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility and safety of bevacizumab-based neoadjuvant and adjuvant&#xD;
           therapy in patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the proportion of patients with margin-positive resections after pancreatic&#xD;
           resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the time to recurrence in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the change in the number of circulating endothelial precursor cells (CEC) and&#xD;
           VEGF expression on CEC at baseline and after the start of neoadjuvant therapy and&#xD;
           examine their relationship with response, time to recurrence, and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the utility of dynamic contrast-enhanced spiral CT scan as surrogate endpoints&#xD;
           for antiangiogenic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neoadjuvant therapy: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8;&#xD;
           oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14; and bevacizumab* IV over 30-90 minutes on&#xD;
           day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Patients receive bevacizumab during courses 1 and 2 only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical resection: Within 6-8 weeks after the last dose of bevacizumab, patients&#xD;
           undergo surgical resection of the pancreatic tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjuvant therapy: Beginning 6-10 weeks after surgery, patients receive up to 6&#xD;
           additional courses of gemcitabine, capecitabine, and bevacizumab as in neoadjuvant&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study for&#xD;
      biomarker correlative studies. Samples are analyzed by flow cytometry to measure levels of&#xD;
      circulating endothelial precursor cells and VEGF markers of angiogenesis. Patients also&#xD;
      undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) spiral CT scan of the abdomen. DCE-CT imaging studies&#xD;
      are performed at baseline and after completion of neoadjuvant therapy (1-2 weeks prior to&#xD;
      surgical resection) to assess changes in tumor blood flow, blood volume, and tumor&#xD;
      vasculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.&#xD;
