  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate potential changes in epidermal nerve fiber&#xD;
      immunostaining (ENFI) and sensory nerve function in healthy normal volunteers following&#xD;
      single applications of three different investigational topical Capsaicin Dermal Liquids (10%&#xD;
      w/v trans capsaicin), and a comparable control (propylene glycol). In addition, the pain and&#xD;
      tolerability of the application of each formulation will also be assessed. Data from this&#xD;
      clinical study may be used to select a formulation for further clinical evaluation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, single-blind, single-center, Phase 1 study in twenty normal&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. Each subject will have a single 15 minute exposure to each of three&#xD;
      topical Capsaicin Dermal Liquids and the control. Each application site, located on the&#xD;
      distal and proximal anterior medial thigh areas, will be 5.0 Ã— 5.0 cm in size. The volume&#xD;
      applied will be 15 mcL per cm2 and hence the total volume applied will be 375 mcL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and prior to skin punch biopsy at Day 7, QST of the four application sites for&#xD;
      warming and cooling detection thresholds, and assessment of mechanical (sharp pain) sensation&#xD;
      and tactile thresholds, will be performed and evaluated. This will be repeated at each of the&#xD;
      four application sites on Day 7 and the Termination Visit.&#xD;

             drugs, menthol, methyl salicylate, other counterirritants, local anesthetics, steroids&#xD;
             or capsaicin anywhere on the thighs for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must not be breast-feeding and must have a negative serum beta human&#xD;
             chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All subjects, including early terminations, must be willing to use effective methods&#xD;
             of birth control and/or refrain from participating in a conception process during the&#xD;
             study and for 30 days following experimental drug exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing and able to comply with protocol requirements for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation. Requirements include but are not limited to attending&#xD;
