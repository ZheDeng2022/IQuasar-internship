    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to investigate the role of genes that may point to a&#xD;
      higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will be part of a pancreatic cancer genetic epidemiology&#xD;
      consortium (herein referred to as &quot;PACGENE&quot;), which includes researchers at these&#xD;
      institutions: Mayo Clinic; Johns Hopkins University; Creighton University; University of&#xD;
      Toronto Mount Sinai Hospital; Dana Farber; and Karmanos Cancer Institute. Participants have&#xD;
      either been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer or are family members of pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked questions by a trained interviewer using an approved&#xD;
      questionnaire. The topics will include demographic data (age, race, etc.), exposures, medical&#xD;
      history data, family history of cancer and other conditions, and other lifestyle factors. It&#xD;
      should take about 30-40 minutes to complete the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will also have about one and a half tablespoons of blood drawn.&#xD;
      Blood that is collected will only be used by researchers involved in this study. If obtaining&#xD;
      a blood sample is not possible, the study staff will ask for a saliva sample using an ORAGENE&#xD;
      kit. Neither participants nor their physicians will receive individual reports of this&#xD;
      research. Results will not be placed in the participant's health records. All information&#xD;
      will be kept confidential and used only for this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a rare chance that a research team member could be accidentally exposed to your&#xD;
      blood or body fluids. If that occurs, extra blood (about 2 teaspoons) may be drawn to test&#xD;
      for infections such as hepatitis and HIV (the AIDS virus). An existing blood sample may be&#xD;
      used for these tests instead. You will be told that your blood is being tested and the&#xD;
      results of your test. Researchers will ask how you would like to receive the results, such as&#xD;
      by phone or certified letter. The test results and your name, address, date of birth, and sex&#xD;
      will be recorded in the confidential M. D. Anderson medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you test positive for hepatitis or HIV, the test results and your name, address, date of&#xD;
      birth, and sex will be shared with appropriate health authorities as required by law. You&#xD;
      will also be given a list of places in your area so that you can receive further testing and&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the protection of your privacy, the study staff has obtained a Certificate of&#xD;
      Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. With this certificate, the&#xD;
      researchers cannot be forced to disclose information that may identify you, even by a court&#xD;
      subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or&#xD;
      other proceedings. The researchers will use the certificate to resist any demands for&#xD;
      information that would identify you, except as explained below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the&#xD;
      United State Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of Federally funded projects&#xD;
      or for information that must be disclosed in order to meet the requirements of the federal&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you or a member&#xD;
      of your family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in&#xD;
      this research. If an insurer, employer, or other person obtains your written consent to&#xD;
      receive research information, then the researchers may not use the certificate to withhold&#xD;
      that information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. This study will include a total of 1,000 participants&#xD;
      recruited at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
