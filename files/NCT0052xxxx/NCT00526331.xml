      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the early identification and more precise&#xD;
      intervention of operating room (OR) patient fluid administration optimization using arterial&#xD;
      pressure-based cardiac output (APCO) yields comparable patient outcome as fluid&#xD;
      administration optimization using a global standard care method.&#xD;

      THE EDWARDS VIGILEO MONITOR:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Vigileo™ monitor measures the amount of blood the heart pumps through the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING TEST:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can begin this study, you will have a &quot;screening test&quot; to help the doctor decide&#xD;
      if you are eligible to take part in this study. Women who are able to have children must have&#xD;
      a negative urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY GROUP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the flip of a coin) to either the Control Group or the Study Group. You will have an equal&#xD;
      chance of being assigned to either group. You will not know to which group you have been&#xD;
      assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PARTICIPATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a arterial catheter (small plastic tube) inserted into an artery inside your&#xD;
      wrist at the beginning of surgery. This is used routinely (even in patients not taking part&#xD;
      in the study) to measure your blood pressure more accurately rather than with a blood&#xD;
      pressure cuff. It is inserted after you receive general anesthesia (numbing medicine), so you&#xD;
      should feel no pain. If it is inserted while you are awake (based on the judgment of your&#xD;
      anesthesiologist), then local anesthesia will be given to you to reduce discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your doctors decide that an arterial catheter is not required as part of your routine&#xD;
      medical care during your surgery, they will not place one for study purposes only. In that&#xD;
      situation, you will be removed from the study, and your medical care will continue as planned&#xD;
      by your doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the catheter is placed, the Vigileo™ monitor will be connected to the catheter and&#xD;
      readings will be taken during the surgery. It will be disconnected at the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the Study Group, your doctor will use the monitor and routine vital sign&#xD;
      measurement to decide how much fluid to give you during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the Control Group, your doctor will not know the information being collected by&#xD;
      the monitor, as it will be collected and compared to the information collected from&#xD;
      participants in the Study Group. The amount of fluid you received during surgery will be&#xD;
      decided by routine vital sign measurement, as is standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESOPHAGEAL DOPPLER:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of study group assignment, during your surgery, researchers will also connect an&#xD;
      esophageal doppler which will also collect data on fluid volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The esophageal doppler is a thin, tube-like device that is placed in your throat while you&#xD;
      are asleep. This is used routinely by doctors to assist in the administration of fluids&#xD;
      during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information from the doppler will be compared to the information collected from the&#xD;
      Vigileo™ monitor. The esophageal doppler measures blood flow through your heart by ultrasound&#xD;
      waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LENGTH OF STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be considered off study once you leave the recovery room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will be collecting information on your progress during and after surgery,&#xD;
      including when you are allowed to leave the hospital. Your medical records will be reviewed&#xD;
      after surgery and up to 6 months after surgery to see how you are doing and if you have had&#xD;
      any medical problems. The kind of information researchers will be collecting is the amount of&#xD;
      time you were in the intensive care (if any), amount of time in the hospital, any&#xD;
      complications or problems you may have had, how well you organs are functioning, and general&#xD;
      health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The Vigileo™ Monitor and esophageal doppler are FDA&#xD;
      approved and commercially available for volume monitoring. The comparison of the monitor and&#xD;
      doppler is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 218 patients will be enrolled in this multi-center study. Up to 66 will be enrolled at&#xD;
      M.D. Anderson.&#xD;
