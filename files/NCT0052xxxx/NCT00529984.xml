      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary objective of this protocol is to determine the safety of immunization with&#xD;
           CEA(6D) VRP in patients with advanced or metastatic CEA expressing malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The secondary objectives are to evaluate CEA-specific immune response to the&#xD;
           immunizations and obtain preliminary data on response rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CEA represents an attractive target antigen for immunotherapy since it is over expressed in&#xD;
      nearly all colorectal cancers and pancreatic cancers, and is also expressed by some lung and&#xD;
      breast cancers, and uncommon tumors such as medullary thyroid cancer, but is not expressed in&#xD;
      other cells of the body except for low-level expression in gastrointestinal epithelium [1].&#xD;
      That CEA is a potential target for T cell mediated immune responses in humans is demonstrated&#xD;
      by the observation that CEA contains epitopes that may be recognized in an MHC restricted&#xD;
      fashion by T cells [2-11]. Specifically, there is support for the existence of human&#xD;
      cytolytic T cells (CTLs) that recognize CEA epitopes that bind to MHC molecules HLA- A2, A3,&#xD;
      and A24. For the most part, these T cells have been generated by in vitro cultures using&#xD;
      antigen-presenting cells pulsed with the epitope of interest to stimulate peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells. In addition, T cell lines have been generated after stimulation with CEA&#xD;
      latex beads, CEA protein-pulsed plastic adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or DCs&#xD;
      sensitized with CEA RNA. T cells have also been generated from patients immunized with a&#xD;
      vaccinia vector encoding CEA immunogen (discussed below). Using high-performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography mass-spectrometry-based approaches, HLA A2-presented peptides from CEA have&#xD;
      been identified in primary gastrointestinal tumors [12]. Of the HLA A2 restricted epitopes of&#xD;
      CEA, CAP-1, a nine amino acid sequence, has been shown to stimulate CTLs from cancer patients&#xD;
      immunized with vaccinia-CEA. Cap-1(6D) is a peptide analog of CAP-1. Its sequence includes a&#xD;
      heteroclitic (nonanchor position) mutation, resulting in an amino acid change from Asn to&#xD;
      Asp, to enhance recognition by the T-cell receptor without any change in binding to HLA A2.&#xD;
      Compared with the non mutated CAP-1 epitope, Cap-1(6D) has been shown to enhance the&#xD;
      sensitization of CTLs by 100 to 1,000 times [3, 5, 13]. CTL lines could be elicited from&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers by in vitro sensitization to the&#xD;
      Cap-1(6D) peptide but not to the CAP-1 peptide. These cell lines can lyse human tumor cells&#xD;
      expressing endogenous CEA.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cohorts 1-4 only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic malignancy due to a tumor expressing&#xD;
             CEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The tumor must express CEA as defined by immunohistochemical staining, CEA blood&#xD;
             level, or a tumor known to be universally CEA positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have received treatment with standard therapy having a possible overall survival&#xD;
             benefit or refused such therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have received and progressed through at least one line of palliative chemotherapy&#xD;
             for colorectal, breast, lung, or pancreatic cancer. For other malignancies, if a first&#xD;

             administered and there should have been progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cohort 5 Only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed colon cancer (rectal cancer excluded). Since colon cancer is&#xD;
             nearly universally CEA positive, CEA staining is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented stage III colon cancer with no evidence of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One to six months following standard post-operative adjuvant treatment, which should&#xD;
             have consisted of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid or capecitabine with or without&#xD;
             oxaliplatin for 4-6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        All Cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;

             chemotherapy for at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hematologic function (WBC ≥ 3000/microliter, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, and&#xD;
             platelets ≥ 100,000/microliter).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal and hepatic function, (serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL, bilirubin ≤ 1.5&#xD;
             mg/dL, and ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received CEA-targeted immunotherapy, if treatment was discontinued&#xD;
             at least 3 months before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are taking medications that do not have a known history of&#xD;
             immunosuppression are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ability to return to Duke University Medical Center for adequate follow-up, as&#xD;
             required by protocol.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with previously resected brain metastases will be permitted if a CT or MRI&#xD;
             scan shows no metastasis within 1 month before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of autoimmune disease.&#xD;
