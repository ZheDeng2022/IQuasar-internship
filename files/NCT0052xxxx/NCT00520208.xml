      This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of tamibarotene in adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute&#xD;
      promyelocytic leukemia (APL) following treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and&#xD;
      arsenic trioxide (ATO). Patients must have received and failed therapy with ATRA and ATO.&#xD;
      Treatment may have been administered either as combination therapy or sequentially as single&#xD;
      agents. Patients who are intolerant to either drug are eligible for this study.&#xD;

    <description>For induction therapy, tamibarotene will be self-administered via tablets on an outpatient basis at a dose of 6 mg/m2 per day, taken orally, in two divided doses approximately one hour after breakfast and dinner. Induction therapy will continue for a maximum of 56 days until either a morphologic leukemia-free state or complete response (CR) has been achieved. For patients who achieve a CR with induction therapy, consolidation therapy will commence 4 to 8 weeks after the end of induction therapy. For patients who have a morphologic leukemia-free state after induction therapy but who fail to achieve a CR, consolidation therapy will commence 8 weeks after the end of induction therapy.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients must meet all of the following criteria for admission into the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have a diagnosis of either relapsed and/or refractory APL:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Refractory disease is defined as a confirmed diagnosis of APL and a myeloblast&#xD;
                  plus promyelocyte count of &gt; 10% in the bone marrow in patients who have failed&#xD;
                  to respond to induction therapy in the first or second line setting. Induction&#xD;
                  therapy must have included ATRA- and ATO-based therapy given either sequentially&#xD;
                  or in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Relapsed disease is defined as a confirmed diagnosis of APL and a myeloblast plus&#xD;
                  promyelocyte count of &gt; 10% in the bone marrow following a documented complete&#xD;
                  remission or positive RT-PCR assay for PML/RAR-α in two consecutive tests&#xD;
                  separated by at least one month, after treatment with ATRA- and ATO-based therapy&#xD;
                  given either sequentially or in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Confirmation of diagnosis and relapsed/refractory APL must be obtained in blood or&#xD;
             bone marrow mononuclear cells by at least one of the following methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Conventional cytogenetics showing the translocation t(15:17),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Positive RT-PCR assay for PML/RAR-α, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showing evidence of the&#xD;
                  PML/RAR-α translocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have received and failed therapy with ATRA and ATO either within the&#xD;
             same or separate induction/consolidation schedule(s). Treatment must have been&#xD;
             administered for a minimum of 28 days for each agent. Treatment may have been&#xD;
             administered either as combination therapy or sequentially as single agents. Patients&#xD;
             who failed to complete a course of induction/consolidation therapy, as specified, due&#xD;
             to drug intolerance are eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients in whom ATO is contraindicated (for example due to congenital long QT&#xD;
             syndrome) are eligible for inclusion on study if they have received and failed ATRA&#xD;
             therapy as defined in (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Be able to provide written informed consent prior to enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Be ≥ 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have an estimated life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Be male or a non-pregnant, non-lactating female. Fertile patients must agree to use an&#xD;
             effective barrier method of contraception (e.g., latex condom, diaphragm, or cervical&#xD;
             cap) to avoid pregnancy while on therapy and for 90 days following the discontinuation&#xD;
             of the study drug. [In countries where double barrier contraception is required by&#xD;
             Regulatory Authorities, patients who are fertile must agree to use 2 forms of barrier&#xD;
             method contraception (e.g., latex condom AND a diaphragm or cervical cap) while on&#xD;
             therapy and for 90 days following the discontinuation of the study drug.]&#xD;
&#xD;
             A non-fertile female is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Postmenopausal (amenorrheic for ≥ 12 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Undergone a complete oophorectomy or hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 10 days prior to the first dose&#xD;
             of study drug (if patient is a female of childbearing potential).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Have adequate organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from study admission:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Extramedullary leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients on a vitamin A preparation or patients with hypervitaminosis A.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have received cytotoxic therapy ≤ 2 weeks from the start of therapy. If the patient&#xD;
             needs these agents due to urgent medical care within 2 weeks prior to starting&#xD;
             tamibarotene, a waiver may be granted by the INNOVIVE Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have a history of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have impaired cardiac function or clinically significant heart disease including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Myocardial infarction within 3 months, unstable angina pectoris, congenital long&#xD;
                  QT syndrome and clinically significant resting bradycardia (&lt; 50 beats per&#xD;
                  minute), uncontrolled congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension,&#xD;
                  history of labile hypertension, or history of poor compliance with&#xD;
                  antihypertensive medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have an active, uncontrolled systemic infection considered opportunistic,&#xD;
             life-threatening, or clinically significant at the time of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have clinically significant acute or chronic liver or renal disease considered&#xD;
             unrelated to leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have uncontrolled hyperlipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Have uncontrolled or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have impaired gastrointestinal function that may significantly alter drug absorption&#xD;
             (e.g., uncontrolled vomiting, ulcerative colitis, malabsorption, or small bowel&#xD;
             resection).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Have psychiatric disorder(s) that would interfere with consent, study participation,&#xD;
             or follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Have any other severe concurrent disease and/or uncontrolled medical conditions,&#xD;
             which, in the judgment of the investigator, could predispose patients to unacceptable&#xD;
             safety risks or compromise compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Have a history of another primary malignancy that has been actively treated in the&#xD;
             last 24 months.&#xD;
