      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of chemotherapy using Taxotere, Temodar, Cisplatin&#xD;
      (TTC) in patients with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the toxicity of chemotherapy using Taxotere, Temodar, Cisplatin (TTC) in&#xD;
           patients with metastatic melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the response rate of induction chemotherapy using Taxotere, Temodar,&#xD;
           Cisplatin (TTC) in patients with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;

      Temozolomide, docetaxel, and cisplatin are &quot;chemotherapy&quot; drugs, known to kill tumor cells by&#xD;
      interfering with the important structures in these cells to grow and divide. Each of these&#xD;
      drugs has been used separately for melanoma treatment. These 3 drugs have not been used in&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on the study, you will have what are called &quot;screening tests&quot;.&#xD;
      These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in the study. You&#xD;
      will have a complete medical history and physical exam, including routine blood tests (less&#xD;
      than 3 tablespoons). You will have an electrocardiogram (EKG - test to measure the electrical&#xD;
      activity of the heart), a chest x-ray, and CT scans of the chest and abdomen. You will have a&#xD;
      MRI or CT scan of brain will as well. Depending on the location of melanoma, CT scans of the&#xD;
      head and neck or pelvis and/or a bone scan may be taken. Photographs of the tumor may be&#xD;
      taken if the tumors are located on the surface of the skin. Women who are able to have&#xD;
      children must have a negative blood pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible, you will receive temozolomide, cisplatin, and docetaxel. The&#xD;
      doses of temozolomide and cisplatin will be fixed for all groups. The dose of docetaxel will&#xD;
      be changed between patient groups until the highest safe dose is found Between 3 and 6&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in each group. Docetaxel will be given by vein over 1 hour, once a&#xD;
      week, for three weeks (on Days 1, 8, and 15). This will be followed by one week of rest.&#xD;
      These 3 weeks of treatment and 1 week or rest make up 1 cycle. Cisplatin will be given by&#xD;
      vein once a day for four days in a row (Days 1, 2, 3 and 4) over 2 hours each cycle.&#xD;
      Temozolomide will be taken by mouth for five days in a row (Days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) of each&#xD;
      cycle. The number of temozolomide pills that you take will be based on your height and&#xD;
      weight. Temozolomide must be taken on an empty stomach (at least 2 hours before or after&#xD;
      meals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For your comfort in receiving cisplatin and docetaxel by vein, your doctor may recommend a&#xD;
      catheter. A catheter is a plastic tube that is inserted into a vein in one of your arms or&#xD;
      into the vein that runs underneath the collar bone, and then threaded into the central vein&#xD;
      in the upper part of the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose of docetaxel and all of the cisplatin doses must be given at M.D. Anderson on&#xD;
      an outpatient basis. All of the temozolomide doses can be taken at home and the Day 8 and Day&#xD;
      15 doses of docetaxel can be taken at a local clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to help the body produce new&#xD;
      blood cells. G-CSF would be given as an injection under the skin on Days 9-13 of each cycle&#xD;
      (except the first cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, you will have a complete physical exam every 4 weeks. Blood samples (1&#xD;
      tablespoon or less) will be taken weekly to monitor the blood counts and liver functions. A&#xD;
      chest x-ray and CT scans of the chest and abdomen with or without head and neck and pelvis&#xD;
      will be done every 2 cycles (8 weeks). A MRI or CT scan of the brain as well as photographs&#xD;
      may also be taken every 2 cycles during the study. For patients who have significant tumor&#xD;
      shrinkage with the treatment, these imaging studies may be repeated in 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants can receive at least 6 cycles of treatment. If your tumor continues to&#xD;
      shrink after the end of 6 cycles, you may be eligible to receive further treatment at the&#xD;
      discretion of the study chair. You may be taken off study early, if your disease gets worse&#xD;
      or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have one last &quot;follow-up&quot; visit once you are taken off study. At this visit you will&#xD;
      have a complete physical exam and blood samples (1 tablespoon) for routine tests will be&#xD;
      taken. You will have a chest x-ray and CT scans of the chest and abdomen, with or without&#xD;
      head and neck and pelvis, and with or without a MRI of brain at this visit as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The FDA has approved all of the drugs in this study, and&#xD;
      they are commercially available. However, their use together in this study is experimental.&#xD;
      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson.&#xD;
