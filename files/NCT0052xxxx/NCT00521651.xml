  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is a sub-study of the ongoing &quot;Protect Health and Reduce Cancer Risk&quot; study&#xD;
      conducted in Shanghai, China, and sponsored by the Shanghai Cancer Institute, Vanderbilt&#xD;
      University, and the National Cancer Institute. The parent study is designed to examine the&#xD;
      relationship of diet, lifestyle, occupational, and environmental risk factors, as well as&#xD;
      genetic variation, to cancer incidence in a large cohort of men in women between 40 and 70&#xD;
      years of age. The current sub-study will assess the validity and reliability of a new&#xD;
      physical activity questionnaire for use in the parent study and to evaluate whether different&#xD;
      types of activity and the frequency, intensity, and duration of activity are associated with&#xD;
      markers that have been linked to cancer risk, such as C-reactive protein, interleukin 6 and&#xD;
      soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the current 12-month study are selected from among men and women&#xD;
      participating in the &quot;Protect Health and Reduce Cancer Risk&quot; study. Participants keep a diary&#xD;
      of their physical activity and complete two 30-minute interviews about their physical&#xD;
      activity, one at the beginning and one at the end of the study period. Every 3 months for 7&#xD;
      consecutive days, they wear a pager-sized activity monitor on their waist that records their&#xD;
      physical activity patterns during that period of time. They provide blood and urine samples&#xD;
      four times during the study and, at the end of the study, undergo a health examination that&#xD;
      includes an electrocardiogram, body composition measurement, and physical fitness test. The&#xD;
      fitness test is a step-test consisting of 3-minute stages in which the subject successively&#xD;
      increases the stepping speed until reaching 85 percent of his or her predicted maximal heart&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples are analyzed for levels of nutrients and certain proteins, and are&#xD;
      stored for future studies related to nutrition and physical activity and possibly for genetic&#xD;
      studies related to health, nutrition, exercise, or disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past decade, China has experienced fundamental decreases in the populations' physical&#xD;
      activity levels, due to increasingly sedentary occupations and lifestyles. However, the&#xD;
      transition to a Western lifestyle has not reached the entire Chinese population. The&#xD;
      resulting wide range of between-person variation in physical activity provides an&#xD;
      unparalleled opportunity for physical activity studies. Although physical activity&#xD;
      measurement techniques have evolved considerably over the past years, the main obstacle in&#xD;
      quantifying physical activity is the complexity of precisely measuring its individual&#xD;
      components, particularly low to moderate-intensity activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, investigators at Vanderbilt University, the Shanghai Cancer Institute, and the DCEG&#xD;
      initiated two prospective population-based cohort studies: the Shanghai Women's Cohort and&#xD;
      the Shanghai Men's Cohort. The aim of these studies is to prospectively examine the relations&#xD;
      of diet, lifestyle, occupational, and environmental risk factors, as well as genetic&#xD;
      variation, to cancer incidence among 75,000 women and 73,000 men, aged 40 to 70 years old,&#xD;
      and residing in Shanghai, China. We propose to conduct a study among 600 women and men&#xD;
      participating in these two cohort studies. The specific objectives of the current study are&#xD;
      to develop a comprehensive physical activity questionnaire and to assess the validity and&#xD;
      reliability of this instrument in the Shanghai cohorts using objective measures of physical&#xD;
      activity/physical fitness: activity monitors, and the Modified Canadian Aerobic Fitness Test.&#xD;
      In addition, we intend to evaluate whether different types and parameters of physical&#xD;
      activity are associated with circulating levels of specific inflammatory markers that have&#xD;
      been linked to cancer risk. The specific markers are C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6&#xD;
      (IL-6), and soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a). The impact of potentially&#xD;
      confounding variables of the association between physical activity and inflammatory markers,&#xD;
      such as recent exercise, use of anti-inflammatory drugs, and current or recent infections,&#xD;
      will be carefully accounted for in the analysis.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The current study will be conducted in random sub samples of the Shanghai Women's Cohort&#xD;
        Study and Shanghai Men's Cohort Study. Eligibility in these 2 cohort studies was determined&#xD;
        based on the following: 40 to 70 years of age and residing in one of 7 Shanghai urban areas&#xD;
        that is representative of all of urban Shanghai. Both women and men will be included in the&#xD;
        study. No exclusions will be made by race, although it should be noted that the study&#xD;
        population of the Shanghai Women's Cohort and Shanghai Men's Cohort Study is virtually 100%&#xD;
        Asian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        There wil be no prior from participation, other than the presence of physical ailments&#xD;
        preventing subjects from participating in the study. Before participating in the fitness&#xD;
        test, subjects will be screened for cardiovascular disease, othopedic limitations, or other&#xD;
        factors that contraindicate testing, including pregnancy, respiratory problems at rest&#xD;
        (labored breathing or persistent cough), presence of illness or fever, or swelling of the&#xD;
        lower extremities. In addition, participants who do not adhere to the pre-test instructions&#xD;
        of not eating heavily or drinking alcohol 2 hours before the test will be excluded from&#xD;
        performing the fitness test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children will not be included in the current study, because study subjects are comprised of&#xD;
        participants in the Shanghai Womens's Cohort Study and the Shanghai Men's Cohort Study, who&#xD;
        are 40 to 70 years of age.&#xD;
