  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if a prostate implant (brachytherapy)&#xD;
      can help to control intermediate risk prostate cancer. The safety of this procedure will also&#xD;
      be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate brachytherapy is performed by inserting permanent seeds (which are radioactive&#xD;
      pellets) into your prostate in order to treat the prostate cancer with radiation therapy.&#xD;

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have an ultrasound of&#xD;
      your prostate before brachytherapy so that the prostate can be measured and mapped and the&#xD;
      placement of the needles and seeds planned ahead of time. This is a 20-minute outpatient&#xD;
      procedure that involves placing a probe (tube) into your rectum, which takes ultrasound&#xD;
      pictures of the prostate to learn the size and shape. A specialized radiation plan for each&#xD;
      patient is made, and the exact number of needles and seeds depend on the size and shape of&#xD;
      the prostate. Ultrasound pictures, using the probe in the rectum, are taken before the&#xD;
      implant procedure so that the plan can be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brachytherapy is an outpatient surgical procedure. Under general or spinal anesthesia, you&#xD;
      will have thin needles inserted through the skin between the anus and the scrotum. Seeds are&#xD;
      inserted into the prostate through the needles. An ultrasound probe (tube which sends images&#xD;
      of the prostate to a screen) is placed into the rectum and remains there during the procedure&#xD;
      to help direct the needles. After the seeds are inserted, the needles are removed. The seeds&#xD;
      remain permanently in the prostate. Typically, about 25 needles are inserted with about 100&#xD;
      seeds. The implant procedure takes about 1-2 hours in the operating room. Afterwards, you&#xD;
      will go to the recovery room for 1-3 hours. You will then have a computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      scan after the procedure to make sure the seeds are properly placed. You will then be allowed&#xD;
      to return home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, you will have a study visit in 4-6 weeks. After that first follow-up visit,&#xD;
      you will have follow-up visits at 4, 8, and 12 months (+/- 3 weeks) after treatment. After&#xD;
      that, follow-up visits are every 6 months until 5 years after treatment and then once a year&#xD;
      from then on (+/- 3 weeks). At these visits, you will have a physical exam. This may include&#xD;
      a digital rectal exam if your doctor feels that it is needed. Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will&#xD;
      be drawn for routine tests. You will be asked to complete 2 questionnaires about your&#xD;
      urinary, bowel, sexual function, and overall quality of life. The 2 questionnaires take about&#xD;
      30 minutes to complete in total. A CT scan of the prostate will also be performed at the&#xD;
      first follow-up visit after the implant to make sure the seeds are properly placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If blood tests show that your cancer is getting worse, a biopsy may be done after the&#xD;
      treatment is complete. A biopsy is done by inserting a needle through the rectum and into the&#xD;
      prostate. The procedure is similar to the one done to first diagnose your prostate cancer.&#xD;
      Six (6) to 10 samples are usually taken. The doctor will also perform an ultrasound. This is&#xD;
      done by placing a tube in the rectum, which shows a picture of the prostate on a screen and&#xD;
      is used to guide the biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be taken off study if your disease progresses. Otherwise, you will remain on study&#xD;
      indefinitely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Brachytherapy is FDA approved. Up to 300 patients will take&#xD;
      part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
