  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The contribution of diesel exhaust (DE) to health, especially children's health, is of&#xD;
      tremendous public health interest. DE has been associated with worsening asthma and&#xD;
      allergies, among other important health effects. Reducing DE exposures has become a major&#xD;
      regulatory initiative, and federal, state, and local jurisdictions are investing hundreds of&#xD;
      millions of dollars in retrofitting diesel engines in school buses and other changes to reach&#xD;
      this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's recent regulations require all on-road diesel&#xD;
      vehicles to change to low emission engines and ultra-low-sulfur fuels by 2007 (US EPA '00).&#xD;
      In spring 2003, the U.S. EPA announced a nationwide voluntary school bus retrofit initiative.&#xD;
      In July 2003, the Washington Legislature enacted a statewide &quot;Diesel Solutions&quot; program that&#xD;
      provides 25 million dollars by 2008 to retrofit school diesel buses with cleaner burning&#xD;
      engines and fuels, making it one of the largest and most active voluntary school bus retrofit&#xD;
      program in the country. If risk assessment estimates are accurate, these changes will have a&#xD;
      large public health impact, especially on children who ride school buses daily. However, no&#xD;
      studies to-date have rigorously examined school children's exposure to diesel exhaust (DE)&#xD;
      and its health effects, nor such a significant change in vehicular pollution control. We&#xD;
      propose to seize this opportunity of a large natural experiment taking place in the Puget&#xD;
      Sound area and conduct a study to assess health effects from diesel bus exhaust before and&#xD;
      after the retrofit of diesel bus fleets between 2005 and 2007. The specific aims of the study&#xD;
      are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether asthmatic children changing to retrofitted buses with cleaner fuels&#xD;
           and engines have a reduction in sub-clinical and clinical asthma severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if increased levels of DE exposure lead to an increase in acute clinical and&#xD;
           sub-clinical features of asthma in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quantify the levels and changes in particle and toxic gas exposures to DE in 3 groups of&#xD;
           children commuting to school by retrofitted buses or private cars, old diesel buses to&#xD;
           be retrofitted later, and old diesel buses through the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-aim 3: Use the time-activity information, personal exposure measurements, and on-bus&#xD;
      monitoring data to construct an exposure model to predict individual exposures to DE for all&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We will recruit 450 subjects ranging from 9 to 11 years old (or 3rd to 5th graders). These&#xD;
      children who commute to school will perform repeated monthly measures of pulmonary function&#xD;
      tests using spirometry, pulmonary inflammation via exhaled breath, and asthma symptoms and&#xD;
      clinical encounters, up to 3 school years. These 500 children will represent 3 exposure&#xD;
      scenarios: 1) one group of 125 children riding retrofitted school buses or private cars; 2)&#xD;
      250 children riding old buses who will change to retrofitted buses during the first or second&#xD;
      year of the study; and 3) 125 children who ride old diesel buses through the study. All&#xD;
      subjects will be either healthy or having physician-diagnosed asthma with severity ranging&#xD;
      from mild intermittent to moderate persistent. Personal exposure monitoring of particulate&#xD;
      matter, CO, NO2, and SO2 will be performed on a subset of 144 asthmatic subjects, with each&#xD;
      subject being monitored for up to 2 days, in each monitoring year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects participating in the study will wear a small backpack containing several personal&#xD;
      air monitors measuring real-time particulate matter concentrations and carbon monoxide&#xD;
      concentrations as well as integrated (24 hour averaged) measurements of SO2 and NO2. The&#xD;
      children's personal monitoring will begin when they wake up in the morning and continue for&#xD;
      24-hours. When wearing the backpack is inconvenient, such as when sleeping, the monitoring&#xD;
      equipment should be placed in close proximity to the subject. Once the subject arrives at&#xD;
      school, s/he will be asked to perform three respiratory tests: exhaled nitric oxide, exhaled&#xD;
      breath condensate, and spirometry. At the end of the school day, the subject will be asked to&#xD;
      perform the same two tests of lung function as earlier, plus an additional test of exhaled&#xD;
      breath condensate. The subject will then continue his/her day as normal. A technician will&#xD;
      replace the filter in the particulate matter monitor between 6 and 7 PM. We will repeat the&#xD;
      same monitoring procedure the following morning when the subject wakes up for another 24-h.&#xD;
      Monitoring will stop on the third morning when the subjects wake up. In addition to the&#xD;
      personal monitoring, a monitoring kit will be installed in the subject's school bus and will&#xD;
      be operated by a technician. This in-vehicle monitoring kit includes everything contained in&#xD;
      the personal monitoring kit, plus a P-TRAK (TSI, model 8525) for real-time ultra-fine&#xD;
      particle counts, two Harvard Personal Environmental Monitors (HPEM) with Teflon and quartz&#xD;
      filters respectively for determining elemental carbon fractions, an EcoChem PAS2000CE monitor&#xD;
      for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and a global positioning system personal&#xD;
      acquisition logger (GPS-PAL). The following timeline shows the typical daily schedule for a&#xD;
      subject participating in the study.&#xD;
