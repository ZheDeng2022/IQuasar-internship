      This is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to&#xD;
      investigate whether hyperimmune bovine milk IgG products specific for CsbD and CS17, protect&#xD;
      subjects against diarrhea upon challenge with a CS-17-ETEC strain LSN03-016011/A. The study&#xD;
      will also evaluate safety and tolerability of these bovine milk IgG products and describe the&#xD;
      immune responses following challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objectives are: 1) Assess safety of the anti-CsbD and anti-CS17 bovine milk&#xD;
      IgG among healthy adult volunteers when orally administered three times a day over 7 days. 2)&#xD;
      Determine efficacy of the anti-CsbD bovine milk IgG preparation against ETEC diarrhea upon&#xD;
      challenge with CS17-ETEC, and 3)Determine efficacy of the anti-CS17 bovine milk IgG&#xD;
      preparation against ETEC diarrhea upon challenge with CS17-ETEC. A secondary objective is to&#xD;
      determine efficacy of the anti-CsbD and anti-CS17 bovine milk IgG preparations against&#xD;
      moderate to severe ETEC diarrhea upon challenge with CS17-ETEC.&#xD;

&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed&#xD;
      to investigate whether hyperimmune bovine milk IgG products specific for CsbD and CS17,&#xD;
      protect subjects against diarrhea upon challenge with a CS-17-ETEC strain LSN03-016011/A. The&#xD;
      study will also evaluate safety and tolerability of these bovine milk IgG products and&#xD;
      describe the immune responses following challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects (N=39) will be randomized into three groups receiving anti-CS17 bovine milk IgG,&#xD;
      anti-CsbD bovine milk IgG, or a placebo control (a commercially available lactose-free infant&#xD;
      formula called LactoFree® Lipil®) on study day -2. Subjects will receive three doses a day of&#xD;
      the test article 15 minutes (range 10 - 25 minutes) after each of their three daily meals&#xD;
      (breakfast, lunch and dinner) for a period of 7 days (i.e., from study day -2 to study day&#xD;
      4). The study will be divided into two cohorts, An initial cohort of 9 subjects (3 per&#xD;
      treatment group), will be admitted to the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) of the&#xD;
      Johns Hopkins Hospital for the initial testing of the bovine milk IgG products. A second&#xD;
      cohort of 30 subjects will then be admitted to the Bayview inpatient facility to complete the&#xD;
      prophylaxis study. Logistical considerations and/or withdrawals or disqualifications prior to&#xD;
      admission or after randomization, but prior to receiving the ETEC challenge, may require a&#xD;
      third cohort to be admitted to either of these facilities. Allowing for these contingencies,&#xD;
      the minimum number of subjects to be challenged with ETEC is 33 total and the maximum number&#xD;
      of subjects will be 42. The GCRC Project Review Committee will review the protocol prior to&#xD;
      subject admission at the GCRC. A brief description of the two inpatient facilities to be used&#xD;
      in this study is provided in Section 6.1.2. Unit doses of the test article powders (as&#xD;
      detailed in Table 5) will be suspended in 150 mL of water containing 2 grams of sodium&#xD;
      bicarbonate buffer. Doses of the test articles/placebo will be prepared by study staff under&#xD;
      the supervision of the research pharmacist. The study staff involved in dose preparation will&#xD;
      not be collecting clinical data on subjects. On the fourth day of the inpatient phase (study&#xD;
      day 0), after their morning meal and receipt of test article/placebo, subjects will be given&#xD;
      120mL of sodium bicarbonate buffer to neutralize their stomach acidity. About 1 minute later&#xD;
      they will ingest a dose of CS17-ETEC strain LSN03-016011/A (5 X 109 cfu) diluted in 30 ml&#xD;
      sodium bicarbonate buffer. Subjects will continue to receive three doses a day of the test&#xD;
      articles/placebo until study day 4. Subjects meeting preset criteria will be treated with&#xD;
      antibiotics within 24 hours of determination by the investigator and test article/placebo&#xD;
      administration will be discontinued with initiation of treatment. Subjects who do not receive&#xD;
      early antibiotic treatment will start antibiotic treatment on study day 5. Routine discharge&#xD;
      is scheduled for day 7, when most subjects are expected to meet the discharge criteria of:&#xD;
      they feel well(clinical symptoms resolved or resolving and have taken at least one dose of&#xD;
      antibiotic and have 1 stool culture negative for the challenge strain. Subjects may be&#xD;
      discharged earlier than day 7 on a case-by-case basis if they meet discharge criteria. The&#xD;
      duration of the active study period is approximately seven months, encompassing up to 6 and&#xD;
      1/2 weeks of screening/enrollment, 4 weeks of the inpatient/outpatient phase when data and&#xD;
      samples will be collected, 12 weeks for immunology assays, and 2 months for analysis and&#xD;
      report.&#xD;
