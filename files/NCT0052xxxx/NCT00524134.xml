  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In up to 1 out of 3 patients with epilepsy, seizures continue to occur despite the use of one&#xD;
      or more antiepileptic medications. Patients also have significant problems with side-effects&#xD;
      of these medications as doses are increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our body naturally generates miniature pumps located on the surfaces of many organs to get&#xD;
      rid of toxic substances, and antiepileptic medications can be considered by the cells of the&#xD;
      body to be a toxin. Research with epileptic brain regions have shown an increase in the&#xD;
      amount of drug pumps, therefore getting rid of antiepileptic drugs. One of these pumps is&#xD;
      called p-glycoprotein (P-gp for short). Medications may be unable to penetrate and stay&#xD;
      within the parts of the brain that need them them most. This may mean that the amount of drug&#xD;
      is actually lower in the parts of the brain that cause seizures, and higher in the rest of&#xD;
      the brain, which may be why patients may still feel side-effects when seizures are still&#xD;
      occurring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research in animals has shown that blocking the P-gp pumps can improve how bad, and how many&#xD;
      seizures occur as well as the length of seizures. Blockage of the pumps can be done using a&#xD;
      different type of medication. Some medications that are used for common problems have been&#xD;
      discovered to also block P-gp pumps. One of these, carvedilol, is used to treat heart failure&#xD;
      and high blood pressure. It has been found to be very safe in these patients, and does not&#xD;
      have a lot of side-effects. We plan to add this medication in addition to patient's&#xD;
      anti-seizure medications to see if it will improve epileptic seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason why some patients have high amounts of P-gp pumps and others do not may be related&#xD;
      to their genetics. A simple blood test can be used to determine a person's potential to&#xD;
      produce high quantities of the pumps. This study will also attempt to show that the genetics&#xD;
      will affect how well the P-gp blocking will work.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Center for Disease Control reports that epilepsy afflicts 2.7 million Americans with&#xD;
      annual costs of $15.5 billion. They estimate that 3% of Americans will have a diagnosis of&#xD;
      epilepsy by age 80, and decided in 1997 to focus on treatment, with a motto of &quot;no seizures,&#xD;
      no side effects&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiepileptic drugs (AED) can fail, despite being structurally unrelated and acting on&#xD;
      different parts of the nervous system. This refractory state constitutes up to 35% of the&#xD;
      epilepsy population, and may be due to pharmacoresistance. Efflux transporters, such as&#xD;
      P-glycoprotein (Pgp), are present at the bloodbrain barrier and serve to pump out&#xD;
      structurally unrelated compounds, likely serving as a method for the removal of toxins (and&#xD;
      drugs). Upregulation of efflux transporters such as Pgp by tumor cells are thought to&#xD;
      contribute to chemotherapy resistant cancer tumors, but Pgp has also been found focally at&#xD;
      seizure foci. Its overexpression was also noted in blood vessel endothelial cells following&#xD;
      temporal lobe resection for intractable epilepsy. Case series have shown mRNA for MDR1, the&#xD;
      gene encoding Pgp, to be 10x greater in the medial temporal lobes of patients with temporal&#xD;
      lobe epilepsy, as compared to those without epilepsy. Pathological examination following&#xD;
      surgical resections have found that epilepsy causing lesions such as cortical dysplasias,&#xD;
      encephalitis, tuberculous leptomeningitis, tuberous sclerosis and astrocytomas express Pgp in&#xD;
      neurons and/or glia, whereas normal brain parenchyma does not. In animal and cell research,&#xD;
      upregulation has been seen following seizure induction and status epilepticus. Many AEDs are&#xD;
      validated substrates to Pgp in animal studies. Delivery of these medications to the brain is&#xD;
      likely associated with Pgp and in some cases, presence of the substrate may upregulate Pgp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When Pgp inhibitors were added to animal models of drug resistant epilepsy, there were&#xD;
      significant improvements in seizure frequency, duration and severity, providing&#xD;
      proof-of-concept at the animal level. Carvedilol and verapamil, among other medications, have&#xD;
      been found to be potent Pgp inhibitors. Verapamil and dexverapamil, either oral or&#xD;
      intravenous, has been used as Pgp-inhibitors in clinical trials, with success as an adjuvant&#xD;
      in malignant lymphoma and a phase III study as an adjunct in chemorefractory, metastatic&#xD;
      breast carcinoma. There have been no clinical trials published using Pgp-inhibition in&#xD;
      epilepsy.&#xD;
