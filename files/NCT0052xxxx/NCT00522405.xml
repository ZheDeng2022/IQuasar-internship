      Background Hepatocellular carcinoma, a malignant tumor of liver is one of the most common&#xD;
      cancers worldwide. All India Institute Of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) being a tertiary care&#xD;
      hospital receives about two to three cases of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) each day in our&#xD;
      Gastroenterology out patient department. Most of these patients present late when the disease&#xD;
      is already advanced and no curative therapies can be offered. At this stage, palliative&#xD;
      therapy forms the mainstay of treatment. This includes TACE or Oral chemotherapy. Whether&#xD;
      oral chemotherapy administered along with TACE potentiates the effect and further prolongs&#xD;
      survival, needs to be ascertained. No studies of this kind are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study is therefore designed to address this issue.&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Diagnostic criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cirrhosis of liver- Diagnosis will be founded on the basis of clinical, biochemical&#xD;
                and endoscopy findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hepatocellular carcinoma- when any one of the following is present&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Any two imaging modalities(Ultrasound (US), dual phase CT (DPCT)/ contrast enhanced MRI)&#xD;
           showing arterialization of the hepatic mass&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AFP more than 400ng/ml along with arterialisation on one imaging modality (DPCT/&#xD;
           contrast enhanced MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. FNAC&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      · Patients will be randomized after the confirmation of diagnosis and obtaining written&#xD;
      consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      · Sequences will be generated by the Statistician&#xD;
&#xD;
      · Stratified randomization will be done. Two strata of child's A and B will be made&#xD;
&#xD;
      · Randomization will be done by drawing consecutively numbered opaque sealed envelopes&#xD;
&#xD;
      · Randomization into A (TACE) and B (TACE +oral chemotherapy) will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unresectable HCC-&#xD;
&#xD;
           · Liver mass larger than 5cm in diameter (single/ multiple), involving less than 50% of&#xD;
           the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
           · Multiple masses more than three in number and more than 3cm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tumor response&#xD;
&#xD;
           This will be based on Dual phase CT findings&#xD;
&#xD;
           · Complete response (CR)- Tumor fully covered with lipiodol showing no viable tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Partial response (PR)- Tumor partially covered (&gt;75%) by lipiodol&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mild response (MR)- About 50 to 75% coverage of the tumor by lipiodol&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No response (NR) - About 25 to 50% coverage of the tumor by lipiodol&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fresh lesions (FL)- Appearance of new mass lesions in the liver with or without&#xD;
                recurrence at the site of previous mass&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient tolerance- Grade 1: no side effects Grade 2: moderate side effects Grade 3:&#xD;
           severe side effects Grade 4: life threatening side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Performance status (PST score)&#xD;
&#xD;
           PST score of 0-5 would be assessed on the following basis 0- No cancer related symptoms.&#xD;
           Normal life style 1- Minor symptoms related to cancer. Capable of non-strenuous&#xD;
           activity. Fully ambulatory 2- Ambulatory and capable of all self care but unable to&#xD;
           carry out any work activities Confined to bed less than 50% of waking hours 3- Capable&#xD;
           of only limited self care. Confined to bed more than 50% of waking hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4- Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self care. Totally confined to bed. 5- Death&#xD;
&#xD;
           5. Sample Size Systematic review of RCTs for TACE show a 2 year survival of 37%.&#xD;
           Expecting that addition of oral drugs would increase survival to 37 to 60%, for a power&#xD;
           of 80% and error of 5%, a sample size of 73 patients in each arm would be required&#xD;
           (Total 146 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
           6. Procedure of TACE&#xD;
&#xD;
           · Patient would be admitted a day prior to the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
           · Patient would be made to fast overnight with intravenous fluid infusion started for&#xD;
           maintaining hydration&#xD;
&#xD;
           · Pre-procedure analgesic (3rd generation antibiotic) would be started at a dose of 2gm&#xD;
           intravenously, 12 hourly, at least 12 hour before the procedure and continued 5 days&#xD;
           post procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
           · Under local anesthesia, the Femoral artery would be punctured at the upper thigh with&#xD;
           a Medicut 18 gauge&#xD;
&#xD;
           · A catheter would be introduced through this route with the help of a guide wire and a&#xD;
           flush aortogram, superior mesenteric arterioportography and the celiac artery run would&#xD;
           be undertaken to define the size and location of the tumors, feeding vessels and to&#xD;
           assess the portal vein patency&#xD;
&#xD;
           · Superselective catheterization of the hepatic artery feeding the tumor would be done&#xD;
&#xD;
           · By placing the catheter tip beyond the gastroduodenal artery, the chemotherapeutic&#xD;
           drugs would be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           · Stable drug mixture would be prepared by using Doxorubicin 50mg, Cisplatin 100mg in&#xD;
           combination with 10-15ml of ionic contrast media and 10-20ml of lipiodol by continuously&#xD;
           agitating the mixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
           · Hydrocortisone 100mg and augmenting dose of analgesic and sedative would be injected&#xD;
           prior to the administration of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
           · The drug mixture would then be injected through the indwelling arterial catheter by&#xD;
           continuously flushing alternately, repeatedly and rapidly between two lever lock&#xD;
           syringes connected across a three way.&#xD;
&#xD;
           · Gelfoam particles would be injected following this for embolization&#xD;
&#xD;
           · Post procedure, devascularization would be confirmed by additional angiography of the&#xD;
           hepatic artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           · Procedure would last approx 45mts-1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
           · Tight compression would be given at the punctured site and patient would be shifted to&#xD;
           the ward once complete hemostasis is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7. Follow up post TACE Clinical follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All patients would be followed up in the Liver clinic monthly unless their clinical&#xD;
                condition warrants earlier follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Liver function tests/ complete blood count would also be done at each visit and AFP&#xD;
                (if elevated earlier) every six months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient tolerance, child's status would be estimated. Imaging follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At one month, a dual phase CT would be done to ascertain the response to therapy&#xD;
                and the need to repeat the procedure. Subsequently, the DPCT would be done at 3 and&#xD;
                6 monthly intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Once the tumor shows complete coverage, randomization into the two treatment groups&#xD;
                would be done&#xD;
&#xD;
                9. Repeat TACE on follow up This would be done if any of the following is noted&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  DPCT shows viable tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fresh lesions appear&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Elevated serum AFP occurs with or without appearance of viable mass on DPCT&#xD;
&#xD;
                10. Oral chemotherapy Drugs used would be Thalidomide and Capecitabine in the&#xD;
                following dosage schedule-&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thalidomide---100mg once a day (OD) for 7 days, Increased to 200mg OD for 7 days,&#xD;
           further increased to 300mgOD for 7 days till a maximum of 600mg once a day is reached&#xD;
&#xD;
           Capecitabine---- 500mg OD for 7 days, then 1000mg OD for next 7 days, increased to a&#xD;
           maximum dose of 1500mg OD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Total leucocyte count &amp; Platelet count would be monitored every 15 days&#xD;
&#xD;
           11. Duration of follow up- Two years after achieving total coverage of the mass lesion&#xD;
           on DPCT&#xD;
&#xD;
           12. Outcome measures Following parameters will be used to ascertain the outcome of&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
