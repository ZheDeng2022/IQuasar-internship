      To define the relationship between Cardene I.V. dose, serum concentrations, and blood&#xD;
      pressure reduction in pediatric subjects with hypertension.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with acute hypertensive episodes are frequently treated with the same marketed drugs&#xD;
      as adults. Few drugs are specifically indicated for use in children with severe hypertension.&#xD;
      Cardene I.V. has been widely used in children with severe hypertension without specific&#xD;
      dosing recommendations for children in the labeling. This study is designed to examine the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy of using Cardene I.V. to reduce&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP) in children with hypertension and will provide important information to&#xD;
      guide use in pediatric patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to the sale of Cardene IV, the sponsor has stopped enrollment and withdrawn the study. No&#xD;
    safety issues were identified.&#xD;
