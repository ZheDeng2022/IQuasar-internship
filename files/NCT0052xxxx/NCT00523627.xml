  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, conducted at the NIH Clinical Research Unit at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center,&#xD;
      will examine how the body s metabolism (energy expenditure) changes when people overeat and&#xD;
      when they fast and how different diets (e.g., high-protein or high-fat) affect metabolism.&#xD;
      The results may provide information about whether there are mechanisms that make some people&#xD;
      more resistant than others to gaining weight when they eat more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-smoking healthy subjects between 18 and 55 years of age who weigh no more than 350 pounds&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test for women of childbearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test. For this test, an I.V. line (needle attached to a plastic&#xD;
           tube) is inserted into a vein to allow several blood draws without repeated needle&#xD;
           sticks. After the first blood sample is drawn, the subject drinks a cola-flavored sugar&#xD;
           solution. Five additional blood samples are then drawn over 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood test for DNA (genetic) studies related to obesity, diabetes and related medical&#xD;
           problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA scan. This test measures body fat. The subject lies on a table while a very small&#xD;
           dose of X-rays is passed through the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory chamber. This test measures how many calories the body burns a day and&#xD;
           assesses energy balance between intake and expenditure. Subjects stay in a room with two&#xD;
           windows, equipped with a sink, toilet, television and DVD player, desk, chair, telephone&#xD;
           and bed for 24 hours. The test is repeated five times during the first 18-day admission&#xD;
           and 3 times during the second 13-day admission. For the first two sessions, subjects are&#xD;
           fed a diet equal to the amount of energy their body uses. For the next 6 stays they are&#xD;
           fed double the amount of calories their body usually uses for 5 of the stays and fast&#xD;
           (consume nothing but water and soda without caffeine or calories) during 1 stay. The&#xD;
           overfeeding diets may be high or low in protein, normal in protein, or high in fat.&#xD;
           Blood tests are done on the day of each respiratory chamber session and a 24-hour urine&#xD;
           sample is collected for one day while in the chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eating behavior questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological performance tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants are asked to volunteer to repeat two of the chamber studies to validate the&#xD;
      measurements. The repeat session includes only the fasting and the overfeeding with normal&#xD;
      protein content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants are followed at 6 months with blood tests, a DEXA scan, and urine tests&#xD;
      (including pregnancy test for women). At annual visits for years 1 through 7, participants&#xD;
      have the 6-month tests plus an oral glucose tolerance test.&#xD;

      Some people appear to be more resistant than others to gaining weight when they overeat,&#xD;
      though they do not increase their physical activity. This may indicate that adaptive&#xD;
      mechanisms exist, which lead to wasting as heat part of the excess calories taken in. Such&#xD;
      mechanisms exist in rodents including activation of brown fat, a tissue which can also&#xD;
      convert calories to heat for warmth. Human studies have provided conflicting results. A pilot&#xD;
      study on the relationship of the weight change over time with the changes in the amount of&#xD;
      energy an individual uses over 24 hours (energy expenditure, EE) with 48-h overfeeding (OF)&#xD;
      and fasting (F) in Pima Indian men has shown that persons with the greatest increase in EE&#xD;
      with OF and the smallest decrease in EE with F gained the least weight over time, indicating&#xD;
      that the ability to waste more calories when overfed may reduce weight gain. Other studies,&#xD;
      however, have not shown this relationship. In addition, it has been proposed that unbalanced&#xD;
      diets can help magnify these effects. The aims of this study are to test whether (a) the&#xD;
      changes in EE in response to 24-h OF and F predict changes in weight over two years, and (b)&#xD;
      high-carbohydrate diets or diets with high or low protein amounts may magnify the metabolic&#xD;
      response to 24-h OF compared to normal protein and high-fat diets. 64 volunteers will be&#xD;
      evaluated at baseline, 6 months and on a yearly basis for up to 7 years. At baseline,&#xD;
      subjects will undergo 8 24-h sessions in a human respiratory chamber to measure EE while on a&#xD;
      weight-maintaining diet, and then in random order: fasting, 200% OF on a normal-protein diet,&#xD;
      200% OF on a high fat, low-protein diet, 200% OF on a high-fat, normal-protein diet, 200% OF&#xD;
      on a high fat, high protein diet, and 200% OF on a high-carbohydrate, normal-protein diet.&#xD;
      Fifteen volunteers will have two additional chambers to try and understand if the source of&#xD;
      carbohydrates, i.e. simple sugars versus complex carbohydrates, in a high carbohydrate diet&#xD;
      affect metabolism. Thirty volunteers are planned to also undergo 2 positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) studies to look at the relationship of brown fat with EE in adult humans.&#xD;
      (As of April 2021, we will stop performing the PET scans; 24 volunteers have completed them&#xD;
      and we have acquired sufficient data.) Body weight and composition will be measured at each&#xD;
      subsequent admission. Hormonal measurements to find determinants of adaptive changes in EE in&#xD;
      response to OF and F will also be performed. This study will provide significant insights&#xD;
      into possible mechanisms that may help people resist weight gain and obesity.&#xD;

          -  Age: 18-55 years, to exclude effects of aging on energy expenditure and weight change.&#xD;
             For the PET-CT substudy, women will be limited to ages 18-40 years because there is a&#xD;
             high likelihood that for women greater than 40 years, their personal physician may&#xD;
             recommend an annual routine mammogram, thereby increasing their annual radiation&#xD;
             exposure. Men will also be limited to this age range to prevent age discrepancies&#xD;
             between men and women for this substudy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Premenopausal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight: less than or equal to 450 lb (maximum weight allowed on the DXA scanning&#xD;

             pressure measurement, using an appropriate cuff, higher than 140/90 mmHg on two or&#xD;
             more occasions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver disease, including cirrhosis, active hepatitis B or C, and AST or ALT greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 3 times normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal disease, as defined by serum creatinine concentrations greater than or equal 1.5&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Infectious disease such as active tuberculosis, HIV (by self-report), chronic&#xD;
             coccidiomycoses or other chronic infections that might influence weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Conditions not specifically mentioned above may serve as criteria for exclusion at the&#xD;
             discretion of the investigators&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alcohol and/or drug abuse (more than 3 drinks per day and use of drugs, such as&#xD;
