      The investigators will study 2 doses of etoricoxib to prove that 60 mg once daily will be&#xD;
      non-inferior to etoricoxib 90mg daily (for 14 days) in the treatment of acute ankle sprain in&#xD;
      sports. The investigators objective is to discuss the point that the investigators will&#xD;
      follow the minimal dose that is effective for the treatment of this acute condition in&#xD;
      orthopedic.&#xD;

      Study Objectives Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy of those 2 treatment doses in patients with acute ankle sprain&#xD;
           in sports Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the overall safety and tolerability of etoricoxib 60 mg and 90mg in patients&#xD;
           with acute ankle sprain in sports&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The efficacy of etoricoxib 60 mg once daily will be non-inferior to etoricoxib 90mg&#xD;
           daily for 14 days in the treatment of acute ankle sprain in sports.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 60 mg dose of etoricoxib will have similarity in reducing the pain and will be more&#xD;
           effective in decreasing the degree of edema, with most patients experiencing remission,&#xD;
           which allows resumption of regular sporting activities after the end of the entire&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both doses will be generally well tolerated and gastrointestinal intolerance will not be&#xD;
           seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance of the Selected Topic Etoricoxib is a cyclo-oxygenase&#xD;
      (COX)-2-selective NSAID with a higher COX-1 to COX-2 selectivity ratio than the other&#xD;
      COX-2-selective NSAIDs rofecoxib, valdecoxib or celecoxib. In patients with rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis, improvements in tender and swollen joint counts and patient and investigator&#xD;
      global assessment of disease activity were significantly greater in etoricoxib than in&#xD;
      placebo recipients in two studies. Etoricoxib was also significantly more effective than&#xD;
      naproxen in one of these studies. In patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee,&#xD;
      etoricoxib was significantly more effective than placebo and had similar efficacy to naproxen&#xD;
      with regards to improvements in pain and physical function scores and patient global&#xD;
      assessment of disease status scores in two studies. Etoricoxib had similar efficacy to&#xD;
      diclofenac in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Single-dose etoricoxib relieved pain&#xD;
      in patients with postoperative dental pain in two studies. Similar scores assessing total&#xD;
      pain relief over 8 hours (TOPAR8) were reported in etoricoxib and naproxen sodium or&#xD;
      ibuprofen recipients, and higher TOPAR8 scores were reported with etoricoxib than with&#xD;
      paracetamol (acetaminophen)/codeine. Pain relief was significantly better with etoricoxib&#xD;
      than placebo in two studies in patients with chronic low back pain. Etoricoxib had similar&#xD;
      efficacy to indomethacin in a study in patients with acute gout, and single-dose etoricoxib&#xD;
      had similar efficacy to naproxen sodium in a study in women with primary dysmenorrhoea.&#xD;
      Compared with non-COX-selective NSAIDs, etoricoxib was associated with significantly fewer&#xD;
      upper gastrointestinal (GI) perforations, ulcers or bleeds, and was significantly less likely&#xD;
      to result in treatment discontinuation because of NSAID-type GI symptoms or any GI symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a significant number of studies showing efficacy and superior GI tolerability&#xD;
      profile of etoricoxib in chronic pathologies as mentioned above. However among acute pain&#xD;
      pathologies there are a number of specific diagnosis that may be better explored. A very&#xD;
      common diagnosis that causes acute pain are traumatic sport-related lesions of soft tissues&#xD;
      (sprains, tendinitis, bursitis). One of the most common diagnosis is the acute ankle sprain,&#xD;
      and many patients after an acute injury use the medication to control the pain and decrease&#xD;
      the amount of edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etoricoxib has been approved for acute pain in the dosage of 90 mg and it has been routinely&#xD;
      prescribed for soft tissues inflammatory conditions, as acute gout. Otherway, we have some&#xD;
      clinical cases that can lead to a longer period of pain, usually up to 2 weeks. As we know,&#xD;
      when we have to use the medication for more than one week we have to decrease the dosage, and&#xD;
      in some cases if you use a high dose it can lead to a persistent edema in the ankle joint.&#xD;
      Therefore a study comparing etoricoxib 90 mg versus 60 mg in acute ankle sprain sport-related&#xD;
      lesion is justified. As we know today, our efforts have to focus on usign the smallest dose&#xD;
      to reach the best clinical results of a specific medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Type This will be a pilot study, randomized, single center, double-blind,&#xD;
           parallel-group study to compare the efficacy and tolerability of etoricoxib 90 mg versus&#xD;
           60 mg in patients with acute ankle sprain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample Size The study will include 50 patients. One primary investigator (Rogerio&#xD;
           Teixeira da Silva, MD, PhD) will coordinate the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Medication and Flowchart&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 50 patients will be recruited to a randomized double-blind 14 days treatment study&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and the tolerability of oral etoricoxib 90mg daily in comparison&#xD;
      with etoricoxib 60 mg/day in a 1:1 proportion.&#xD;

      Phone Contact / Day 45 After 4 weeks of completion of treatment, there will be a phone&#xD;
      contact to assess resumption of regular sporting activities and adverse experiences in this&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Measures / endpoints of interest Primary • The main efficacy criterion will be the&#xD;
      reduction of pain during active mobilization measured using a visual analogue scale VAS at&#xD;
      day 8,. We will measure the normal movements of the joints (flexion and extension, abduction&#xD;
      and adduction, external and internal rotation). Also we will evaluate the volumetric&#xD;
      measurement of the ankle and foot, at day 1 and day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary efficacy criteria will be pain during motion against resistance,&#xD;
           functional impairment and global assessment of efficacy by either patient and&#xD;
           investigator, measured at Day 15. It will be measures by the VAS and also using the&#xD;
           volumetric measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tolerability will be assessed by the frequency of adverse experiences and global&#xD;
           assessment of efficacy by either patient and investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics In this study we will include a total of 50 patients presenting acute ankle sprain&#xD;
      occurred in sport, treat them with either oral etoricoxib (120 mg/day or 60 mg/day) for 14&#xD;
      days, under double-blind conditions, and verify efficacy and safety post-treatment&#xD;
      accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain evaluation will be performed through a visual analog scale (VAS), ranging from 0 until&#xD;
      10, and median differences of one point in the VAS will be considered as significant. Based&#xD;
      upon works using such scale, it was verified that the standard deviation within VAS is, in&#xD;
      average, of 1.2 point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to methodology presented by Fisher &amp; Belle (1993), the following table presents the&#xD;
      sample estimation for different significances and study power:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidence Power Number necessary per group (ni) for 1-point difference in VAS&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1 - α) (1 - β) 0.95 0.95 37 0.95 0.90 30 0.95 0.80 23 0.90 0.95 31 0.90 0.90 25 0.90 0.80 18&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the number of patients for each study group would be 25 patients, with a&#xD;
      confidence interval of 95% and study power of 90%. Considering the study as a pilot, we&#xD;
      believe that this power is good. After this study, we can do another one to at least 74&#xD;
      patients to prove the more power of if.&#xD;
