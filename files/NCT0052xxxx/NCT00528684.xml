      RATIONALE: Oncolytic viruses such as reovirus (REOLYSIN®) can specifically kill tumor cells&#xD;
      while leaving healthy cells unharmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II study investigates the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) and anti-tumor effect of intralesional administration of REOLYSIN® therapeutic&#xD;
      reovirus in patients with malignant glioma with evaluable disease which is&#xD;
      progressive/recurrent despite surgery and/or radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. (The&#xD;
      phase I portion of the study is currently enrolling patients.)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oncolytic viruses, such as reovirus, are those viruses which specifically destroy cancer&#xD;
      cells. Reovirus is a common virus that does not cause disease, and has been shown to be&#xD;
      associated with only minor flu-like symptoms. REOLYSIN® is a formulation of the live,&#xD;
      replication-competent wild-type reovirus that selectively replicates in tumor cells, while&#xD;
      leaving healthy cells unharmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase I/II multi-center study follows a standard design utilizing therapeutic viral&#xD;
      dosage escalation. The phase I portion of the trial will evaluate the doses of intralesional&#xD;
      REOLYSIN titrated to a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The objective of the phase II portion of&#xD;
      the study is to assess tumor response. The proportion of patients surviving to six months and&#xD;
      the safety of REOLYSIN® are secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient enrolled in the study will receive a single infusion of REOLYSIN® over 72 hours.&#xD;
      Patients will remain in hospital for at least 90 hours after initiation of infusion.&#xD;
      Following REOLYSIN® administration, each patient will be followed for at least 12 weeks&#xD;
      (Phase I) and at least 6 months (Phase II) with regular evaluation visits (weekly and then&#xD;
      monthly). Evaluations will include tumor measurements, serial neurologic exams and functional&#xD;
      performance status assessments at baseline, prior to hospital discharge, and at weeks 4, 8,&#xD;
      12, 16 and 24 after REOLYSIN® therapy. Changes in performance will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Karnofsky Performance Status scale. Subjects will also undergo serial blood sampling for&#xD;
      evaluation of viral RNA, hematology and biochemistry.&#xD;
