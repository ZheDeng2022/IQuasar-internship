      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the objective (polysomnographic) changes in sleep quality before and after&#xD;
      introduction of olanzapine in treatment of patients with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the subjective changes in sleep quality parameters before and at different stages&#xD;
      after introduction of olanzapine in treatment, longitudinally, and to correlate these changes&#xD;
      with measures of illness severity and changes in cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, double blind, randomized polysomnographic (PSG) study of patients before and&#xD;
      after treatment with olanzapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSG recordings will be done three times throughout the study: before starting olanzapine&#xD;
      augmentation (baseline), at day 3 to 5 (acute) and day 28 to 31 (chronic). PSG will be&#xD;
      completed at patients' homes with a portable PSG. Psychiatric scales, subjective sleep&#xD;
      quality scales, and cognition measurements will be completed at each visit.&#xD;
