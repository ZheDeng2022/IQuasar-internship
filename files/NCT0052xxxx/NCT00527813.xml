      We project to test the effect of prone position on mortality in severe ARDS patients&#xD;
      (PaO2/FiO2&lt;150 with FiO2 &gt; or = 0.6 and positive end-expiratory pressure &gt; or = 5 cmH2O).&#xD;
      Ventilator will be set in accordance with current standards aiming at protecting the lungs&#xD;
      from VALI. Patients will be randomized into two arms: prone group in which proning will be&#xD;
      realized for at least 16 hours a day and supine group in which patients will stay in a&#xD;
      semi-recumbent position. Primary end-point is 28-day mortality of all causes. Secondary&#xD;
      end-points are 90-day mortality of all causes and incidence of ventilator-acquired pneumonia.&#xD;
      Study sample was calculated to detect ability of proning to reduce mortality from 60 to 45%&#xD;
      percent, at one-tailed alpha error of 5% and power of 90% and 230 patients are needed in each&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;

      The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute respiratory failure characterized&#xD;
      by bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on frontal chest radiography, arterial oxygen tension&#xD;
      (Pao2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio of 200 or less, and absence of evidence&#xD;
      for left atrial hypertension. In-hospital mortality remains high: from 40 to 60%. Typical&#xD;
      pathological findings include disruption of the alveolar epithelium, diffuse alveolar damage,&#xD;
      hyaline membranes and pulmonary inflammation. Gas exchange is severely altered making of&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation required in most of the cases. Mechanical ventilation should&#xD;
      be judiciously set in order to protect the lung from ventilator- associated lung injury&#xD;
      (VALI). VALI is commonly seen as the expression of two main alveolar strains. The well&#xD;
      documented one to date is over distension of alveoli when high tidal volumes are used. A&#xD;
      North-American randomized controlled trial (RCT) has demonstrated that using low tidal&#xD;
      volumes (6 ml per kilo of predicted weight) results in a 22% decrease in mortality when&#xD;
      compared with high tidal volumes (12 ml per kilo of predicted weight). As suggested by an&#xD;
      ancillary study of this trial, a reduced pulmonary inflammation is one of the contributing&#xD;
      factors of this result. Therefore, minimizing VALI is a primary therapeutic goal. Low lung&#xD;
      volume VALI is the second potential mechanism, though less well documented. It is expected to&#xD;
      result from repetitive collapse and reopening of terminal respiratory units. Experimental&#xD;
      data suggest that proning can reduce VALI by homogenizing lung strains. In ARDS patients,&#xD;
      proning is mainly used due to its ability to improve gas exchange in 60 to 70% of patients.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, 3 RCTs failed to demonstrate a significant effect on mortality of proning in&#xD;
      three clinical situations: 1: acute lung injury, 2: hypoxemic acute respiratory failure, 3:&#xD;
      ARDS. Post hoc analysis of one of them has suggested an effect of proning on mortality for&#xD;
      the most hypoxemic sub-group. Studies limitations can explain lack of statistical&#xD;
      significance as lack of power, heterogeneity of patients, insufficient duration of proning,&#xD;
      high tidal volumes. Only one RCT was specifically designed for ARDS. Mortality was 25% lowest&#xD;
      in the prone position arm, but this difference was not significant due to lack of power. So,&#xD;
      the capability of proning to improve patient survival in ARDS is still an open question.&#xD;
