  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TRU-015 in treatment of B-cell&#xD;
      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRU-015 is also currently being evaluated in multiple clinical studies for the treatment of&#xD;
      autoimmune disorders. Over 300 patients have received TRU-015 in these studies, and the data&#xD;
      observed to date support its safety in patients with autoimmune disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of an escalating dose of 4 weekly infusions of TRU-015 will be evaluated in subjects&#xD;
      with relapsed NHL (see inclusion criteria for subtypes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is confirmed or maximum dose to be studied is determined&#xD;
      to be safe and well tolerated, an expanded cohort of subjects with relapsed follicular NHL&#xD;
      will be evaluated for efficacy.&#xD;

        Main Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with CD20-positive, B cell NHL who, after at least 2 prior therapies of&#xD;
             probable clinical benefit, have relapsed or refractory disease. The following&#xD;
             histologies may be included*: lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (formerly known as&#xD;
             lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma), splenic marginal zone B cell lymphoma, extranodal&#xD;
             marginal zone B cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, nodal marginal&#xD;
             zone B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large-cell B&#xD;
             cell lymphoma, and mediastinal large B cell lymphoma. Small lymphocytic lymphoma will&#xD;
             be included if it is a primary diagnosis and if the lymphoma cells are &lt; 5.0 x 109/L&#xD;
             (5000/mm3) in the peripheral blood. *Subjects enrolled in the preliminary efficacy&#xD;
             cohorts must have relapsed, refractory, or persistent follicular lymphoma (persistent&#xD;
             disease defined as computed tomography (CT) positive for 3 months after last&#xD;
             treatment), and must not have received anti-CD20 targeted therapy within 3 months of&#xD;
             receiving the first dose of test article. Subjects may be considered eligible after a&#xD;
             single therapy of probable clinical benefit, if no further standard effective&#xD;
             treatment is available in the opinion of the investigator. Prior CD20&#xD;
             immunophenotyping of tumors to document B cell NHL is acceptable. If such prior&#xD;
             documentation is not available, then the immunophenotype of the current disease must&#xD;
             be documented by fine-needle aspirate or biopsy, or by circulating CD20-positive NHL&#xD;
             cells from peripheral blood before administration of test article.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 1 measurable lesion that is 1.5 cm in at least 1 dimension by CT or magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI), in an area of no prior radiation therapy, or documented&#xD;
             progression in an area that was previously irradiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recovery to baseline or grade 1 [according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI)&#xD;
             Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0] from all acute&#xD;
             adverse effects of prior therapies (excluding alopecia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Main Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidate for potentially curative therapy that is available to the subject, in the&#xD;
             clinical opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Burkitt's lymphoma, primary effusion&#xD;
             lymphoma, and/or precursor B cell lymphoblastic lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatments: radioimmunotherapy; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant&#xD;
             (within 6 months of first dose of study drug); chemotherapy, cancer immunosuppressive&#xD;
             therapy, growth factors (except erythropoietin), or investigational agents (within 4&#xD;
             weeks of first dose of study drug); major surgery not related to debulking surgical&#xD;
             procedures (within 3 weeks of first dose of study drug).&#xD;
