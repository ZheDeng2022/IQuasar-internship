    <textblock>
      Patients with peripheral neuropathy frequently exhibit treatment-refractory neuropathic pain.&#xD;
      Although both peripheral and central determinants are recognized for the pathophysiological&#xD;
      basis of neuropathic pain following peripheral injury, the modulating effect on pain&#xD;
      processing in brain by peripheral mechanisms remains elusive. Here, we will systematically&#xD;
      compare the sensory symptoms and brain activation to painful heat stimulation applied to the&#xD;
      foot dorsum between patients with peripheral neuropathy and healthy controls. Functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging will be used to define brain activation to thermal stimulation&#xD;
      with noxious heat and innocuous warm thermal stimuli applied by contact heat stimulator.&#xD;
      Brain activation during thermal stimulation in patients with neuropathic pain will be&#xD;
      clarified, and we will also analyze the potential relationships between the topography,&#xD;
      quality and intensity of the different painful symptoms and the magnitude and pattern of&#xD;
      brain activation during thermal stimulation. This will add in our understanding in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of brain modulation in pain and provide clinically useful message toward the&#xD;
      potential therapeutics in the management of neuropathic pain.&#xD;

      Patients with peripheral neuropathy and healthy volunteers will be recruited in this study.&#xD;
      Peripheral neuropathy is defined according to the neuropathic symptoms and signs. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be approved by the Ethical Committee of the National Taiwan University Hospital&#xD;
      and obtained from each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the severity of different neuropathic symptoms, such as spontaneous ongoing and&#xD;
      paroxysmal pain, evoked pain, paraesthesia, and dysaesthesia, patients with neuropathic pain&#xD;
      will fill out the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory. Each subject will receive detailed&#xD;
      sensory examination to evaluate the integrity of sensory fibers. To measure thresholds of&#xD;
      thermal and vibratory sensations, we will perform quantitative sensory testing by the method&#xD;
      of level using a Thermal Sensory Analyser and Vibratory Sensory Analyser (Medoc Advanced&#xD;
      Medical System, Minneapolis, MN, USA) following an established protocol. We will use a&#xD;
      contact heat stimulator to deliver thermal stimulation. Noxious and innocuous heat&#xD;
      temperatures will be applied within the right foot dorsum. Several pretests will be applied&#xD;
      before CHEP recording to eliminate expectation effects. To avoid sensitization and&#xD;
      desensitization, low intensity stimuli will precede high intensity stimuli at each block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be performed on a 3-T MR machine (Sonata;&#xD;
      Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). A high resolution T1 weighted scan of the entire brain in&#xD;
      trans-axial orientation will be obtained to provide anatomical information for the&#xD;
      superimposed functional activation maps. Echo Planar Imaging will be used for the acquisition&#xD;
      of the functional data. Each imaging session will be consisted of one high-resolution&#xD;
      anatomical scan and three functional scanning runs, with 5-min intersession interval. During&#xD;
      the scanning, several thermal stimuli will be applied by CHEP stimulator to the right dorsal&#xD;
      foot. To avoid sensitization, the stimulation site will be changed slightly after each&#xD;
      stimulus. After 12-s stimulation, the temperature will be cooling, with a subsequent 36-s&#xD;
      interstimulus interval. After each fMRI session, subjects will be asked to rate the intensity&#xD;
      and unpleasantness of received pain stimulus. The average rating values will be indicated&#xD;
      after the scan on a computer driven visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 10 (0, no pain;&#xD;
      1, slight intense; 2, mild intense; 3, moderate intense; 4, slight pain; 5, mild pain; 6,&#xD;
      moderate pain; 7, moderate-strong pain; 8, strong pain; 9, severe pain; 10, unbearable pain),&#xD;
      and the intensity and unpleasantness of received pain will be assessed using the Short-Form&#xD;
      McGill Pain Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be processed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM2). fMRI&#xD;
      data series will be realigned and resliced with sinc interpolation to correct for motion&#xD;
      artifacts. Scans with sudden head movements of more than 2 mm will be omitted. To enable&#xD;
      intersubject analysis, the functional data will be coregistered to the anatomical scan and&#xD;
      transformed into a reference space according to the MNI template of SPM2 by normalization&#xD;
      using sinc interpolation. The resampled voxel volume of the normalized images is 2 x 2 x 2&#xD;
      mm. Subsequently, data will be smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full-width&#xD;
      at half maximum to reduce high frequency noise and to account for anatomical variances.&#xD;
      Condition-specific effects will be estimated with the general linear model using a boxcar&#xD;
      approach convolved with the hemodynamic response function. High pass filtering will remove&#xD;
      low frequency noise and low pass filtering will account for serial autocorrelations of the&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will analyze the data on an individual (subject per subject) basis and across subjects&#xD;
      (group analysis) using a cross-subjects variance (random effect analysis). Data from each&#xD;
      stimulation will be pooled for group statistical comparisons. A single design matrix,&#xD;
      including 3 sessions of all subjects, will be generated due to the limited number of&#xD;
      experiments representing a fixed-effects model analysis. Statistical parametric maps will be&#xD;
      generated as t-contrasts and corrected for multiple comparisons according to the random field&#xD;
      theory with P &lt; 0.05. The threshold for the Z maps is 3.09 (P &lt; 0.001) for individual subject&#xD;
      analysis. Significant clusters have to show a minimum extension volume of 10 voxels.&#xD;
