      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using Seraffix LTB&#xD;
      system for excisional biopsy wounds closure&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excisional biopsy of the skin is a biopsy in which an entire lesion is removed. An excisional&#xD;
      biopsy is in contrast to an incisional biopsy in which only a sample of tissue is cut into&#xD;
      and removed. It is most frequently done to diagnose a skin growth such as a mole, or cancer&#xD;
      of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common method of wound closure of skin excisions is interrupted nonabsorbable&#xD;
      sutures. The sutures should be removed as soon as adequate intrinsic bonding strength is&#xD;
      sufficient, depending mostly on the specific body region (from 5-7 days for the face and up&#xD;
      to 12-14 days for trunk and extremities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser energy, also known as laser welding, has been used on limited basis as an alternative&#xD;
      to traditional wound closure method. There have been two fundamental approaches to laser&#xD;
      assisted bonding of tissues:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Laser welding-heating the approximated edges of cuts in tissues by a laser beam;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Laser soldering- applying a biological solder onto the approximated edges and heating&#xD;
           the solder (and the underlying tissue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seraffix has developed the Seraffix LTB (Laser Tissue Bonding) System - a laser system for&#xD;
      soft tissue bonding. This innovative system includes features that make laser soldering&#xD;
      suitable for clinical use. The Seraffix system is composed of CO2 laser device, propriety&#xD;
      grip device (Clamps) and soldering agent (Human Albumin).&#xD;
