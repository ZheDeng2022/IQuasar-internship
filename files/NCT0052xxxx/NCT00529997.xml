  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess whether the Stabilimax NZ® is at least as safe and&#xD;
      effective as the control therapy of fusion in patients receiving decompression surgery for&#xD;
      the treatment of clinically symptomatic spinal stenosis at one contiguous vertebral levels&#xD;
      from L1-S1. Safety and effectiveness will be assessed by means of primary study endpoints&#xD;
      which address improvements in pain and function in the absence of major device related&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis criteria for demonstrating safety and efficacy requires scientific&#xD;
      evidence that patients classified as satisfying the primary study endpoint post device&#xD;
      implantation is at least as good for Stabilimax NZ® recipients as that for patients&#xD;
      undergoing fusion with posterior pedicle screw instrumentation at the 24 month followup&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative spine disease is a normal part of the aging process. This degeneration can&#xD;
      sometimes cause significant pain and limit normal movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain can be from many sources. For patients being enrolled into this study the pain has&#xD;
      been diagnosed to be primarily as a result of a condition called spinal stenosis. The current&#xD;
      standard of care for the treatment of moderate to severe spinal stenosis is a surgical&#xD;
      procedure that relieves the pressure on the spinal cord and nerves is called decompression&#xD;
      surgery. The surgeon removes the tissue and bone that are causing the narrowing thus&#xD;
      relieving the pinching of the spinal cord and nerve roots. After surgery, the patient may&#xD;
      have a spine that is too unstable. In other words the muscles and ligaments around the spine&#xD;
      have to work too hard to maintain normal posture and to control movement. For many years&#xD;
      those patients with unstable backs have received fusion therapy. Fusion is the development of&#xD;
      bone between the vertebra to stabilize the spine and prevent motion. This is done by&#xD;
      inserting a bone graft around the vertebra being treated and placing a rigid brace called a&#xD;
      fusion device to prevent movement. Eventually bone will form between the vertebra and the&#xD;
      spine will become &quot;fused&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will be conducting research to evaluate a new, investigative medical device&#xD;
      that is designed to brace and support the spine just like fusion but without fusing in the&#xD;
      patient's spine. Devices that do this are called &quot;motion preserving&quot; or &quot;dynamic stabilizing&quot;&#xD;
      spinal devices. The investigational device that is being evaluated in this study is called&#xD;
      the Stabilimax NZ® Dynamic Spinal Stabilization System. The Stabilimax NZ® is inserted and&#xD;
      fixed to the vertebra by means of pedicle screws in exactly the same way a fusion device is&#xD;
      inserted and attached. The only difference is that for the Stabilimax NZ® no bone graft will&#xD;
      be placed around or between the vertebra to promote bone growth for fusion. Patients in the&#xD;
      study will receive either the Stabilimax NZ® or will receive a fusion procedure. The study is&#xD;
      a randomized controlled clinical trial using a 2:1 investigational:control randomization&#xD;
      scheme. The study will enroll 480 patients at approximately 20 investigational sites across&#xD;
      the United States.&#xD;
