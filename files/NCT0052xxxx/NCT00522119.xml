  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure affects nearly one third of all individuals in the United States. It is&#xD;
      believed that genetic factors may predispose some people to develop this disease. This study&#xD;
      will identify and characterize variations in three genes known to play a part in the&#xD;
      development of high blood pressure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure is one of the most common health problems in this country. It can be&#xD;
      caused by many factors, including stress, diet, diabetes, kidney disease, or obesity. In many&#xD;
      people, there is no identifiable cause for their high blood pressure. If high blood pressure&#xD;
      goes untreated, it can lead to heart failure, kidney failure, or stroke. Previous studies&#xD;
      have shown that variations in three genes in chromosome 1-ATP1B1, RGS5, and SELE-cause some&#xD;
      people to be more susceptible to developing high blood pressure. All three of these genes are&#xD;
      involved in the development of proteins that play a role in regulating blood pressure, but it&#xD;
      is not known exactly how variations in these genes affect blood pressure levels. This study&#xD;
      will examine previously collected genetic samples from participants in two studies, the&#xD;
      GenNet study and the Heredity and Phenotype Interaction (HAPI) Heart study. Study researchers&#xD;
      will analyze the samples to identify and characterize variations in the ATP1B1, RGS5, and&#xD;
      SELE genes. Results from this study may lead to more effective diagnostic and treatment&#xD;
      options for people with high blood pressure.&#xD;

      For each subject, blood and urine samples were collected at various time points during for&#xD;
      interventions designed to study cardiovascular biology, including (1) a high-fat challenge,&#xD;
      after which we measured the post-prandial excursion in triglycerides; (2) a cold pressor&#xD;
      stress test (CPT), for which we measured changes in blood pressure and endothelial function;&#xD;
      (3) a dietary salt intervention, involving 6-day ingestion of a high-salt diet, followed by&#xD;
      6-day ingestion of a low-salt diet, during which we measured changes in blood pressure; and&#xD;
      (4) 14 days of low-dose aspirin therapy, during which we measured changes in platelet&#xD;
      function. The exact protocol is published in the American Heart Journal, Volume 155, Issue 5,&#xD;
      May 2008, pages 823-828.&#xD;
