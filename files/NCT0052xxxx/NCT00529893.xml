      The purpose of this study is examine the efficacy of atomoxetine on executive functioning&#xD;
      measures including the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and the executive function measures&#xD;
      of the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale of this proposal is based upon the high prevalence (7.5% in Taiwan (Gau et al.,&#xD;
      2004b)), the magnitude of the short- and long-term impact on individuals, family, and&#xD;
      society, the responsibility of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD to treatments&#xD;
      with CNS stimulants and Atomoxetine. Although numerous studies have shown that&#xD;
      methylphenidate demonstrates significant effect on improving neuropsychological functioning&#xD;
      including inhibition of executive function (e.g., Aron et al., 2003; Kempton et al., 1999;&#xD;
      Konrad et al., 2004) and motor control measures (e.g., Moll et al., 2000), there has been no&#xD;
      study examining the effect of Atomoxetine on the improvement of response inhibition or other&#xD;
      neuropsychological functioning among children with ADHD. As several clinical trials have&#xD;
      shown the efficacy of Atomoxetine in improving the core symptoms of ADHD (e.g., Eiland and&#xD;
      Guest, 2004; Michelson et al., 2002) and Atomoxetine has been approved by FDA as first line&#xD;
      medication for child and adult ADHD in 2002, we anticipate that Atomoxetine will demonstrate&#xD;
      significant efficacy on treating ADHD by improvement of neuropsychological measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the efficacy of atomoxetine on executive functioning measures including the&#xD;
           Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and the executive function measures of the Cambridge&#xD;
           Automated Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the efficacy of atomoxetine on other neuropsychological measures including&#xD;
           the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), and the attention, memory, and paired learning&#xD;
           tests of the CANTAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To validate the ADHD using psychopathological, neuropsychological, functional brain&#xD;
           imaging, behavioral, and social correlates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open label, non randomized, clinical trial with daily dose of atomoxetine&#xD;
      1.2 mg/kg for subjects with ADHD. Thirty drug-na√Øve children with DSM-IV ADHD and 30 normal&#xD;
      children matched in sex, age, and IQ will be recruited. All of the participants will be&#xD;
      assessed by the CPT, WSCT, CANTAB, and several measures covering domains of ADHD symptoms and&#xD;
      social functioning. Subjects with ADHD will be reassessed using the neuropsychological tests&#xD;
      and other measures on Week 4 (Visit 2) 3 days, Week 12 (Visit 2) 3 days of treatment with&#xD;
      atomoxetine 1.2 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will consist of 30 subjects with ADHD, aged 10 to 15, and 30 subjects without&#xD;
      ADHD, who are matched in age, sex, and IQ as cases. We anticipate that this study will&#xD;
      provide enough evidence to support the efficacy of Atomoxetine not only on the symptoms&#xD;
      improvement but also neuropsychological measures and fMRI studies among children with ADHD.&#xD;

    <measure>The Efficacy of Once-Daily Atomoxetine Hydrochloride on Executive Function in Taiwanese Children with Attention-deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with ADHD performed worse in the backward digit span task, CPT, IED and RVIP than the controls. Their significant improvement in executive function after treatment with atomoxetine for 4 weeks included fewer omission and commission errors, fewer hit reaction time standard errors, and less variability in the CPT; fewer total errors and trials in the IED; higher probability of hits, total correction rejection, and total hits, fewer total misses, and shorter latency in the RVIP; longer span length and fewer total usage errors in the SSP; fewer errors and strategy utilization in the SWM; and more problems solved, fewer mean moves, and shorter subsequent thinking time in the SOC. Atomoxetine significantly reduced ADHD-related symptoms over time.</description>
