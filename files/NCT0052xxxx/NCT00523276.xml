  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)&#xD;
      spreads within families, if significant disease resulted, and how the body responds to SARS.&#xD;
      The study will also explore the affects of SARS on genetics and the immune system (the body&#xD;
      system that fights disease). Up to 1000 people residing in Beijing, China may be involved in&#xD;
      this study. Adult survivors of SARS (numbering 200) and their family members including&#xD;
      children age 4 and up will be asked to participate in the study. The study will recruit an&#xD;
      additional 200 persons, who will be matched with SARs survivors of similar age, gender,&#xD;
      health status, and housing/work location, and recruited as comparators. Blood will be taken&#xD;
      from all volunteers and tested for the presence of SARS antibodies (proteins made by the&#xD;
      body's immune system in response to something that can cause infection). Health and&#xD;
      clinic/hospital visit records may be reviewed.&#xD;

      This study will investigate immune responses, transmission and nucleotide polymorphisms in&#xD;
      families with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus infections. Study objectives are&#xD;
      to: develop an immune response profile to SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) among SARS survivors;&#xD;
      ascertain whether there was spread of SARS CoV within the family and whether significant&#xD;
      disease resulted; and determine whether 1 or more nucleotide polymorphisms relate to&#xD;
      occurrence and severity of SARS CoV disease or immunologic responses. Up to 1,000 persons&#xD;
      residing in Beijing, China, will participate in this study and will include the following&#xD;
      groups: 200 adult (greater than or equal to18 years of age) subjects, previously experiencing&#xD;
      SARS caused by SARS Coronavirus; their household/family members, including children ages 4&#xD;
      and up (male or female); and an additional 200 adults matched for characteristics (age,&#xD;
      gender, health status and housing/work location) of the 200 SARS survivors. As much as&#xD;
      possible (for DNA tests), these controls will be persons involved in health care with a&#xD;
      possible SARS exposure during the epidemic. Blood will be obtained from all subjects and used&#xD;
      for SARS CoV antibody assays. Additional studies will be performed with blood specimens from&#xD;
      selected subjects. Tests for serum antibodies will be used to identify infected persons in&#xD;
      each family. For any who possess specific antibodies, a review of their health and&#xD;
      clinic/hospital visit records for the SARS epidemic period will be conducted to identify any&#xD;
      illness, its type and severity. A control for interpretation can be illnesses during the&#xD;
      study period in uninfected family members. Data will be analyzed by age, gender, and health&#xD;
      status of family members, the severity of SARS illness in the index case and the time of&#xD;
      return to the home environment. The illness data will be obtained from medical records and&#xD;
      not from subject memory. To assess health status, subjects for this study will have a chest&#xD;
      x-ray performed and 15 mL of blood obtained for complete blood counts, liver function, to&#xD;
      include ALT, and creatinine. For study purposes, 30 to 100 mL of blood will be collected from&#xD;
      SARS survivors and from 50 matched controls (age, gender and health status). Illnesses from&#xD;
      medical records will be characterized for severity and will include extent of x-ray changes,&#xD;
      need for oxygen therapy, medical care in the intensive care unit and extent of leukocyte&#xD;
      changes. Microarray chips that contain human genes determining immune responses, production&#xD;
      of cytokines and chemokines and a number of other potential responses to illness have been&#xD;
      constructed. PureGene kits will be provided for isolation of DNA from blood specimens for&#xD;
      testing for polymorphisms. These analyses will be performed on the 200 SARS survivors, the&#xD;
      200 matched controls and on family members. The DNA samples will be shipped to laboratories&#xD;
      at Baylor College of Medicine for analysis using the microarray chips.&#xD;
