  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      carisbamate treatment for the signs, symptoms, and impairment associated with Essential&#xD;
      Tremor (ET) compared to placebo treatment. The secondary objective is to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of carisbamate treatment on indicators of affect and mood in patients who have ET compared to&#xD;
      placebo treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is that carisbamate will be effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      Essential Tremor compared to placebo as measured by the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale&#xD;
      (TRS). This randomized (study medication assigned by chance) study has 3 Phases:&#xD;
      Screening/Washout, Double Blind Treatment (the physician and patient do not know the name of&#xD;
      the study medication), and Exit. The Double Blind Treatment Phase has 2 Treatment Periods.&#xD;
      Since this is a cross-over study, all subjects who complete the full Double Blind Treatment&#xD;
      Phase will have the opportunity to take carisbamate. Carisbamate is administered as 100 mg&#xD;
      oral tablets. During Treatment Period 1, patients will take 2 tablets of their assigned study&#xD;
      medication (either carisbamate or placebo) two times a day for 21 days. Patients will return&#xD;
      for clinical evaluations approximately 1 week after starting the study medication and at the&#xD;
      end of Treatment Period 1. Patients will then reduce their dose of study medication to 1&#xD;
      tablet twice a day for 3 days prior to stopping all study medication for at least 11 days.&#xD;
      Before entering Treatment Period 2, patients will return for a clinical evaluation. During&#xD;
      Treatment Period 2, patients will take 2 tablets of their assigned study medication two times&#xD;
      a day for 21 days. Patients will return for clinical evaluations approximately 1 week after&#xD;
      starting the second study medication and at the end of Treatment Period 2. Patients will then&#xD;
      reduce their study medication to 1 tablet twice a day for 3 days before stopping all study&#xD;
      medication. Patients will return for a clinical evaluation approximately 1 week after&#xD;
      stopping all study medication and will be contacted by telephone approximately 30 days after&#xD;
      the last dose of study medication. Safety will be assessed during each study visit by&#xD;
      monitoring adverse events, clinical laboratory testing, physical and neurological&#xD;
      examinations and electrocardiograms. Patients will take 2 carisbamate 100mg tablets 2 times a&#xD;
      day (400 mg/day) for 21 days during one Treatment Period and 2 matching placebo tablets 2&#xD;
      times a day for 21 days during the other Treatment Period. Patients will reduce the dose of&#xD;
      study medication for 3 days at the end of each Treatment Period. There will be times during&#xD;
      the study when no study medication is taken.&#xD;
