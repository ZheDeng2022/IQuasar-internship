      The main aim of this trial is to assess the long-term prognostic value of different types of&#xD;
      Factor XIIa in an unselected, single center series of 871 chest pain patients admitted to the&#xD;
      emergency unit, employing blood samples collected at admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second purpose of this study is to assess the incremental prognostic value of B-type&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide (BNP) and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third purpose of this study is to evaluate the prognostic impact of the Omega-3 Index which&#xD;
      is a measure of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) relative to other&#xD;
      fatty acids in the erythrocyte membrane.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Cardiac troponins are sensitive markers for myocardial injury in ACS and even a&#xD;
      minor elevation of cardiac troponins is associated with an increased risk for future adverse&#xD;
      coronary events. However, a detectable troponin release occurs only in a part of patients&#xD;
      admitted with ACS. The clinical outcomes and further prognosis of patients with ACS with&#xD;
      absent TnT release vary widely, and the identification of potential high-risk patients with&#xD;
      troponin negative ACS still remains a major problem in clinical routine. Therefore, the aim&#xD;
      of this study is focused on identifying new biomarkers for risk stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activated Factor XII: Activated Factor XII leads to contact activation and a number of&#xD;
      pathophysiological processes, including hypotension, inflammation, thrombosis and&#xD;
      fibrinolysis, are affected by contact activation following the activation of XIIa. Several&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated a relation between XIIa and coronary artery heart disease (CAD)&#xD;
      (1,2,3,4) and that XIIa levels post MI predict recurrent coronary occlusive events and play a&#xD;
      role as an independent risk marker in these patients (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the detailed mechanisms of XIIa's actions in CAD still remain uncertain although&#xD;
      recent findings in animal studies using FXII deficient mice indicate that Factor XII is&#xD;
      essential for arterial thrombus formation (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research indicates that in-vivo XIIa exists in multiple types and that in-vivo XIIa&#xD;
      can exist in the circulation complexed to a variety of other proteins (7). To date, no data&#xD;
      exist on the prognostic value of specific in-vivo types of XIIa on outcome in patients with&#xD;
      chest pain and/or ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-type natriuretic peptide: B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a counter-regulatory peptide&#xD;
      hormone predominantly synthesized in the ventricular myocardium. BNP is released into the&#xD;
      circulation in response to ventricular dilatation and pressure overload, and reflects&#xD;
      ventricular wall stress and tissue hypoxia rather than cell injury per se (8, 9). It is a&#xD;
      well known marker of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure (HF), and it provides&#xD;
      prognostic information beyond and above left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients&#xD;
      with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (10). This marker of neurohormonal activation and&#xD;
      inflammation plays a pivotal role across the spectrum of ACS, including patients with&#xD;
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) and non ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). Previous studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated that BNP measured in the first days after the onset of symptoms&#xD;
      independently predicts mortality, HF, and new MI in this patient population. Elevated&#xD;
      natriuretic peptides at presentation have been shown to identify patients with ACS who are at&#xD;
      higher risk of death and HF, and it adds information to that provided by the troponins&#xD;
      (11-13). However, in a low-risk population the association between elevated BNP and survival&#xD;
      is attenuated when adjustment is made for echocardiographic variables (in addition to&#xD;
      clinical covariates), as shown by Wang and colleagues. In addition, they did not find any&#xD;
      association between baseline BNP and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP): C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase&#xD;
      reactant that is produced in response to acute injury, infection or other inflammation&#xD;
      stimuli. It is a marker for underlying systemic inflammation and plays an important role in&#xD;
      the initiation and propagation of atherosclerosis and ultimately to plaque rupture and the&#xD;
      ensuing thrombotic complication (15) Elevated levels of CRP were first reported in patients&#xD;
      hospitalized with NSTE-ACS in the early 1990s (16, 17). Through the use of appropriate&#xD;
      high-sensitive assays, it has been possible to investigate the relationship between plasma&#xD;
      CRP levels that previously were considered to be normal and cardiovascular disease (CVD).&#xD;
      Nevertheless, it is still under debate which markers should be preferred for risk prediction&#xD;
      (18, 19). It has been suggested that the combined evaluation of BNP and CRP may yield&#xD;
      incremental prognostic information in the risk stratification of patients with ACS (20), and&#xD;
      their combined use has been shown to improve long-term risk prediction of mortality in&#xD;
      patients with stable CHD (21). To our knowledge, there are limited data available that&#xD;
      directly compare these two markers in a prospective manner in an unselected patient&#xD;
      population presenting to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain. In addition, their&#xD;
      role in risk stratification in patients with ACS is still under evaluation, and therefore&#xD;
      additional investigations are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omega- 3 Index: The value of the Omega-3 Index as a prognostic marker in the acute coronary&#xD;
      syndromes is still under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This prospective single center observational non-invasive trial includes 871 men&#xD;
      and women admitted with chest pain and potential ACS at the Stavanger University Hospital&#xD;
      between November 2002 and October 2003. Blood samples were collected immediately following&#xD;
      admission. Patients were stratified according to peak troponin T (TnT) release following&#xD;
      admission; i.e. 1) patients with an admission TnT exceeding 0.05 ng/mL, and 2) patients with&#xD;
      a peak TnT level of 0.05 ng/mL or lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of a history of previous MI, angina pectoris (AP), congestive heart failure (CHF),&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension was based on hospital records and personal&#xD;
      interview. Electrocardiographic findings at admission were classified according to the&#xD;
      presence of ST segment changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Survival status, date and cause of&#xD;
      death and clinical data were obtained by telephone interview and hospital journal reports at&#xD;
      4 predefined time points (30 days, 6, 12 and 24 months) during the two year follow-up period.&#xD;
      In case of incapacity to provide information, the general practitioner or nursery home were&#xD;
      contacted for relevant data. Hospital journals were searched for confirmation of reported&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
