      The purpose of the ALPHA Trial is to examine the physiologic changes that occur in a woman's&#xD;
      body when she begins exercising that may be related to a change in her risk of getting breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine how a one-year exercise intervention, as compared to a&#xD;
      usual sedentary lifestyle, influences specific biologic mechanisms that are hypothesized to&#xD;
      be operative in the association between physical activity and breast cancer risk. These&#xD;
      biologic mechanisms include sex hormone concentrations (estrone, estradiol and sex-hormone&#xD;
      binding globulin); measures of adiposity and obesity; mammographic density; insulin-like&#xD;
      growth factors; and insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-centered, two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) of exercise and risk factors for&#xD;
      breast cancer will be conducted. Approximately 334 postmenopausal, sedentary women will be&#xD;
      recruited to the study. Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: an exercise&#xD;
      intervention, or a control group. The intervention group will undertake five weekly exercise&#xD;
      sessions of 60 minutes each; three will be facility-based and two will be home-based each&#xD;
      week. The Edmonton and Calgary exercise oncology facilities will be working in collaboration,&#xD;
      and each will include both the controls and exercise intervention arms of the trial. The&#xD;
      exercise intervention will last for 12 months. The control group will be asked not to change&#xD;
      their usual level of activity during that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessments will be obtained of serum sex hormones (estrone and estradiol), measures&#xD;
      of obesity and adiposity, mammographic density, serum insulin growth factor (IGF)-1, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, aerobic capacity, and psychosocial health measures. At the end of the study, all&#xD;
      baseline assessments will be repeated and compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will specifically address identified gaps in knowledge, in terms of examining the&#xD;
      simultaneous effect of physical activity on several biologic mechanisms in a controlled trial&#xD;
      setting, building on evidence from the only other randomized controlled trial on this topic.&#xD;
      Strengths of the proposal include the multi-centered setting (utilizing facilities in both&#xD;
      Calgary and Edmonton), and the collaboration of an experienced multi-disciplinary research&#xD;
      team from across North America.&#xD;
