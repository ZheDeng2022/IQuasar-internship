  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to test the first version of a website that will offer&#xD;
      information and support for adolescents and young adults with FAP. Researchers want to see if&#xD;
      the website will be helpful, easy to understand, and easy to use for young patients with FAP.&#xD;

      Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will view the website, take part in a one-on-one&#xD;
      interview or a small group discussion (a focus group), and one or more questionnaires. You&#xD;
      may come to M. D. Anderson to take part in this study, which may take place during your&#xD;
      routine doctor visit, if this is possible. If you are enrolled in a registry outside of M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson, or if you do not wish to come to M. D. Anderson, you will access the website over&#xD;
      the internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to fill out a brief knowledge and quality of life questionnaire that will&#xD;
      take 10-15 minutes to complete. For the website, you will be asked to view (all or parts) of&#xD;
      an early version. The website is designed to offer information and support for adolescents&#xD;
      and young adults with FAP. Viewing the website will take about 30-60 minutes, depending on&#xD;
      what stage of development the website is in at the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the one-on-one interview or focus group (after viewing the website), you will speak with&#xD;
      a research assistant. You will be asked for your permission to record this interview or focus&#xD;
      group on an audiotape so that study staff can collect all of your responses. During this&#xD;
      interview or focus group, you will be asked about different aspects of the website, including&#xD;
      if you like it, if the information is useful to you, and if the website is easy to understand&#xD;
      and use. You will also be asked about ways that you think the website can be improved or&#xD;
      changed to better serve adolescents and young adults patients with FAP. This interview or&#xD;
      focus group will take about 15-30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the questionnaire, some participants (those who view later versions of the website) will&#xD;
      also be asked to complete the Website Analysis and Measurement Inventory (WAMMI). The WAMMI&#xD;
      is a questionnaire that will measure if the website is appealing and easy to use for&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults patients with FAP. Examples of questions on the WAMMI will be&#xD;
      about whether you can quickly find what you want on the website and whether everything on&#xD;
      this website easy to understand. You will be able to answer the questions on a 5-point scale&#xD;
      from &quot;Strongly Agree&quot; to &quot;Strongly Disagree.&quot; The questionnaire will take about 5-10 minutes&#xD;
      to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have finished viewing the website and completed the interview (and/or&#xD;
      questionnaire), you will be given the option to speak with a genetic counselor if you have&#xD;
      any questions about FAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your total time on this study will range from about 45 minutes to 2 hours. Your participation&#xD;
      will be over in this study once you have finished viewing the website and completed the&#xD;
      interview and/or questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 55 patients will take part in this study. All will be&#xD;
      enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
