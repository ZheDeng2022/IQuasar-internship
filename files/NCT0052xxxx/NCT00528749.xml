      This study is intended to compare intrathoracic pressure and respiratory effort data obtained&#xD;
      by forehead venous pressure and respiratory movement (FVP/RM) with data obtained by the&#xD;
      current gold standard, esophageal manometry. If this feasibility study validates the ability&#xD;
      of FVP/RM data to quantitatively measure respiratory effort non-invasively, further studies&#xD;
      will be performed to validate the utility of the ARES device in diagnosis of the UARS.&#xD;

      Sleep apnea is the most common disorder observed in the practice of sleep medicine and is&#xD;
      responsible for more morbidity and mortality than any other sleep disorder.(1) Although&#xD;
      characterized over 40 years ago, sleep apnea has only recently gained recognition as one of&#xD;
      the world's most prevalent undiagnosed disorders. Due to associated morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      sleep apnea has been identified as a major public health concern. Currently, sleep apnea is&#xD;
      diagnosed by performing a sleep study. This requires a patient staying overnight in a sleep&#xD;
      laboratory while being monitored, which is often inconvenient for patients and is relatively&#xD;
      expensive to perform. The development of a device that allows for simple home monitoring of&#xD;
      patients when assessing for sleep apnea would be a significant development in the field of&#xD;
      sleep medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differentiation of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) from central sleep apnea is an important&#xD;
      aspect of diagnosing and treating OSA. In central apneas/hyponeas, the lack of airflow is due&#xD;
      to lack of respiratory effort. In OSA, effort to breathe continues, but airflow is prevented&#xD;
      by an occluded airway. More recently, subtle obstructive events without a defined&#xD;
      desaturation, characterized by increasing respiratory efforts against a partially closed&#xD;
      airway and terminated by an arousal, have been described as Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome&#xD;
      (UARS). UARS can lead to daytime somnolence due to these frequent arousals. Although nasal&#xD;
      pressure signal has been used as a surrogate, by definition, distinguishing UARS from OSA&#xD;
      requires the use of esophageal manometry. This syndrome is characterized by increased upper&#xD;
      airway resistance (IUAR) that was defined by increasingly negative inspiratory esophageal&#xD;
      pressure. (2) To better understand the clinical significance of esophageal manometry, let us&#xD;
      briefly review some basic physiology. Taking a breath requires that the inspiratory muscles&#xD;
      generate sufficient force to overcome the elastic recoil of the chest wall and lungs,&#xD;
      frictional lung and chest wall tissue resistance, and the frictional resistance of airflow&#xD;
      through the airways. At the end of inspiration, the potential energy stored in the tissues of&#xD;
      the lungs and chest wall is available to allow rapid passive exhalation when the inspiratory&#xD;
      muscles cease contraction and the distending force disappears. All intrathoracic structures&#xD;
      are subjected to the pressures generated by breathing. The esophagus is a thin walled&#xD;
      muscular tube that, from the view of pulmonary physiologists, is ideally placed in the&#xD;
      thoracic cavity between the lung surface and the chest wall. Measurement of differential&#xD;
      pressure changes in the lumen of the esophagus accurately reflect changes in intrathoracic&#xD;
      pressure. These changes in intrathoracic pressure are in turn reflective of inspiratory&#xD;
      effort and have become the gold standard for detecting and quantifying inspiratory effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, measurement of esophageal manometry requires the placement of an esophageal&#xD;
      catheter via the nose or mouth. This procedure in invasive, time consuming, and requires&#xD;
      specialized training. For this reason, esophageal manometry is not routinely performed during&#xD;
      sleep studies, although it is performed in patients at the WRAMC sleep lab who are suspected&#xD;
      of having UARS. Instead of esophageal manometry, the most frequently used method of&#xD;
      monitoring respiratory effort is to record thoracic cage expansion. In this procedure, bands&#xD;
      are placed around the rib cage and abdomen. The change in circumference of these two&#xD;
      compartments with breathing is measured. This procedure yields a qualitative change in&#xD;
      inspiratory volume and paradoxical movement of the rib cage or abdomen can indicate effort&#xD;
      against a closed or partially collapsed airway. This device is impractical for&#xD;
      self-application by patients. Given the limitations of the latter procedure and the invasive&#xD;
      nature of esophageal manometry, a non-invasive quantitative method for measuring respiratory&#xD;
      effort would be a significant advancement in sleep medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past five years, investigators from Advanced Brain Monitoring, Inc. developed and&#xD;
      validated the Apnea Risk Evaluation System (ARES). This device was initially developed to&#xD;
      provide a highly accurate method of in-home diagnosis of OSA that maximized patient comfort&#xD;
      and ease of use. The ARES Unicorder was designed as a single site (forehead) system to&#xD;
      acquire oxygen saturation, pulse rate, snoring, airflow (nasal pressure), and head&#xD;
      position/movement. Recently, investigators determined that a number of signals that were&#xD;
      being acquired with the Unicorder could be used to measure respiration.(1) Pulsations&#xD;
      observed in the red and infrared optical signals used to compute oxygen saturation and the&#xD;
      forehead sensor pressure signal appear to reflect central venous pressure changes. These data&#xD;
      has been termed the Forehead Venous Pressure/Respiratory Movement (FVP/RM) measure. If FVP/RM&#xD;
      data proves to correlate with esophageal manometry data, the long sought after non-invasive&#xD;
      quantitative measurement of intrathoracic pressure and respiratory effort would be available.&#xD;
      This would represent a significant advancement in the diagnostic evaluation of sleep&#xD;
      disordered breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better illustrate how forehead venous pressure could reflect intrathoracic pressure, let&#xD;
      us again review some physiology. During inspiration, the central venous pressure (CVP)&#xD;
      decreases, aiding the return of blood to the heart. Changes in pleural and intrathoracic&#xD;
      pressure due to respiration are reflected by and can be timed to changes in central venous&#xD;
      pressure. When recumbent, the internal and external jugular veins are open and provide the&#xD;
      primary cerebral and superficial forehead venous return. The communication between the&#xD;
      superior vena cava and the veins of the headallows intrathoracic pressure changes to be&#xD;
      reflected by the superficial veins of the head. In a sense, the forehead veins offer a direct&#xD;
      fluid filled catheter into the thoracic cavity, and when the correct compressive force is&#xD;
      applied against the skull, respiratory effort linked venous pressure changes can be&#xD;
      accurately measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, current evaluation of UARS requires esophageal manometry testing, an invasive and&#xD;
      time consuming procedure for accurate diagnosis. Currently, no non-invasive quanitative means&#xD;
      of measuring intrathoracic pressure changes linked to respiratory effort exists. This study&#xD;
      is a pilot trial of a new non-invasive method of determining intrathoracic pressures. If&#xD;
      intrathoracic pressure data from this device is found to correlate with esophgeal manometry&#xD;
      data, this could have significant implications on the way in which UARS is diagnosed. This&#xD;
      technology also has the potential to develop a non-invasive means of measuring CVP.&#xD;
