  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goals of this study are to identify patterns of familial aggregation with&#xD;
      regards to categorical and dimensional approaches of ADHD and neuropsychological measures, to&#xD;
      validate the phenotypes and endophenotypes that are close to biological expression of genders&#xD;
      underlying ADHD, and to identify the genetic variants close to the etiological genes of ADHD&#xD;
      in Taiwanese sample. We propose to replicate the analysis of the candidate genes identified&#xD;
      by previous genetic studies on ADHD using the candidate gene association study design&#xD;
      (family-based case control study using parental controls) to validate the findings from other&#xD;
      research groups. With the accomplishment of these goals, this study will resolve&#xD;
      controversies over inconsistent findings in previous genetic studies and contribute to the&#xD;
      literature on the validity of ASD using clinical and genetic data.&#xD;

      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), characterized by inattention, hyperactivity&#xD;
      and impulsivity, is an early onset, highly heritable, clinically heterogeneous, long-term&#xD;
      impairing disorder with tremendous impact on individuals, families, and societies. It affects&#xD;
      5-10% of school-aged children worldwide (7.5% in Taiwan) and 2-4% of adults.&#xD;
      Neuropsychological deficits related to executive functions, state regulation, and delay&#xD;
      aversion show heritability, replicated association with ADHD, and familial-genetic overlap&#xD;
      with ADHD, are suitable for biomarkers for ADHD. Despite the abundance of molecular genetic&#xD;
      studies on ADHD, the genetic etiologies of ADHD have been non-conclusive, and there is&#xD;
      limited information about the expressions, endophenotypes, and genetic variants for ADHD in&#xD;
      Chinese population. This polite study, a family-based parental control association study,&#xD;
      aims to identify the genetic markers for ADHD using the dichotomous categorization of&#xD;
      affected and non-affected, quantitative phenotypes (symptoms dimension and severity of ADHD)&#xD;
      and endophenotype (neuropsychological measures) as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine the components of ADHD and neuropsychological deficit with the greatest&#xD;
           familial recurrence risks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to replicate studies with positive genetic findings from literature by performing&#xD;
           candidate gene analysis such as DRD4, DAT1, DRD5, HTR1B, SNPA-25, 5-HTT, DBH, CHRNA4,&#xD;
           CHRNA7 etc;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to identify the potential genetic variants using haplotype tag SNPs for the following&#xD;
           candidate genes, CHRNA4 and CHRNA7 and any updated genetic findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 200 probands with ADHD, aged 7-18, and their parents (n = 400) and siblings&#xD;
      (n= 150) in three years (50, 100, and 50 families with ADHD in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year,&#xD;
      respectively). The measures include (1) interviews for psychopathology (K-SADS-E) and social&#xD;
      functioning (SAICA), (2) self-administered questionnaires to measures ADHD symptoms&#xD;
      (CPRS-R:S, CTRS-R:S, SNAP-IV and Adult ADHD rating scale) and comorbid conditions (ASRI and&#xD;
      CBCL), and (3) Neuropsychological tests: WISC-III, CPT, CANTAB, and Time Perception Tasks.&#xD;
      The DNA will be collected and analyzed. The transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) and&#xD;
      quantitative TDT will be used in data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate the establishment of clinical, neuropsychological, and genetic database of 200&#xD;
      ADHD families, completion of the screening of several candidate genes, and identification of&#xD;
      potential genetic variants for ADHD, and determination of their association with ADHD&#xD;
      diagnosis and symptoms and its endophenotype in a Taiwanese sample. The long-term objectives&#xD;
      are to identify the behavioral phenotypes and endophenotypes that are close to the biological&#xD;
      expression of genes underlying ADHD. The findings of different approaches to identify the&#xD;
      genetic etiologies for ADHD in this pilot study should help us to determine the most&#xD;
      promising approach for future molecular genetic study on ADHD.&#xD;
