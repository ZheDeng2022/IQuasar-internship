    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is a chronic pulmonary disease characterized by an irreversible dilatation of&#xD;
      the bronchi. The current view of the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis considers initial&#xD;
      colonization of the lower respiratory tract by different microorganisms as the first step&#xD;
      leading to an inflammatory response characterized by neutrophil migration within the airways&#xD;
      and secondary secretion of a variety of tissue-damaging oxidants and enzymes such as&#xD;
      neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase. Persistence of microorganisms in the airways because&#xD;
      of impairment in mucus clearance may lead to a vicious circle of events characterized by&#xD;
      chronic bacterial colonization, persistent inflammatory reaction, and progressive tissue&#xD;
      damage. The exact prevalence of bronchiectasis in COPD patients is not known. It would be&#xD;
      important to assess the prevalence, the kind of bronchiectasis and the bacterial&#xD;
      colonisation. These are all important features that can be related to the natural history of&#xD;
      COPD and to the therapeutic management of patient with COPD and bronchiectasis. Recent data&#xD;
      indicate that macrolide long-term treatment and inhaled steroids therapy are both associated&#xD;
      with a reduced rate of exacerbation, bronchial colonization and inflammation The present&#xD;
      study will address, on a relatively large number of patients, the prevalence of&#xD;
      bronchiectasis in COPD subjects using a multislice CT scan technique applied in all the units&#xD;
      and centrally analysed by Unit 2 and 4. This analysis will determine the presence and the&#xD;
      morphology of bronchiectasis. Bacterial colonization and inflammatory parameters will be&#xD;
      evaluated on blood and exhalate bronchial condensate. Concerning bacterial colonization&#xD;
      molecular biology techniques (Qualitative PCR and quantitative real time PCR) will be&#xD;
      applied. ELISPOT technique for the evaluation of specific immune response will be&#xD;
      used.Electron and optical microscopy techniques will be applied on bronchial biopsy samples&#xD;
      obtained in a subgroup of patients enrolled. During the second study year, a randomized trial&#xD;
      on patients with bronchiectasis will be performed. Patients will be randomized to receive a&#xD;
      macrolide or inhaled steroids or standard of care for 6 months with a follow-up of 6 months.&#xD;
      All the inflammatory, microbiologic and functional parameters described above will be&#xD;
      recorded. A clinical and functional evaluation will be applied looking to number of&#xD;
      exacerbations, quality of life, respiratory function parameters.&#xD;

      AIMS OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      As previously described the research program aims are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  definition of bronchiectasis prevalence in patients affected by chronic obstructive&#xD;
           pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After bronchiectasis patients identification, we will evaluate the pathophysiologic&#xD;
           implications, and microbiologic and inflammatory features of this subgroup in comparison&#xD;
           to non-bronchiectasis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finally, the research will address the effects of long-term treatments with inhaled&#xD;
           steroids and antibiotic on the natural history of the disease and their pathophysiologic&#xD;
           implications. To these purposes, the study will be divided into two sections. In the Ist&#xD;
           section 400 patients with COPD will be recruited. In these patients we intend to assess&#xD;
           the prevalence of bronchiectasis using a CT spiral scanning. We will also detect&#xD;
           bacterial colonisation by real time PCR and ELIspot technique, and airway inflammation&#xD;
           by a non-invasive method (exhaled breath condensate) comparing patients with and without&#xD;
           bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD patients with bronchiectasis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this population we will study the effect of different &quot;prophylaxis&quot; i.e., macrolide and&#xD;
      inhaled steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of the Interventions Proposed STABLE COPD The patient will attend the clinic in the&#xD;
      morning for enrolment, and provide written informed consent. During the visit medical history&#xD;
      will be recorded and subjects will undergo a physical examination and lung function testing&#xD;
      at baseline and post salbutamol 200 mcg. CT scan, exhaled breath condensate and the&#xD;
      venopuncture will also be performed. Sputum samples will be obtained for bacterial&#xD;
      colonization assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung function testing will be performed using a Fleish No. 3 heated pneumotachograph; the&#xD;
      plethysmographic measurements, thoracic gas volume (TGV), residual volume (RV), total lung&#xD;
      capacity (TLC), will be assessed using a body plethysmograph (Werner Gut, Basle, Switzerland)&#xD;
      with electronic BTPS compensation at a constant volume (850L). DLCO determination will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scan All the multislice CT (MSCT) scan performed will be centrally analysed by UO 4 . The&#xD;
      following protocol will be followed&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MSCT in inspiration at TLC with slice of 1 mm every 10 + 3 expiratory slices at RV using&#xD;
           three predetermined levels (aortic arch, tracheal carina, right basal common vein)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Technical parameters: 120 kV, 220 mA, filter bone, FOV including both lung, lung&#xD;
           parenchyma window (-600/1600 HU)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All CT will be saved on CD rom Two radiologists will analyse the same CT, every&#xD;
           discrepancy will be solved by consensus&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis and evaluation of bronchiectasis will be performed according to Webb et al.&#xD;
      (1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will be performed lobe by lobe including lingula (total lobes= 6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. bronchiectasis extension on lobar base: 0, 1 (&lt; 25% of the lobe), 2 (25-50%), 3 (&gt;50%) -&#xD;
           MAX TOT 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. severity and kind of bronchiectasis and semi-quantitative, comparing the diameter to&#xD;
           that of the adjacent artery: 0, 1 (bronchial diameter equal to 100-200% artery&#xD;
           diameter), 2 (200-300%), 3 (&gt; 300%) - MAX TOT 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Thickness of bronchial walls: 0, 1 (Thickness &lt; 50% artery diameter), 2 (50-100%), 3 (&#xD;
           complete obliteration of lumen or Hydro-air levels) - MAX TOT 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluation of emphysema (visual score on three levels (inspiration) (aortic arch,&#xD;
           carina, vein)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluation of air trapping in expiration (idem)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Bullae&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Ground glass areas (extension by visual score)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. bronchiolitis: prevalent site, lobar involvement, severity ( 0,1,2,3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Pulmonary artery diameter (pathological if &gt; 2,9 cm)&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Other features&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exhaled breath condensate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exhaled breath condensate will be collected by using a condenser, which allows the&#xD;
      non-invasive collection of nongaseous components of the expiratory air (EcoScreen, Jaeger,&#xD;
      Germany). Subjects breathe tidally through a mouthpiece connected to the inlet for 8 min&#xD;
      while wearing a nose-clip. The mouthpiece is also used as a saliva trap. Approximately 1 ml&#xD;
      of breath condensate is collected and stored at -70° C. IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a and&#xD;
      cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) will be measured by specific enzyme immunoassays (EIA)&#xD;
      (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Moreover proteomic analysis will be performed on the subset&#xD;
      of patients enrolled by UO1 as previously reported (2); briefly, one-dimensional and&#xD;
      two-dimensional electrophoresis will be performed and for qualitative evaluation and mass&#xD;
      spectrometry analysis, the gels will be stained with silver nitrate, with or without&#xD;
      glutaraldehyde in the sensitization step and formaldehyde in the impregnation solution. Spot&#xD;
      volumes will be calculated using Image J 1.29x (W. Rasband, National Institutes of Health,&#xD;
      Bethesda, Maryland) for one-dimensional gels, and with PDQUEST (Biorad, Hercules, California)&#xD;
      for two-dimensional gels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum aliquots will be arranged in duplicate and stored at - 20°C until the time of analysis.&#xD;
      IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a and cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LTs) will be measured by specific enzyme&#xD;
      immunoassays (EIA) (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-reactive protein and procalcitonin will be also measured.(3) UO 1 The ex-vivo Enzyme-Linked&#xD;
      ImmunoSPOT (ELISPOT) assay is the most sensitive tool to detect and quantify the&#xD;
      antigen-specific T-cell response, and can detect and enumerate T-cells producing one or more&#xD;
      cytokines in response to specific antigens. This technique has been already used to detect&#xD;
      low numbers of antigen-specific T-cells in infectious disorders, with particular emphasis to&#xD;
      intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis . The ELISPOT technique is&#xD;
      becoming a standard reference for the monitoring of many infectious diseases, including HIV&#xD;
      infection, and is becoming more and more used in advanced clinical immunological&#xD;
      applications, such as the detection of an antigen-specific T cell immune responses to&#xD;
      oncogene peptides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of the proposed project, the ELISPOT technology will be used to detect the&#xD;
      presence of a systemic (blood) and local (bronchoalveolar lavage) antigen-specific response&#xD;
      using peptide pools of non tuberculous mycobacteria and other intracellular bacteria (such as&#xD;
      Mycoplasma pneumoniae), bacteria (such as Pseudomonas spp) and fungi (such as Aspergillus&#xD;
      species). The ELISPOT tests will be performed on samples of whole blood (after Ficoll&#xD;
      separation of peripheral mononuclear cells) and bronchoalveolar cells measuring the number of&#xD;
      T cells producing interferon-gamma after an overnight incubation with the specific antigenic&#xD;
      peptide pools. (4-8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sputum collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of spontaneous sputum will be obtained from all patients. Alternatively induced&#xD;
      sputum according to Pizzichini, et al (9) will be collected. In summary, induced sputum is&#xD;
      obtained after inhalation of hypertonic saline water at 3% for 20 minutes using an ultrasonic&#xD;
      nebulizer (Ultraneb 2000; DeVilbiss Healthcare Inc, Somerset, PS, USA).Only samples of sputum&#xD;
      degree IV or V of Murray-Washington classification (10) will be processed. A sputum sample&#xD;
      will be frozen at -70°C for bacterial DNA detection using a PCR (qualitative analysis) and&#xD;
      real time PCR (quantitative analysis) techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following Bacteria wil be detected using standard protocol in use in UO1: H. influenzae,&#xD;
      M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae, P.&#xD;
&#xD;
      aeruginosa, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae. An aliquot will be cultivated using&#xD;
      standard microbiologic techniques Patients 400 patients will be recruited at the UO 1,2,3 e&#xD;
      5. All the CT scan will be collected and examined at UO 4. UO2 will serve as second observer&#xD;
      in a double-blind fashion; any discrepancy will be solved by consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One subgroup of patients with stable COPD (n=15) and an subgroup of patients with COPD and&#xD;
      bronchiectasis (n=15) will undergo bronchoscopy with biopsy collection. Subjects will be&#xD;
      premedicated with atropine and anesthetized topically with lidocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoscopy will be performed with a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. Bronchial biopsies&#xD;
      will be taken through the bronchoscope with standard forceps from the carina of the basal&#xD;
      segment bronchus of the right lower lobe. From this area two specimens will be obtained in&#xD;
      each patients. Bronchial biopsies obtained will be prepared for electronic and light&#xD;
      microscopy analysis (UO3 and UO 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: we can expect at least a 30% prevalence of bronchiectasis that means 120&#xD;
      patients to be included in the second step of the study (11)&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIECTASIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this population we will study the effect of different &quot;prophylaxis&quot; i.e. macrolide and&#xD;
      inhaled steroids. The population will be followed for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedure will be performed every 3 months and at each exacerbations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment, Exhaled breath condensate, Serum Sampling, Sputum collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On biological samples all the previously described techniques plus renal and hepatic function&#xD;
      tests (safety) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sputum culture will be performed to assess bacterial flora and resistance patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 patients will be randomized in 3 groups (40 pts) to receive :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. azithromycin 500 mg OD 3 days a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for 6 months and then&#xD;
           inhaled steroids (fluticasone 500 ug bid) for 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. inhaled steroids (fluticasone 500 ug bid) for 6 months and then azithromycin 500 mg OD 3&#xD;
           days a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  effects of treatments on bronchial inflammation parameters SECONDARY&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  effects of treatments on exacerbations frequency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  effects of treatments on pulmonary function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We can expect a 40% difference between treated and non-treated patients for at least one&#xD;
      among TNFa, IL6, IL8, and cysteinyl-leukotrienes. In this case we need 35 treated patients&#xD;
      (for each arm) and 35 non-treated patients for an alpha error of 0.05 and a beta of 0.1.&#xD;
