      The purpose of this study is to compare Apidra (a rapid acting insulin analogue) with Regular&#xD;
      insulin (fast acting) in addition to the use of long acting insulin Glargine in hospitalized&#xD;
      patients in terms of efficacy and safety in blood glucose control and frequency of low blood&#xD;
      glucose. Blood glucose control along with incidence and rate of low blood glucose during the&#xD;
      hospitalization shall be of primary interest; length of hospital stay comparing the short&#xD;
      acting insulin used shall be the secondary interest.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: To compare the rapid acting insulin analogue Apidra with regular insulin in&#xD;
      addition to insulin Glargine in hospitalized patients in terms of efficacy and safety, namely&#xD;
      Glycemic control and frequency of hypoglycemia. Glycemic control, and incidence and rate of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia during the hospitalization shall be the primary endpoints; length of hospital&#xD;
      stay according to the short acting insulin used shall be the secondary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN: Randomized, prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Inpatient single center study, planning to enroll 600 patients with type II diabetes&#xD;
      admitted to medical or surgical non-ICU service for three days or longer. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to Apidra or regular insulin in a 1:1 fashion. Insulin Glargine will be given once&#xD;
      a day for basal insulin in all subjects. An algorithm to determine the initial doses of&#xD;
      insulin and dose adjustments is as follows: Lean subjects (BMI less than 25 kg/m2) will&#xD;
      initially receive a total of 0.4 units/kg/day, overweight subjects (BMI 25-30 kg/m2) 0.5&#xD;
      units/kg/day and obese subjects (BMI greater than 30 kg/m2) 0.6 units/kg/day. Fifty percent&#xD;
      of the total amount of insulin will be given as Glargine and 50% as regular insulin or&#xD;
      Apidra. Supplemental short-acting insulin will be given for hyperglycemia before meals.&#xD;
      Automated order sets shall be generated to minimize errors in order entries. Glucose&#xD;
      concentrations will be measured before each meal and at bedtime, and if symptomatic. In&#xD;
      addition, eight-point blood glucose profiles will be obtained every three days starting on&#xD;
      day 2. Dose adjustments will be made to keep blood glucose concentrations between 80 and 120&#xD;
      mg/dl pre-prandially and less than180 mg/dl after meals. In addition, HbA1c, lipid profile&#xD;
      and a fasting plasma C-peptide will be obtained. Two days prior to the anticipated discharge,&#xD;
      another HbA1c will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence and the rate of hypoglycemia in each category shall be determined. During the&#xD;
      hospitalization, the average of blood glucose measurements at each time point of an 8-point&#xD;
      blood glucose profile will be compared; after the hospitalization the HbA1c shall be used.&#xD;
      Glycemic control will be compared between groups using ANCOVA adjusting for baseline HbA1c.&#xD;
      Hypoglycemic events will be compared between groups using logistic or Poisson regression;&#xD;
      length of stay will be compared between groups using survival analysis or the Mann Whitney U&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
