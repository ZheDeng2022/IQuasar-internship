  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with symptoms of mixed incontinence (loss of urine associated with&#xD;
      coughing/sneezing/laughing, and loss of urine associated with the strong urge to void), is&#xD;
      surgical treatment with tension free vaginal tape or pharmacological treatment with&#xD;
      tolterodine more effective? What are the parameters predictive of success or failure with&#xD;
      either forms of treatment? What are the parameters predictive of the necessity for further&#xD;
      treatment after primary treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to having surgical or pharmacological treatment for their mixed&#xD;
      incontinence symptoms. They will be assessed subjectively and objectively pre-treatment and&#xD;
      after treatment at intervals up to 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy and effect on the patient subsequent to&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment with single dose tolterodine compared to surgical treatment with&#xD;
      TVT in patients with urodynamically demonstrated mixed urinary incontinence, but with&#xD;
      prevailing symptoms of stress incontinence. Secondary aims are the identification of&#xD;
      parameters predictive of success or failure for the two treatments (echography, duration of&#xD;
      the symptoms) and the necessity for further treatment after the primary therapy. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to reduce the number of incontinence episodes after treatment with either&#xD;
      modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design will be randomisation of 40 patients, with 20 in the surgical group and 20 in the&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment group. The patients must be female and aged between 35 and 70. They&#xD;
      should not be intending to fall pregnant and be capable of completing a questionnaire about&#xD;
      their incontinence symptoms and quality of life, a diary of their incontinence episodes and&#xD;
      account of the passing of their urine, as well as be able to give informed consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for approximately 12 months and will consist of 5 visits. At the first&#xD;
      visit, the patient will be seen to verify their suitability for admission into the study,&#xD;
      have baseline blood tests, and urine analysis, as well as urodynamic assessment. They will&#xD;
      also be given a diary to fill out an account of their urine passing which they will be asked&#xD;
      to complete for the course of 3 days prior to their next appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the second appointment, the patient's diary will be collected and reviewed, a quality of&#xD;
      life questionnaire will be completed, as well as an ultrasound scan performed to assess the&#xD;
      thickness of the wall of their bladder. The patients will then be randomised into the&#xD;
      pharmacological and surgical groups. Those in the surgical group will be put onto the waiting&#xD;
      list for TVT (which they will have within 2 weeks of the second appointment), or commence&#xD;
      treatment with tolterodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 weeks after either treatment the patients are seen again and their symptoms are assessed&#xD;
      and a second diary of the urinary behaviour (completed by the patient for the week prior to&#xD;
      this visit) will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the final visit, which will be after 12 weeks of treatment, the patients undergo&#xD;
      urodynamic testing, diary assessment, symptom assessment, a quality of life questionnaire is&#xD;
      completed and an appraisal of the patient's satisfaction with their treatment is collected.&#xD;
      The discussion of need for any further treatment will take place and at this stage the&#xD;
      patient may then have their treatment changed to either the tolterodine or surgery depending&#xD;
      on their symptoms. These patients will then be finally seen after six months to review their&#xD;
      progress.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must be female as this is a urogynaecology study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. An age of between 35 and 70 years. This takes into account that incontinence tends to&#xD;
             prevail in women with advancing years. Younger women may be planning to start a family&#xD;
             which precludes them from participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinical urodynamic evidence of mixed incontinence with prevalence of symptoms of&#xD;
             stress incontinence assessed by means of a specific questionnaire and visual analog&#xD;
             scale (VAS). The study is assessing the treatment of mixed incontinence and the&#xD;
             patients will have to have evidence of this which is provided by their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Candidates for corrective surgery of the component of sphincter defect with Ba &lt; - 1&#xD;
             according to the International Continence Society (ICS) classification of genital&#xD;
             prolapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients capable of filling in the micturition diary, the VAS, and the pathology&#xD;
             specific quality of life questionnaire, the Kings Health Questionnaire. These form&#xD;
             part of the continuing assessment of effectiveness of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients capable of understanding and signing an informed written consent form for&#xD;
             participating in the trial. If patients are unable to give their consent for the&#xD;
             procedures and investigations they cannot be ethically recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who accept not to give birth vaginally in the future, so as not to jeopardize&#xD;
             the results of the surgical operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Contraindications for using anti-cholinergic agents (urinary retention, uncontrolled&#xD;
             narrow-angle glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, severe ulcerative colitis, toxic megacolon).&#xD;
             Anticholinergics form one group of the patients and inability to take these drugs&#xD;
             therefore precludes them from participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ascertained hypersensitivity to tolterodine or any of the excipients. For the above&#xD;
             reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of pathologies or conditions that in the Investigator's opinion make the&#xD;
             patient unsuitable for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) during the run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with recurrent urinary tract infections (&gt; 5 in the past 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with diagnosed interstitial cystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             These compromise the results obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with haematuria of uncertain origin. These patients need urgent investigation&#xD;
             of these signs with procedures that are not included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients on treatment with anti-cholinergic agents of other drugs acting on detrusor&#xD;
             instability. This will compromise the results of the study if for example these&#xD;
             patients are randomised into the surgical group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients on treatment with oestrogens, unless the therapy was commenced at least 2&#xD;
             months prior to inclusion in the study and follows a constant dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients on diuretics. This affect their urinary behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients on concomitant treatment with potent CYP 34A inhibitors, such as macrolide&#xD;
             antibiotics or antimycotic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients who have undergone previous surgery on the distal urinary tract (with the&#xD;
             exception of hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients who do not have adequate contraceptive cover or patients who are&#xD;
             breast-feeding. For reasons of avoiding pregnancy during the study.&#xD;
