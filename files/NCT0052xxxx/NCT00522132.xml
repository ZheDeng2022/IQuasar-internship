    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of 2 intravenous&#xD;
      artesunate dosing regimens (2.4 mg/kg initially and at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours or 4.0 mg/kg&#xD;
      initially and at 24 and 48 hours) in clearing P. falciparum parasites in children with severe&#xD;
      malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the tolerability and safety of the 2 intravenous artesunate dosing regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate differences in the pharmacokinetic profile of intravenous artesunate by&#xD;
           patient age and clinical presentation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, double-blind, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group study of the&#xD;
      antimalarial activity and safety of 2 intravenous artesunate regimens in children with severe&#xD;
      P. falciparum malaria (Appendix B). It will compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      the SEAQUAMAT regimen, the recommended dosing regimen for adults,8 which requires twice daily&#xD;
      artesunate dosing on the first day, to a simpler once daily regimen. The study will also&#xD;
      evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of artesunate in pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to study initiation, the protocol will be approved by the Independent Ethics&#xD;
      Committee/Institutional Review Board(s) (IEC/IRB) of each site and the national regulatory&#xD;
      authority of each study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 200 patients will be randomized at 3 study sites in Africa, which are part of&#xD;
      the Severe Malaria in African Children (SMAC) network. Patients will be randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: artesunate 2.4 mg/kg initially, and at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours (12 mg/kg&#xD;
           total dose); or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: artesunate 4 mg/kg initially, and at 24 and 48 hours (12 mg/kg total dose),&#xD;
           normal saline will be administered as a placebo at 12 and 72 hours in order to maintain&#xD;
           the study blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into 3 main periods including the Pre-Treatment Period (Screening/Day&#xD;
      0), the Treatment Period (Days 0 through 3; Day 0 is the first day of study drug dosing), and&#xD;
      the Post-Treatment Period (including evaluations on Days 7, 14, and 28). Children presenting&#xD;
      to the study hospitals with signs/symptoms of severe malaria will be screened for study&#xD;
      enrollment. Those with presumed severe malaria will be identified and informed consent for&#xD;
      participation from parents/guardians will be obtained while confirmation of malaria is&#xD;
      determined by microscopic analysis of a Giemsa-stained thick smear. Patients who meet study&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized and promptly treated&#xD;
      with 1 of the artesunate regimens, while hospitalized for at least 4 days (Days 0, 1, 2, and&#xD;
      3). Adjunctive therapy, including fluids, glucose, and blood, will follow SMAC standards,&#xD;
      based on WHO guidelines for the treatment of severe malaria (Appendix C). As soon as the&#xD;
      patient is able to receive oral medication and no signs and symptoms of severe malaria are&#xD;
      present, but not before the last pharmacokinetic sample is taken (approximately 50 hours&#xD;
      after the start of therapy), a single dose of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine will be administered&#xD;
      to ensure parasitological cure. Patients who received sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine within 14&#xD;
      days prior Study Day 0 will receive mefloquine instead of SP,, to ensure effective&#xD;
      parasitological cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the parasitemia is controlled and the safety laboratory tests from Day 3 indicate no&#xD;
      clinical concern warranting prolonged hospitalization, the patient may be discharged at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigator. If a patient is discharged from the hospital on Day 3, he/she&#xD;
      will return to the study site on Day 7 for evaluation. If the patient is unable to tolerate&#xD;
      oral liquids or food within 6-24 hours after the last dose of artesunate, the patient will&#xD;
      continue to be hospitalized and treated with parenteral antimalarial therapy until he/she is&#xD;
      able to resume oral intake or a total of 7 days of therapy have been completed. All patients&#xD;
      will return to the study site for evaluation on Days 14 and 28 to assess resolution of&#xD;
      clinical complications and monitor for safety of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed by various parasite clearance parameters. Safety evaluations&#xD;
      including physical examinations, vital signs, hematology and chemistry laboratory parameters&#xD;
      and monitoring of adverse events will be performed throughout the study. Pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      assessments will be performed at 3 different timepoints during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If adverse events reported during the study are unresolved by Day 28, patients will be&#xD;
      followed for an additional 30 days or until resolution of the event or determination that no&#xD;
      further medical management is deemed necessary. Similarly, the investigator will instruct the&#xD;
      parents/guardians to return the patient to the study site if any untoward event occurs within&#xD;
      30 days of completing study drug.&#xD;
