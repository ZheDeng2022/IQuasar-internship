      Introduction: Efforts to bridge the gap between research based treatment modalities&#xD;
      advancements and clinical practice have received the highest priority in the research&#xD;
      community. In the child psychiatry field there is an urging need to promote bridging this&#xD;
      gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents and child health providers hesitate to refer children to child psychiatrist due to&#xD;
      stigma but also due to lack of awareness of available and efficient treatment options. In the&#xD;
      field of trauma treatment another reason for lack of treatment is lack of recognition of&#xD;
      trauma related symptoms in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the second Lebanon war scarce referrals to psychiatric clinics have been registered and&#xD;
      access to treatment is low as indicated by 20 referrals in the past year to Emek Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to explore the effectiveness of well-established adult treatment for PTSD, the&#xD;
      Prolonged Exposure (PE), in community-based general pediatric clinics, serving an&#xD;
      underprivileged diverse population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty children age 6 to 18 attending general pediatric clinic and in Afula region will&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      children will be diagnosed using the Hebrew translation of the Childhood version of the&#xD;
      Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (Apter et al., 1989 Children will receive&#xD;
      the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the. CPSS All subjects will be treated with a&#xD;
      manualized 12-week Prolonged Exposure protocol Ratings will be made at baseline, 6weeks, and&#xD;
      12 weeks using CDI and CPSS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. PE adapted for pediatric population will be effective in treating single-event traumas in&#xD;
      a community setting.&#xD;

      SPECIFIC AIMS The aim of the study is to examine the effectiveness of PE treatment of PTSD in&#xD;
      community settings&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE There is a great need to apply scientific achievements in&#xD;
      behavioral science research to community-based clinical settings. Many recent advances in&#xD;
      psychology with significant potential to improve clinical practice and intervention have not&#xD;
      yet been utilized in clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent report of the NIH National Advisory Mental Health Council Behavioral Science&#xD;
      Workgroup has defined this approach, &quot;Translational research&quot;, as follows: &quot;Translational&#xD;
      research in the behavioral and social sciences addresses how basic behavioral processes&#xD;
      inform the diagnosis, prevention, treatment and delivery of services for mental illness, and&#xD;
      conversely, how knowledge of mental illness increases our understanding of basic behavioral&#xD;
      processes. &quot; (NIH publication, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTSD in children is a well established diagnosis.Recent studies have shown 30 % of children&#xD;
      presenting with PTSD symptoms after the second Lebanon war Parents and child health providers&#xD;
      hesitate to refer children to child psychiatrist due to stigma but also due to lack of&#xD;
      awareness of available and efficient treatment options. In the field of trauma treatment&#xD;
      another reason for lack of treatment is lack of recognition of trauma related symptoms in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the second Lebanon war scarce referrals to psychiatric clinics have been registered and&#xD;
      access to treatment is low as indicated by 20 referrals in the past year to Ha'Emek Medical&#xD;
      Center child and adolescent psychiatric clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ha'Emek medical center is initiating a community base PTSD treatment program to children&#xD;
      attending general pediatric clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to explore the effectiveness of well-established adult treatment for PTSD, the&#xD;
      Prolonged Exposure (PE), in community-based general pediatric clinics, serving an&#xD;
      underprivileged diverse population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Subjects: Twenty children age 6 to 18 referred to the community&#xD;
      base PTSD treatment program offered by the Ha'Emek medical center in Afula will be include:&#xD;
      All families referred to the PTSD treatment program will be offered to participate in the&#xD;
      research protocol. We expect 50 families to be included in the treatment program. Only&#xD;
      subject whose both parents will agree for inclusion in the research program will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DSM- IV R diagnosis: PTSD Evaluation/Instruments Socio-Demographics Data: Child: Age, Sex,&#xD;
      grade level and medical history. Parents: Age, marital status, ethnic background, country of&#xD;
      birth, language spoken at home, education level, occupational status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trauma History: Type of trauma, distance from Katushe fall Kiddy SADS: a semi structural&#xD;
      interview CDI: a self report questionnaire CPSS: a self report questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be informed of the goals of the study by their primary child health provider,&#xD;
      and will be offered the opportunity to meet with the mental health worker prior to&#xD;
      enrollment.. Parents will be told that their participation in the research is voluntary and&#xD;
      anonymous and their refusal to participate will not affect the services they receive by the&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children who will be diagnosed as having PTSD will be offered 12 sessions treatment by PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CDI and CPSS will be scored at time 0, time 6 weeks and time 12 weeks&#xD;
