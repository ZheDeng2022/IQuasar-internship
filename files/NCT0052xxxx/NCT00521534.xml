      Background and Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SDB is increasingly recognized as a co-morbidity with significant impact on overall health.&#xD;
      The disorder has been implicated in the development of hypertension, atherosclerotic&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease as well as arrhythmia, stroke and the progression of congestive heart&#xD;
      failure. The disorder is prevalent among males, estimated to affect upto 24% of the general&#xD;
      population. Its prevalence increases with age, and it is particularly prevalent among&#xD;
      patients with congestive heart failure with the prevalence rising to 51% in that group.&#xD;
      Interestingly, recent evidence points to a potential impact for treating sleep disordered&#xD;
      breathing, on heart failure patients. At the same time, recent reports of a beneficial impact&#xD;
      of atrial overdrive pacing on SDB, have stirred interest in a potentially effective and well&#xD;
      tolerated non-pharmacologic means of therapy for this disorder. Particularly at a time when&#xD;
      cardiac resynchronization therapy utilizing biventricular pacing has demonstrated significant&#xD;
      impact on heart failure, the interplay between CHF and SDB pacemaker based therapy begs&#xD;
      further exploration. The interdependence of potential positive impact on each entity needs to&#xD;
      be elucidated for further research and refinement of therapeutic tools. Furthermore, this&#xD;
      study aims to explore potential neurohormonal influence on and affection by each of these&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: To assess the effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with or&#xD;
      without atrial pacing on SDB in patients with advanced CHF at 8 and 16 weeks after&#xD;
      implementation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1: Resynchronization therapy improves SDB, the effect may anticipate or lag&#xD;
      improvement in heart failure. Atrial pacing has a beneficial effect in addition to CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: To explore the effect of CRT on cardiac neuro-hormonal activity in relation&#xD;
      to its effects on CHF and SDB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2: CRT neuro-hormonal modulation is a common path in its effects on SDB and CHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3: To assess prevalence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in patients with&#xD;
      advanced congestive heart failure (CHF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #3: SDB is prevalent yet under recognized in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study with a built in double blinded prospective randomized&#xD;
      interventional substudy of a potential confounder i.e. atrial pacing. All patients will&#xD;
      receive CRT with defibrillator for clinical indications (CRT-D). Investigators other than the&#xD;
      EP physicians as well as patients will be blinded to the pacing mode. After screening and a&#xD;
      run in period of back up pacing a baseline polysomnogram (PSG) will be performed. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized between atrial overdrive or atrial tracking pacing modes for six months,&#xD;
      all patients receiving CRT. Sleep studies will be performed at baseline and at three month&#xD;
      intervals. Subjects: Patients referred for implantation of CRT -D will be recruited for this&#xD;
      trial. Patients are included only if they are indicated for such a device on clinical&#xD;
      grounds. Outcome Measures: 1.Sleep quality related Parameters:The following will be collected&#xD;
      at times of each PSG: MAP-PSQI, PSG parameters of sleep quality and architecture, apnea&#xD;
      hypopnea index, and oxygen saturation as well as biochemical markers of sleep efficiency.&#xD;
      2.Heart Failure Parameters: The following will be obtained at times of each PSG: Minnesota&#xD;
      Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, Clinical and echocardiographic measures of heart&#xD;
      failure progression and biochemical markers of heart failure severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Analysis: An improvement in SDB in both initial randomization arms is assumed, however&#xD;
      we further assume the atrial overdrive arm will offer improvement over the atrial tracking&#xD;
      arm of equal magnitude. An arbitrary estimate would be twenty percent improvement in atrial&#xD;
      overdrive arm. The corresponding estimate is 40% improvement due to CRT. To achieve 0.80&#xD;
      power thirty four data sets need to be collected.&#xD;
