  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a disease in which fatty build-up, or &quot;plaque,&quot;&#xD;
      accumulates in the peripheral arteries. People with PAD often experience leg pain while&#xD;
      walking due to reduced blood flow to the legs. This study will use magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) techniques to examine how specific features of plaque build-up in the leg arteries&#xD;
      affect walking ability, leg strength, and balance in people with PAD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plaque build-up caused by atherosclerosis increases the risk of blood clots, heart attack,&#xD;
      and stroke. Blockages of plaque can occur in different areas of the body. PAD, a circulatory&#xD;
      disorder in which blockages occur in the peripheral arteries, is one manifestation of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. Individuals with PAD experience reduced blood flow to the legs, which may&#xD;
      cause leg pain while walking. This study will use MRI techniques to examine how&#xD;
      characteristics of plaque build-up in the leg arteries change over time and how this change&#xD;
      affects function, walking ability, leg strength, and balance in people with PAD. Results from&#xD;
      this study may be used to shape future research studies that will attempt to identify more&#xD;
      effective treatments for people with PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll people with PAD, as well as a smaller control group of people who do&#xD;
      not have PAD. At an initial study visit, study researchers will interview participants to&#xD;
      collect information about their medical history, daily activity level, walking ability, and&#xD;
      mental functioning. Blood collection and a leg MRI will occur. Also, blood flow to the legs&#xD;
      will be measured by comparing blood pressure measurements in the arms and legs. Leg function&#xD;
      will be measured through a series of timed walks, leg strength exercises, and muscle power&#xD;
      exercises. Questionnaires to assess participants' medical history will be completed by each&#xD;
      participant's primary care doctor, and study researchers will review participants' medical&#xD;
      records. Participants with knee pain will have a knee x-ray, and participants may wear a&#xD;
      small device called an accelerometer for 1 week to monitor physical activity levels. During&#xD;
      the second and third study visits, occurring at one and two year follow-up, blood flow, leg&#xD;
      function, and leg strength will be measured. If participants cannot attend either study&#xD;
      visit, researchers may visit participants at their home or conduct an interview over the&#xD;
      phone. Study researchers may contact participants by phone once or twice a year for&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
