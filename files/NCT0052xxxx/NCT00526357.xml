  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We wish to investigate the effects of 3 weeks of orally administered fish oil supplements on&#xD;
      the airway sensitivity (provoking dose to cause a 15% fall in FEV1, PD15) to inhaled mannitol&#xD;
      (AridolTM). Mannitol, an osmotic stimulus has been demonstrated as a useful model for&#xD;
      exercise-induced asthma. We also wish to investigate if there is any associated improvement&#xD;
      associated with selected markers of airway inflammation that can be measured in the sputum,&#xD;
      blood, urine and exhaled breath condensate. Oral fish oil supplements have recently been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be effective inhibitors of exercise-induced asthma, in association with an&#xD;
      inhibition of markers of inflammation, over a 3 week treatment period. This finding has&#xD;
      important implications in the treatment of asthma as this is a faster and more effective&#xD;
      improvement than what is seen with inhaled corticosteroids on exercise-induced asthma. This&#xD;
      observation requires validation and further investigation. We wish to study this in two&#xD;
      patient groups; (a) steroid na√Øve asthmatics taking beta2 agonist when required and (b)&#xD;
      asthmatics taking regular inhaled corticosteroids &lt; 1000 mcg/day.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by recurrent episodes&#xD;
      of dyspnea, wheeze and chest tightness and is associated with variable airway obstruction.&#xD;
      Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is a feature specific to asthma. Exercise testing&#xD;
      protocols have been developed to identify the presence of asthma as well as to assess asthma&#xD;
      therapy. Airway narrowing following exercise in persons with asthma is thought to result from&#xD;
      dry air hyperpnoea-induced dehydration of the airway surface, leading to the release of&#xD;
      mediators from inflammatory cells residing in the airway. Regular treatment with inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids inhibits the airway response to exercise by decreasing the number of&#xD;
      inflammatory cells and thus the source of bronchoconstricting mediators. Therefore, a&#xD;
      decrease in the source of mediator may be the reason for this eventual inhibition of the&#xD;
      airway response to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has recently been demonstrated that fish oil supplementation in capsule form, taken daily&#xD;
      over three weeks, provides significant protection against EIB. This protection appears to be&#xD;
      of equal or greater efficacy than inhaled corticosteroids treatment over a similar period.&#xD;
      This may have positive implications in the treatment of asthma as inhaled corticosteroids are&#xD;
      known to have some unwanted side effects. Fish oil supplementation in the high doses given in&#xD;
      previous studies have not demonstrated any side effects and may lead to an alternative&#xD;
      treatment, or a decrease in the dose of inhaled steroids required in the treatment of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new bronchial provocation test using inhaled mannitol, derived from the mechanism of EIB,&#xD;
      has been recently developed and is now registered in Australia and the European Union.&#xD;
      Mannitol causes airway narrowing in a similar manner to exercise in persons with asthma and&#xD;
      is effective in identifying responsiveness to inhaled corticosteroids. We wish to use inhaled&#xD;
      mannitol as a model for EIB in an effort to further investigate the use of fish oil&#xD;
      supplementation in the treatment of asthma. Our hypothesis is that daily orally administered&#xD;
      encapsulated fish oil will attenuate the airway response to mannitol over a 3-week treatment&#xD;
      period. We also wish to measure associated markers of inflammation in the blood, urine,&#xD;
      sputum and exhaled condensate as well as monitor clinical outcomes such as symptoms and daily&#xD;
      beta2 agonist use.&#xD;
