  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical utility and safety of Fentanyl for pain&#xD;
      treatment caused by radiotherapy. Fentanyl is a synthetic pure opioid agonist with a&#xD;
      selective activity on Âµ receptors.&#xD;

      The study is a phase IV, open label, single arm study. The purpose of this study is to assess&#xD;
      the clinical utility and safety of fentanyl transdermal therapeutic system (patch) for&#xD;
      treatment of pain caused by radiotherapy. The patients increase or even decrease the amount&#xD;
      of study medication in order to achieve pain relief, 48 to 72 hours or 3 days are required&#xD;
      after the first patch application. The study medication will be used for 4 weeks. VAS (visual&#xD;
      analog scale), BPI Q9 (quality of life) and global assessment have been used to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness. VAS will be assessed every week. BPI Q9 will be assessed at week 1 and week 4.&#xD;
      Global assessment will be assessed at week 4. The safety of the study drug will be evaluated&#xD;
      using adverse event (AE) report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will assess the pain intensity of patients and increase or even decrease&#xD;
      Fentanyl dosage every week. Fentanyl will be started on 25 or 50 ug per hr depending on&#xD;
      investigator's judgement. Fentanyl will be administered for 4 weeks.&#xD;
