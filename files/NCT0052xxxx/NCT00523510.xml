      This study will investigate the feasibility of HIV positive mothers in Tanzania to correctly&#xD;
      use the Flash-heat method to pasteurize their breast milk and for how long they are able to&#xD;
      do so. The patients will be followed in this study for up to 3 months of Flash-heating their&#xD;
      milk. Flash-heated breast milk could be a potential method to reduce mother-to-child&#xD;
      transmission of HIV. The investigators will also collect infant health data to pilot a future&#xD;
      efficacy trial. The investigators hypothesize that with enhanced home-based infant feeding&#xD;
      counseling, mothers will be capable of Flash-heating their breast milk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive&#xD;
      mothers in developing countries exclusively breastfeed for the first months of the infant's&#xD;
      life followed by early cessation, unless breast milk substitutes are acceptable, feasible,&#xD;
      affordable, sustainable, and safe. The weaning period is high risk for such infants due to&#xD;
      lack of adequate replacement feeds resulting in malnutrition, growth faltering and&#xD;
      susceptibility to diarrheal and respiratory illness from loss of breast milk's immune&#xD;
      protection and introduction of contaminated foods and water. In addition, risk of HIV&#xD;
      transmission is increased if a mother breastfeeds during weaning due to higher breast milk&#xD;
      viral load during this time. Appropriate infant feeding alternatives during and after the&#xD;
      high-risk weaning period are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although heat-treating breast milk is listed by WHO as one method of modifying breast milk,&#xD;
      it has not been fully explored. Our preliminary data demonstrate that Flash-heat, a&#xD;
      low-technologic home pasteurization method, is capable of inactivating HIV in infected breast&#xD;
      milk while maintaining most vitamins and immunoglobulins. This suggests Flash-heating breast&#xD;
      milk could be a potential infant feeding option during and after weaning to decrease risk of&#xD;
      infant illness and malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical staffing shortages in much of Africa, however, limit the ability of doctors, nurses&#xD;
      and counselors to provide comprehensive infant feeding counseling to each mother. In light of&#xD;
      this, our study will investigate the use of enhanced peer-based infant feeding counseling as&#xD;
      a practical approach to improving exclusive breastfeeding durations while we are&#xD;
      investigating the feasibility of Flash-heating breast milk. We will collaborate with the US&#xD;
      and Tanzania offices of the University Research Co, LLC (URC), who are at the forefront of&#xD;
      implementing appropriate infant feeding counseling methods in Africa. We will work with URC,&#xD;
      local investigators, and Anna Coutsoudis, who's Safer Breastfeeding Programme in South Africa&#xD;
      is considered a model, to provide community health workers with comprehensive infant feeding&#xD;
      counseling training. HIV positive mothers (and a small number of HIV negative/status unknown&#xD;
      mothers to avoid stigmatizing home-based counseling) who are breastfeeding will be recruited&#xD;
      at 1-2 months postpartum at hospitals in Tanzania and provided enhanced counseling to&#xD;
      exclusively breastfeed. Trained community health workers will make weekly home visits to&#xD;
      support the mothers and collect infant feeding and breast pathology data. When the HIV&#xD;
      positive mothers anticipate introduction of complementary foods, the Flash-heat method will&#xD;
      be further discussed as an option for during and after transition. Mothers who choose to&#xD;
      Flash-heat will be provided home-based support by community health workers and followed for&#xD;
      up to 3 months from the time they stop breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility and pilot efficacy study of Flash-heating breast milk will be used to guide&#xD;
      a full-scale efficacy trial in the near future. Specific aims include to: 1) Determine the&#xD;
      impact of enhanced home-based training on infant feeding outcomes. Given clinical staffing&#xD;
      shortages in Tanzania, the use of community health workers could provide support needed to&#xD;
      exclusively breastfeed longer. Rates of initiation and duration of exclusive breastfeeding&#xD;
      will be measured. These findings are important to explore effective methods of thoroughly&#xD;
      educating the mothers about the risks and benefits of the various infant-feeding alternatives&#xD;
      while not increasing the burden facing under-staffed health care workers. 2) Determine uptake&#xD;
      of the Flash-heat method and protocol adherence by mothers in their homes. With enhanced&#xD;
      support from community health workers, mothers may be able to correctly Flash-heat their&#xD;
      milk, suggesting it could be a practical infant feeding method. Uptake of heat treatment and&#xD;
      the duration of successful heat treatment will be measured. We will also interview mothers&#xD;
      who opt to attempt the method to qualitatively assess the challenges mothers may face in a&#xD;
      field setting. 3) Determine safety of Flash-heated breast milk in a field setting. Breast&#xD;
      milk samples will be collected and assayed for HIV inactivation and bacterial counts to&#xD;
      ensure method safety in field settings. 4) To pilot an efficacy trial of Flash-heat to&#xD;
      improve infant health outcomes. Research personnel will monitor infant feeding, growth and&#xD;
      morbidity during home visits twice monthly. If infants who receive heat-treated breast milk&#xD;
      experience less morbidity and mortality than those fed complementary foods while continuing&#xD;
      to breastfeed and those completely weaned to replacement foods, counselors in the future will&#xD;
      be better able to inform mothers of risks and benefits of different feeding options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this proposed study finds that HIV positive mothers can successfully heat-treat their&#xD;
      breast milk, it could be viewed as an HIV-free, safe, nutritious, affordable and available&#xD;
      complementary food during and after the weaning phase after EBF.&#xD;

    <description>We will collect infant health data to monitor and compare health outcomes among 3 groups of infants who had exclusive breast feeding (EBF) for the first months and then either: 1) fed Flash-heated breast milk and complementary foods (n=30), or 2) weaned to replacement foods and NO breast milk (n=15; per standard WHO recommendation for rapid cessation), or 3) continued feeding at the breast and providing other foods and/or fluids, i.e. mixed feeds (n=15; per WHO consensus that breastfeeding continue if replacement feeding is not AFASS94). We will collect infant growth and morbidity data. Infant health outcomes will be compared for the 3 groups noted above. These data will be collected primarily to pilot an efficacy trial.</description>
