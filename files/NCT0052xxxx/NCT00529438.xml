  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bardoxolone methyl (RTA 402) is a synthetic triterpenoid that has demonstrated significant in&#xD;
      vivo single agent anti-cancer activity. This is an open-label phase I dose-escalation study&#xD;
      of Bardoxolone methyl (RTA 402) administered orally for the first 21 days of a 28-day cycle.&#xD;
