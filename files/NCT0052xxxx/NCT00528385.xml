    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is find whether the addition of aldosterone antagonist,&#xD;
      spironolactone to dual renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade involving angiotensin&#xD;
      converting enzyme inhibitor and AT-1 angiotensin II receptor blocker leads to the reduction&#xD;
      of proteinuria, main prognostic marker of chronic kidney disease progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the progression of&#xD;
      chronic kidney diseases (CKD), and inhibition of the RAAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme&#xD;
      inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) may retard CKD&#xD;
      progression. Dual pharmacological blockade of the RAAS with ACEI and ARB is recommended as a&#xD;
      standard renoprotective management at least in patients with nondiabetic proteinuric CKD.&#xD;
      However, neither ACEI nor ARB, even in high doses or in concomitant usage, abrogate the&#xD;
      progression of CKD completely. Innovative approaches are needed to keep patients with CKD off&#xD;
      dialysis. Additional blockade of the aldosterone pathway may prove to be such beneficial&#xD;
      therapeutic concept.Aldosterone, a final effector of RAAS plays a significant role in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of CKD independently of angiotensin II through direct cellular action. This&#xD;
      includes promoting an inflammatory response, endothelial dysfunction, and fibrosis by&#xD;
      increasing plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and transforming growth factor beta-1&#xD;
      (TGF-beta-1) expression and stimulation reactive oxygen species.A number of observations&#xD;
      suggest nongenomic vasoconstrictor action of aldosterone leading to raise arterial and&#xD;
      glomerular capillary pressure.Given these facts additional administration of aldosterone&#xD;
      antagonist to combination treatment with ACEI and ARB, so called triple RAAS blockade may&#xD;
      provide additional renal protection. To shed more light on this issue, we performed a&#xD;
      randomised open controlled study to evaluate the influence of triple RAAS therapy on&#xD;
      surrogate markers of kidney injury, i.e. proteinuria, markers of tubular involvement and&#xD;
      kidney fibrosis.&#xD;

    <description>In the 8-weeks run-in period ACEI, cilazapril (5 mg), telmisartan (80 mg) and hydrochlorotiazyd (12.5 mg) were administered to achieve the target blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg. Next, they were randomly assigned to add (or not) 25 mg of spironolactone in two active treatment periods lasting 8 weeks each.</description>
