      STAND is a research study testing a way to help teens between 12-18 years of age who have&#xD;
      symptoms of sadness or depression. The study hopes to learn if teens do better if they get&#xD;
      five to nine counseling sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy coordinated with the support&#xD;
      of their doctor. All teens who join the study will keep seeing their doctor as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teens and a parent are interviewed briefly over the phone to see if they are appropriate for&#xD;
      the study. If they qualify for the study, there is an hour-long interview with teen over the&#xD;
      telephone and a 30 minute interview with the parent. The interview will include questions&#xD;
      about the teen's mood, feelings, behavior, and how they get along with friends and family&#xD;
      members. The parent is also asked about his or her own feelings and mood. If the teen and&#xD;
      parent join the study, they will be interviewed six more times in the next two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half the teens in the study will also meet with a research counselor for five to nine&#xD;
      individual, weekly sessions that last about 50 minutes each. Whether a teen attends the&#xD;
      weekly counseling sessions is decided by chance, like flipping a coin. If teens are assigned&#xD;
      to these sessions, they will learn ways to deal with stress and feel better. If teens take&#xD;
      part in the counseling sessions, the study counselor will also talk to the teen's doctor from&#xD;
      time to time to help plan for the best possible care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Substantial numbers of depressed adolescents either decline antidepressant medication or&#xD;
      quickly discontinue such medications before benefits are expected. Recent controversies&#xD;
      regarding the safety of SSRI anti-depressants are likely to increase medication refusal. More&#xD;
      than half of depressed adolescents identified in primary care prefer psychosocial treatments,&#xD;
      compared to 20% who prefer medication. Among the psychotherapy alternatives to medication,&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has the strongest research support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The STAND study is a two-arm, randomized, efficacy-effectiveness trial in primarily a Health&#xD;
      Maintenance Organization (HMO), comparing a treatment as usual (TAU) control condition to TAU&#xD;
      plus brief, individual, collaborative care CBT delivered in primary care. We will enroll 240&#xD;
      youth ages 12 to 18 who, during this depressive episode, have either declined anti-depressant&#xD;
      medication or who received a single dispense of anti-depressant medication but quickly&#xD;
      discontinued. All enrolled cases will be reassessed periodically throughout a 24-month&#xD;
      follow-up period. The primary clinical outcome is recovery from the index episode of major&#xD;
      depression, assessed via research diagnosis. Secondary outcomes include continuous depression&#xD;
      symptomatology; depression response; rates of new, recurrent episodes of major depression in&#xD;
      the follow-up period; improvements in psychosocial function; clinical improvement; reduction&#xD;
      in depression-related dysfunction; parent/youth attitudes regarding treatment. We will also&#xD;
      examine incremental cost-effectiveness of CBT compared to TAU from the HMO, family, and&#xD;
      societal perspectives. We will conduct exploratory analyses of mediation and moderation of&#xD;
      depression treatment outcomes, and employ data from the TAU control condition to estimate the&#xD;
      usual outcomes for depressed youth who refuse/discontinue antidepressant medication. Finally,&#xD;
      we will examine how provider, parent and youth barriers, attitudes and beliefs moderate&#xD;
      outcomes, as well as possibly change over time as a function of participation in this&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validation of a primary care model for brief CBT may prove to be a significant benefit to&#xD;
      the sizeable numbers of depressed youth identified in primary care, and who elect not to try&#xD;
      anti-depressant medication or quickly discontinue an initial trial.&#xD;
