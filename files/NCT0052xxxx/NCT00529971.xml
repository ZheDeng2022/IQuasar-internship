      This study will examine the effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in&#xD;
      helping men living with HIV cope with negative emotions and stresses in their life. MBSR is&#xD;
      an approach to reducing stress for patients with chronic medical conditions. It involves&#xD;
      systematic training in mindfulness meditation practices to increase quality of life and to&#xD;
      reduce general stress, anxiety, depression or pain. The effectiveness of MBSR will be&#xD;
      evaluated by looking at changes in participants' experience of stress, anxiety associated&#xD;
      with pain management and psychosocial functioning before and after they receive the MBSR&#xD;
      compared with participants who do not receive the MBSR treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to participate, individuals must be: male, living with HIV, age 18-70 years, live&#xD;
      within one hour of participating centre, and have a good understanding of the English&#xD;
      language. Questionnaires will be completed before individuals begin the program, at the end&#xD;
      of the intensive phase (8 weeks) and at 6 months after the start of the group program. The&#xD;
      primary program evaluation outcome will be a reduction in stress; secondary evaluation&#xD;
      outcomes will include the improvements in the physical and emotional experience of pain as&#xD;
      well as general psychosocial functioning and self-esteem.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In most health care settings, psychosocial interventions that target stress and distress&#xD;
      states that are integrated into routine HIV care will need to serve a large number of&#xD;
      patients. Due to their time- and cost- efficiency, group approaches are being used&#xD;
      increasingly in medical settings to address this need. One approach that has been used&#xD;
      successfully in cancer and other chronic diseases is mindfulness-based stress reduction&#xD;
      (MBSR), an 8-week manualized treatment program that provides mood management techniques based&#xD;
      on training in mindfulness, a metacognitive skill. A recent randomized controlled trial in&#xD;
      cancer demonstrated that this brief intervention significantly reduced anxiety and depression&#xD;
      symptoms and that these gains were maintained at a six-month follow-up. Similar results have&#xD;
      been obtained in a heterogeneous sample of medical patients. Although research in this area&#xD;
      is in its infancy, it does appear that MBSR may be effective in the management of anxiety and&#xD;
      mood symptoms that are common across various medical conditions and thus may be a good&#xD;
      treatment option in men living with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence, gathered from a pilot assessment of an MBSR program for HIV positive&#xD;
      men, demonstrated significant pre- to post-intervention reductions in anxiety and depression,&#xD;
      as well as overall mood disturbance scores on standardized measures, and thus, MBSR has&#xD;
      promise in this population. A randomized controlled trial is clearly needed however before&#xD;
      can be recommended as a psychosocial treatment for men with HIV. It is predicted that MBSR&#xD;
      will be effective in mitigating anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as HIV-related&#xD;
      distress, among HIV patients (Hypothesis #1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MBSR appears to be particularly well suited for anxiety- and depression- spectrum symptoms&#xD;
      because it targets cognitive processes that contribute to and maintains them. Current&#xD;
      cognitive models emphasize the central role of worry and rumination in the onset and&#xD;
      maintenance of anxiety and depression, respectively. Worry can perpetuate an upward spiral of&#xD;
      increased emotional arousal and intrusive thoughts heightening anxiety symptoms. Similarly,&#xD;
      rumination can escalate a spiraling cycle of dysphoric affect and associated negative&#xD;
      thinking that can lead eventually to a major depressive episode. (MBSR utilizes training in&#xD;
      attention regulation that is thought to provide patients with a skill that enables them to&#xD;
      disengage from patterns of worry and rumination that otherwise would perpetuate negative&#xD;
      affect. Consistent with this prediction, Dr. Bishop (co-investigator) has found evidence from&#xD;
      a recently completed pilot study that mindfulness training results in decreased frequency of&#xD;
      worry and rumination. Although preliminary, MBSR may be associated with decreases in both&#xD;
      worry and rumination (Hypothesis #2) and that, consistent with current cognitive models,&#xD;
      decreases in worry and rumination would moderate the reductions in anxiety and depression,&#xD;
      respectively (Hypothesis #3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are also interested in whether this approach is effective for the management of pain,&#xD;
      which is prevalent in this population. There is substantial evidence that anxiety, and&#xD;
      particularly pain-related fear, can heighten the perception of the intensity and&#xD;
      unpleasantness of pain and that anxiety management can lessen pain. Since we anticipate that&#xD;
      MBSR will reduce anxiety in this study, we would further expect that it would also reduce the&#xD;
      subjective experience of pain (Hypothesis #4). There is some evidence from an uncontrolled&#xD;
      trial suggesting that MBSR may be highly effective for managing chronic pain. If MBSR can be&#xD;
      used to effectively mitigate pain, then this too would have a recursive effect on mood. Pain&#xD;
      in medical populations is a significant factor in emotional distress and psychiatric&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
