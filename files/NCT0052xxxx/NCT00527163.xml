  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, conducted by NIH, the University of Bamako in Mali, Africa, and Tulane University&#xD;
      will examine the relationships between hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells), nitric oxide&#xD;
      (a gas important in regulating blood vessel dilation and blood flow) and pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension in patients with malaria. Malaria is among the leading causes of death in many&#xD;
      of the world s poorest countries. It is caused by a parasite that is transmitted to humans by&#xD;
      mosquitoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malian children ages 1-5 years are eligible for participation in this study. They include&#xD;
      children with asymptomatic infection, uncomplicated disease, and severe disease. Uninfected&#xD;
      controls are also included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrollment, participants have a medical history and physical examination, echocardiogram&#xD;
      (ultrasound test of heart function) and blood tests. In addition, all participants (infected&#xD;
      children and controls) have repeat evaluations when healthy, approximately 7 to10 days&#xD;
      following successful therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is among the leading infectious causes of death in many of the world s poorest&#xD;
      countries. This parasitic mosquito-borne illness produces massive hemolysis in many infected&#xD;
      human hosts. While much is known about parasite replication and cytoadherence, very little is&#xD;
      known about the impact of hemolysis per se on vascular tone and endothelial function.&#xD;
      Crossing a number of medical disciplines beyond the scope of malaria, intriguing new research&#xD;
      on inherited hemolytic disorders such as sickle cell disease (SCD) provides clues to&#xD;
      pathogenic mechanisms that may be relevant to malaria. Dr. Gladwin (NHLBI) and colleagues&#xD;
      have characterized a mechanism of disease, hemolysis-associated endothelial dysfunction, in&#xD;
      which red blood cell hemoglobin spills into plasma and reacts with and oxidatively destroys&#xD;
      nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, erythrocyte arginase I is released into plasma and&#xD;
      catabolizes arginine, the substrate for endothelial NO synthesis. As a result, the profound&#xD;
      reduction in NO bioavailability produces vasomotor instability, oxidant stress, inflammation,&#xD;
      endothelial adhesion molecule expression, activation of tissue factor, and platelet&#xD;
      aggregation. Consistent with shared mechanisms, these same pathways are found to be activated&#xD;
      during malarial infection. Chronic hemolysis in hemoglobinopathies also leads to a disease&#xD;
      syndrome, hemolysis associated pulmonary hypertension, which develops in all chronic&#xD;
      hereditary and acquired hemolytic conditions and is associated with excessive morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Despite the recent appreciation of these mechanisms, not one study can be found in&#xD;
      the literature evaluating pulmonary hypertension in human malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol therefore aims to evaluate mechanisms governing interrelationships among&#xD;
      malaria, intravascular hemolysis, NO bioavailability, endothelial function, pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension, and evolutionarily selected host polymorphisms that regulate the host response&#xD;
      to hemolysis. We will correlate our clinical observations in the field with laboratory assays&#xD;
      of hemolysis and nitric oxide bioavailability related to scavenging by cell-free hemoglobin&#xD;
      and arginine catabolism. Using a candidate gene approach, we will identify and selectively&#xD;
      characterize polymorphisms in genes important for endothelial function, vascular inflammation&#xD;
      and disease phenotype. Finally, the characterization of this mechanism in malaria may&#xD;
      catalyze the development of novel therapies targeting this pathway, such as sodium nitrite,&#xD;
      inhaled nitric oxide gas, and/or recombinant haptoglobin infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This international collaboration between scientists at the NIH, University of Bamako, and&#xD;
      Tulane University will provide an exclusive opportunity for the rapid transfer of appropriate&#xD;
      technology and expertise relevant to the provision of the highest quality care to malaria&#xD;
      patients in Mali and the world.&#xD;
