  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vicriviroc (vye-kri-VYE-rock) is an investigational drug (not yet approved by Government&#xD;
      Regulatory Authorities for commercial use) that belongs to a new class of drugs, called CCR5&#xD;
      receptor blockers. This group of drugs blocks one of the ways HIV enters T-cells (the cells&#xD;
      that fight infection). Previous smaller studies in HIV treatment-experienced patients, have&#xD;
      shown that vicriviroc is safe and effective. The purpose of this study is to confirm the&#xD;
      previous findings in a larger phase 3 study over a 48-week period, and show that when taken&#xD;
      in combination with other appropriate HIV drugs, vicriviroc can decrease the level of HIV&#xD;
      (viral load) in the blood and that it is well tolerated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study of&#xD;
      vicriviroc maleate in HIV subjects infected with CCR5-tropic virus only and who have&#xD;
      documented&#xD;
&#xD;
      resistance to at least 2 of the 3 antiretroviral drug classes (NRTI, NNRTI or PI) or at least&#xD;
      6 months experience with at&#xD;
&#xD;
      least 2 of the following: one NRTI, one NNRTI, or two PIs (excluding low-dose ritonavir)and&#xD;
      failed at least one standard triple-drug regimen. The study will compare the virologic&#xD;
      benefit of adding vicriviroc to an optimized background regimen to a control group receiving&#xD;
      placebo plus the new optimized background therapy. The optimized background regimen will be&#xD;
      chosen by the investigator based on results of drug susceptibility tests performed at&#xD;
      Screening, history of prior antiretroviral drug use by the patient, and drug toxicity. OBT&#xD;
      must include a PI boosted by ritonavir (&gt;=100 mg ritonavir), and at least 2 active drugs (ie,&#xD;
      to which HIV isolate is fully susceptible). Primary efficacy analysis will be conducted when&#xD;
      all subjects have completed 48 weeks of treatment. An interim analysis will be performed when&#xD;
      all subjects have completed 24 weeks of treatment. After completing Week 48 of the study,&#xD;
      subjects who meet applicable criteria will be offered open-label vicriviroc 30 mg QD, if&#xD;
      appropriate until the sponsor terminates the clinical development of vicriviroc.&#xD;
      Additionally, subjects who discontinued early from the study prior to Week 48 may be eligible&#xD;
      for the open-label segment of the study.&#xD;
