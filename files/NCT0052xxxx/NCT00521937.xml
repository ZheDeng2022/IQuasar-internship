  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 300 million people worldwide will have diabetes by the year 2025. About&#xD;
      12 percent of those with diabetes will have had a foot ulcer, which is a major source of&#xD;
      morbidity, concern, and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The foot ulcers are the leading cause of hospitalization among people with diabetes and often&#xD;
      lead to amputation. The costs of treatment and the high morbidity and mortality associated&#xD;
      with diabetic foot problems necessitate the need for a systemic approach to a foot ulcer&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current local treatments of this type of ulcer are: dressings (hydrocolloids, alginate…), and&#xD;
      growth factors. However modern dressings may not avoid infection and the results of the&#xD;
      clinical studies are not significant in terms of complete healing rate or in terms of time to&#xD;
      healing. Concerning growth factors, the only one whose therapeutic application made proof is&#xD;
      the rhPDGF (Regranex®) with an increase in the number of ulcers completely healed at the&#xD;
      twentieth week compared to placebo (50% and 35%, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advancement of tissue-engineering has made possible dermal replacement on human wounds to&#xD;
      facilitate healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new sponge composed of collagen and glycosaminoglycans (chondroitins 4 and 6 sulphate),&#xD;
      reticulated by ionic bonds with chitosan before freeze-drying, was developed in France. This&#xD;
      sponge is a non-toxic product due to its non-chemical reticulation (ionic bonds),&#xD;
      biocompatible and biodegradable processes, handling and storable easily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate that such a substitute, cellularized by&#xD;
      functional allogenic fibroblasts, and complying with all safety conditions, enables to lead&#xD;
      to healing of diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
