      RATIONALE: BI 2536 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well BI 2536 works in&#xD;
      treating patients with recurrent or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate if BI 2536 demonstrates antitumor activity in the selected tumor types.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Further document its safety profile in the treated patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the plasma concentration time-course following administration of a single&#xD;
           administration of BI 2536 in patients with different tumor types using an appropriate&#xD;
           population pharmacokinetic model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive BI 2536 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood is collected periodically during study. Plasma samples are analyzed for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      studies by HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.&#xD;
