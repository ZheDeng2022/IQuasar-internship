  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About two-thirds of depressed patients respond to a standard course of serotonin specific&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI's) within 3-4 weeks. While some clinicians advise continued watchful&#xD;
      waiting after this time or switch to a different reuptake-blocker based antidepressant,&#xD;
      result of such conservative strategies are usually disappointing. For severe depression&#xD;
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an option and for atypical depressions monoamine oxide&#xD;
      inhibitors (MAO) inhibitors often give relief at this point. A unique strategy with both&#xD;
      theoretical and practical implications is lithium augmentation (Fava et al, 1994). Addition&#xD;
      of lithium to SSRI failures at 3-4 weeks is consistently and sometimes dramatically found to&#xD;
      be helpful. This is considered true even by those authors who advocate use of lithium under&#xD;
      usual circumstances only in bipolar patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lithium in recent years has been joined as a mood stabilizer by carbamazepine and valproate.&#xD;
      Phenytoin, ignored for many years as a possible anticonvulsant mood stabilizer, has been&#xD;
      recently reported in double-blind controlled trials to be anti-manic (Mishory et al, 2000)&#xD;
      and also prophylactic in BP disorder (Mishory et al, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on mood stabilizers other than lithium as augmentors in SSRI failures are sparse.&#xD;
      Carbamazepine (Steinacher et al, 2002) and valproate (Barbee et al, 2002) have been used.&#xD;
      Given our recent preliminary results of phenytoin's efficacy in unipolar depression (Nemets&#xD;
      et al, 2005) and its analogy to lithium as a mood stabilizer, it seems important to study&#xD;
      phenytoin as a possible augmentation of SSRI failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have published a negative study previously of inositol as an augmentation of SSRI&#xD;
      failures, enrolling forty-two patients over two years (Nemets et al, 1999). Antidepressant&#xD;
      failures are easier to recruit from referring physicians in our center than are untreated&#xD;
      patients, whom clinicians are reluctant to refer for new drug studies given the adequacy of&#xD;
      standard treatment in 2/3 of them. Thus we estimate that we could enroll 20 patients per year&#xD;
      in such a study. Survey of the literature of Li augmentation suggests that 40 phenytoin vs.&#xD;
      40 placebo should give adequate power to detect a significant phenytoin effect if the&#xD;
      phenytoin effect is similar to that of lithium.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The study has been approved by the Helsinki Committee and all patients must give written&#xD;
      informed consent. Patients will be evaluated for study if they meet DSM-IV criteria for major&#xD;
      depression without psychotic features. Patients can enter the study if they had at least 3&#xD;
      weeks of treatment with SSRI at clinically adequate doses (150mg fluvoxamine, 20mg&#xD;
      fluoxetine, or 20mg paroxetine) and still have a score of at least 18 on the Hamilton&#xD;
      Depression Scale (HDS) (on 24 item scale) with at most mild improvement from onset of SSRI&#xD;
      treatment. Patients with alcohol or drug abuse or patients with unstable medical illnesses&#xD;
      are excluded. Design is parallel double-blind. Patients continue SSRI treatment of the same&#xD;
      medication and dose they received before entry. They are randomly assigned to phenytoin or&#xD;
      identical placebo capsules. Patients will be rated on the HDRS weekly for four weeks after&#xD;
      addition of phenytoin or placebo. Patients who do not improve at least 1 unit on the GCI&#xD;
      every two weeks will be dropped from the study for ethical reasons and referred to open&#xD;
      treatment. HDRS ratings are done weekly by an experienced psychiatrist (BN) blind to the&#xD;
      treatment medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood levels of phenytoin will be reported by the lab to the treating psychiatrist after&#xD;
      &quot;dummy&quot; levels are assigned by the control psychiatrist to patients on placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated physically and EKG, liver and kidney functions, and blood cell&#xD;
      count performed before entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special attention will be given to instruction of patients in dental hygiene and patients&#xD;
      showing signs of gingival hyperplasia will be dropped. Studies in epilepsy show that this&#xD;
      side effect is surprisingly uncommon, despite wide publicity. No cases were seen in our&#xD;
      previous short-term study or prophylactic study (Mishory et al, 2000; Mishory et al, 2003).&#xD;
      Nonlinear pharmacokinetics, drug interactions and the consequent danger of toxicity will be&#xD;
      handled by careful blood levels monitoring. Patients with significant side effects or&#xD;
      toxicity will be dropped from the study. Patients with indications of hypersensitivity&#xD;
      reactions (morbilliform rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, hepatic&#xD;
      necrosis, neutropenia and leukopenia, red-cell aplasia, agranulocytosis, aplastic- or megalo-&#xD;
      anemia, or thrombocytopenia) will be dropped from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance: Almost one third of patients fail to respond to standard antidepressants. Proof&#xD;
      of efficacy of phenytoin augmentation in such cases would: 1) be a useful addition to our&#xD;
      clinical armamentarium 2) strengthen the theoretical profile of phenytoin as an antimanic,&#xD;
      antidepressant and mood stabilizing compound parallel to lithium and several other&#xD;
      anticonvulsants 3) raise useful and heuristic ideas for mechanistic studies of phenytoin's&#xD;
      effects on mood.&#xD;
