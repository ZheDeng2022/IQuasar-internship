      Study Protocol Post-Operative Creatinine Changes In Patients With Pre-Existing Renal&#xD;
      Impairment After Low-Flow Isoflurane Or Sevoflurane: A Randomised Clinical Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sevoflurane is a volatile anaesthetic agent available for clinical use in most countries&#xD;
      including Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Since the first&#xD;
      clinical use of sevoflurane in Japan during the 1980s, millions of anaesthetics have been&#xD;
      given with sevoflurane. Sevoflurane has a number of advantages over other agents for general&#xD;
      anaesthesia, particularly isoflurane. The benefits to patients and the environment include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A lower blood and tissue solubility allows patients to wake up faster after anaesthesia&#xD;
           1, 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The lower blood solubility allows faster titration during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate is more stable during increases in inspired concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Airway resistance is lower than with other volatile agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pleasant smell allows gas induction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is less nausea and vomiting than with isoflurane&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is a fluorocarbon rather than a chlorofluorocarbon and does not worsen the&#xD;
           atmospheric ozone hole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important concern about sevoflurane is its effect on renal function due to breakdown&#xD;
      products. When sevoflurane is exposed to the carbon dioxide absorbents soda lime and baralyme&#xD;
      a vinyl breakdown product called Compound-A is formed. High dose exposure to Compound-A&#xD;
      alters kidney histology in rats. Some, but not all, studies have found that Compound-A&#xD;
      produces increases urinary secretion of renal tubule enzymes in humans. The clinical&#xD;
      importance of enzyme secretion is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most widely used indicator of renal function that has established clinical importance is&#xD;
      plasma creatinine concentration. No study of sevoflurane has shown that sevoflurane produces&#xD;
      greater increases in plasma creatinine concentration than other anaesthetic drugs. The Austin&#xD;
      Health Department of Anaesthesia has recently completed a study in cardiac anaesthesia that&#xD;
      included sevoflurane. We found that, comparing isoflurane, sevoflurane, and propofol, there&#xD;
      was no difference in creatinine change after surgery between the three groups. This study&#xD;
      will be published in Anesthesiology, the manuscript is attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fresh gas flow into an anaesthetic machine is the amount of oxygen, or oxygen and air, or&#xD;
      oxygen and nitrous oxide that flows into the anaesthetic circuit per minute. Moderate fresh&#xD;
      gas flows are around 3 l/min. Low fresh gas flows are around 1 l/min. Low fresh gas flows&#xD;
      have benefits for patients, the environment, and the hospital:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients lose less heat&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients lose less water&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is less environmental contamination with chlorofluorocarbons and nitrous oxide (a&#xD;
           green house gas).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lower anaesthetic costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At low fresh gas flows, patients are exposed to higher concentrations of Compound A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent multicentre study looked at creatinine changes after major surgery. This study found&#xD;
      no difference between isoflurane and sevoflurane with low fresh gas flows of 1 l/min.&#xD;
      Patients with pre-existing renal impairment were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative renal impairment increases the risk of clinically important deterioration of&#xD;
      renal function after surgery. Studies of changes in creatinine after sevoflurane have&#xD;
      included only a small number of patients with pre-existing renal impairment 10. None of these&#xD;
      small studies has shown that sevoflurane aggravates pre-existing renal impairment more than&#xD;
      other anaesthetic drugs. This includes a subgroup analysis in our Cardiac Anaesthesia study.&#xD;
      No study, however, has examined creatinine changes in those with pre-existing renal&#xD;
      impairment and with low fresh gas flow. This would expose those with increased risk of&#xD;
      further renal impairment to greater doses of Compound-A. From other research and our own, we&#xD;
      believe that sevoflurane would not affect renal function more than isoflurane in patients&#xD;
      with preexisting renal impairment receiving low flow anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question What are the post operative changes in serum creatinine after anaesthesia&#xD;
      with sevoflurane or isoflurane using fresh gas flows of 1 l/min in patients with&#xD;
      pre-operative renal impairment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study methods draw heavily on our previous study 7, copy attached. The study&#xD;
      design conforms to the Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study type Randomized, clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients for elective surgery who will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. need to stay at least one night&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. need general anaesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. have a pre-operative serum creatinine concentration greater than 130 umol/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient refuses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patient is less than 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The patient is on pre-operative dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The anaesthetist plans to use only regional or total intravenous anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Specific types of surgery: craniotomy, carotid, and cardiac.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruiting One of the investigators will recruit patients as soon as possible after the&#xD;
      patients are booked for surgery. We expect to enroll at least 3 patients per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment arms&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Isoflurane OR 2. Sevoflurane Anaesthesia maintenance will be with fresh gas flows of 1&#xD;
      l/min and inspired oxygen of 30% to 100% in nitrogen (oxygen/air) or nitrous oxide.&#xD;
      Individual anaesthetists will determine all other aspects of the peri-operative care&#xD;
      including fluid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random allocation Patients will be randomly allocated to receive isoflurane or sevoflurane.&#xD;
      Before the trial ARMC pharmacy staff will provide the allocation sequence using a table of&#xD;
      random numbers. Allocations will be kept in opaque envelopes by the trial coordinator.&#xD;
      Anaesthetists will be notified of the allocation to isoflurane or sevoflurane on the day of&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point The primary end point will be the highest change in serum creatinine from&#xD;
      before operation to the first three days postoperatively. Supporting data will be from the&#xD;
      highest creatinine and urea in the first three postoperative days. Patients leaving hospital&#xD;
      before 3 postoperative days will be included. Good clinical care for patients with renal&#xD;
      impairment includes a creatinine measurement on admission and at least one postoperative&#xD;
      creatinine measurement. The trial coordinator will oversee this. The data for this study will&#xD;
      be from clinically indicated tests. Specific blood tests for this study will not be needed.&#xD;
      Data will be collected from the ARMC clinical chemistry results. Data will be stored on&#xD;
      computer in a secure are of the ARMC Department of Anaesthesia in line with the Therapeutic&#xD;
      Goods Administration Guidelines for Good Clinical Research Practice in Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically important changes&#xD;
&#xD;
      When analysing the differences between the isoflurane and sevoflurane groups, two criteria&#xD;
      will need to be met for the changes in creatinine to be clinically important:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. at least one mean increase in creatinine will be greater than 45 umol/l above&#xD;
           pre-operative concentration AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the difference between the means will be greater than 20 umol/l. For example: The group&#xD;
           1 mean rises by 50 umol/l and the group 2 mean rises by 25 umol/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis Using a standard deviation of 50 umol/l from our Cardiac Anaesthesia trial&#xD;
      data, for a power of 0.90, alpha &lt; 0.05, to detect a 20 umol/l difference between 2 groups we&#xD;
      would need 270 patients. We estimate we would need two years to complete this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Statistical analysis Data will be collected and analysed by investigators&#xD;
      blinded to the drug allocation. Statistical analysis will be by parametric tests if data are&#xD;
      normally distributed. Otherwise equivalent non-parametric tests will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistics will be the point estimate for the difference between the isoflurane and&#xD;
      sevoflurane increases in creatinine, the 95% confidence interval for the point estimate, and&#xD;
      the p value from an unpaired Student's t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional analysis will be an estimate of the proportions of patients in the isoflurane&#xD;
      and sevoflurane groups who have a postoperative creatinine change greater than 45 umol/l. The&#xD;
      statistics will be the point estimate for the difference in the proportions, the 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval for the point estimate, and the p value from a Chi square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supporting statistics will be from the point estimates for the difference between the peak&#xD;
      creatinine and urea, the 95% confidence interval for the point estimates, and the p values&#xD;
      from unpaired Student's t-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events. In addition to usual clinical care, patients in this study will have added&#xD;
      surveillance of their clinical chemistry results. Important changes will be passed on to the&#xD;
      surgical units caring for the patient. The investigators will notify the ARMC Human Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee of any death or serious morbidity of patients enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of the project For this large trial, with a simple design, our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that sevoflurane will not produce greater increases in creatinine than isoflurane in patients&#xD;
      with preexisting renal impairment. For this project an unequivocal finding would be that the&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals for the differences between the isoflurane and sevoflurane groups&#xD;
      did not include clinically important differences and that any differences that were found had&#xD;
      a p value of greater than 0.05. Unequivocal findings would lead us to two conclusions: (1)&#xD;
      that it is highly unlikely that sevoflurane has clinically important adverse renal effects,&#xD;
      and (2) that sevoflurane is safe to use with low fresh gas flows in patients with preexisting&#xD;
      renal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of sevoflurane and low fresh gas flows are discussed in the introduction. A&#xD;
      finding of no adverse renal effects would provide high quality evidence supporting the safety&#xD;
      of using sevoflurane and low fresh gas flows in patients with preexisting renal impairment.&#xD;
