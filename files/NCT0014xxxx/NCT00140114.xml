      Misoprostol (Cytotec®) is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog that has been marketed in the&#xD;
      United States since 1988 as a gastric cytoprotective agent. In contradistinction to&#xD;
      prostaglandin E2 preparations (dinoprostone, Prepidil, Cervidil), misoprostol is inexpensive&#xD;
      and available in scored tablets that can be broken and inserted vaginally. Despite a focused&#xD;
      campaign by the manufacturer to curtail its use in obstetric practice, misoprostol has, over&#xD;
      the past several years, gained widespread acceptance as both a labor induction and a cervical&#xD;
      ripening agent. Such off-label indication has been endorsed by the American College of&#xD;
      Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other medical bodies. Recently, FDA approved a new label&#xD;
      for the use of cytotec during pregnancy which removed pregnancy as a contraindication for its&#xD;
      use. Vaginal administration seems to be more efficacious than when given orally, although&#xD;
      there is the worry of uterine tachysystole and hyperstimulation with vaginal doses &gt; 50-µg.&#xD;
      The use of sublingual misoprostol for cervical ripening at term was recently investigated in&#xD;
      two studies that compared it to the oral route, on the assumption that the sublingual route&#xD;
      would have the higher efficacy of the vaginal route by avoiding the first pass effects of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal and hepatic systems, while having lower hyperstimulation rates by avoiding&#xD;
      the direct effects on the cervix. In addition, the sublingual route would combine an easier&#xD;
      administration with the added advantage of no restriction of mobility after administration.&#xD;
      There has been no previous report in the literature comparing the use of misoprostol given&#xD;
      sublingually to that given vaginally for the induction of labor at term. Our aim is to&#xD;
      compare efficacy, safety and patient satisfaction with misoprostol given vaginally (the&#xD;
      current standard) to that given sublingually.&#xD;

      Misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog, has been given both orally and vaginally&#xD;
      for induction of labor in the third trimester.1 Vaginal misoprostol has been shown to be more&#xD;
      efficacious than oral misoprostol in equivalent doses,2 although there is the worry of&#xD;
      uterine tachysystole and hyperstimulation with vaginal doses of 50 µg or higher.2-4 The&#xD;
      higher efficacy after vaginal administration may be explained by the pharmacokinetics of the&#xD;
      drug. Zeiman et al5 showed that the systemic bioavailability of vaginally administered&#xD;
      misoprostol is 3 times higher than that after oral administration. Plasma concentrations of&#xD;
      its metabolite, misoprostol acid, peak one to two hours after vaginal application as compared&#xD;
      with the peak seen 30 minutes following oral administration, and although peak levels are&#xD;
      lower with the vaginal route, they are sustained longer and overall exposure to the drug is&#xD;
      increased, perhaps because of the presystemic gastrointestinal or hepatic metabolism that&#xD;
      occurs with the oral route. An additional explanation for the higher efficacy could be that&#xD;
      there is a direct effect on the cervix that initiates the physiologic events that lead to&#xD;
      increased uterine contractility.6 However, there seems to be a trend toward patient&#xD;
      preference for the oral route. The sublingual route of administration has not been reported&#xD;
      in the literature prior to 2001. Since then and partly because of issues relating to patient&#xD;
      preference, investigators started studying the sublingual route of administration of&#xD;
      misoprostol. In theory, the sublingual route could mimic vaginal administration&#xD;
      pharmacokinetically, although there have been no such reported studies on this route of&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is speculated that sublingual misoprostol could combine the higher efficacy of the vaginal&#xD;
      route by avoiding gastrointestinal and hepatic metabolism, but it could have a more&#xD;
      restrained effect on uterine contractility by avoiding direct effects on both the uterus and&#xD;
      cervix. Therefore, in theory, the sublingual route may have lower hyperstimulation rates and&#xD;
      would have the advantage of a less invasive administration and lack of restriction of&#xD;
      mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many studies have been published on the use of sublingual misoprostol for medical&#xD;
      abortion in the first and second trimesters, 7-11, only two studies (by the same group) have&#xD;
      compared sublingual to oral misoprostol, in different doses.12,13 The 50-µg dose was chosen&#xD;
      because it is the dose most commonly used orally and vaginally in various studies reported in&#xD;
      the literature.3,14 To the best of our knowledge, no study comparing sublingual to vaginal&#xD;
      misoprostol for labor induction at term has been previously published in the literature.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study, when completed will provide evidence on the relative effect and safety&#xD;
      profile of different routes of administration of misoprostol for labor induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy of a 50-µg sublingual dose of misoprostol&#xD;
      administered at 4-hour intervals with an equivalent dose regimen administered vaginally in&#xD;
      women admitted for induction of labor for a medical or obstetric indication at term. In&#xD;
      addition, we want to assess the safety profile and patient acceptability of the 2 modes of&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that the sublingual route of administration of misoprostol is as&#xD;
      effective as the vaginal route for induction of labor at term and is more acceptable to&#xD;
      patients as compared to vaginal misoprostol.&#xD;
