  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether telmisartan and/or a low-glycemic index&#xD;
      diet are effective in reducing intra-myocellular lipid (muscle fat) content.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome currently affects over 20% of the adult population in Canada. Patients&#xD;
      with abdominal obesity are at markedly increased risk for diabetes and heart disease. Recent&#xD;
      studies have shown that decreased sensitivity to insulin (insulin resistance), a hallmark of&#xD;
      the metabolic syndrome, is related to increased storage of fat in muscle cells (muscle fat).&#xD;
      Several recent studies indicate that blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may improve&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity and prevent the development of type 2 diabetes. Other data suggests that&#xD;
      this effect may be due to the effect of RAS blockade on the recruitment and growth of adipose&#xD;
      tissue. The primary aim of this study is therefore to explore the role of angiotensin II in&#xD;
      the development of insulin resistance. Specifically, we will examine the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying the putative anti-diabetic effect of RAS blockade by examining the effect of&#xD;
      angiotensin receptor blockade on muscle fat content in individuals with the abdominal&#xD;
      obesity. This study will therefore test the hypothesis that treatment with the angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor blocker telmisartan (Micardis®) will reduce muscle fat, thereby improving insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity in people with abdominal obesity, with or without additional features of the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome. A number of dietary factors can also affect insulin sensitivity and may&#xD;
      influence muscle fat. Recent studies suggest that increasing the content of low-glycemic&#xD;
      foods (carbohydrates which are less easily digested), can improve insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      lipid profile in patients with insulin resistance. A second aim of this study is therefore to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that a low-glycemic diet will reduce muscle fat, thereby improving&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity in this population.&#xD;
