  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with a type of cancer called carcinoma of unknown primary site&#xD;
      (CUP), meaning that the site of the body where the tumor has originated is not clear.&#xD;
      Currently, carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP) accounts for about 5% of all newly&#xD;
      diagnosed malignancies. The stage of the tumor is such that it is not treatable by surgery.&#xD;
      Currently, the standard treatment for such a type of cancer at that stage is chemotherapy.&#xD;
      However, the overall prognosis for patients with metastatic CUP remains poor, even if treated&#xD;
      with conventional chemotherapy. Through ongoing research at medical centers around the world,&#xD;
      doctors are trying to improve on the presently available chemotherapy regimens. The purpose&#xD;
      of the investigators' study is similar: it is trying to determine whether a combination of&#xD;
      three chemotherapy drugs - carboplatin, gemcitabine, and capecitabine - will improve the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with metastatic CUP. The reason the investigators are interested in the&#xD;
      above combination of chemotherapy agents is that each one of them is already used in patients&#xD;
      with a variety of specific tumors, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      colon cancer, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will help determine whether the combination of carboplatin, gemcitabine&#xD;
      and capecitabine can be used and is effective in patients with carcinoma of unknown primary&#xD;
      site.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP) accounts for approximately 5% of all newly diagnosed&#xD;
      malignancies. The overall prognosis for patients with CUP remains poor, with median survival&#xD;
      less than one year with modern chemotherapy combinations and virtually no long-term&#xD;
      survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been recognized that patients with CUP represent a heterogeneous group of tumors.&#xD;
      Managing patients with CUP requires a complete medical history, careful consideration of&#xD;
      findings on physical exam, targeted radiologic studies and pathologic analysis of biopsy&#xD;
      and/or surgical specimens. Within this heterogeneous group there exist at least four subsets&#xD;
      of patients with CUP, that based on clinicopathologic features are treated with regimens&#xD;
      which have demonstrated efficacy in tumors originating in the most likely primary site of&#xD;
      that CUP; squamous carcinoma involving mid or high levels of cervical lymph nodes, women with&#xD;
      isolated axillary adenopathy containing adenocarcinoma, women with a predominant presentation&#xD;
      of peritoneal carcinomatosis and young men with extragonadal germ cell syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, a majority of patients with CUP do not fall into any of the above subsets and&#xD;
      these represent a therapeutic dilemma, as there is no single regimen to date that has shown&#xD;
      significant activity or has resulted in prolonged survival for these patients with&#xD;
      particularly poor prognosis. Thus, new therapeutic combinations need to be investigated for&#xD;
      treatment of these patients with CUP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platinum compounds have been the cornerstone of chemotherapy regimens for a wide variety of&#xD;
      solid tumors, including lung, urothelial, head and neck, ovarian and endometrial carcinomas,&#xD;
      as well as testicular carcinomas. Cisplatin and its analog carboplatin are currently used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy combinations to treat CUP. Carboplatin has fewer non-hematologic side effects&#xD;
      compared to cisplatin including less nausea and vomiting, peripheral neuropathy,&#xD;
      nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity making it an attractive agent to combine with other drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, new agents active in solid malignancies have been developed. Gemcitabine is&#xD;
      one such agent. It is a deoxycytidine analogue structurally related to cytosine arabinoside.&#xD;
      Gemcitabine is activated by deoxycytidine kinase in three steps of phosphorylation into&#xD;
      difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate, which when incorporated into DNA, leads to chain&#xD;
      termination. Gemcitabine has been shown to have activity in pancreatic, breast, non-small&#xD;
      cell lung carcinomas as well as in carcinomas of unknown primary site. Because of its mild&#xD;
      toxicity profile, gemcitabine has been used in combination with other chemotherapy agents.&#xD;
      There is evidence of in vitro and in vivo synergy between gemcitabine and the platinum&#xD;
      compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine is an orally administered fluoropyrimidine that undergoes a three-step&#xD;
      conversion into 5-FU, with pharmacokinetics that mimic low dose continuous infusion 5-FU. The&#xD;
      oral formulation allows for convenient continuous therapy, avoiding a need for central venous&#xD;
      catheters and external infusion pumps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final step of conversion of capecitabine into 5-FU is catalyzed by thymidine&#xD;
      phosphorylase (TP), an enzyme which has been shown to be over expressed in colorectal tumors.&#xD;
      This selective tumor activation has been demonstrated to lead to higher concentrations of&#xD;
      5-FU in tumor cells as compared to normal tissue, suggesting tumor targeting by the oral&#xD;
      drug. Capecitabine was initially approved by the FDA for treatment of refractory breast&#xD;
      carcinoma and has shown activity in metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Capecitabine is an&#xD;
      attractive agent for use in combination chemotherapy due to its non-overlapping toxicity&#xD;
      profile with many agents and lack of hematologic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine has been combined with 5-FU, and may enhance the activity of 5-FU in vivo.&#xD;
      Gemcitabine is an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme needed for synthesis of&#xD;
      deoxynucleotides, and 5-FU interferes with dTTP synthesis by inhibition of thymidylate&#xD;
      synthase (TS). It is plausible that concomitant administration of gemcitabine and&#xD;
      capecitabine, may result in increased cytotoxicity by reducing intracellular dTTP thru two&#xD;
      different mechanisms, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and repair. Platinum compounds lead&#xD;
      to cell death by forming DNA adducts and causing double strand breaks. By inhibiting DNA&#xD;
      synthesis and repair, both gemcitabine and 5-FU analogues could potentiate the activity of&#xD;
      carboplatin. These interactions may underlie the clinical synergism that has been observed&#xD;
      with platinum/5-FU and platinum/gemcitabine combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to combine carboplatin, gemcitabine and capecitabine as a palliative treatment for&#xD;
      patients with CUP. Programs evaluating the incorporation of newer chemotherapy agents into&#xD;
      combinations are reasonable in an attempt to improve outcome in patients with CUP. In&#xD;
      addition to anticipated anti-tumor activity, the proposed combination provides a convenient&#xD;
      schedule of brief intravenous treatment, the use of the oral agent capecitabine, and a&#xD;
      toxicity profile which is expected to be mild, characteristics which are important in&#xD;
      palliative treatment programs.&#xD;
