      Purposes of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the prevalence of female sexual dysfunctions among Italian general&#xD;
           population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine which sexual domains are more frequently compromised&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate which of the factors we took into consideration are more frequently&#xD;
           associated with FSD&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female Sexual Dysfunctions (FSD) are a relatively new field of study as are possible&#xD;
      interventions. Until recently FSD were regarded as only a psychological matter and&#xD;
      consequently the exact definition of the problem was to some extent controversial. Things&#xD;
      have changed and now we refer to FSD according to the classification decided during the&#xD;
      International Consensus development Conference on FSD (Basson et al, 2000). There are 5 major&#xD;
      categories of FSD: Sexual Desire Disorders, Sexual Arousal Disorders, Orgasmic Disorders,&#xD;
      Sexual Pain Disorders. A woman can be considered sexually dysfunctional if she has one or&#xD;
      more of these disorders and if she feels uncomfortable about them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies completed abroad show the prevalence of FSD to be extremely high: from 38% to&#xD;
      63% of women interviewed about their sexuality have complaints about it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, in Italy there are no studies showing the prevalence of FSD among healthy women. We&#xD;
      have no reasons to think that the results will demonstrate lower percentages than those found&#xD;
      abroad indicating therefore a high number of women complaining about their sexuality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define the prevalence of alteration in sexual function we decided to use a questionnaire&#xD;
      that would explore all the area included in the definition of FSD. We chose the Female Sexual&#xD;
      Function Index (Rosen et al, 2000). This is commonly recognized as a reliable and specific&#xD;
      instrument. Moreover there is a validated Italian translation of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women coming to the Gynecologic Clinic for routine examination represent in our opinion a&#xD;
      realistic sample of Italian female population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete anonymity will be guaranteed for the entire study to every woman filling out the&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study we will try to answer the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the prevalence of FSD among healthy Italian women?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which domains of sexuality are most frequently compromised?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which among the following factors effect the most sexual functions?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Menopause?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stable relationship?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration and quality of relationship?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical background?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reasons for coming to the gynecologic clinic?&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to answer these questions the study will be organized as follow&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Request for approval of the study from the local board&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distribution of the FSFI Questionnaire to female outpatient of the Bologna University&#xD;
           Gynecologic Clinic. We are planning to hand ouas many questionnaires as needed to have a&#xD;
           minimum of 500 questionnaires completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registration and analysis of the data from the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FSFI is a multidimensional questionnaire organized into 19 multiple-choice questions and&#xD;
      divided in 6 domains which explore sexual desire, arousal, vaginal lubrication, satisfaction&#xD;
      and sexual pain. It contains questions about sexual life in the previous 4 weeks. Each answer&#xD;
      is given a score between 0 and 5. The final total score gives the result of the test, when&#xD;
      it's lower than 26.5 (Wiegel et al, 2005) it suggests a possible sexual dysfunction. FSFI is&#xD;
      easily understandable and the time required to complete it is less than 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study the FSFI Questionnaire is utilized in conjunction with anonymous questions about&#xD;
      age, marital/partner status, duration of relationship, current and past clinical complains,&#xD;
      reason for coming to the Gynecologic Clinic and menopause. These will give us the instruments&#xD;
      to evaluate whether these factors can influence the presence of FSD and which domains they&#xD;
      affect the most.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will be handled by medical staff. The research subjects will be reassured&#xD;
      about the anonymity of the study, will be invited to leave the completed FSFI in the&#xD;
      collection boxes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION Selecting women coming for routing testing/exams at the&#xD;
      Gynecology Clinic gives us the chance to have our questionnaires completed by a broad sample&#xD;
      of women. At least in Italy, where the National Health System guarantees an easy and&#xD;
      affordable access to sanitary services, women of all ages and social classes periodically&#xD;
      come to clinic to have their gynecologic exam or pap test done. Therefore, even if selected&#xD;
      inside a clinic our female sample can reasonably be considered a realistic example of the&#xD;
      general female population.&#xD;
