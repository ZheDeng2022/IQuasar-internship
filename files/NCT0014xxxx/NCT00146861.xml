  <brief_summary>

      This study will compare how two different sensors inside the pacemaker may affect patients'&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LIFE Study will estimate the prevalence of CI among a general sample of pacemaker&#xD;
      patients and compare changes in quality of life and physical activity between patients&#xD;
      randomized to receive rate response driven by either blended sensor or accelerometer. Changes&#xD;
      in chronotropic response between CI patients randomized to either blended sensor or&#xD;
      accelerometer will be compared. A sub-study will evaluate changes in functional capacity&#xD;
      between CI patients randomized to either blended sensor or accelerometer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who meet current INSIGNIATM Plus pacemaker indications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who sign and date a Patient Informed Consent prior to device implant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who remain in the clinical care of the enrolling physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose previous pacemaker had a minute ventilation sensor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have neuromuscular, orthopedic, or vascular disability that prevents&#xD;
             normal walking (e.g., intermittent claudication, arthritis, residual stroke weakness,&#xD;
             need for a wheelchair or walker)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in whom a symptom-limited exercise protocol is thought to be dangerous&#xD;
             because of coronary artery disease or other cardiac disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled arrhythmias (e.g., chronic atrial fibrillation, frequent/persistent&#xD;
             atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, or patients with ablate and pace whose&#xD;
             arrhythmia continues to be uncontrolled)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose medical condition is expected to preclude the use of the&#xD;
             protocol-required primary pacing mode (i.e., DDD or DDDR)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose life expectancy is less than 12-months due to other medical conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have or who are indicated for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator&#xD;
             (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have active chronic leads that are either single-pass VDD, unipolar&#xD;
             ventricular and atrial, non-IS-1, and non-3.2mm UNLESS the leads are replaced with&#xD;
             bipolar leads that are IS-1/3.2mm compatible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently enrolled in another investigational study that would&#xD;
             directly impact the treatment or outcome of the current study. Each instance should be&#xD;
             brought to the attention of Guidant's Clinical Application Research Studies (CARS)&#xD;
             group to determine eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are younger than 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are mentally incompetent and cannot sign a Patient Informed Consent or&#xD;
             participate in the study&#xD;
