  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The advent of new antiretroviral agents, in particular Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy&#xD;
      (HAART), spectacularly reduced HIV-associated morbidity and mortality. However, new&#xD;
      complications have appeared in HIV-infected patients treated by with HAART such as&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and related cardiovascular complications&#xD;
      including acute coronary syndromes, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke have been&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A linear association has been proved between increased intima-media thickness of the common&#xD;
      carotid artery (CCA-IMT), aortic stiffness (pulse wave velocity [aPWV]) and incidence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events suggesting that IMT and aPWV could be considered as an early marker of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. The progression of IMT has been shown to be predictive of cardiovascular&#xD;
      events. Case control and longitudinal studies but not all have suggested an increase CCA-IMT&#xD;
      in HIV-infected patients under HAART compared with non-HIV infected patients with different&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to examine the effects of pravastatin on CCA-IMT and aortic&#xD;
      stiffness in dyslipidemic HIV-infected patients receiving HAART by using a high-resolution&#xD;
      echotracking system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the pravastatin group were consecutively recruited in four department of&#xD;
      infectious diseases if they fulfilled the following criteria : (1) HIV-infected treated with&#xD;
      HAART for &gt; 12 months 2) with dyslipidemia, defined as fasting serum LDL cholesterol &gt; 160&#xD;
      mg/dL before initiation of pravastatin, (3) treated with pravastatin &gt; 12 months and one more&#xD;
      coronary risk factor. The patients in the control group were selected consecutively in the&#xD;
      same departments among 1) HIV-infected patients treated with HAART &gt; 12 months 2) fasting&#xD;
      serum LDL cholesterol &gt; 160 mg/dL 3) without lipid-lowering drugs and one more coronary risk&#xD;
      factor. Cases and control patients were matched for age, gender and tobacco consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using data from Mercie et al., inclusion of 42 patients in pravastatin and control groups was&#xD;
      the minimum sample size needed for detection of a 6.5% difference in CCA-IMT, in a two-sided&#xD;
      test (a = 0.05, b = 0.20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol of the study, sponsored by the French Society of Cardiology was approved by the&#xD;
      Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects in Biomedical Research of Pitié-Salpétrière&#xD;
      University hospital in Paris. Written informed consent to participate in the study was&#xD;
      obtained from each patient.&#xD;
