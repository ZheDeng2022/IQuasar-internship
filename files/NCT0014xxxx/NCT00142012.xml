  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this initiative is to reduce the prevalence and occurrence of obesity&#xD;
      and increase the remission of obesity in children and adolescents through implementation of a&#xD;
      Comprehensive School Nutrition Policy designed to promote changes in the school environment&#xD;
      that will reinforce students' development of healthy eating and physical activity patterns&#xD;
      inside and outside of school.&#xD;

      The proposed research aims to evaluate the effects of a school-based nutrition policy&#xD;
      initiative on prevalence, incidence and remission of overweight (BMI &gt; 95th percentile). It&#xD;
      is a partnership between the Food Trust, the School District of Philadelphia and the&#xD;
      University of Pennsylvania. Participants are approximately 1500 students from ten schools in&#xD;
      grades four through eight. Half of the schools were randomized to a comprehensive School&#xD;
      Nutrition Policy Initiative (SNPI) based on CDC's Guidelines to Promote Lifelong Healthy&#xD;
      Eating. The SNPI is a community-based intervention administered by the Comprehensive School&#xD;
      Nutrition Policy Task Force that is comprised of 40 individuals representing the public and&#xD;
      private sectors. The goal of the SNPI is to change the school environment to: support healthy&#xD;
      eating, increase physical activity, and decrease the prevalence of childhood overweight and&#xD;
      diet-related diseases. The remaining study participants are in five control schools, matched&#xD;
      for ethnicity, SES, and type of food service. Most students are African American and qualify&#xD;
      for free and reduced meals at school (household income &lt; 185% of the poverty level adjusted&#xD;
      for household size). Assessments of weight, height, intake, activity, inactivity and eating&#xD;
      disorder symptomatology are being conducted at baseline and 1 and 2 years.&#xD;
