  <brief_summary>

      Objective: Our overall objective is to test the hypothesis that the health of children with&#xD;
      chronic respiratory symptoms or chronic exposures to environmental hazards can be improved&#xD;
      through a combination of standard home maintenance interventions and a set of interim&#xD;
      controls and targeted repair interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bi-State Kansas City Enhanced Enterprise Community (KCEEC) is one of pervasive poverty,&#xD;
      unemployment and general distress. This same area is also an area of poor environmental&#xD;
      health with a disproportionate number of children with lead poisoning, asthma, and home&#xD;
      injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In May 2001, the Metropolitan (Kansas City) Health Council released a report urging the&#xD;
      implementation of strategies to address this growing concern. They stated, &quot;Environmental&#xD;
      assessments and interventions in homes, schools, and workplaces are needed to promote indoor&#xD;
      air quality and thereby help prevent asthma and asthma flare-ups,&quot; in combination with the&#xD;
      need for, &quot;trained community-based peer educators needed to work with families/communities in&#xD;
      areas of high asthma incidence,&quot;. The need for major rehabilitation is echoed in the 1999&#xD;
      Consolidated Plan, as well as by most community development and housing officials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The KC CERT project responds to these concerns by demonstrating low-cost, replicable&#xD;
      intervention strategies that can have an impact on the health and safety of children and&#xD;
      their families. By providing training and employment opportunities to residents in high-risk&#xD;
      areas to assess, prevent and remediate environmental hazards, this project promotes sustained&#xD;
      systematic change within the KCEEC.&#xD;

      This study is an observational study. It will be managed by a project director for HHN and&#xD;
      the Environmental Health Program Manager for CMH. Following enrollment in the study, a health&#xD;
      assessment focusing on specific respiratory problems and lead exposure will be performed.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects must be between the ages of 2 and 17 years of age, and stay in the home a&#xD;
      minimum of 4 nights per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The home environment will also be assessed using a specific set of on-site and laboratory&#xD;
      sampling and analyses. Once study analyses are complete, a report will be written and&#xD;
      provided to the family. The health and home assessments will be used in the presentation of&#xD;
      in-home education related to specific strategies for creating and maintaining a safe and&#xD;
      healthy home. Once the initial assessments are complete, the family will receive a set of&#xD;
      standard and targeted interventions that together total no more than $2000 in value. If the&#xD;
      house is in need of more than $2000 worth of interventions, the family would not qualify to&#xD;
      participate in this study and would be offered alternative resources through the HHN, and the&#xD;
      UMKC Center for the City, Home Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interim controls recommended in the assessment will be provided within 60 days of the&#xD;
      in-home education. These interim controls include a set of standard interventions that will&#xD;
      be provided in all homes and, in addition, a set of site-specific or targeted interventions&#xD;
      based on the assessment findings. Six months after the interventions have been implemented,&#xD;
      the child's health and the home will be assessed using the same instruments, procedures,&#xD;
      questionnaires, and the same number and type of samples as in the initial assessment will be&#xD;
      taken. This will ensure consistency and quality in data gathering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Healthy Homes Network will recruit participants from community physicians and clinics,&#xD;
      and organizations affiliated with the HHN including health departments and housing&#xD;
      authorities, the CMH Emergency Room, the CMH Allergy Clinic, other CMH primary care clinics.&#xD;
      HHN will recruit through advertising in the media if necessary (see proposed ad included),&#xD;
      but the CMH name or LOGO will not appear in the ad. Subjects will be referred to CMH for&#xD;
      health evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Sample Size: Total study: 200 CMH only: 200&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that qualify for the study will have one of the following health conditions:&#xD;
      persistent asthma as defined by NHLBI guidelines, chronic respiratory symptoms, and/or have&#xD;
      lead levels equal to or above 15 micrograms per deciliter. They must be between the ages of 2&#xD;
      and 17 years of age, and stay in the home a minimum of 4 nights per week and, they should&#xD;
      reside in the KCEEC (Defined as the city limits of Kansas City Kansas or Kansas City&#xD;
      Missouri). They will also have lived in the same housing, either rental or self-owned, for at&#xD;
      least 6 months and have a reasonable expectation of remaining in this housing for at least&#xD;
      one additional year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To qualify for the intervention phase of the study done by HHN, the home must have no more&#xD;
      than $2000 estimated intervention costs. Examples of houses that would not qualify include: A&#xD;
      house that needs a new roof, a house with extensive amounts of flaking lead paint, a house&#xD;
      with significant structural problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any children who do not meet the age and residency requirements. Any home with more than&#xD;
      $2000 worth of maintenance and repair problems. Any home with emergent, life threatening&#xD;
      conditions. Children with other chronic diseases (leukemia, diabetes etc) will be referred&#xD;
      through the HHN and CMH to appropriate medical services, agencies, organizations and other&#xD;
      community resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is only one study group (the immediate intervention group). In this group, the child's&#xD;
      health will be evaluated, the home environmental health will be assessed and reported to the&#xD;
      family, and the family will receive in-home education. Within 60 days of the in-home&#xD;
      education, a series of interim controls for the home will be provided by HHN using a specific&#xD;
      set of standard interventions and a site-specific set of targeted interventions based on the&#xD;
      assessment findings. The home will be checked to ensure the interventions were properly done.&#xD;
      After 6 months, the child's health will be reevaluated and the environmental health of the&#xD;
      home will be assessed a second time to evaluate the impact on the child's health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observations/Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal 1: Demonstrate improvement in overall health and chronic symptoms in children&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre/Post Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
