  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hydrocephalus (secondary or idiopathic) is a condition characterized by dilatation of the&#xD;
      lateral and third ventricles, and often associated with increased intracranial pressure&#xD;
      (ICP). We hypothesize that either the ventricle dilatation or the increased ICP may cause&#xD;
      disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, resulting in different degrees of&#xD;
      hypopituitarism. The goal of this study is to determine the prevalence of hypopituitarism in&#xD;
      adult patients with hydrocephalus.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Johns Hopkins Adult Hydrocephalus Program evaluates approximately 250 new patients per&#xD;
      year for hydrocephalus and associated disorders, resulting in the new diagnosis of&#xD;
      hydrocephalus in about 100 patients annually. After treatment with either shunt surgery or&#xD;
      third ventriculostomy, virtually all patients are followed on a regular basis by physicians&#xD;
      in the program (Dr. Michael Williams, neurologist, and Dr. Daniele Rigamonti, neurosurgeon,&#xD;
      both involved in this project).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients represent an ideal cohort to study the effect of hydrocephalus on anterior&#xD;
      pituitary function. In addition, as data on intracranial pressure is available for all of&#xD;
      them, evaluation of pituitary function would allow us to determine whether the level of&#xD;
      intracranial pressure correlates with the likelihood of pituitary failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to study 20 subjects of both sexes with NPH, aged 18-80 years over a period of 18&#xD;
      months. They will be recruited by direct advertising among the patients cared for by the&#xD;
      Adult Hydrocephalus Program. Patients with hydrocephalus will be studied twice (6-12 months&#xD;
      apart) whether or not they undergo shunting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROTOCOL:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In addition to the comprehensive neurological history and physical examination, further&#xD;
           history will be obtained, with particular attention to sexual function and libido in&#xD;
           males and menstrual history in women of fertile age, will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After overnight fasting, an indwelling catheter will be inserted in a peripheral vein.&#xD;
           Blood for baseline hormonal evaluation (8-9 AM) including: serum free T4 (FT4), TSH,&#xD;
           cortisol, GH, IGF-1, prolactin, LH, FSH, Estradiol (in females) and total testosterone&#xD;
           (in males). Menstruating females will be studied during follicular phase. Serum IGF-1,&#xD;
           testosterone, estradiol and gonadotropin levels will be interpreted in accordance with&#xD;
           the patients' age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All subjects will undergo GH stimulation test by combination of GHRH (1 mcg/kg bolus)&#xD;
           and arginine (0.5 gm/kg over 30', maximal dose 30 gm). Blood will be dawn at time 30',&#xD;
           60', 90' and 120' after the GHRH bolus injection. The GHRH+arginine test is the most&#xD;
           widely used test to determine GH reserve in adults, independently from their age (14).&#xD;
           Normal response is a peak serum GH &gt; 9 ng/ml. Both GHRH and arginine are FDA-approved&#xD;
           for this purpose, and have no significant side effects (GHRH may cause transient itching&#xD;
           and flushing).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. An AM cortisol below 5 mcg/dl will be considered diagnostic of adrenal insufficiency.&#xD;
           Conversely, a value above 15 mcg/dl will be interpreted as indicating normal adrenal&#xD;
           function. For serum cortisol values between 5 and 15 mcg/dl, subjects will be studied on&#xD;
           a separate day by low-dose (1 mcg) ACTH stimulation test. Blood for serum cortisol&#xD;
           measurement will be obtained at baseline and after 30' from ACTH injection. The low-dose&#xD;
           ACTH stimulation test is safe, easy to perform, has high sensitivity for partial&#xD;
           secondary adrenal insufficiency, and has been recently used in patient with TBI. Normal&#xD;
           response is a serum cortisol at 30' &gt; 18.0 mcg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have shunt surgery will undergo a second study of pituitary function not earlier&#xD;
      than 6 months and no later than 1 year from the procedure. We will identify the degree of&#xD;
      clinical improvement by documenting change in gait with the Tinetti Gait Assessment Tool, and&#xD;
      change in dementia with the Mini-Mental-Status exam. If there is sufficient sample size in&#xD;
      the clinically improved and unimproved patients, we will compare between-group results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have been on systemic glucocorticoids (GC) for longer than 3 weeks during the&#xD;
      previous 12 months will be excluded, as GC may cause suppression of hypothalamic-adrenal&#xD;
      axis. In subjects who are on phenytoin, unbound T4 will be measured by equilibrium dialysis,&#xD;
      as phenytoin may interfere with direct unbound T4 measurement. Subjects already on&#xD;
      L-thyroxine replacement will be excluded.&#xD;
