      Aim/Background: This study aims to investigate the necessity and efficacy of a hepatitis B&#xD;
      virus (HBV) vaccine booster in children after liver transplantation. A universal mass&#xD;
      vaccination program of HBV was launched for 20 years in Taiwan. The coverage rate is high and&#xD;
      the effect is great. The carrier rate of the population under vaccine coverage decreased from&#xD;
      10-15% to &lt; 1%. In Taiwan, most children who receive organ transplantation were vaccinated&#xD;
      with HBV vaccine in infancy and well before the transplantation procedure. This vaccination&#xD;
      background information on Taiwanese children is quite unique and not similar to the other&#xD;
      countries in the world. The antibody generated by the vaccine usually wanes after a certain&#xD;
      period even in normal subjects, let alone in subjects who receive organ transplantation and&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents after transplantation. At present, Taiwan is still an HBV&#xD;
      hyperendemic area and the risk of exposure to HBV cannot be overlooked. Should children be&#xD;
      given a booster dose of HBV vaccine after transplantation? And how about the immunogenicity&#xD;
      of this booster dose in these immunocompromised hosts? If these children cannot obtain an&#xD;
      adequate antibody titer, will the risk of HBV infection increase? This study is designed to&#xD;
      answer these questions. As a pediatric hepatologist, the author's routine work is to take&#xD;
      care of children who underwent liver transplantation. To take advantage of this, the&#xD;
      investigators decided to study the efficacy and necessity of HBV booster vaccine in these&#xD;
      patients. However, the results of this study should be able to be applied to any kind of&#xD;
      solid organ transplanted patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs) titer will be checked in patients who&#xD;
      received liver transplantation &gt; 1 year ago. If the titer is &lt; 10 IU/L, a booster dose will&#xD;
      be administered. The humoral (anti-HBs) and cellular immunity (by ELISPOT to assay T and B&#xD;
      cell specific proliferation) and cytokine assay will be done in these patients before and&#xD;
      after the booster dose. A three-year follow-up will be performed to monitor the HBV infection&#xD;
      in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results: The investigators expect for those who survive one year more after liver&#xD;
      transplantation to yield a relatively good response to HBV booster under adequate&#xD;
      immunosuppression.&#xD;

      The anti-HBs titer will be checked in the patients who received liver transplantation for &gt; 1&#xD;
      year. If the titer is &lt; 10 IU/L, a booster dose will be administered. The humoral (anti-HBs)&#xD;
      and cellular immunity (by ELISPOT to assay T and B cell specific proliferation) and cytokine&#xD;
      assay will be done in these patients before and after the booster dose. A three-year&#xD;
      follow-up will be performed to monitor the HBV infection in these patients.&#xD;
