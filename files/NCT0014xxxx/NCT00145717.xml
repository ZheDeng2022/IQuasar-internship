  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to see if plant sterols are effective at lowering blood cholesterol&#xD;
      levels in Chinese people. The study will be done with Chinese colleagues based at Peking&#xD;
      University in Beijing with whom our Institute has a well-established collaboration. The study&#xD;
      will be randomised, placebo-controlled and double-blind. The total study period for&#xD;
      participants will be an average of seven weeks comprised of a two-week placebo run-in period&#xD;
      and a five-week follow-up on randomised treatment. Randomised treatment will comprise either&#xD;
      placebo, low- or standard-dose plant sterol. The primary outcome for the study will be blood&#xD;
      cholesterol levels.&#xD;

      RESEARCH PLAN The study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with three&#xD;
      parallel groups, two assigned different doses of active treatment and one assigned placebo.&#xD;
      The total study period for participants will be an average of seven weeks comprised of a&#xD;
      two-week placebo treatment run-in period prior to randomisation and a five-week follow-up on&#xD;
      randomised treatment. An estimated 400 participants will be commenced on run-in with the&#xD;
      expectation that 300 (100 in each group) will go on to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY TREATMENTS Pre-randomisation open run-in phase: All potentially eligible participants&#xD;
      will commence a 10-20 days run-in period with the placebo milk tea administered twice daily.&#xD;
      This run-in period will help to identify before randomisation, those individuals who are&#xD;
      unlikely to tolerate the milk tea product or comply with the study follow up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post randomisation double-blind treatment phase: Participants that successfully complete the&#xD;
      run-in phase will be assigned at random to receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Milk tea containing a total of 2.3g of plant sterol each day administered in two divided&#xD;
           doses of 1.15g; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Milk tea containing a total of 1.5g of plant sterol each day administered in two divided&#xD;
           doses of 0.75g; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo milk tea containing no plant sterol. Blinding of participants and investigators&#xD;
           will be assured by providing all groups with their allocated treatment in packaging that&#xD;
           is identical except for a unique identifying number corresponding to the randomisation&#xD;
           code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2.3g/d treatment group compared to placebo group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1.5g/d treatment group compared to placebo group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  active treatment group (2.3g/d and 1.5g/d combined) compared to placebo group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2.3g/d treatment group compared to 1.5g/d treatment group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary: To establish the effects of the same intervention on total cholesterol&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
