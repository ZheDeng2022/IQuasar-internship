      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyse time to tumor progression in patients cystectomized for locally advanced&#xD;
           transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder, who are not suitable for&#xD;
           cisplatin-based chemotherapy (i.e. postoperative reduced renal function, advanced age).&#xD;
           Patients are randomized to receive either adjuvant gemcitabine immediately after radical&#xD;
           operation (treatment arm A) or no treatment (control arm B). Patients in the control arm&#xD;
           are to be treated with gemcitabine as soon as tumor progression becomes evident&#xD;
           clinically and/or radiologically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimation of time-specific survival probabilities irrespective of causes of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of toxicity and tolerability of gemcitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of survival experience of patients in the control arm beyond the time of&#xD;
           initiating chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of&#xD;
           Cancer [EORTC] Quality of Life Questionnaire [QLQ]-C30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled phase 3 two-arm study&#xD;
      using gemcitabine as a single agent in chemonaive cystectomy patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      TCC of the bladder in an adjuvant setting. The patients will receive the following treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A (treatment): gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 intravenously once a week for 2 weeks (days 1 and&#xD;
      8) followed by 1-week rest period. Repeat cycle on day 22. Maximum of 6 cycles. Begin&#xD;
      treatment until 3 months after radical operation (within first 6 weeks is recommended).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B (control): No immediate post-surgery treatment. Watchful waiting; treatment only&#xD;
      conditionally in case of progression with gemcitabine (dose and schedule as in arm A).&#xD;
