      This research project will focus on whether it is safe and effective to rely on donor cells&#xD;
      to prevent relapse of leukemia, lymphoma, or other blood cancer after bone marrow stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (SCT). For many patients with these conditions, a bone marrow transplant can be&#xD;
      the only chance for cure. The standard type of bone marrow transplant involves giving very&#xD;
      high-doses of chemotherapy and radiation to kill all the cancer cells followed by an infusion&#xD;
      of bone marrow stem cells from a relative who is a bone marrow match. After the transplant&#xD;
      the patient takes anti-rejection drugs for many months to prevent the donor's immune cells&#xD;
      from causing a severe reaction called Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD), which can even be&#xD;
      fatal. However, for some patients with certain types of high-risk cancer even this intense&#xD;
      treatment is not effective and the cancer relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is has been known for many years that some of the bone marrow cells from the donor can kill&#xD;
      cancer cells. Recently, it has been discovered that sometimes patients who relapse after a&#xD;
      bone marrow SCT can be cured by giving an infusion of donor white blood cells (called a donor&#xD;
      leukocyte infusion or DLI). By giving a DLI BEFORE a relapse happens, hopefully relapse can&#xD;
      be prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy given prior to a standard bone marrow&#xD;
      stem cell transplant can make a patient very sick and also increase the chance of getting&#xD;
      severe GVHD. In this research study we are going to rely mainly on the donor cells to kill&#xD;
      the cancer cells, and patients will receive dosages of chemotherapy that are lower than the&#xD;
      usual dosages. It is thought that this low intensity conditioning will make the transplant&#xD;
      safer without risking more relapses, however it is not know whether low intensity&#xD;
      conditioning is safer than standard conditioning.&#xD;
