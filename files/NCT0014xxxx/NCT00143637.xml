  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is focused at the dose response relation for office dust and such office dust&#xD;
      spiked with components from fungi known from damp buildings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of this study is to investigate if dust causes objective changes such as&#xD;
      changes of lung function, nasal geometry, inflammatory indicators in tears and nasal lavage,&#xD;
      tear film stability and cells at exposure levels relevant to indoor air. The controlled&#xD;
      exposure variable is air concentration of office dust spiked with Glucan to simulate a worse&#xD;
      case scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Confirm or support the causality between objective effects and exposures to dust&#xD;
      spiked with Glucan with focus on inflammatory responses. This is done by negation of the&#xD;
      hypothesis that no significant effects are found for the variables in question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 is to estimate the thresholds and slopes of the DR relation for effect measures which&#xD;
      show effects of exposures. At best the study will supply for each variable a zero response to&#xD;
      clean air and three non-zero responses to dust. Thresholds and slopes are estimated&#xD;
      graphically by linear regression or by an accumulated response model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 is a confirmation that atopic persons and histamine sensitive persons in nasal&#xD;
      provocation tests have different responses in the effect measures showing significant effects&#xD;
      of exposures to dust spiked with Glucan. Risk group status is therefore included in the&#xD;
      analyses of the main variables as explaining variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential additional aim 4: Chemical and biological characterization of the office dust used&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4 is an investigation of dose response relations for explorative measures, which in&#xD;
      previous investigations have showed indications of a dose response relation. For these no a&#xD;
      priory hypotheses exists and the analyses must be arranged ad hoc. The explaining variables&#xD;
      are exposure and risk group status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One challenge in investigations of unspecific effects caused by mixed exposures is that few&#xD;
      specific objective effects measures are available and subjective measures have to be&#xD;
      introduced. Therefore there is a need for developments of new objective measures of health&#xD;
      effects of air pollution. Some of these are related to new biomarkers of respiratory effects&#xD;
      in a bio-sample taken as condensed exhaled breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 5: Developments of new objective measures of health effects of air pollution. After the&#xD;
      experiment it will be investigated by logistic regression if a sensitivity index can be&#xD;
      established.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The basic procedure is an exposure experiment in which human subjects are exposed to&#xD;
      controlled variations of dust spiked with Glucan. Their responses are monitored before, after&#xD;
      minutes and hours of exposure and later the same evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of subjects are selected in a pre-investigation using strict selection and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. The two groups are atopic persons and responders to Histamine in a RSM&#xD;
      nasal provocation test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The groups are exposed under controlled conditions in a climate chamber at IMA to office dust&#xD;
      spiked with Glucan (same procedure and amount as in DAMOS) at clean air level (less than 20&#xD;
      micro-g/m3 (TSP) and at 150, 300 and 700 micro-g/m3 (TSP). In the pre-investigation and&#xD;
      during the exposure sessions a number of personal characteristics are measured or registered&#xD;
      to be used in the statistical analyses as explaining variables for the responses of the&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dust exposure will be characterized both though its size distribution and gravimetrically&#xD;
      using up-to-date analytical instruments. To optimise the exposures several pilot studies are&#xD;
      made. Only effects measures, which previously have shown clear indications of responses to&#xD;
      dust exposures, are included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timetable includes pre-investigations, two repetitions of the exposure design (run 1 and&#xD;
      2), analyses of the bio-samples, statistical analyses, and reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a main study and several additional work-packages, which will be activated&#xD;
      when funding become available.&#xD;
