  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human thyroglobulin (Tg) is the most sensitive biochemical marker for recurrence of&#xD;
      differentiated cancer (DTC), especially after the complete removal of thyroid tissue through&#xD;
      surgery and radioiodine therapy (RIT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, current assays for measuring Tg in blood samples are not sensitive enough to&#xD;
      reliably measure Tg while patients are under thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Instead&#xD;
      patients have to withdraw thyroid hormone for several weeks or receive costly injections of&#xD;
      recombinant thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in order to raise Tg production by thyroid&#xD;
      remnant and/or thyroid cancer cells so that it can be measured by current Tg assays. Other&#xD;
      patients have antibodies against Tg that interfere in current immunoassays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study was to characterize a new highly sensitive assay for measuring Tg in&#xD;
      the serum in thyroid cancer patients both on thyroid hormone therapy and off therapy in&#xD;
      comparison to the normal routine assay already in use at Münster University Hospital.&#xD;

      Sera of 100 consecutive DTC patients after total thyroidectomy were to be collected at the&#xD;
      Department of Nuclear Medicine both under TSH-suppression therapy and under endogenous TSH&#xD;
      stimulation (TSH &gt; 25 mU/l). All patients were staged by clinical examination, cervical&#xD;
      ultrasound (7.5 MHz), I-131 whole-body scintigraphy and - where applicable - F18-FDG-PET.&#xD;
      Written informed consent was obtained from all pts. Sera were taken in separation tubes&#xD;
      without anticoagulants and stored at -20°C until analysis. Sera were allowed to come to room&#xD;
      temperature prior to analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tg, TgR and TgAb concentrations were determined by fully automated two-site chemiluminescence&#xD;
      immunoassays (CLIA; Nichols Advantage®; Nichols Institute Diagnostics, San Clemente,&#xD;
      California). All 3 assays are based on the identical highly purified hTg material for&#xD;
      calibration (Tg), recovery (TgR) and antigen (TgAb; biotinylated and acridinium ester&#xD;
      labeled) for optimum comparability of test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, Tg and TgR was measured by a fully automated two-site TRACE immunoassay (BRAHMS&#xD;
      Kryptor®, Brahms AG, Hennigsdorf, Germany) and TSH with a 3rd-generation CLIA assay (TSH-3,&#xD;
      Advia Centaur, Bayer Corporation).&#xD;
