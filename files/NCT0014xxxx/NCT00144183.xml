      To determine whether a regimen of single dose nevirapine combined with either 4 or 7 days of&#xD;
      Combivir速, compared to a regimen of single dose nevirapine, for the prevention of mother to&#xD;
      child transmission can reduce the rate of development of drug resistant mutations of HIV-1,&#xD;
      in HIV-1 infected pregnant women, who have not received antiretroviral therapy previously.&#xD;

      An open-label, randomised, multicentre study to determine whether a regimen of single dose&#xD;
      nevirapine combined with either 4 or 7 days of Combivir, compared to a regimen of single dose&#xD;
      nevirapine, for the prevention of mother to child transmission can reduce the rate of&#xD;
      development of drug resistant mutations of HIV-1, in HIV-1 infected pregnant women, who have&#xD;
      not received antiretroviral therapy previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis of the first 61 patients showed that a clinical and statistical&#xD;
      difference exists between the occurrence of HIV-1 NNRTI resistant mutations in the single&#xD;
      dose nevirapine only arm (50%) and the two other combination arms (9%). These findings&#xD;
      partially answered the objectives outlined in the initial objectives. Consequently enrolment&#xD;
      onto the single dose nevirapine arm was terminated. The objective of the trial was modified&#xD;
      to compare whether either the 4 or the 7 day combination of ZDV+3TC and nevirapine would&#xD;
      result in any significant reduction in the incidence of nevirapine resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations of HIV-1 resistance patterns in trials of pMTCT have demonstrated nevirapine&#xD;
      resistant HIV-1 isolates in approximately 15-20% of mothers 4-6 weeks after receiving either&#xD;
      a single or two dose 200mg nevirapine regimen. Although the ability to detect these genotypic&#xD;
      mutations decreases to 0% by about 18 months, it is not clear whether this resistance is&#xD;
      clinically significant.(HIVNET 012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Empirically then it would seem useful to develop a strategy to diminish the emergence of this&#xD;
      early resistance, therefore this study is proposed to evaluate whether the effect of 4 or 7&#xD;
      days of 3TC+ ZDV added to a single dose nevirapine regimen for the prevention of MTCT will&#xD;
      prevent the emergence of resistance to nevirapine.&#xD;
