  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Foods containing more dairy fat (and thus a higher proportion of short and medium chain fatty&#xD;
      acids and possibly some other nutrients or micronutrients with effect on energy intake,&#xD;
      satiety or energy metabolism) affect energy balance and metabolic profile in subjects prone&#xD;
      to develop abdominal adiposity and metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that intake of dairy products has a favorable&#xD;
      effect on markers of the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore such a hypothesis the participants have to be in a free living situation during an&#xD;
      extended study period.&#xD;
