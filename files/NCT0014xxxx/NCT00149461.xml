    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this randomized, controlled study is to compare a model written treatment&#xD;
      plan with the usual care that is provided by a group of adult and pediatric pulmonologists&#xD;
      and allergists in their practice settings. The written treatment plan is a form that allows a&#xD;
      treatment regimen that is consistent with National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)&#xD;
      guidelines to be conveyed to patients. Barriers to the use of written plans will be&#xD;
      identified to better understand why some patients and physicians use written treatment plans&#xD;
      more frequently and effectively than others. An additional goal is to assess how patients&#xD;
      from different racial/ethnic backgrounds utilize treatments plans. Because asthma&#xD;
      disproportionately affects African American and Latino patients, another goal of this study&#xD;
      is to better understand if there are fundamental differences in the way patients from&#xD;
      racial/ethnic minority groups self-manage asthma in comparison to their white counterparts.&#xD;
      The study will also try to determine if differences exist in the way physicians care for&#xD;
      minority patients. If there are differences, it is important to determine if the disparities&#xD;
      can be overcome with the use of a written treatment plan form.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective self-management of asthma requires that patients, or their caregivers, recognize&#xD;
      the early symptoms of an exacerbation and initiate appropriate interventions aimed at&#xD;
      preventing the progression of symptoms. Most asthma clinical guidelines suggest that the&#xD;
      incorporation of a written self-management plan is essential. Patients must possess,&#xD;
      understand, and follow a written plan if they are to respond appropriately to changes in&#xD;
      asthma status. Nevertheless, there are no controlled studies examining the efficacy of the&#xD;
      written plan itself. Furthermore, even if written plans are an essential and effective&#xD;
      component of successful self-management, the data suggest that few patients receive these&#xD;
      plans. If patients and physicians are to increase their use of written plans, the barriers to&#xD;
      the use of these plans need further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three primary outcome measures of this study are as follows: 1) reduction in asthma&#xD;
      symptom frequency; 2) reduction in urgent, unscheduled, and emergency visits for asthma; and&#xD;
      3) improved quality of life. These outcomes will be measured over a 12-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following four secondary outcome measures will also be examined: 1) hospitalizations due&#xD;
      to asthma; 2) days with activity restriction; 3) the proportion of patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group who are given the model written plan form during the initial visit; and 4)&#xD;
      the proportion of patients in the intervention group who have the model treatment plan at the&#xD;
      end of the follow-up period. These outcomes will be measured over a 12-month period.&#xD;
