  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Procalcitonin, a marker of infection has often been compared to clinical pictures as for&#xD;
      instance &quot;clinical sepsis&quot;. This has given som problems in the interpretation of these&#xD;
      studies, because of the lack of good Gold Standards for &quot;clinical sepsis. We have decided to&#xD;
      investigate the development from day to day of Procalcitonin in the blood of intensive care&#xD;
      patients, compared to the mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Procalcitonin increase after reaching a certain level predicts mortality in the&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a major cause of mortality in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Efforts have been made&#xD;
      to reduce the time needed to diagnose sepsis in order to reduce mortality from sepsis-related&#xD;
      multi-organ dysfunction .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and White Blood Cell count (WBC)&#xD;
      have proved far from ideal in identifying critically ill patients who need antimicrobial&#xD;
      therapy, because the sensitivity and specificity for bacterial infection is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procalcitonin (PCT) is a 13 kDa 116 amino acid polypeptide, initially described as a&#xD;
      prohormone of Calcitonin, a hormone of the calcium metabolism produced in the medullary&#xD;
      C-cells of the Thyroid gland5-7. However, recent studies demonstrated that the variant PCT&#xD;
      associated with infection can be produced by other tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As kinetic studies on baboons and humans have shown a rapid release within 2-4 hours after&#xD;
      injection of bacteria or bacterial toxins, PCT is a substance which is released more rapidly&#xD;
      than CRP. The plasma half-life of PCT is close to 24 hours. Measurements of PCT in healthy&#xD;
      individuals have shown very low serum levels (&lt;0.05 ng/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1993, Assicot et al. reported that elevated levels of serum procalcitonin were closely&#xD;
      related to the onset of bacterial infection and seemingly correlated to severity of&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical studies have detected a high PCT level in patients with evidence of systemic&#xD;
      bacterial infection, while relatively low PCT levels, on the other hand, occur in patients&#xD;
      with only local bacterial infection or viral infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other studies have shown low to only moderately elevated PCT in uninfected patients after&#xD;
      major surgery, trauma and after myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reduced usage of antimicrobial therapy has been demonstrated when treatment was guided by&#xD;
      PCT in patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection, who were admitted to a&#xD;
      medical emergency department. Only few studies, however, have investigated the PCT day-to-day&#xD;
      changes for several days in respect of the clinical outcome in a population at risk of&#xD;
      contracting serious infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study was to assess the ability of PCT-, CRP- and leucocyte&#xD;
      measurements in early identification of critically ill patients, who are at high risk of&#xD;
      mortality. The study was a one-year study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Patients From January 2 through December 2002, we conducted an observational study&#xD;
      including all patients (except livertransplanted patients) admitted to the multi-disciplinary&#xD;
      intensive care unit 4131 at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, a secondary and&#xD;
      tertiary reference hospital. Patients were included on admittance to the ICU. In cases of&#xD;
      re-admittance, only measurements from the first admittance were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When sepsis was suspected, we performed culture samples from all suspected sites before&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy was initiated. Surveillance culture samples were performed twice a week&#xD;
      from all patients, including blood cultures from indwelling catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data of co-morbidity and mortality were registered real-time and were verified via the&#xD;
      central hospital register for Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all analyses, mortality was defined as all-cause mortality. The primary endpoint was&#xD;
      90-day survival; secondary endpoints were survival while admitted to the ICU and 30-day&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples Blood samples for PCT measurements were collected by the nursing staff in the&#xD;
      ICU on a daily basis between 6.00 a.m. and 7.30 a.m. in accordance with the assumed half life&#xD;
      of PCT. PCT analyses were performed by laboratory technicians at the Department of Clinical&#xD;
      Microbiology, using an immunoluminometric assay (Lumitest-PCT, B.R.A.H.M.S. Diagnostica,&#xD;
      Berlin, Germany). The threshold of detection was 0.1 ng/ml serum, according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected as a routine test in accordance with the ethical procedures of&#xD;
      the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood samples were stored at 4o Celsius, and were analysed within maximally 72 hours. As&#xD;
      a control of the PCT analysis and storage, we made double determinations. Ten blood samples&#xD;
      were analysed single-blinded three times daily at a standardised time for three days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCT-day-to-day change analysis Standard empiric antimicrobial treatment of sepsis in this ICU&#xD;
      includes: Meropenem and Ciprofloxacin, when relevant supplemented with: Metronidazole,&#xD;
      Vancomycin, Linezolid and occasionally other antibiotics according to clinical findings,&#xD;
      patient tolerance, suspected site of infection and bacterial cultures from foci and from&#xD;
      surveillance cultures combined with susceptibility patterns. Treatment of invasive fungal&#xD;
      infection included Caspofungin, Liposomal Amphotericin B or Voriconazole, or combination&#xD;
      therapy with these according to Candida species identification and susceptibility pattern&#xD;
      from Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) in surveillance cultures.&#xD;
