      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is a risk factor for a number of adverse medical and psychosocial outcomes. Solving&#xD;
      the obesity problem will require a much greater emphasis on prevention. Treatment research&#xD;
      indicates that interventions focusing directly on the food environment (structured meals and&#xD;
      control of food stimuli) have considerable promise for weight control. Prevention research&#xD;
      has found little support for trying to modify characteristics (e.g., knowledge, beliefs,&#xD;
      skills) of individuals, perhaps because this approach does little to modify the food&#xD;
      environment. The research will be implemented in a workplace cafeteria where employees eat&#xD;
      year-round and where the nutritional composition of the food can be modified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was initiated in response to a Request for Applications issued in October, 2001 on&#xD;
      &quot;Environmental Approaches to the Prevention of Obesity&quot;. The Request for Applications was&#xD;
      jointly issued by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the&#xD;
      National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the National Center for Minority Health&#xD;
      and Health Disparities, the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, and the&#xD;
      National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of two promising interventions on food intake, weight change, and related&#xD;
      outcomes will be investigated. The first intervention consists of a training program aimed at&#xD;
      reducing the energy density of participants' diets inside and outside of the cafeteria. The&#xD;
      second intervention consists of financial incentives to encourage the consumption of&#xD;
      cafeteria foods lower in energy density. Participants will be 195 Caucasian and&#xD;
      African-American men and women between the ages of 21 and 65. They will have a BMI of 23-35&#xD;
      and will have characteristics associated with an increased risk of weight gain. Selection and&#xD;
      intake of lunch foods will be measured with digital photography and cashiers' computerized&#xD;
      records of food purchases. Cafeteria patrons will be randomly assigned to 1) a&#xD;
      measurement-only condition; 2) an intervention designed to teach participants how to reduce&#xD;
      the energy density of their diets; or 3) the reduced energy density intervention plus&#xD;
      financial incentives for choosing cafeteria foods low in energy density. The potential&#xD;
      moderating influence of individual differences characteristics on outcome will also be&#xD;
      evaluated. Outcome measures will be administered repeatedly during the intervention and at 9-&#xD;
      and 18-month follow-ups. The assessments will include measures of anthropomorphic and blood&#xD;
      lipid variables, nutritional intake (both in and out of the cafeteria), physical activity,&#xD;
      overeating, eating self-efficacy, and weight-related quality of life.&#xD;
