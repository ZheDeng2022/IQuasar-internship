      Balance disorders in children are poorly known, underestimated, and rarely assessed.&#xD;
      Technologies to assess balance in children are almost non-existent, apart from a few&#xD;
      exceptions. Such technologies are routinely used in adults for some decades, and are of&#xD;
      considerable contribution in the diagnosis and treatment of adults balance disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess objectively children balance disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to provide technologies suitable for children balance assessement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to study children balance disorders suffering from sensorineural hearing loss.&#xD;

      The inner ear included two sensorineural organs closely linked: the cochlea and the&#xD;
      vestibule. With regards to children inner ear affliction, only cochlear function is taken&#xD;
      into consideration, whereas balance related to vestibule function is often neglected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Congenital sensorineural hearing loss is frequent (3/1000 births, Martin et al. 1981, Fortum&#xD;
      et al. 1997). Furthermore, otitis media is among the most frequent afflictions discovered in&#xD;
      small childhood, and Handicaps secondary to sensorineural hearing loss are numerous:&#xD;
      language, cognitive disorders, delay according to school and social integration (Joint&#xD;
      Commitee on Infant Hearing 1994, Casselbrant et al. 2005, Jung et al. 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In counterpart, children balance disorders are often unknown and underestimated. However,&#xD;
      they clinically lead to an evident handicap in case of acute or chronic otitis media&#xD;
      (Caselbrant et al. 1995). Balance control involves three sensory systems tightly linked:&#xD;
      vision, vestibule, and somesthesia. From the links between vision and vestibule originate the&#xD;
      visio-vestibular and vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VVOR,VOR). Dynamic Posturography (DP) is a&#xD;
      technology able to measure each of these sensory inputs involved in balance control by&#xD;
      recording sensory organization test (SOT). This technology is available for adults for a few&#xD;
      decades but are poorly used in children (Wiener-Vacher et al. 1996, 1998, Casselbrant et al&#xD;
      1995, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-To assess objectively children balance control (to provide normative data according to the&#xD;
      age). 2- to put in place methods to investigate children balance disorders. 3- to study&#xD;
      children balance disorders suffering from sensorineural hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studied population: two groups of children are involved and compared in this study: 150&#xD;
      healthy children and 150 children suffering from sensorineural hearing loss. Each group is&#xD;
      divided into three age groups: 6-8, 8-10, 10-12 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters are recorded in both groups: VVOR and VOR, SOT on two DP Equitest&#xD;
      and Balance Quest. Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions were recorded too in order to prove&#xD;
      normal hearing status in the healthy group and hearing loss in the sensorineural hearing loss&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
