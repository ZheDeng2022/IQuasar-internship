      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study was to test a practical, theory-based intervention to achieve&#xD;
      long-term behavior change for women with Type 2 diabetes at high risk for developing coronary&#xD;
      heart disease (CHD). Epidemiological and clinical studies suggest that diabetes is associated&#xD;
      with increased risk for CHD that is greater in women than in men. CHD is a major cause of&#xD;
      death and functional limitations in women, but the vast majority of CHD studies have&#xD;
      primarily involved middle-aged men. There is convincing research evidence that healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle behaviors, including low-fat diet, physical activity, stress management, smoking&#xD;
      cessation, and social support, can reduce CHD risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was initiated in response to a Request for Applications released in October 1997 by&#xD;
      the National Institutes of Health Office of the Director on &quot;Innovative Approaches to Disease&#xD;
      Prevention Through Behavior Change.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a randomized trial to compare short-term (6-month) outcomes in women receiving&#xD;
      usual care compared to a modified Ornish-type comprehensive lifestyle management (CLM)&#xD;
      intervention. Participants (N = 279) were randomized to usual care (UC) or Mediterranean&#xD;
      Lifestyle Program, a lifestyle change intervention aimed at the behavioral risk factors&#xD;
      (eating patterns, physical activity, stress management, and social support) affecting risk&#xD;
      for CHD in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes. After 6 months, women in the CLM&#xD;
      condition were randomized to one of two approaches for providing support either lay-led group&#xD;
      support or personalized computer-based support - to evaluate these strategies in enhancing&#xD;
      longer-term maintenance of effects. Outcomes included multiple CHD lifestyle behaviors (e.g.,&#xD;
      dietary intake, exercise levels, stress management, smoking cessation), physiological risk&#xD;
      factors associated with CHD (e.g., serum lipids, hypertension, weight, vascular reactivity),&#xD;
      HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin, a measure of diabetes), and quality of life (e.g., depression,&#xD;
      functioning).&#xD;
