      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides smoking cessation, weight loss and improved nutrition are the most important&#xD;
      behavioral changes, which can lead to improved health. Weight loss is also a critically&#xD;
      important behavioral recommendation for treating certain illnesses such as hypertension and&#xD;
      diabetes; for recovery from stroke or myocardial infarction; and for primary prevention of&#xD;
      these conditions as well as certain cancers. Unfortunately, adherence is very poor even with&#xD;
      motivated patients. This is a serious issue for all but especially African American women.&#xD;
      These diseases affect them disproportionately. They are more likely to be overweight and&#xD;
      there is a serious scarcity of culturally appropriate programs available. Also, many of these&#xD;
      women receive their care in high demand/low resource clinics so that any program must also be&#xD;
      practical and affordable within these constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is in response to a Request for Applications issued in January, 2001 on &quot;Overcoming&#xD;
      Barriers to Treatment Adherence in Minorities and Persons Living in Poverty.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current research involves studying adherence to recommend changes in behaviors related to&#xD;
      nutritional intake and physical activity designed to reduce weight. The investigators will&#xD;
      develop and test two versions of a 16-session weight loss program with the content delivered&#xD;
      by videotape. They are nearing the end of another study, SisterTalk, for which a culturally&#xD;
      appropriate weight control program was designed in partnership with and then delivered to&#xD;
      African American women by cable television. Based upon that previous study, they plan to&#xD;
      address a number of specific barriers to adherence by designing one version for clinic&#xD;
      delivery and another for home delivery. Both approaches, each addressing different adherence&#xD;
      issues, will be compared to a Wait List Control Group at 4 and 12 months after beginning the&#xD;
      program. The primary outcome measures are adherence to recommended nutritional behaviors and&#xD;
      physical activity levels. The program is based upon Social Action Theory and provides the&#xD;
      opportunity to study many of that theory's mediating variables and their relationships to&#xD;
      specific adherence behaviors. This will include extensive process evaluation procedures.They&#xD;
      will also gather a great deal of data concerning the specific barriers and facilitators to&#xD;
      adherence to nutrition and physical activity recommendations encountered by low-income&#xD;
      African American women who are hypertensive or at high risk for hypertension.&#xD;
