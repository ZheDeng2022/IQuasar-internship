      Insecticide Treated Nets (ITN's) offer good protection against malaria in Africa where the&#xD;
      vector mosquitoes feed indoors late at night. However, in other parts of the world like South&#xD;
      America, vectors feed earlier in the evening before people go to bed. In such cases it may be&#xD;
      necessary to use alternative treatments in the evening to supplement the efficacy of ITN's.&#xD;
      This study compares 2 matched groups of households in the Bolivian Amazon. One group will be&#xD;
      given ITN's plus a plant-based insect repellent in the evening, the other has ITN's plus a&#xD;
      placebo lotion. Households are monitored over a full malaria season to record numbers of&#xD;
      malaria cases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is little doubt that the use of insecticide treated bed nets (ITN's) is one of the most&#xD;
      successful means of reducing malaria in Africa. However, vectors in this region tend to be&#xD;
      late night, indoor feeders. Vector species in other parts of the world may not be so&#xD;
      susceptible to this form of vector control. In much of Central &amp; Southern America, the major&#xD;
      vectors such as An. darlingi and An. albitarsis have a feeding peak between 8 - 10pm, before&#xD;
      most people retire to bed. Similarly, the major vector in much of S.E. Asia, An. dirus,&#xD;
      seldom enters homes to feed. In these circumstances it is unlikely ITN's alone will provide&#xD;
      adequate protection. Supplemental use of skin applied insect repellents may be an effective&#xD;
      method of personal protection in the hours between dusk and retiring to bed. It would also&#xD;
      prove useful for those individuals working late or moving early into the forest where&#xD;
      exophagic species are encountered. As yet, there have been no robust clinical evaluations of&#xD;
      combined ITN and repellent use. This double blind, placebo-controlled study is designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of combined ITN and plant based insect repellent use to reduce P.&#xD;
      falciparum in the Bolivian Amazon in a region where ITN's alone are likely to be ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical evaluation. 1000 households will be&#xD;
      used and 5 individuals age 10 + will be entered into the study from each. Recruitment will&#xD;
      cover all rural communities in Vaca Diez and Pando Provinces, Department of Beni in the&#xD;
      Bolivian Amazon Region, plus the outer 10 % of periurban districts of the 2 major towns in&#xD;
      the region, Riberalta and Guayaramerin. A maximum of 20 % of households in any one location&#xD;
      will be used, thus avoiding any effect of diversion of insects from treatment to placebo&#xD;
      homes. Likewise, each house used will be a minimum of 25m from any other in the study.&#xD;
      Baseline surveys will be conducted on each individual and informed written consent will be&#xD;
      collected. Treatment (30 % L.E.) / placebo (0.1 % clove oil in alcohol) marked A or B will be&#xD;
      allocated (50:50) at random, and all individuals in both groups will be provided with an ITN.&#xD;
      Compliance questionnaires, collection of old bottles and distribution of fresh bottles will&#xD;
      be conducted every 4 weeks. Everyone will receive personal instruction on how to apply&#xD;
      repellent to arms &amp; legs each evening at dusk and left a pictorial instruction sheet on how&#xD;
      to measure 10 ml using the bottle lid. Compliance threshold will be set at 10% and monitored&#xD;
      by measuring any residual product on collection and recording of nightly use. A more&#xD;
      realistic measure of compliance will be gained through occasional evening spot checks of&#xD;
      households by the local health workers. Finger prick blood samples will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline and monthly throughout the study by trained &amp; approved field staff. P. falciparum&#xD;
      infection will be diagnosed by Paracheck® dipstick test, thus overcoming problems of&#xD;
      recrudescence of P. vivax. Positive cases will be referred to the local health centre for&#xD;
      treatment. The timing of the visits means the majority of malaria episodes will be detected&#xD;
      as the Paracheck® test can detect antibodies in blood for around 3 weeks post treatment. In&#xD;
      addition to the use of our monthly questionnaires, any episodes missed are highly likely to&#xD;
      be recorded, as we are employing the same local health workers in each area, and blood slides&#xD;
      are routinely taken at the local health centres. Outcome determination will constitute a&#xD;
      series of monthly cross-sectional prevalence surveys, and, as positive cases are treated,&#xD;
      this is equivalent to a measure of average prevalence of infection for each house.&#xD;
