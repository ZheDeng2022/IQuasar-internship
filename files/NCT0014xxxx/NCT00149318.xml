      Fabry disease is an X-linked rare metabolic disease, caused by a deficient activity of the&#xD;
      hydrolase α-Galactosidase A, and characterized by a progressive and systematic deposition of&#xD;
      glycosphingolipids in many organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease is most severe in affected males. In the classic form (where the enzyme activity&#xD;
      is absent) the clinical findings are represented by pain and paresthesias in the extremities,&#xD;
      vessel ectasia (called angiokeratoma) in skin and mucous membranes, and hypohidrosis (a&#xD;
      reduced sweating) during childhood or adolescence. Corneal and lenticular opacities may be&#xD;
      present. Proteinuria, renal impairment,cardiac and neurological lesions develop with time,&#xD;
      together with hypertension. When end stage renal disease occurs, dialysis or renal&#xD;
      transplantation may be necessary. In heterozygous females a residual enzymatic activity may&#xD;
      be demonstrated and they usually have asymptomatic or later onset disease manifestations,&#xD;
      although rarely they could develop a disease as severe as in males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cardiac and a renal variant, where the heart and kidney are the only organs involved by the&#xD;
      disease have been described too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recombinant human α-galactosidase A is now available for patients. Infusions of the&#xD;
      enzyme replacement treatment have been demonstrated to be safe and effective. This study&#xD;
      wants to evaluate the long term efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy in patients with Fabry&#xD;
      disease and renal involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical period evaluations together with a genetic counselling will be offered to each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Fabry disease is an X-linked error of glycosphingolipid catabolism caused by the&#xD;
      deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase α-galactosidase A (α-gal A) in tissues and&#xD;
      fluids of affected hemizygous males; most heterozygous females have an intermediate level of&#xD;
      enzymatic activity. The enzymatic defect leads to a systemic deposition of&#xD;
      glycosphingolipids, predominantly globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), in body fluids and in the&#xD;
      lysosomes of endothelial, perithelial, and smooth-muscle cells of blood vessels. Deposition&#xD;
      also occurs in ganglion cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical manifestations in classically affected hemizygotes (with absent α-gal A activity),&#xD;
      include pain and paresthesias in the extremities, vessel ectasia (angiokeratoma) in skin and&#xD;
      mucous membranes, and hypohidrosis during childhood or adolescence. Corneal and lenticular&#xD;
      opacities are early findings. With increasing age, proteinuria and renal impairment lead to&#xD;
      hypertension and uremia. Renal failure typically occurs in the third-fifth decades of life,&#xD;
      and these patients need chronic hemodialysis and/or renal transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atypical hemizygotes with residual α-gal A activity may be asymptomatic or have late-onset,&#xD;
      mild disease manifestations primarily limited to the heart (the &quot;cardiac variant&quot;). Recently&#xD;
      a renal variant has been identified too. Heterozygous females may have an attenuated form of&#xD;
      the disease.The most frequent clinical finding in females is the characteristic whorl-like&#xD;
      corneal epithelial dystrophy. They usually are asymptomatic, although rarely can be severely&#xD;
      affected as hemizygous males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the kidney accumulation of glycosphingolipids appear in the sequence in endothelial and&#xD;
      epithelial cells of the glomerulus and of Bowman's space, epithelium of the loops of Henle&#xD;
      and in distal tubules till proximal tubules, interstitial histiocytes and fibrocytes.&#xD;
      Lipid-laden distal tubular epithelial cells desquamate and may be detected in the urinary&#xD;
      sediment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal blood vessels may be involved progressively and extensively. An early finding is&#xD;
      arterial fibrinoid deposits. Other histologic renal findings are severe arteriolar sclerosis,&#xD;
      glomerular atrophy and fibrosis, pseudotubular proliferation of residual glomerular&#xD;
      epithelium, tubular atrophy and diffuse interstitial fibrosis. Preliminary studies of enzyme&#xD;
      replacement therapy demonstrate that periodic infusions of recombinant human α-galactosidase&#xD;
      A are safe and effective in patients with Fabry disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long term efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy&#xD;
      in patients with Fabry disease and renal involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of enzyme replacement therapy on the rate of decline in the&#xD;
           glomerular filtration rate (GFR, measured by inulin clearance) in Fabry patients with&#xD;
           renal involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the biological activity of recombinant human galactosidase in terms of&#xD;
           clearance of plasma Gb3 (that is directly correlated with renal endothelial&#xD;
           glycosphingolipid clearance) Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of enzyme replacement therapy on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour urinary protein excretion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  renal plasma flow (PAH renal clearance)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  glomerular perm-selectivity (fractional dextran clearances)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  end stage renal failure, kidney transplantation or death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  systolic and diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cardiac anomalies (left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmias, conduction anomalies)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cutaneous anomalies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ocular anomalies DESIGN Twenty patients (males and females) with Fabry disease, and&#xD;
           renal involvement, referred to the SMIMAF - Studio Multicentrico Italiano sulla Malattia&#xD;
           di Anderson-Fabry - will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
