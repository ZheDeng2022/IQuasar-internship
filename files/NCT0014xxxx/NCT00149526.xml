      To improve asthma outcomes by developing and evaluating strategies for enhancing the&#xD;
      clinic-patient partnership. To develop a model of shared decision-making for asthma&#xD;
      treatment, and to evaluate it in a two-year randomized clinical trial in 342 adults aged&#xD;
      18-70 years with sub-optimally controlled persistent asthma.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although much is now known about asthma, and there is effective asthma treatment, only about&#xD;
      half of the patients with persistent asthma adhere to their prescribed long-term controller&#xD;
      medication. One way to change this might be to involve patients more in decisions about their&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview and study design This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a model of&#xD;
      shared decision-making in improving outcomes in adults aged 18-70 years with suboptimally&#xD;
      controlled, mild-moderate persistent asthma. The shared decision-making model (SD) is being&#xD;
      compared in a randomized controlled trial with a model based on national asthma guidelines&#xD;
      (MG), and with usual care (UC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, we adapted the model of shared decision-making that has been used successfully in&#xD;
      cancer to make it appropriate for a chronic disease (asthma). We will also adapted the KP&#xD;
      Asthma Guidelines so that the two models (Management by Guidelines and Shared&#xD;
      Decision-Making) take a similar amount of clinician-patient interaction time. We are&#xD;
      comparing the two models and usual care in the primary care setting at Kaiser Permanente&#xD;
      Northwest and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii in a randomized controlled trial with 24-month follow&#xD;
      up. The individual asthma patient will be the unit of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions were done by a care manager (nurse practitioner or clinical pharmacist) with&#xD;
      experience in asthma, and the authority to change medication regimens. Different staff were&#xD;
      used for the two intervention groups to minimize contamination between the groups&#xD;
      attributable to the intervention. Eligible participants were randomized into the three groups&#xD;
      (UC, MG, and SD) on an equal 1:1:1 basis, stratifying on prior health care utilization and&#xD;
      within center (KPNW or KPH). All study participants are being followed for 24 months with&#xD;
      clinic visits for data collection at 12 months. The MG and SD arms are receiving interim&#xD;
      phone calls from the care managers at three, six, and nine months to assess problems with&#xD;
      their treatment regimens, discuss changes that may be desired in treatment regimens, and&#xD;
      encourage adherence. Different staff are responsible for data collection and intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare the MG and SD models versus usual care (UC vs MG; UC vs SD), and the MG and&#xD;
      SD models (MG vs SD).&#xD;
