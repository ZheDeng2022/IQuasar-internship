  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart disease and stroke, known as cardiovascular disease, are major causes of death in&#xD;
      people with chronic kidney disease. Abnormalities of a metabolic pathway called the&#xD;
      &quot;L-arginine-nitric oxide&quot; pathway are thought to be particularly important in these people,&#xD;
      and previous research in animals has suggested that sodium (salt) affects part of this&#xD;
      metabolic pathway. The purpose of our research is to study the effects of sodium intake on&#xD;
      the &quot;L-arginine-nitric oxide&quot; pathway, and on blood vessel function, in patients with kidney&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with abnormalities of endothelial function (EF)&#xD;
      and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, and it is proposed that the endogenous NO synthase inhibitor&#xD;
      asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) plays a central role. In man ADMA is largely metabolized&#xD;
      by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), with some renal excretion occurring.&#xD;
      Sodium inhibits DDAH expression in experimental animals and, given that CKD is frequently&#xD;
      characterized by sodium retention, it would be interesting to study the effects of sodium&#xD;
      loading on DDAH activity/expression, ADMA levels and EF in CKD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer these questions, we have designed a double-blind cross-over study employing Slow&#xD;
      Sodium (150 mmol/day) and placebo for seven days in individuals with mild-to-moderate CKD.&#xD;
      Changes in the ratio of urinary ADMA to dimethylamine (DMA, an ADMA metabolite) will be used&#xD;
      as an marker of DDAH activity/expression. ADMA will be measured by ELISA, DMA by high&#xD;
      performance liquid chromatography, and EF by venous occlusion plethysmography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to test the following hypothesis; that in subjects with mild-to-moderate CKD under&#xD;
      conditions of high sodium intake, as compared to low-normal sodium intake:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) The ratio [ADMA]urine:[DMA]urine is increased (ii) [ADMA]plasma is increased (iii)&#xD;
      Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation is reduced&#xD;
