  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the inaccuracies of the current classification scheme for inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
      (IBD), the failure of surgical pouches and the findings of retrospective observational trials&#xD;
      to date, we hypothesize that a significant proportion of patients with UC will have small&#xD;
      bowel involvement that will result in a change in diagnosis to CD or the recognition of a new&#xD;
      phenotype of IBD. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of small bowel&#xD;
      pathology in patients diagnosed with UC using WCE. This information will aid in the current&#xD;
      efforts to re-classify IBD using improved endoscopic and imaging technologies, genetic&#xD;
      information and serologic information.&#xD;

      Subjects will undergo both a blood draw and a wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood draw will occur in the GI procedure unit on the day of subjects exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WCE: Subject will only consume a clear liquid diet after noon the day prior to the exam. No&#xD;
      food or beverage consumption any after 10 PM on the day before examination. Not oral&#xD;
      medications after 12 AMon the day of exam (8 hours before subject's exam).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day of exam, subject will report to the endoscopy unit. At that time, subject will be&#xD;
      prepared for examination by doctor who will apply a sensor array to the abdomen with adhesive&#xD;
      sleeves. In addition, a waist belt device that holds the data recorder will be fitted to&#xD;
      subject. Subjects will swallow the capsule endoscope. The capsule endoscope passes naturally&#xD;
      through digestive tract while transmitting video images to the data recorder worn on the belt&#xD;
      for approximately eight hours. At this point, subjects will be free to leave the University&#xD;
      of Chicago hospital until they return eight hours later for disconnection of the recording&#xD;
      equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hours after ingestion of the capsule, subject will be able to resume a clear liquid diet.&#xD;
      Four hours after the study's start time, subject will be able to resume a regular diet (&#xD;
      solid foods). At this time, subject will also be able to resume taking oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After eight hours, subject will return to the endoscopy suite (DCAM 6H) for disconnection of&#xD;
      the recording equipment (sensor array, data recorder, and belt). The time that the capsule&#xD;
      was ingested, eating and drinking times, and disconnection time as well as any discomfort&#xD;
      subject experienced will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will be contacted 72 hours after the examination to confirm passage of the capsule.&#xD;
      If they have not reported passage of the capsule with this time, subject will undergo an&#xD;
      abdominal radiograph in order to determine whether or not the capsule has passed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to identify a non-relative control (spouses are acceptable) within&#xD;
      five years of their age and of similar background without Ulcerative Colitis. There is an&#xD;
      Information Handout that participating subjects will give to friends interested in&#xD;
      participating. If the subject does not find anyone, they may still participate in this&#xD;
      research study. The study staff will try to find someone for them.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for the &quot;disease&quot; arm include a clinical impression of ulcerative&#xD;
        colitis that includes assessment of the colon by colonoscopy and biopsy and assessment of&#xD;
        the terminal ileum either by ileoscopy or by small bowel radiograph or enteroclysis.&#xD;
        Subjects in the &quot;control&quot; arm will only be included if they do not carry the diagnosis of&#xD;
        UC or CD, have not had previous gastric or small bowel surgery and are free of&#xD;
        gastrointestinal symptoms including unexplained abdominal pain, diarrhea or&#xD;
        gastrointestinal bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A known bowel obstruction, fistula or stricture, a permanent pacemaker and/or implantable&#xD;
        defibrillator, history of a swallowing disorder, inability to provide informed consent,&#xD;
        pregnancy, the use of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within the&#xD;
        past 30 days, known celiac disease, known terminal ileal disease on ileoscopy and a history&#xD;
        of occult or obscure gastrointestinal bleeding of unclear etiology. In menstruating&#xD;
        females, a urine HCG will be performed on the day they arrive for the study (prior to&#xD;
        ingestion of the capsule), if fourteen (14) days or more have elapsed since their last&#xD;
        menstrual period. If subject reports they are menopausal, a urine HCG will be performed&#xD;
        unless subject has had no menses during the past two years.&#xD;
