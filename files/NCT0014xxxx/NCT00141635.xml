      Implementation and Evaluation of Implementation of Quality of Life Diagnostics and Therapy in&#xD;
      Individual Patients with Breast Cancer. A prospective study including 170 patients, 5 clinics&#xD;
      and 38 general practitioners as coordinating doctors for quality of life therapies.&#xD;
      Correlational study including several comparisons such as patients and their doctors.&#xD;

      Improving cancer patients' quality of life (QL) requires that QL-diagnostics, the&#xD;
      availability of QL-enhancing treatment options and treatment decisions are being integrated&#xD;
      into a clinical path. This description presents the development and implementation of such a&#xD;
      clinical path in the Tumorcenter Regensburg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acting persons and institutions in this clinical path are the breast cancer patients, the&#xD;
      hospitals, the family doctors or gynaecologists, and a QL-study team. Starting point is the&#xD;
      QL-assessment either in the hospital or in doctors' practice (EORTC QLQ-C30 plus BR-23). The&#xD;
      caring physician documents the patients' health status. Based on these two pieces of&#xD;
      information, the QL-study team writes up a medical/QL-opinion plus therapy recommendation.&#xD;
      This report is sent to the caring physician. The effectiveness of the therapy recommendation&#xD;
      is assessed in the following QL-assessment. This clinical path is implemented via three&#xD;
      interrelated methods of implementation: local opinion leaders, outreach visits, and quality&#xD;
      circle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 38 physicians were made familiar with QL-diagnostics through outreach visits, and&#xD;
      12 opinion leaders were identified and convinced to support this project. The quality circle&#xD;
      provided regular CME meetings on QL-enhancing therapy options (pain control, psychotherapy,&#xD;
      physiotherapy, nutrition, social rehabilitation). A total of 170 QL-reports were sent to&#xD;
      physicians. All 38 doctors found the QL-profiles comprehensible and the therapy&#xD;
      recommendations clinically relevant. The most common QL-problems were emotional functioning,&#xD;
      fatigue, and arm/shoulder problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QL-diagnostics is a new way to individualise and to rationalise patient care. It transforms&#xD;
      the QL-concept into a decision-relevant, integral part of a clinical path that aims to&#xD;
      provide high quality patient care.&#xD;
