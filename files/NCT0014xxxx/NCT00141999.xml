  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the immune response to an additional (booster) dose&#xD;
      of hepatitis B vaccine 5-14 years after a three dose series was given&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Routine hepatitis B vaccination beginning at birth was provided to Alaska Natives several&#xD;
      years before other areas of the United States began routine infant hepatitis B vaccination&#xD;
      programs. Follow up studies of hepatitis B immunity among Alaska Native children provide an&#xD;
      early opportunity to assess long term protection against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection&#xD;
      for children vaccinated at birth with the currently used recombinant vaccine. This protocol&#xD;
      describes an evaluation of long-term protection against HBV infection among children who&#xD;
      received the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine beginning at birth, and who currently receive&#xD;
      medical care at the Alaska Native Medical Center (ANMC) in Anchorage, Alaska.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objective of this study is to evaluate the immune response to a five microgram&#xD;
      dose of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine among 5-6 year old and 10-14 year old children who&#xD;
      received the primary recombinant hepatitis B vaccine series beginning at birth. The&#xD;
      concentration of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) will be measured&#xD;
      immediately before administering the vaccine, and compared with levels in serum drawn 1, 2&#xD;
      and 4 weeks afterwards. A rapid antibody response (anamnestic response) indicates that immune&#xD;
      memory, and therefore immunity to HBV infection, is preserved. The frequency and magnitude of&#xD;
      the anamnestic response for the group of older children will be compared to that of the&#xD;
      younger group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no recommendation for a routine booster dose of vaccine after receiving&#xD;
      three doses at birth. This study will provide valuable information regarding the need for and&#xD;
      response to an additional dose (booster dose) of hepatitis B vaccine among children entering&#xD;
      primary school or adolescence. If evidence of waning immune memory (as measured by a delayed&#xD;
      or diminished response to the additional dose of vaccine) is found, these two age groups&#xD;
      would be the most easily accessible for routine delivery of a booster dose.&#xD;
