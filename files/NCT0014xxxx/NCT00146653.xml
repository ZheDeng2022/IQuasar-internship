  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose a comparison between between our standard ACT based heparin management protocol&#xD;
      for children undergoing CPB and a patient-specific heparin concentration-based heparin&#xD;
      management protocol. We hypothesize that a heparin concentration-based anticoagulation&#xD;
      management protocol during CPB in children will result in more effective attenuation of&#xD;
      hemostatic activation as reflected by decreased levels of thrombin formation and, ultimately,&#xD;
      better preservation of hemostasis postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional 20 patients will be enrolled to address the validation of heparin&#xD;
      concentrations calculated by the Hepcon machine with laboratory-measured heparin&#xD;
      concentrations. These patients will not be randomized and therefore will not receive an&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 patients will be randomly assigned to either the traditional heparin management group or&#xD;
      the intervention group. The traditional group will be treated with an initial heparin dose of&#xD;
      400 units/kg and the standard amount of heparin, as dictated by the circuit size, will be&#xD;
      added to the CPB circuit prime. An ACT target value of 480 seconds will be maintained&#xD;
      throughout the bypass period. Should the ACT fall below 480 seconds,additional boluses of 100&#xD;
      units/kg of heparin will be given until the ACT returns to the target value. At the end of&#xD;
      CPB, heparin will be neutralized by the standard reversal of 4 mg/kg of protamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional 20 patients will be enrolled to address the validation of heparin&#xD;
      concentrations calculated by the Hepcon machine with laboratory-measured heparin&#xD;
      concentrations. These patients will not be randomized and therefore will not receive an&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the intervention group, a heparin dose (HDR) response assay will be performed prior to&#xD;
      surgical incision by the Hepcon instrument. The hepcon machine performs a patient-specific&#xD;
      HDR assay based on body surface area, and determines a projected heparin concentration&#xD;
      required by that patient to achieve an ACT of 480 seconds. The HDR assay provides the initial&#xD;
      dose of heparin to give the patient as well as the amount of heparin to be added to the CPB&#xD;
      circuit. Additional heparin doses as determined by the hepcon instrument will be administered&#xD;
      as needed if the patient's heparin concentration falls below the projected reference&#xD;
      concentration. The hepcon instrument will also calculate the protamine dose needed to reverse&#xD;
      heparin at the end of CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For comparison between groups, an assay using the hepcon machine to measure whole blood&#xD;
      heparin concentration and an ACT will be obtained for each patient at the following&#xD;
      intervals: after the initial heparin dose, 30 minutes after the initiation of CPB, the start&#xD;
      of rewarming and immediately prior to the discontinuation of CPB. A sample for anti-factor Xa&#xD;
      activity will also be obtained at each of the above time intervals to validate the heparin&#xD;
      concentration determined by the hepcon machine to a laboratory measured value. Blood samples&#xD;
      for biochemical markers of hemostatic activation will be collected from all patients before&#xD;
      the initiation of CPB after the administration of the initial heparin dose and after the&#xD;
      conclusion of CPB before protamine infusion. The following biochemical markers of hemostatic&#xD;
      activation will be measured: prothrombin fragment 1.2, fibrinopeptide A, free tissue factor&#xD;
      pathway inhibitor, factor V, factor VIII, and beta-thromboglobulin. The following measures of&#xD;
      clinical outcome will also be recorded: amount of blood products transfused after protamine&#xD;
      administration, time between the administration of protamine to leaving the operating room,&#xD;
      24-hour chest tube drainage, first post-operative weight, time to extubation and duration of&#xD;
      ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional 20 patients: These additional 20 patients will be enrolled to provide further&#xD;
      validation of the Hepcon-measured heparin concentrations with the laboratory-measured heparin&#xD;
      concentrations (anti-factor Xa activity). A blood sample will be obtained for a heparin dose&#xD;
      response (HDR) assay prior to surgical incision Samples will also be obtained to measure a&#xD;
      heparin concentration by the Hepcon machine and by anti-factor Xa activity at two time&#xD;
      periods: after the initial heparin dose and immediately prior to discontinuation of CPB. In&#xD;
      addition, these 20 patients will also have an ACT test analyzed by the Hepcon machine after&#xD;
      protamine is given.&#xD;
