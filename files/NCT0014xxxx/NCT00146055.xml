  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a less-intensive preparative therapy&#xD;
      followed by an allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation will provide an effective&#xD;
      treatment for your disease and whether it will be associated with fewer side effects.&#xD;

      Combinations of high-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy (preparative regimen) followed&#xD;
      with allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation from an unrelated donor is a current&#xD;
      treatment approach. Chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation are given in higher doses to&#xD;
      increase their effectiveness. High-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy generally affect&#xD;
      cells that are dividing. They are used to treat cancer because cancer cells divide more often&#xD;
      than most other cells. High-dose treatment severely damages the patient's bone marrow so that&#xD;
      the patient no longer is able to produce needed blood cells. Peripheral stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation allows stem cells that were damaged by treatment to be replaced with healthy&#xD;
      stem cells that can produce the blood cells the patient needs. Patients experience a number&#xD;
      of complications after transplantation. Some are temporary and relatively minor; yet others&#xD;
      can be life threatening. Many doctors consider high-dose chemotherapy, by itself or with&#xD;
      radiation, and bone marrow or stem cell transplantation as the best available treatment&#xD;
      option for diseases under specific circumstances. However, this study will explore whether a&#xD;
      less-intensive preparative therapy before the peripheral stem cell transplantation will prove&#xD;
      to be safer, have less side effects, and be an effective treatment for certain diseases.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be a candidate for unrelated donor stem cell transplantation and the donor&#xD;
        and recipient must be 5/6 or 6/6 matched. In addition, patients must have one of the&#xD;
        following histologically confirmed diagnosis :&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with previously treated AML (M0 - M7 by FAB classification)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  who are in not in complete remission (CR).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  who are in second or later CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  who have 5-30% persistent blasts in bone marrow following induction or salvage&#xD;
                  chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  who have high-risk feature in first complete remission e.g. presence of&#xD;
                  Philadelphia chromosome or non-core-binding factor type of chromosomal&#xD;
                  abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and IPS int-1, int-2 or high-risk scores who&#xD;
             are transfusion-dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who are in accelerated, blastic, or or chronic&#xD;
             phase&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  who are in first complete remission and have high risk disease [Ph' or t (4; 11)&#xD;
                  , WBC&gt; 30,000, &gt; 4 weeks to achieve CR].&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  who are in second or greater CR.&#xD;
