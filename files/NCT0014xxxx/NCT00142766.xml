      The purpose of this two-year project is to pilot test an intervention to change sedation&#xD;
      management in pediatric patients supported on mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory&#xD;
      failure in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). While ensuring patient comfort is an&#xD;
      integral part of pediatric critical care, analgesic and sedative use in this patient&#xD;
      population is associated with injury; specifically, comfort medications may depress&#xD;
      spontaneous ventilation and prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation. Additionally,&#xD;
      drug tolerance develops over time and may precipitate iatrogenic abstinence syndrome&#xD;
      (chemical withdrawal) when the patient no longer requires sedation. Alternatively, suboptimal&#xD;
      comfort management contributes to the patient not breathing synchronously with the ventilator&#xD;
      and/or self-removal of breathing tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group has developed and validated a nurse-implemented sedation algorithm (set of specific&#xD;
      instructions) to guide titration of comfort medications that may optimize patient comfort and&#xD;
      reduce the risk of under-medication, but this algorithm needs to be evaluated further. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that pediatric patients managed per sedation protocol will experience fewer days&#xD;
      of mechanical ventilation than patients receiving usual care. This research has the potential&#xD;
      of revolutionizing sedation practices that are driven by and synchronized to patient needs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We propose a two-year project to pilot test and evaluate an intervention to change sedation&#xD;
      management in pediatric patients supported on mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory&#xD;
      failure in the PICU. Rather than seeking an elusive ideal drug, this unique nurse-led pilot&#xD;
      study focuses on optimizing clinical decision making by: (a) multidisciplinary team education&#xD;
      and consensus building; (b) multidisciplinary team identification of the patient's trajectory&#xD;
      of illness and daily prescribing of a sedation goal; (c) a nurse-implemented sedation&#xD;
      algorithm to guide titration of comfort medications; and(d)team feedback on clinical&#xD;
      performance. This intervention models the most recent sedation clinical practice guideline&#xD;
      published by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and addresses the only potentially&#xD;
      manipulable factor influencing extubation failures rates in the Pediatric Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coordinating center, Children's Hospital Boston, developed, tested and currently uses the&#xD;
      sedation algorithm as a standard of care. We will pilot the intervention in two separate&#xD;
      previously selected PICUs that are matched on size and organization, academic affiliation and&#xD;
      volume of patients supported on mechanical ventilation. One PICU will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive early intervention while the other will first serve as a control, then will receive a&#xD;
      delayed intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a randomized controlled trial with delayed intervention in the control&#xD;
      hospital. Because the intervention is an educational and organizational change directed at&#xD;
      all PICU clinicians, the unit of randomization and analysis is the PICU. During the start-up&#xD;
      phase, case report forms will be developed and a consensus meeting with all nurse and&#xD;
      physician co-investigators will be conducted. The purpose of this consensus meeting will be&#xD;
      to review the Children's Hospital Boston experience with the sedation algorithm and reach&#xD;
      agreement on its application in the two PICUs. System nuances may impact protocol&#xD;
      implementation and will require group discussion and multidisciplinary problem solving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design includes baseline assessment of the organizational structure and comfort&#xD;
      practices in both units. The PICU randomized to early intervention will then undergo training&#xD;
      followed by implementation, a one-month respite, and post-data collection to evaluate the&#xD;
      sustainability of the practice change. The PICU randomized to delayed intervention will start&#xD;
      with pre-data collection, then undergo training followed by implementation. This design&#xD;
      allows multiple comparisons; specifically, baseline to intervention/control, pre and post&#xD;
      comparisons in both units, and sustainability in one unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training will be multifaceted and will include all clinicians (physicians, nurses, clinical&#xD;
      pharmacists and physicians-in-training) involved in the sedation management of intubated&#xD;
      mechanically-ventilated patients. A multidisciplinary, cooperative approach is necessary to&#xD;
      assure compliance and successful implementation of protocols. Training material will include&#xD;
      discipline-specific lectures, informal discussions, video on sedation and opioid withdrawal&#xD;
      scoring, bedside booklets, and physician order sheets. The research team will develop the&#xD;
      supporting materials. Physician training will focus on sedation and opioid withdrawal&#xD;
      scoring, identifying the patient's trajectory of illness, collaborating with nursing in&#xD;
      prescribing the daily sedation goal, and completion of the standardized order template.&#xD;
      Nursing content will likewise focus on sedation and opioid withdrawal scoring, trajectory&#xD;
      analysis and collaboration, but also will include practical support on the daily &quot;wake-up&quot;&#xD;
      test and titration of sedatives. Prior to the intervention phase, all physicians,&#xD;
      physician-in-training, unit-based clinical pharmacist, charge nurses and full-time nursing&#xD;
      staff will be required to document their understanding of the intervention by completion of a&#xD;
      discipline-specific scenario-based self-assessment evaluation. Respiratory therapists will&#xD;
      also require refresher instruction on extubation readiness testing and general information&#xD;
      about sedation assessment and sedation algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the implementation phase, daily multidisciplinary rounds will include identification&#xD;
      of the patient's trajectory of illness and daily prescription of (a) sedation goal and (b)&#xD;
      sedation parameters. Nurses will titrate the comfort medications as prescribed and perform a&#xD;
      daily &quot;wake up&quot; test in patients during their stable phase who are not awake. During the&#xD;
      implementation phase, a member of the research team will round separately on each patient to&#xD;
      monitor for study compliance and offer staff support and re-training as necessary. This level&#xD;
      of vigilance is necessary to identify aspects of the algorithm that are challenging to&#xD;
      clinicians, and accurate reporting of protocol deviations requires an evaluation of the&#xD;
      context of decision-making. This daily check will not continue in the early intervention arm&#xD;
      when sustainability is evaluated. During the implementation phase, all sedation orders will&#xD;
      be derived from standardized physician orders. This order template will serve two purposes:&#xD;
      physician education and enhanced compliance with the algorithm&#xD;
