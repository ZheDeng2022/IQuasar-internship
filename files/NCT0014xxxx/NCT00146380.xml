      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that a regimen using highly active antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (HAART) to maximally suppress maternal viral load in the late antenatal period and&#xD;
      during the first six months of lactation is safe, effective and can be implemented in&#xD;
      resource poor settings in order to reduce the risk of HIV transmission to the infant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Approximately 800,000 HIV-infected infants are born each year, two thirds of them&#xD;
      in sub-Saharan Africa. The rate of HIV transmission from mother to infant is estimated at&#xD;
      13-48% in the absence of antiretroviral treatment. Interventions currently available to&#xD;
      prevent mother to child transmission in resource-limited settings among breastfeeding&#xD;
      populations child HIV transmission during the breastfeeding period. Because safe alternatives&#xD;
      to breastfeeding are not currently a viable option for many HIV-infected women in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa, it is important to identify interventions to decrease transmission to the infant&#xD;
      during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To demonstrate that a regimen using highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)&#xD;
      to maximally suppress maternal viral load in the late antenatal period and during the first&#xD;
      six months of lactation is safe, effective and can be implemented in resource poor settings&#xD;
      in order to reduce the risk of HIV transmission to the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The study will be an open label Phase II trial of Zidovudine/Lamivudine and&#xD;
      depending on maternal CD4 count, either Nevirapine or Nelfinavir to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerance and activity of maternal HAART to reduce the risk of transmission among&#xD;
      breastfeeding HIV infected women in Kisumu Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Transmission through breastfeeding accounts for 25-40% of all mother-to-child&#xD;
      transmission of HIV. This trial will assess the safety and activity of a potent triple drug&#xD;
      combination to lower maternal viral loadprenatally, intrapartum and during breast feeding.&#xD;
      The regimen will be given to HIV infected women from 34 weeks gestation through 6 months of&#xD;
      breastfeeding postpartum. Infants will receive a single dose of NVP. Women will be encouraged&#xD;
      to breastfeed exclusively and wean abruptly at 6 months. Mother and infant will be followed&#xD;
      for 24 months. Clinical and laboratory evaluations will be performed periodically to&#xD;
      determine infection status of the infant and side effects of medications to mother and&#xD;
      infant. The estimated sample size needed to address both transmission reduction of HAART in&#xD;
      comparison to single dose NVP as well as related safety of the two HAART regimens is 520&#xD;
      mother-infant pairs. Comparison will be made with data from previous studies (HIVNET O12 in&#xD;
      Uganda and the malaria vertical transmission study in Kisumu) and with data from current&#xD;
      Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMCT) programs in Kisumu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expectations and significance: A HAART regimen of this nature may potentially show a dramatic&#xD;
      decrease in transmission when compared to existing PMCT regimens. Given the continued&#xD;
      decreasing costs of ARVs and the relatively low efficacy of existing PMCT regimens, such a&#xD;
      regimen would be seriously considered for wide implementation in resource poor settings and&#xD;
      elsewhere.&#xD;
