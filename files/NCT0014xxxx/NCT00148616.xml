      This study examines the efficacy and safety of 24 weeks memantine add-on treatment to&#xD;
      risperidone for the treatment of negative symptomatology and cognitive impairment in patients&#xD;
      with chronic schizophrenia. The trail was double-blind, prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group and consisting of a 'placebo-run-in' period, treatment,&#xD;
      and follow-up periods. Study personnel and participants were blinded to group assignment. In&#xD;
      the 'run-in' period, patients received Lorazepam for the treatment of anxiety and tension&#xD;
      states for two weeks before starting antipsychotic therapy. After the 'run-in' period&#xD;
      treatment, patients began receiving antipsychotic therapy with Risperidon with continuous&#xD;
      concomitant administration of a 24 weeks Memantine, 20 mg/d, or placebo. Adherence was&#xD;
      assessed at each clinic visit by pill count. In cases of anxiety and tension states, an&#xD;
      experienced psychiatrist decided whether patients should receive Lorazepam, 5 mg/d, as rescue&#xD;
      medication in addition to the study medication (Memantine or placebo), to which the patients&#xD;
      remained blinded. In cases of pseudo parkinsonism patients were allowed to receive Biperiden,&#xD;
      up to 8 mg/d, and for the treatment of patients suffering from sleep disorders Zopiclon (15&#xD;
      mg/d) was allowed. The consumption of alcohol and drugs were not allowed during the trial. In&#xD;
      both study parts, psychiatric assessments were performed at baseline as well as after 2; 4;&#xD;
      6; 12 and 24 weeks after treatment (that is, during the follow-up period). The&#xD;
      neuropsychological examination was performed at baseline, and after 6 and 24 weeks.&#xD;
      Psychiatric changes, adverse events, laboratory values, dose adjustments of the antipsychotic&#xD;
      therapy, and possible pharmacologic adverse effects were systematically monitored throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
