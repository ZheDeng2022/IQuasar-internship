  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure (hypertension) affects up to 80% of all patients receiving haemodialysis&#xD;
      for chronic kidney disease (CKD). High blood pressure is a major cause cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (i.e. strokes, heart attacks and heart failure) and, thereby, cardiovascular deaths in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant cause of raised blood pressure in haemodialysis patients is thought to be due&#xD;
      to retention of salt in the body. In healthy people the kidneys excrete salt but the kidneys&#xD;
      of patients with CKD cannot do this, so salt has to be removed by dialysis. However dialysis&#xD;
      cannot remove as much salt as is necessary, and so it accumulates. This fact has been&#xD;
      recognized for many years, and health professionals caring for haemodialysis patients often&#xD;
      stress the importance of restriction of dietary salt intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However no research has looked in detail at the mechanisms by which salt raises blood&#xD;
      pressure in haemodialysis patients. It is likely that salt directly affects thirst, causing&#xD;
      patients to drink more and become overloaded with fluid. In addition, salt may have direct&#xD;
      effects on the blood vessel wall, causing failure of adequate blood vessel relaxation. Both&#xD;
      of these factors may raise blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a carefully controlled crossover study looking at the effects of a modest&#xD;
      reduction in salt intake on BP. During the course of the study, which will last eight weeks,&#xD;
      patients will receive both a 5 gram per day and a 10 gram per day salt intake. We will look&#xD;
      at how thirst, fluid intake, a number of markers of blood vessel function and blood pressure&#xD;
      differ on these two salt intakes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      High blood pressure (BP) is a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in&#xD;
      individuals on haemodialysis, and yet BP is extremely poorly controlled in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excessive dietary salt intake is likely to be a major cause of hypertension in these&#xD;
      patients. Firstly, excessive salt intake will result in thirst, excessive fluid intake and&#xD;
      weight gains between dialysis, and thereby chronic over-expansion of extracellular fluid&#xD;
      volumes resulting in high blood pressure. Secondly, salt may have direct effects on the&#xD;
      arterial tree contributing to endothelial dysfunction that has clearly been demonstrated in&#xD;
      uraemic individuals, including haemodialysis patients. Abnormalities in endothelial nitric&#xD;
      oxide (NO) production may play an important role in salt-sensitive hypertension, mediated by&#xD;
      the potent inhibitor of NO synthase, asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA). Plasma ADMA&#xD;
      concentrations are several-fold higher in individuals on dialysis than in normal controls,&#xD;
      and it would be of interest to see whether ADMA concentrations decrease with a reduction&#xD;
      dietary salt intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of the importance of dietary salt intake in haemodialysis patients, there are no&#xD;
      controlled studies which delineate the mechanisms by which salt intake affects BP. We propose&#xD;
      to conduct a prospective double-blind placebo controlled cross-over study of normal (10 to 12&#xD;
      grams salt per day) versus modestly reduced (6 grams per day) salt intake over an eight week&#xD;
      period in haemodialysis patients. The primary outcome measure is the change in pre-dialysis&#xD;
      systolic BP. Other outcome measures include mean systolic and diastolic BP as measured by&#xD;
      ABPM, thirst scores, daily weight gains and thoracic fluid content, as measured by thoracic&#xD;
      bioimpedance. Furthermore, in a sub-group of subjects will we study the changes in plasma&#xD;
      ADMA concentrations with reductions in salt intake, and examine correlations with changes in&#xD;
      BP and systemic vascular resistance.&#xD;
