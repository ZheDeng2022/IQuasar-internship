  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to test the efficacy of an innovative&#xD;
      multi-component intervention aimed at reducing the risk for adverse health outcomes among&#xD;
      caregivers of older survivors with spinal cord injury or disability, and to improve the well&#xD;
      being of the spinal cord-injured survivor. In a three-group, randomized, controlled design&#xD;
      providing access to information, resources, and support, we predict that the dual target&#xD;
      approach will have a greater positive impact on both the caregiver and survivor than the&#xD;
      caregiver-only approach, and that both active treatments will be superior with respect to&#xD;
      caregiver outcomes than an information-only control condition.&#xD;

      The specific aims of this project are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the impact of a dual target (caregiver and care recipient) intervention compared&#xD;
           to a traditional caregiver-only intervention strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess causal linkages between the treatment components (e.g. knowledge, social support)&#xD;
           of a multi-component intervention and specific treatment outcomes (e.g. caregiver&#xD;
           depression, quality of life).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore cultural and racial differences in the evaluation of and effectiveness of the&#xD;
           different treatment approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the issues affecting management of SCI/D in later life are complex and hold critical&#xD;
      implications for the health of the long-term survivor as well as for those who provide care&#xD;
      in the home environment. Large numbers of individuals are living with the effects of SCI/D&#xD;
      for decades post-injury. In addition to the health-related complications that typically&#xD;
      accompany older age, these individuals are especially vulnerable to co-occurring medical&#xD;
      conditions that require high degrees of support and maintenance. Consequently, older&#xD;
      caregivers face multiple and often extreme challenges in providing support to the SCI/D&#xD;
      survivor at a time in their lives when their own abilities may be compromised due to&#xD;
      age-related changes in health and functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multi-faceted burden faced by caregivers is associated with high levels of depression and&#xD;
      anxiety as well as the onset of deleterious physical symptoms. The cumulative effects of such&#xD;
      multiple stressors over time all too frequently leave the caregiver unable to continue&#xD;
      providing the level of support necessary to maintain their partner's health in the home&#xD;
      environment. In order to circumvent the additional distress certain to accompany such a&#xD;
      family separation, Elliott et al. (2001, p. 230) recently concluded that &quot;there is a pressing&#xD;
      need for interventions that help family [SCI] caregivers address the routines and tasks&#xD;
      essential to maintaining family functioning.&quot;&#xD;
