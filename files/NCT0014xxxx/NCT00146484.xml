  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal insulin regimen for children and adolescents with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a split evening injection&#xD;
      regimen (insulin injections before breakfast, supper and bedtime) leads to better glucose&#xD;
      control and quality of life than twice daily insulin in children and adolescents with new&#xD;
      onset diabetes.&#xD;

      The optimal insulin regimen for children and adolescents with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      remains unknown. No published studies have examined the effectiveness of a split evening&#xD;
      (three times daily) injection regimen in this group of patients. Indeed, because the first&#xD;
      few years of diabetes management are the easiest (due to a &quot;honeymoon&quot; period characterised&#xD;
      by residual insulin secretion), the potential for any benefit from more intensive management&#xD;
      (i.e., three daily injections) may be small during this period. In addition, the intensity of&#xD;
      the initial insulin regimen may be an important determinant of quality of life, family&#xD;
      functioning, and subsequent compliance with diabetes regimens. A randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      has been designed to test the hypothesis that a split evening injection regimen leads to&#xD;
      better glycemic control and quality of life than twice daily insulin in children and&#xD;
      adolescents with new onset diabetes.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New onset type 1 diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less than 48 hours since first insulin injection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child and/or parent able to read and write English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Family intends to continue treatment at our institution for the next two years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent from adolescents greater than 16 years of age, or if less than 16&#xD;
             years, informed consent from the parent/guardian with assent from the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic medical conditions other than treated hypothyroidism or mild asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concerns of the diabetes team regarding future treatment adherence making twice daily&#xD;
             insulin preferable to the split evening injection regimen (e.g., cognitive impairment,&#xD;
             severe family dysfunction).&#xD;
