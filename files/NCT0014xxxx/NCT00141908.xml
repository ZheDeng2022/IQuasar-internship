    <textblock>
      Preterm birth remains a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality in developing as&#xD;
      well as in developed countries. Despite major clinical research efforts aimed at reducing the&#xD;
      incidence of preterm births in the United States, the preterm birth rate reached its highest&#xD;
      level in 2 decades, 11.9% in 2001, which translates to a 27% rise since 1981. Much of this&#xD;
      increase may be accounted for by the increase in multiple gestations brought about by&#xD;
      assisted reproductive technology. Twin gestations accounting for 20% to 25% of all&#xD;
      pregnancies conceived following such procedures. Twin gestations are at a particularly&#xD;
      increased risk of preterm labor and they deliver at a mean gestational age of 37 weeks&#xD;
      compared to 40 weeks for singleton pregnancies. In a study by our group, we estimated that&#xD;
      about 54.5% of twin gestations would deliver prior to 37 completed weeks of gestation; i.e.&#xD;
      preterm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence regarding efficacy of interventions designed to prevent preterm birth has been&#xD;
      disappointing. Most well-designed clinical trials have failed to demonstrate any reduction in&#xD;
      preterm births with such interventions as home uterine activity monitoring, reduced physical&#xD;
      activity, administration of antibiotic or tocolytic therapy, and intensive and frequent&#xD;
      antenatal follow ups. Recently, progesterone has shown some promise in the prevention of&#xD;
      preterm birth among women with prior preterm births. Whether this intervention will prove&#xD;
      effective in other populations, such as women with multiple gestations, remains to be seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of our study is to compare the effectiveness of weekly intramuscular injections&#xD;
      of 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate, a natural metabolite of progesterone, in preventing&#xD;
      delivery at less than 37 weeks of gestation in a population of 290 patients with twin&#xD;
      gestations between 16 and 36 weeks of gestation compared to a placebo. The data generated&#xD;
      will be invaluable in managing this group of patients that is considered at a very high risk&#xD;
      for preterm labor and delivery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth remains the leading public health problem in obstetrics. A recent analysis of&#xD;
      neonatal mortality (death at age &lt; 28 days) in the United States between 1989 and 2001&#xD;
      revealed that preterm delivery (&lt; 37 weeks) accounted for 70% of neonatal deaths.9 In&#xD;
      addition to being at risk for neonatal death, preterm infants are at increased risk for&#xD;
      long-term neurologic and developmental morbidity, with an estimated risk of significant&#xD;
      handicaps in up to 15% of the survivors. These statistics have led many investigators to&#xD;
      identify those women at greatest risk (e.g., those with prior preterm delivery, multiple&#xD;
      gestations, maternal weight &lt;50 kg, African-American race, bleeding, and concurrent sexually&#xD;
      transmitted diseases). Despite identification of these risk factors, no reproducible and&#xD;
      effective method of preventing preterm delivery has been demonstrated. On the contrary,&#xD;
      preterm birth rates has risen 27% since 1981.1 A significant contributor to this tremendous&#xD;
      rise is the increase in the rate of multiple gestations observed in over the past years. This&#xD;
      is partly due to the advances in assisted reproductive technologies with twin gestations&#xD;
      accounting for around a quarter of pregnancies conceived following these procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One modality that showed promise for prevention of preterm labor in small trials was&#xD;
      treatment with progestational agents. Two separate meta-analyses assessing the effects of&#xD;
      progesterone on preterm labor arrived at contradictory conclusions. Goldstein found no&#xD;
      evidence of effectiveness of progestational compounds in the prevention of preterm delivery.&#xD;
      Daya, on the other hand, showed a beneficial effect. A third meta-analysis, restricted to&#xD;
      trials of 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate showed, in composite, a significant reduction&#xD;
      in the rate of preterm delivery. A recently reported trial comparing 17-alpha&#xD;
      Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate therapy with placebo to prevent preterm birth in a select,&#xD;
      high-risk group of women (documented history of a previous spontaneous preterm birth &lt;37&#xD;
      weeks of gestation) was terminated prematurely when results showed a significant protection&#xD;
      against recurrent preterm birth for women who received 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate.&#xD;
      Other studies, using the same form of progesterone, did not demonstrate such a beneficial&#xD;
      effect. A study in 1980 has failed to show any benefit of 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone&#xD;
      Caproate in women with twin gestations. In that study, 77 women with twin gestations were&#xD;
      treated during the last trimester with weekly injections of either 17-alpha&#xD;
      Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate or a placebo. The study was limited by the small sample size. In&#xD;
      addition, the progesterone therapy was started late in the third trimester of gestation which&#xD;
      could partly explain the inability to detect a beneficial effect of progesterone in this&#xD;
      group of patients using that particular regimen. Most reported trials on other progesterone&#xD;
      compounds have failed to demonstrate a substantial effect in reducing the risk of preterm&#xD;
      delivery. However, a recent small randomized placebo-controlled trial of supplemental vaginal&#xD;
      progesterone in women at high risk for preterm birth revealed that the preterm birth rate at&#xD;
      less than 34 weeks of gestation was significantly lower among women receiving progesterone&#xD;
      than among those receiving placebo.8 The results of this study and that of the National&#xD;
      Institute of Child Health and Human Development7 support the hypothesis that progesterone&#xD;
      supplementation reduces preterm birth in a select very high-risk group of women. In fact, the&#xD;
      American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Obstetric Practice believes&#xD;
      that further studies are needed to evaluate the use of progesterone in patients with other&#xD;
      high-risk obstetric factors, such as multiple gestations, short cervical length, or positive&#xD;
      test results for cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms of action of 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate in prolonging gestation are&#xD;
      not entirely known. They include relaxation of myometrial smooth muscle, blocking of the&#xD;
      action of oxytocin, and inhibition of the formation of gap junctions. There is also evidence&#xD;
      that local changes in the progesterone level or the ratio of progesterone to estrogen in the&#xD;
      placenta, decidua, or fetal membranes may be important in the initiation of labor in humans.&#xD;
      As for its safety profile, aside from local injection-site reactions like soreness, swelling,&#xD;
      itching and bruising, 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate appears to be safe during&#xD;
      pregnancy with absence of teratogenic effects. The safety of 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone&#xD;
      Caproate administration in pregnancy is well documented by animal and clinical studies.&#xD;
      Reviews of this topic by knowledgeable authors have uniformly concluded that no evidence&#xD;
      exists that administration of 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate in pregnancy represents a&#xD;
      significant risk to mother, fetus or newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM(S):&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the effectiveness of weekly injections of 250 mg of 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone&#xD;
      Caproate as compared with placebo in the prevention of preterm delivery in patients with twin&#xD;
      gestations, when given from 16-20 weeks of gestation until 36 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We chose the 250 mg dose of 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate because this is the dose&#xD;
      that was used in the studies that showed a beneficial effect of this medication in the&#xD;
      prevention of preterm delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that placebo is equivalent in its efficacy to 17-alpha&#xD;
      Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate in preventing preterm delivery in twin pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      to participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will stratify patients by reduced/non-reduced and IVF/ no-IVF. Patients will be then&#xD;
           randomized to the different treatment groups using permuted block randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization envelopes will be prepared by means of random number tables. Randomization&#xD;
           will occur between 16 weeks and 20 weeks of gestation whereby the next numbered opaque&#xD;
           envelope will be opened to assign each consenting patient to receive identically&#xD;
           appearing active 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate (Proluton® Depot, Schering AG,&#xD;
           Germany) or placebo (castor oil) injections prepared by our pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The women, their obstetricians, and research personnel will be blinded to the study&#xD;
           medication allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 2:1 ratio will be used for the assignment of women to 17-alpha Hydroxyprogesterone&#xD;
           Caproate or placebo, because the patients assigned to placebo would be receiving painful&#xD;
           injections on a weekly basis with no possibility of direct benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine studies and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An ultrasonographic examination, a routine procedure that is done on every pregnant&#xD;
           patient, will be performed between 14 weeks and 20 weeks of gestation to confirm the&#xD;
           gestational age and to identify any major fetal anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gestational age will be calculated based on the last menstrual period and/or first&#xD;
           trimester ultrasonography for spontaneously conceived twins and the day of egg retrieval&#xD;
           for twins conceived by assisted reproductive technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After consenting, the patients will be offered to come for weekly injections of 17-alpha&#xD;
           Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate (250 mg) or placebo given by a study nurse. If they cannot&#xD;
           come for weekly injections, they will be handled the medications at the time of their&#xD;
           follow up visits to their obstetricians to be given by a private nurse, whichever is&#xD;
           more convenient for them. In order to avoid the burden on the clinic staff, it was&#xD;
           decided to use the OPD premises from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., a time where OPD sessions&#xD;
           are over. Flow sheets to document the date of the injection will be available with the&#xD;
           RA, obviating the need for pulling out patients charts. The financial compensation of&#xD;
           the staff-nurse will comply with AUMBC rules and regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For those patients who elect to receive their injections at home, they will be called on&#xD;
           the day of the injection to remind them of the injection to ensure that they are&#xD;
           receiving the medication in due time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be categorized as non-compliant if there is ≥ 10 day-gap between any&#xD;
           two injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The injections will be continued until 36 weeks of gestation or delivery, whichever&#xD;
           occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition to the weekly visits for the study injections, the women will receive&#xD;
           routine prenatal care with her obstetrician. Twin gestations at our department are&#xD;
           usually asked to come for routine checkup visits every 3-4 weeks in the first and second&#xD;
           trimester and every 2 weeks from 28 weeks to 36 weeks and weekly thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The possible side effects of the medication, written in the consent form, will be&#xD;
           explained to the patient by the research assistants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a patient goes into preterm delivery, she will be managed by her obstetrician&#xD;
           according to standard protocols that might necessitate admission and even tocolysis. In&#xD;
           these cases, the injections will continue on a weekly basis till 36 weeks of gestation&#xD;
           or delivery, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be performed using the SPSS statistical&#xD;
      package adjusting for the stratified design. The analyses will be done on the intent-to-treat&#xD;
      basis. Categorical data like maternal characteristics and the rates of neonatal morbidity&#xD;
      will be compared using Chi square when sample sizes support the approximation. Otherwise,&#xD;
      categorical data will be analyzed with two-tailed Fisher exact test if the expected cell&#xD;
      frequencies were small. Continuous variables will be compared by Student t test if&#xD;
      assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances appeared to be reasonable or the&#xD;
      Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Unpaired variables and differences in distributions will be compared&#xD;
      using the Mann-Whitney test. Neonatal outcomes will be analyzed on the assumption that if a&#xD;
      neonatal outcome variable occurs in at least one of the fetuses, the pregnancy will be&#xD;
      considered affected for that variable. A p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Logistic regression model will include all the confounding variables to for check their&#xD;
      contribution to the primary outcome. The variables that we are going to control for include:&#xD;
      need for tocolysis, BMI, smoking, assisted reproductive technology, prior preterm delivery,&#xD;
      prior term delivery, spontaneous or reduced twins, etc ….&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolongation of pregnancy will be assessed by life-table methods. The duration will be&#xD;
      considered as the period between the time of randomization and the time a woman gives birth,&#xD;
      is lost to follow-up, or reaches 40 weeks of gestation, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE AND LIMITATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Managing preterm neonates is a major burden on the health system medically and&#xD;
           financially. The results of this study will therefore have major implications if such&#xD;
           treatment proves effective in reducing preterm delivery in twins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Limitations: Since the study is limited to twin gestations, the results cannot be&#xD;
           generalized to singletons without risk factors for preterm labor or to higher order&#xD;
           gestations.&#xD;
