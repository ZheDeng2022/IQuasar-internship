  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine immune status of adolescents who responded to a&#xD;
      primary series of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine given at birth and to assess their response&#xD;
      to a booster dose of vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the 1970s, Alaska Natives had the highest rate of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the&#xD;
      US. Because of this, routine vaccination for all Alaska Native infants beginning at birth was&#xD;
      implemented in 1985. Hepatitis B vaccination programs have resulted in significant declines&#xD;
      in acute and chronic HBV infections among Alaska Natives, with virtually no new chronic&#xD;
      infections observed among the vaccinated cohort. Since 1991, the American Academy of&#xD;
      Pediatrics (AAP) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) have recommended&#xD;
      hepatitis B vaccination for all infants, preferably beginning at birth. Beginning vaccination&#xD;
      during infancy prevents childhood acquisition of HBV, and provides immunity against HBV&#xD;
      before individuals reach an age where they may be at increased risk of exposure due to&#xD;
      high-risk behaviors (i.e., sexual activity and drug use) or occupation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The success of this vaccination strategy is contingent on the vaccine being able to induce&#xD;
      long-lasting protection. The duration of protection conferred by hepatitis B vaccination&#xD;
      initiated at birth is not firmly established. Over 95% of vaccinees in clinical studies&#xD;
      develop a response to the three-dose primary hepatitis B vaccination series, defined as the&#xD;
      development of antibody to hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBs) to concentrations&#xD;
      greater than10 milliInternational Units per milliliter (mIU/mL) in blood. Within 5-10 years&#xD;
      after the primary series, anti-HBs concentrations decline and for many vaccinees,&#xD;
      concentrations will fall below 10mIU/mL, or even below detectable levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite low anti-HBs concentrations, HBV infections (as measured by the presence of&#xD;
      markers of infection such as hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] or antibody to hepatitis B&#xD;
      core antigen [anti-HBc]) are rare in persons who have been shown to respond to the primary&#xD;
      vaccine series. Continued protection against HBV infection in these children is likely&#xD;
      provided by immune memory cells generated at the time of the primary series. An immunologic&#xD;
      memory response (also termed an anamnestic response) can be evaluated by measuring the effect&#xD;
      of an additional (booster) dose of hepatitis B vaccine. An anamnestic response is generally&#xD;
      defined as a rapid (within 14-30 days) two-fold or greater increase in the anti-HBs titer to&#xD;
      at least 20mIU/mL. This signifies that immune memory cells capable of generating a rapid rise&#xD;
      in anti-HBs are still functional and would protect against HBV infection. Blood tests that&#xD;
      can identify memory B cells that are specific for vaccine antigens are now available, and&#xD;
      could be used to provide additional evidence of immune memory.9&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is good evidence that the immunologic memory for HBsAg exceeds the persistence&#xD;
      of measurable antibodies, few studies have examined lasting protection (&gt;10 years) against&#xD;
      HBV infection in a low-risk population vaccinated at birth with recombinant vaccine.10 Most&#xD;
      studies demonstrating long term protection from infection and persistent immune memory&#xD;
      despite low anti-HBs concentrations have been performed among children living in areas where&#xD;
      HBV infection is endemic, or whose mothers had chronic HBV infection (i.e., children at high&#xD;
      risk of perinatal or childhood HBV infection). Studies conducted among Alaska Native children&#xD;
      have demonstrated that &quot;low-risk&quot; children (i.e., infants who were born to HBsAg-negative&#xD;
      mothers with no HBsAg-positive persons living in their households) also have concentrations&#xD;
      of anti-HBs that fall below 10mIU/mL during later childhood. In a cohort of 36 children known&#xD;
      to have responded to a recombinant vaccine series starting at birth, none retained levels of&#xD;
      anti-HBs ≥ 10mIU/mL at 7.5 years of age. In addition, three of these children failed to&#xD;
      exhibit an anamnestic response to a booster dose given at an average age of 7.5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the present time, neither measurement of anti-HBs concentrations nor booster dose(s) are&#xD;
      recommended for low-risk children after the hepatitis B vaccine primary series given during&#xD;
      infancy. Low-risk Alaska Native children who received recombinant hepatitis B vaccination&#xD;
      starting at birth are now reaching adolescence, a period when the risk of HBV infection&#xD;
      through sexual transmission or transmission by injecting drug use is more likely to occur.&#xD;
      More information is needed to determine if protection against HBV infection among children&#xD;
      entering adolescence is adequate or if booster dose(s) might be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine anti-HBs concentrations among adolescents aged 11-14 years old who&#xD;
           responded to a primary series of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine initiated at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the anti-HBs response to a booster dose of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine&#xD;
           among adolescents who have been previously shown to respond to a primary series of&#xD;
           recombinant hepatitis B vaccine initiated at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether specific immune memory cells are present among the study cohort&#xD;
           members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To correlate the response to a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine with&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. initial response to the primary series&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. concentration of anti-HBs and age at time of a booster dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To document side effects in persons receiving a fourth dose of hepatitis B vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the proportion of children who received and responded to a primary vaccine&#xD;
           series in infancy who subsequently became infected with HBV as demonstrated by the&#xD;
           presence of anti-HBc and/or HBsAg.&#xD;
