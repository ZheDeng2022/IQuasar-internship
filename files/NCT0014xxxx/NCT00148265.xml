      This study is likely to identify an improved and economical treatment for diabetic macular&#xD;
      oedema, one of the commonest causes of blindness both in Australia and the rest of the&#xD;
      world.The specific aims of the study are to test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That intravitreal triamcinolone followed by laser treatment results in a greater&#xD;
           improvement in visual acuity than placebo followed by laser treatment of eyes with&#xD;
           macular oedema secondary to diabetes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That intravitreal triamcinolone followed by laser treatment results in greater degree of&#xD;
           resolution of macular oedema than placebo followed by laser treatment of eyes with&#xD;
           macular oedema secondary to diabetes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That intravitreal triamcinolone followed by laser treatment results in a reduced&#xD;
           requirement for further laser treatment to control diabetic macular oedema than placebo&#xD;
           followed by laser treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That intravitreal triamcinolone followed laser has a manageable and acceptable safety&#xD;
           profile in eyes with diabetic macular edema.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A 25 fold increase in the risk of going blind on diagnosis of diabetes is one of the most&#xD;
      daunting threats that people with diabetes face. Stimulated by several uncontrolled,&#xD;
      anecdotal reports, we are already conducting a randomized clinical trial of intravitreal&#xD;
      triamcinolone for the treatment of diabetic macular edema which is refractory to conventional&#xD;
      laser treatment. The analysis of the 3 month data from this study has already unequivocally&#xD;
      demonstrated that the treatment very significantly reduces or eliminates macular oedema in&#xD;
      the short term and results in improved visual acuity. Thus intravitreal triamcinolone may&#xD;
      represent the most significant development in the prevention of blindness in people with&#xD;
      diabetes since the introduction of laser treatment. It is also a highly cost-effective&#xD;
      intervention that can be administered by general ophthalmologists. The next question to be&#xD;
      answered, which will be addressed directly by the present study, is whether there is a&#xD;
      significant, synergistic beneficial effect when intravitreal steroids are combined with&#xD;
      current therapy (laser).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study represents the second major project to be undertaken by the Australian Retinal&#xD;
      Collaboration (ARC). The ARC aims to set the highest attainable standards for&#xD;
      investigator-initiated clinical research in retinal diseases in Australia. Having enrolled&#xD;
      and treated more than the target of 120 patients, we are currently completing an RCT of laser&#xD;
      induced chorioretinal anastomosis for central retinal vein occlusion, an innovative&#xD;
      Australian concept for a severe and otherwise untreatable disease. The proposed study is&#xD;
      likely to identify an improved and economical treatment for one of the commonest causes of&#xD;
      blindness both in Australia and the rest of the world. Intravitreal triamcinolone is also an&#xD;
      intervention which has generated intense interest internationally, and one for which members&#xD;
      of the ARC are acknowledged pioneers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful implementation of the study proposed, which is feasible, is highly likely to have&#xD;
      an immediate and direct effect on the prevention of vision impairment and blindness in people&#xD;
      with diabetes&#xD;

Eyes assigned to placebo were prepared in the same way but had the barrel of the syringe without a needle pushed firmly against the eye to simulate an injection.</description>
