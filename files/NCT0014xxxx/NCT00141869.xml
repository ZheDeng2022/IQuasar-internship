      This study will examine brain activity associated with the involuntary urges or uncontrolled&#xD;
      movements, called &quot;tics,&quot; experienced by people who have Tourette syndrome (TS). Before&#xD;
      people with TS actually develop a tic, whether it is a movement or a vocal tic (like a cough&#xD;
      or bark), they feel the urge to tic. This study will look at brain activity during the time&#xD;
      of this urge and how brain activity may differ in people with TS and without TS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with TS between 14 and 65 years of age may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Patients must have sensory tics in the facial region and must experience at&#xD;
      least a moderate premonitory urge. Candidates are screened with a medical history, brief&#xD;
      physical examination, and a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetoencephalography (MEG): This test records magnetic field changes produced by brain&#xD;
           activity. During the test, the subjects are seated in the MEG recording room and a cone&#xD;
           containing magnetic field detectors is lowered onto their head. Electrodes (small metal&#xD;
           disks) are placed on both sides of the face near the jaw. The recording may be made&#xD;
           while the subject receives small currents from the electrodes on the jaw. Subjects may&#xD;
           be asked a few questions about what they felt during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This test uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves&#xD;
           to obtain images of body organs and tissues. During the procedure, the subject lies on a&#xD;
           table that can slide in and out of the scanner-a metal cylinder. Subjects may be asked&#xD;
           to lie still for up to 30 minutes at a time. They can communicate with the staff at any&#xD;
           time during the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Somatosensory evoked responses: This test examines how sensory information travels form&#xD;
           the nerves to the spinal cord and brain in the nervous system. An electrode placed on&#xD;
           the arm, leg, or face delivers a small electrical stimulus that may tingle and cause a&#xD;
           twitch of a hand, foot, or face muscle. Additional electrodes may sometimes be placed on&#xD;
           the scalp, neck, and over the collarbone to record how the impulse from the stimulus&#xD;
           travels over nerve pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the study are contacted for follow-up after the study. Follow-up will be&#xD;
      conducted by phone or email, according to the patients' convenience, and will consist of&#xD;
      reaffirming that there were no adverse events.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of sensory tics in patients with Tourette&#xD;
      syndrome (TS). We will also investigate the possible existence of a sensory gating problem.&#xD;
      By investigating somatosensory evoked responses from stimulation of the trigeminal nerve&#xD;
      (tSERs) on affected versus unaffected sides of the face, we hope to identify differences in&#xD;
      the SER waveforms that suggest sensory abnormalities. We will use a series of short trains of&#xD;
      stimulations on the affected side to examine habituation, subsequently performing a time-&#xD;
&#xD;
      frequency analysis to seek indicators of decreased sensory gating. This study will examine,&#xD;
      specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether the cortical neurocircuitry involved in the elicitation of tSERs differs in patients&#xD;
      with tic disorders from controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If SERs differ in a sensory tic facial region of patients, compared to the same spot on an&#xD;
      unaffected side of the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether in controls and patients with sensory tics on both sides of their body, tSERs on both&#xD;
      sides of the face are symmetrical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is a lack of habituation in tic patients to tSERs in a short-train click paradigm,&#xD;
      compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The location for sources of abnormalities in either paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty patients and 10 control subjects will be studied. Subjects can be of any race, gender,&#xD;
      handedness, or age between 14 and 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare tSERs in normal volunteers to those in TS patients. Patients with&#xD;
      bilateral sensory tics will be contrasted with those who have unilateral sensory tics,&#xD;
      comparing power of the response at latencies on affected versus unaffected sides. Subjects&#xD;
      will be seated in the MEG and instructed to &quot;feel the delivered sensation, and try not to tic&#xD;
      for seventy seconds, without counting&quot;. The trigeminal nerve will be electrically stimulated&#xD;
      at 0.25 Hz for 30 seconds, which will be followed by head localization and subsequent rest&#xD;
      for tic release. To evaluate sensory gating, the design is similar except the trigeminal&#xD;
      stimulation will occur in short trains. Patients will be surveyed to determine if the&#xD;
      instructions intensified sensory tics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare the power of averaged tSERs at latencies, comparing face sides in patients&#xD;
      and comparing patients' active face side with controls' dominant face side. The power of&#xD;
      frequency components at latencies will be considered. We will locate the sources of&#xD;
      differential tSER activity.&#xD;
