  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      APO303 is a sub-study of patients enrolled in APO401 (the long-term open label safety&#xD;
      protocol) and was designed to evaluate adverse events, particularly blood pressure drops when&#xD;
      standing up during first dose in patients who have not been exposed to apomorphine before.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study was to determine the electrocardiographic and orthostatic&#xD;
      effects of apomorphine during controlled in-patient dose introduction in apomorphine-naïve&#xD;
      late stage Parkinson's disease patients. Although safety observations represented the primary&#xD;
      objective of the study, a control group was considered essential to properly interpret&#xD;
      adverse events that occurred during dose titration. Additional data comparing the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of subcutaneous apomorphine, placebo and standard antiparkinson (anti-PD) therapy&#xD;
      was derived from this experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a two-phase study that involved a controlled in-office dose titration phase followed&#xD;
      by a 6-month outpatient open-label treatment phase. During the in-patient dose titration&#xD;
      phase, subjects were evaluated on separate days for the response to single doses of&#xD;
      medication administered during an observed &quot;Off&quot; event (defined as first &quot;Off&quot; event that&#xD;
      occurs at least one hour after administration of the normal morning dose of oral&#xD;
      antiparkinson medication). Evaluation of the acute response to oral anti-PD medication&#xD;
      (Baseline) and to apomorphine dose escalation between 2 and 10 mg (Titration Visits) was&#xD;
      conducted under unblinded conditions. At the 0.4-mL titration level, placebo was randomly&#xD;
      introduced under double-blind crossover conditions.&#xD;
