  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness and feasibility of the Active&#xD;
      Living Every Day Physical Activity Program (ALED) for people with arthritis. This project is&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the ALED program in changing arthritis-related&#xD;
      health outcomes and to investigate the feasibility of conducting the ALED program in a public&#xD;
      health setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence has shown that regular moderate-intensity physical activity improves symptoms and&#xD;
      function in persons with arthritis. A 20-week behavior-based program was developed by the&#xD;
      Cooper Institute, Brown University, and Human Kinetics to help people with sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyles become and stay physically active. A randomized trial evaluated the effectiveness&#xD;
      and efficacy of a similar program on which Active Living Every Day is based (ALED) on&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk factors, cost-effectiveness, and cardiorespiratory fitness.&#xD;
      However, the current research supporting ALED is limited for people with arthritis. The&#xD;
      primary goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness and feasibility of the Active&#xD;
      Living Every Day Physical Activity Program (ALED) for people with arthritis. The primary goal&#xD;
      will be accomplished through a twenty week randomized controlled trial conducted with 400&#xD;
      participants residing in the 17 Area Agencies on Aging housed in the Councils of Government&#xD;
      in North Carolina, including both urban and rural counties. This project is designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of the ALED program in changing arthritis-related health outcomes&#xD;
      and to investigate the feasibility of conducting the ALED program in a public health setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate that the ALED program can increase physical activity and fitness levels&#xD;
           among people with arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To demonstrate that the Active Living Every Day has arthritis-specific benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the feasibility of disseminating the Active Living Every Day program through&#xD;
           the NC public health network.&#xD;
