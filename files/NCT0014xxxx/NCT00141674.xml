  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Donated red blood cells vary in how old they are, that is, how long they have been stored&#xD;
      since being collected from donors. Blood that has been donated is stored for a maximum of 42&#xD;
      days, after this time it is expired. That means that red blood cells that are given to&#xD;
      patients as a blood transfusion can be anywhere from a few days old to 42 days old. The&#xD;
      average age of blood that is given as a blood transfusion in this hospital is 21 days old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stored blood gets older its ability to carry oxygen may be reduced. Whether or not this is&#xD;
      important in patients with a brain injury is not currently known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to try and determine if fresh blood (less than 5 days old) is&#xD;
      better than old blood (greater than 20 days old) in improving the supply of oxygen in&#xD;
      patients who have suffered an injury to their brain.&#xD;

      PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate that packed red blood cells (pRBC) less than 5 days old are superior to older&#xD;
      (&gt;20days) blood in improving markers of cerebral oxygenation in acutely head injured&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfusion of pRBC will result in increased cerebral extraction of oxygen. This effect will&#xD;
      be greatest in pRBC stored for a greater length of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main aims of the intensive management of head injured patients is the prevention&#xD;
      of secondary hypoxic or hypotensive insults in the already injured brain. Packed red blood&#xD;
      cell transfusions are commonly given to trauma patients suffering anemia (Hgb &lt;100 g/l)&#xD;
      secondary to blood loss in order to improve oxygen delivery to vital organs including the&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that the capacity of packed red blood cells (pRBC) to improve&#xD;
      oxygen delivery to tissues diminishes with increased time in storage. This storage lesion may&#xD;
      improve with time post transfusion; however, this may take many hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other studies have shown an association between age of pRBCs transfused and length of stay in&#xD;
      trauma patients and mortality in septic ICU patients. Unused old blood is likely to be sent&#xD;
      to high volume centers to avoid wasting a precious resource.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of 'old' transfused blood have not been subject to rigorous prospective studies&#xD;
      and age of blood has not been shown to be causally related to the adverse outcomes mentioned&#xD;
      above, hence the need for further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injured brain is uniquely sensitive to further damage. Even a brief secondary insult of&#xD;
      either hypotension or hypoxia has been shown to have a significant adverse effect on outcomes&#xD;
      including permanent disability and death. Furthermore the measurement of markers of cerebral&#xD;
      oxygenation forms part of the standard care of severely head injured patients in this&#xD;
      institution giving a unique opportunity to study the effects of blood transfusion in this&#xD;
      group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of a storage lesion in pRBCs lasting even a few hours could have a significant&#xD;
      impact on the head injured patient. If indeed 'fresh' blood does significantly improve&#xD;
      markers of cerebral oxygenation when compared to older blood it could alter clinical practice&#xD;
      significantly by placing a priority on transfusing only 'fresh' blood in such patients. The&#xD;
      effect of age of pRBCs has never been studied in the head injured population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donated blood is stored for a maximum of 42 days. The average age of pRBC administered at VGH&#xD;
      is 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of transfusing &quot;fresh&quot; (blood stored less than 5 days) versus &quot;stored&quot;&#xD;
      (blood stored for greater than 20 days) pRBC on cerebral oxygen extraction. We will also&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of transfusion of pRBC on cerebral oxygen extraction in patients with&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single centre randomized trial in severely head injured patients requiring a blood&#xD;
      transfusion. Randomization will be by computer generated random numbers paced in sealed&#xD;
      envelopes. Patients would be randomized to receive either blood less than 5 days old or&#xD;
      greater than 20 days old. The decision to transfuse and all other intensive care management&#xD;
      will be unaltered by enrolment in the study.&#xD;
