  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the drug gemcitabine to two drugs, gemcitabine and&#xD;
      docetaxel, to find out which treatment is better for people with sarcomas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because better treatments for sarcomas are needed. This is a&#xD;
      phase III study. This means that one treatment is being compared to another to find out which&#xD;
      is better. We are comparing the drug gemcitabine to the two drugs gemcitabine and docetaxel&#xD;
      to find out which treatment is better for people who have sarcomas. From previous studies we&#xD;
      know that gemcitabine causes shrinking of some people's sarcoma tumors. We also know that&#xD;
      gemcitabine and docetaxel are useful for sarcomas as well, but we believe the two drugs&#xD;
      together may be more toxic than the single drug alone. In this study we are trying to answer&#xD;
      the question: &quot;Is the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel any better than just&#xD;
      gemcitabine alone?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized Phase III trial comparing two treatment regimens in patients with&#xD;
      unresectable soft tissue sarcoma. The failure rates observed on both treatment arms (failure&#xD;
      defined as progression or death) will be compared to determine which regimen results in the&#xD;
      lowest failure rate (Primary objective). As a secondary endpoint, the percentage of patients&#xD;
      who are failure-free (failure defined as progression or death) at 3 months and 6 months will&#xD;
      be compared between the two arms (Secondary objective).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial, sponsored by the North American Sarcoma Study Group of the Connective Tissue&#xD;
      Oncology Society, is being done at a number of hospitals around the country and is expected&#xD;
      to enroll up to 120 patients.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically proven soft tissue sarcoma (except the following histologies:&#xD;
             gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), Kaposi's Sarcoma, mesotheliomas&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;= 10 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recurrent or progressive disease defined as an increase in size of any existing tumor&#xD;
             mass, or the development of new tumor mass or masses, which is not amenable to&#xD;
             definitive surgical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have had another cancer but there must be convincing clinical evidence&#xD;
             that the sarcoma is the disease requiring therapeutic intervention. (ie. Several&#xD;
             sarcoma patients have had had a prior cancer (Hodgkin's disease or breast cancer)&#xD;
             treated years previously and then developed a clinically active sarcoma.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have failed no more than 3 prior chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease as defined by RECIST. Measurable disease is the presence of at&#xD;
             least one measurable lesion. If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary&#xD;
             lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology. A measurable&#xD;
             lesion is one that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest&#xD;
             diameter &gt;20 mm using conventional techniques or &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peripheral neuropathy, if present, must be &lt; or = to grade 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 3 weeks since prior chemotherapy (10 days if the patient was on imatinib,&#xD;
             thalidomide, or an interferon)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 3 weeks since prior radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total Bilirubin &lt; upper limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ALT (SGOT) or AST (SGPT) &lt;5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alkaline Phosphatase &lt; 2.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &lt; or equal to 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women of child-bearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective&#xD;
             contraception while on treatment and for a reasonable period thereafter (approximately&#xD;
             3 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the patient is 18 or older, the patient must be capable of providing written,&#xD;
             informed consent. If the patient is younger than 18, written and voluntary informed&#xD;
             consent from patient's parents or legal guardians and the patient's assent are&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Soft tissue sarcomas with the following histologies: gastrointestinal stromal tumors&#xD;
             (GIST), Kaposi's sarcoma, mesotheliomas&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active or uncontrolled infection (on antibiotic therapy for acute or chronic&#xD;
             infection)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with gemcitabine or docetaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peripheral neuropathy &gt; or = grade 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of known hypersensitivity reaction to agents formulated in polysorbate 80, the&#xD;
             solubilizing agent for docetaxel [e.g. interferon alpha-2a, children's ibuprofen&#xD;
             suspension (Advil), terconazole (Terazol), lamivudine (Epivir), etoposide, amiodarone,&#xD;
             vaccines (DtaP, influenza), bupropion (Wellbutrin), Vitamins B12, C+zinc+selenium].&#xD;
