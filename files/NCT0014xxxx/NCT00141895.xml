      Misoprostol (Cytotec®) is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog that has been marketed in the&#xD;
      United States since 1988 as a gastric cytoprotective agent. Despite a focused campaign by the&#xD;
      manufacturer to curtail its use in obstetric practice, misoprostol has, over the past several&#xD;
      years, gained widespread acceptance to effect the medical termination of pregnancy in the&#xD;
      second trimester, either alone or after pretreatment with mifepristone. The primary reasons&#xD;
      for this prompt incorporation into standard practice include its low cost and the lack of&#xD;
      stringent storage requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal administration seems to be more efficacious than when given orally. The use of&#xD;
      sublingual misoprostol for first trimester abortions has been extensively investigated as&#xD;
      evidenced by the large number of publications comparing sublingual to other routes of&#xD;
      misoprostol for first trimester pregnancy termination, on the assumption that the sublingual&#xD;
      route would have a similar efficacy of the vaginal route. In addition, the sublingual route&#xD;
      would combine an easier administration with the added advantage of no restriction of mobility&#xD;
      after administration. There has been no previous report in the literature comparing the use&#xD;
      of misoprostol given sublingually to that given vaginally for the second trimester&#xD;
      termination following intrauterine fetal death. Our aim is to compare efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction with misoprostol given vaginally (the current standard) to that given&#xD;
      sublingually.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prostaglandins have been recognized as effective abortifacients for several decades.&#xD;
      Misoprostol, a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1, has several advantages over other&#xD;
      prostaglandins that include low cost, easy storage at room temperature, and favorable side&#xD;
      effect profile. In recent years, misoprostol has attracted attention as an effective and&#xD;
      cost-efficient agent for the medical interruption of the second-trimester pregnancy.&#xD;
      Nowadays, misoprostol has been accepted widely as a safe and effective agent for labor&#xD;
      induction during the second trimester. Various doses, routes, and protocols for medical&#xD;
      termination of pregnancy during the second trimester have been investigated. The optimal&#xD;
      dosage and route of administration, however, have yet to be defined. Previous studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated greater efficacy with vaginal misoprostol versus oral administration in&#xD;
      effecting mid-trimester termination. However, oral administration of any medication is&#xD;
      preferred by patients and health care providers alike. The higher efficacy after vaginal&#xD;
      administration may be explained by the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Zeiman et al showed that&#xD;
      the systemic bioavailability of vaginally administered misoprostol is 3 times higher than&#xD;
      that after oral administration. Plasma concentrations of its metabolite, misoprostol acid,&#xD;
      peak one to two hours after vaginal application as compared with the peak seen 30 minutes&#xD;
      following oral administration, and although peak levels are lower with the vaginal route,&#xD;
      they are sustained longer and overall exposure to the drug is increased, perhaps because of&#xD;
      the presystemic gastrointestinal or hepatic metabolism that occurs with the oral route. An&#xD;
      additional explanation for the higher efficacy could be that there is a direct effect on the&#xD;
      cervix that initiates the physiologic events that lead to increased uterine contractility.&#xD;
      The sublingual route of administration has not been reported in the literature prior to 2001.&#xD;
      Since then and partly because of issues relating to patient preference, investigators started&#xD;
      studying the sublingual route of administration of misoprostol. In theory, the sublingual&#xD;
      route could mimic vaginal administration pharmacokinetically, although there have been no&#xD;
      such reported studies on this route of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many studies have been published on the use of sublingual misoprostol for medical&#xD;
      abortion in the first trimester, none were done to compare sublingual and vaginal routes in&#xD;
      the case of second trimester termination for intrauterine fetal death. The 400-µg dose was&#xD;
      chosen because it is the dose most commonly used orally and vaginally in various studies&#xD;
      reported in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, no study comparing sublingual to vaginal misoprostol for&#xD;
      termination of pregnancy for intrauterine fetal death in the second trimester has been&#xD;
      previously published in the literature. Therefore, this study, when completed will provide&#xD;
      evidence on the relative effect and safety profile of different routes of administration of&#xD;
      misoprostol for indicated second trimester termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy of a 400-µg sublingual dose of misoprostol&#xD;
      Cytotec® (Searle Pharmaceuticals, Bucks, United Kingdom) administered at 4-hour intervals&#xD;
      with an equivalent dose regimen administered vaginally in women admitted for second trimester&#xD;
      termination for intrauterine fetal death. In addition, we want to assess patient&#xD;
      acceptability of the 2 modes of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that the sublingual route of administration of misoprostol is as&#xD;
      effective as the vaginal route for induction of labor for mid trimester termination and is&#xD;
      more acceptable to patients as compared to vaginal misoprostol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization to vaginal or sublingual misoprostol will be based on a computer-generated&#xD;
      table with the allocation concealed in sealed, sequentially numbered, brown envelopes, which&#xD;
      had been prepared by the principal investigator that will not be involved in the clinical&#xD;
      care of the patients. Because of the nature of the misoprostol administration, the patients&#xD;
      and staff will not blinded to the randomization allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine studies and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pelvic exam will be done to make sure that the patient is eligible for inclusion in&#xD;
           the study (Bishop's score &lt;8).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternal pulse, blood pressure, and temperature will be recorded every 4 hours ( at the&#xD;
           time of the insertion of the Misoprostol).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After delivery of the fetus, all patients will receive 20 units of oxytocin in 1000 mL&#xD;
           of intravenous crystalloid at an infusion rate of 125 mL per hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postpartum curettage will be performed at the discretion of the physician if the&#xD;
           placenta had not delivered spontaneously 2 hours after the delivery of the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive intravenous narcotics or epidural anesthesia as needed for pain&#xD;
           control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antiemetics, antipyretics, and anxiolytics will be administered as indicated.&#xD;
           Interventions: The women will give a full informed consent, after which they will be&#xD;
           randomized to receive 400 µg of vaginal or sublingual misoprostol Cytotec® (Searle&#xD;
           Pharmaceuticals, Bucks, United Kingdom) after admission to the induction ward. This dose&#xD;
           and route of administration will be repeated every 4 hours, if required as long as the&#xD;
           patient is undelivered up to 48 hours following initiation of induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The induction will be categorized as having failed if the woman was undelivered after 48&#xD;
      hours and then she would receive extraamniotic PGF2 instillation or high-concentration&#xD;
      intravenous oxytocin, depending on their cervical status and amniotic membrane integrity.&#xD;
      Another option would be a further attempt at cervical ripening with vaginal Prostin tablets&#xD;
      (Upjohn Pharmaceuticals) after an interval of at least four hours following the last dose of&#xD;
      misoprostol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The women will complete a brief questionnaire using a visual analogue scale to ascertain&#xD;
      their perceptions of the process in terms of pain, control, and overall opinion of the&#xD;
      procedure every 12 hours. The women will perform the pain scale assessments with a visual&#xD;
      analogue ruler scaled from 0 to 10, with 0 representing no perception of pain and 10&#xD;
      representing the most intense pain ever experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be performed using the SPSS statistical&#xD;
      package. Categoric data like maternal characteristics will be compared using Chi square when&#xD;
      sample sizes support the approximation. Otherwise, categorical data will be analyzed with&#xD;
      two-tailed Fisher exact test if the expected cell frequencies were small. Continuous&#xD;
      variables will be compared by Student t test if assumptions of normality and homogeneity of&#xD;
      variances appeared to be reasonable. Unpaired variables and differences in distributions will&#xD;
      be compared using the Mann-Whitney test. A p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
