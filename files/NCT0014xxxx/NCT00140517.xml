    <textblock>
      Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine (CQ) and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP)&#xD;
      continue to spread, impeding control of this important disease. CQ and SP are still the most&#xD;
      commonly used antimalarial drugs for malaria prevention during pregnancy and might be made&#xD;
      less effective by resistance. However, the treatment and prophylaxis regimens used may also&#xD;
      create conditions for selecting resistant malaria parasite strains. A better understanding of&#xD;
      the relationships between chemoprophylaxis regimens and resistance would be helpful to&#xD;
      improve chemoprophylaxis of malaria in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work aims to improve the use of chemoprophylaxis in pregnancy by determining whether&#xD;
      there is a relationship between the use of standard prophylactic regimens with CQ and SP and&#xD;
      the occurrence of P. falciparum resistant strains in pregnant women. The study consists of 2&#xD;
      parts. The first part is a randomized trial comparing 3 chemoprophylactic treatment groups: -&#xD;
      weekly CQ after initial presumptive CQ treatment, - CQ intermittent presumptive treatment&#xD;
      given as a standard dose at 2nd and 3rd trimester, respectively and SP intermittent&#xD;
      presumptive treatment given as a single dose at 2nd and 3rd trimester, respectively. These&#xD;
      treatment groups will also be compared to a group of women delivering at the same health&#xD;
      centre but who have not been participating in the study. The second part will be a clinical&#xD;
      trial for assessment of clinical and parasitological efficacy of CQ and SP treatment in&#xD;
      pregnant women presenting with uncomplicated malaria attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted from October 2002 to March 2005 in a health centre of&#xD;
      Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso where malaria transmission is seasonal and resistance to CQ and SP&#xD;
      is low.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES Overall objective: To improve the use of malaria chemoprophylaxis in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effects of weekly CQ, intermittent presumptive treatment with CQ, and with&#xD;
      SP on placental, peripheral, and cord parasitaemia and on P. falciparum resistance status in&#xD;
      primigravidae and secundigravidae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the relationships between carriage of P. falciparum resistant strains and&#xD;
      malaria morbidity (attacks and anaemia) during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the clinical and parasitological efficacy of CQ and SP in primigravidae and&#xD;
      secundigravidae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in a peripheral health centre of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, West&#xD;
      Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The largest part of the country is tropical savannah with a rainy season from June to October&#xD;
      (average rainfall: 1000 mm per year, mean temperature &gt; 25°C), a cold dry season from&#xD;
      November to February, (min. temp. 15°C) and a hot dry season from March to May. Malaria&#xD;
      transmission is seasonal (June to December)and the major mosquito vectors are A. gambiae, A.&#xD;
      funestus and A. arabiensis. Malaria morbidity represents 30 to 50% of febrile illnesses and&#xD;
      is the most frequent reason for health centres attendance and hospitals admission.Since it's&#xD;
      first notification in 1986, P. falciparum resistance to CQ increased slowly with a&#xD;
      considerable variation in space and time and resistance to SP has remained low. CQ clinical&#xD;
      failures are in general less than 20% in 6-59 months children and parasitological resistance&#xD;
      is around 30%. Malaria prevention in pregnancy is given as weekly 300 mg CQ following a&#xD;
      presumptive initial treatment as recommended by the national malaria control programme (MOH).&#xD;
      ANC services in health centres provide pregnant women with CQ and haematinics. The health&#xD;
      centre 'Centre médical Paul VI' is a peri-urban health facility of Ouagadougou. It comprises&#xD;
      general outpatient consultation service, paediatric and maternity wards, and a&#xD;
      laboratory.Patients come from the peri-urban districts and the neighbouring villages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Comparative randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups will be studied. Pregnant women (primigravidae and secundigravidae from 12 to 24&#xD;
      weeks of pregnancy) will be randomly assigned, using random numbers lists, to treatment&#xD;
      groups A to C as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A : pregnant women receiving weekly 300 mg CQ prophylaxis after a curative dose&#xD;
           (10mg/kg at days 1 and 2 +5mg/kg at day 3) at the first visit ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B : pregnant women receiving a presumptive CQ treatment at the 2nd and 3rd&#xD;
           trimester of pregnancy (10mg/kg at days 1 and 2 +5mg/kg at day 3);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C: pregnant women receiving a presumptive SP treatment at the 2nd and 3rd&#xD;
           trimester of pregnancy (25mg sulfadoxine + 1,25mg pyrimethamine/kg in a single dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another group composed of primiparous and secundiparous women who are not part of the study&#xD;
      and who come to deliver at the health centre (group D) and who have not received chloroquine&#xD;
      prophylaxis during pregnancy will be considered as reflecting the normal situation and act as&#xD;
      a control group. These women will only be included during the first three months of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. personal information, anthropometric measures, clinical data, and obstetrical history,&#xD;
           will be recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. fingerprick blood will be collected for a thick and a thin blood smear, Hb and on filter&#xD;
           paper for subsequent PCR tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment: The single dose of SP and the 3 days of CQ treatment will be administered&#xD;
           supervised by the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be invited to come to the follow up visits or any time they feel sick&#xD;
      or need health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits at the beginning of second and third trimester will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a clinical and parasitological examination. The health events since the previous visit&#xD;
           will be recorded, Hb&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. providing chemoprophylaxis or treatment in accordance with the treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At delivery, the following data will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. delivery outcomes (birth weight, mode of delivery, APGAR score)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. mother's peripheral blood for thick blood smear, Hb and filter paper for PCR&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. placental blood for thick blood smear, and collection on filter paper for PCR&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. cord blood for thick blood smear. If positive blood will be collected on filter paper&#xD;
           for PCR&#xD;
&#xD;
           b)Clinical trial for the assessment of clinical and parasitological efficacy of CQ and&#xD;
           SP in pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primigravidae and secundigravidae women presenting with an uncomplicated malaria attack&#xD;
           will be randomly treated with CQ or SP and regularly followed up to assess clinical and&#xD;
           parasitological efficacy. A molecular analysis of parasite gene mutations conferring&#xD;
           resistance to chloroquine (PfCRT), and antifolates (DHFR, DHPS) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patients will randomly assigned to treatment with either CQ or SP. They will then be&#xD;
           followed-up during 28 days in accordance with WHO protocol. The follow up criteria are&#xD;
           clinical (body temperature) and parasitological (peripheral parasitaemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a) Comparative randomized trial: Considering the prevalence of placenta parasitaemia to&#xD;
           be 35% in pregnant women who do not get prophylaxis, 24% in women with weekly CQ&#xD;
           prophylaxis, 15% in women with intermittent presumptive treatment with CQ and 5% in&#xD;
           women with intermittent presumptive treatment with SP, and using a significance level of&#xD;
           5%, a power of 80% and 20% drop-out, each group should include 200 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a) Drug efficacy assessment in pregnant women Considering the proportion of pregnant&#xD;
           women with clinical failures to be 10-15% for chloroquine, and using a significance&#xD;
           level of 5%, a power of 80% and 20% drop-out, a sample of 42 subjects should be&#xD;
           included.&#xD;

                - malaria diagnosis: a thick and thin smear of fingerprick blood will be prepared&#xD;
                from each subject. Thin films will be fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa&#xD;
                in phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 30 min. and examined with a 100X oil immersion&#xD;
                objective. The parasite species will be determined on the thin film and the&#xD;
                parasites densities evaluated on the thick film by counting the number of asexual&#xD;
                P.falciparum parasites against 200 leukocytes and expressed as number of parasites&#xD;
                by microliter (µl) of blood assuming a standard leukocyte count of 8000/µl. At&#xD;
                least 100 thick film fields will be examined to declare a slide negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Blood collection on filter paper: fingerprick blood will be collected on&#xD;
                     Whatmann 3MM chromatography filter paper. About 80-100 µl blood will be&#xD;
                     directly blotted on the paper strips, air dried and individually placed in&#xD;
                     plastic bag and conserved at room temperature in bottles containing silicagel.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  HB will be measured using a HemoCue portable photometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays will be performed from blood on filter&#xD;
                     papers using the methods described by Jelinek et al., 1999, for resistance to&#xD;
                     antifolates and by Djimde et al.2001 for resistance to CQ.&#xD;

                follow up. Those lost of follow up will be actively searched for the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The WHO 28 days &quot;assessment of therapeutic efficacy of antimalarials drugs for&#xD;
                uncomplicated falciparum malaria in areas with intense transmission protocol&quot; will&#xD;
                be used, adapted to pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Data handling and statistical analysis All data will be recorded in pre-designed&#xD;
                and tested questionnaires and/or registers. Then they will be progressively&#xD;
                entered, cleared, checked and analysed using SPSS software.&#xD;
&#xD;
                For the comparative randomized trial, a general analysis will aim to describe the&#xD;
                study samples through the calculation of variables means (e.g. age, parity,&#xD;
                parasite density, haemoglobin concentrations, birthweight), the frequency of some&#xD;
                clinical data as malaria attacks, clinical results, delivery outcomes, mutations&#xD;
                profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Then a comparative analysis will compare the proportions of main variables between&#xD;
                the different treatment groups (peripheral, placenta, and cord blood parasitaemia,&#xD;
                LBW, prevalence of resistant strains, mutations profiles, clinical and&#xD;
                parasitological responses) using the chi-square test. The means (birthweight,&#xD;
                haemoglobin concentrations, and number of clinical attacks) will be compared&#xD;
                between groups by t-test and one way analysis of variance. Stratified or&#xD;
                multivariate analysis tests will be used when necessary.&#xD;
