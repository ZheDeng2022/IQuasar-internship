  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood and marrow stem cell transplant has improved the outcome for patients with high-risk&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies. However, most patients do not have an appropriate HLA (immune type)&#xD;
      matched sibling donor available and/or are unable to identify an acceptable unrelated HLA&#xD;
      matched donor through the registries in a timely manner. Another option is haploidentical&#xD;
      transplant using a partially matched family member donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although haploidentical transplant has proven curative in many patients, this procedure has&#xD;
      been hindered by significant complications, primarily regimen-related toxicity including GVHD&#xD;
      and infection due to delayed immune reconstitution. These can, in part, be due to certain&#xD;
      white blood cells in the graft called T cells. GVHD happens when the donor T cells recognize&#xD;
      the body tissues of the patient (the host) are different and attack these cells. Although too&#xD;
      many T cells increase the possibility of GVHD, too few may cause the recipient's immune&#xD;
      system to reconstitute slowly or the graft to fail to grow, leaving the patient at high-risk&#xD;
      for significant infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, a primary focus for researchers is to engineer the graft to provide a T&#xD;
      cell dose that will reduce the risk for GVHD, yet provide a sufficient number of cells to&#xD;
      facilitate immune reconstitution and graft integrity. Building on prior institutional trials,&#xD;
      this study will provide patients with a haploidentical graft engineered to specific T cell&#xD;
      target values using the CliniMACS system. A reduced intensity, preparative regimen will be&#xD;
      used in an effort to reduce regimen-related toxicity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of patients were enrolled on this study. One group included those with high-risk&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies and the second group included participants with refractory&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies or undergoing a second transplant. The primary aim of the study was&#xD;
      to estimate the relapse rate in the one group of research participants with refractory&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies or those undergoing second allogeneic transplant. Both groups will&#xD;
      be followed and analyzed separately in regards to the secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was closed to accrual on April 2006 as it met the specific safety stopping rules&#xD;
      regarding occurrence of severe graft vs. host disease. Although this study is no longer open&#xD;
      to accrual, the treated participants continue to be followed as directed by the protocol.&#xD;

      Secondary outcome evaluations for this clinical study included the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate one-year overall survival for research participants with high risk&#xD;
           malignancies who receive a haploidentical HSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare overall survival and cumulative incidence of relapse for the two groups of&#xD;
           patients with their corresponding historical controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate disease-free survival and event-free survival in participants with&#xD;
           hematologic malignancies who receive a haploidentical HSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the incidence of overall grade 3-4 acute GvHD in research participants with&#xD;
           hematologic malignancies who receive a haploidentical HSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the incidence of chronic GvHD and graft failure in research participants&#xD;
           with hematologic malignancies who receive a haploidentical HSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the incidence of non-hematologic regimen-related toxicity and&#xD;
           regimen-related mortality in the first 100 days post-transplant in research participants&#xD;
           with hematologic malignancies who receive a haploidentical HSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the number of research participants who develop evidence of EBV reactivation&#xD;
           or post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLPD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe disease-free survival, GvHD and engraftment in research participants&#xD;
           receiving grafts from Killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) mismatched and KIR&#xD;
           matched haploidentical donors&#xD;

Transplant recipients received a reduced intensity conditioning regimen consisting of OKT-3, fludarabine, thiotepa, and melphalan followed by an infusion of a T-cell depleted haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell graft. The antibody Rituximab was administered within 24 hours of the infusion in an effort to prevent PTLPD. In addition to T -cell depletion of the donor product, Mycophenylate mofetil was provided over several months as prophylaxis for GVHD</description>
