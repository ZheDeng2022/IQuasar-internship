  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to determine whether immunization with the MAGE-3.A1 peptide&#xD;
      mixed with CpG 7909 results in a detectable immune response; to determine the safety of this&#xD;
      vaccine and to document the tumor response to the vaccine.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be vaccinated every two weeks on six occasions. On each vaccination day, the&#xD;
      MAGE-3.A1 peptide (300 µg) mixed with CpG 7909 (5 mg) will be administered twice&#xD;
      intradermally (10% of the dose each) and twice subcutaneously (40% of the dose each) in the&#xD;
      arms and thighs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor staging will be performed before inclusion and at week 13. PBL collections will be&#xD;
      performed before starting the treatment, and at weeks 3, 7 and 13. They will provide the T&#xD;
      lymphocytes for the immunological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional cycles of immunization will be proposed to patients without tumor progression&#xD;
      requiring another treatment. A second cycle of 3 injections at 6-week intervals will be&#xD;
      started at week 17 with the same vaccine, followed by a third cycle of 12 injections at&#xD;
      3-month intervals starting at month 11. At any time, progression of the disease necessitating&#xD;
      any treatment not allowed during the study, will result in study withdrawal.&#xD;

    <description>Blood samples were collected prior to treatment and in weeks 3, 7, and 13.

    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>All adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Scale, version 3.0.&#xD;
DLT was defined as:&#xD;
Any Grade 3 hematological or non-hematological toxicity other than skin or flu-like symptoms.&#xD;
Any Grade 4 toxicity. To be dose-limiting, an adverse event must be definitely, probably, or possibly related to the administration of MAGE-3.A1 peptide mixed with CpG 7909.</description>

    <measure>To Determine the Clinical Effectiveness of the Treatment by Measuring Tumor Response in Patients With Measurable Disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Computed tomography (CT) scans were performed at screening, and at week 13. Response was assessed using RECIST version 1.0 (Therasse et al, J Natl Cancer Inst 2000; 92:205-16). Per RECIST, target lesions are categorized as follows: complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions (no evaluable disease); partial response (PR): ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; progressive disease (PD): ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; stable disease (SD): small changes that do not meet above criteria.</description>

Per RECIST, target lesions are categorized as follows: complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions (no evaluable disease); partial response (PR): ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; progressive disease (PD): ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; stable disease (SD): small changes that do not meet above criteria.</description>
