      Overall Aim: The overall aim of this study is to identify - from a societal perspective - the&#xD;
      costs and associated benefits of three strategies for implementing a practice guideline that&#xD;
      addresses the management of croup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Strategies: The intervention strategies to be compared will be mailing of&#xD;
      printed educational materials (the &quot;Standard intervention&quot;), mailing plus a combination of&#xD;
      interactive educational meetings, educational outreach visits, and reminders (a &quot;Saturn&#xD;
      intervention&quot;), and a combination of mailing, interactive sessions, outreach visits,&#xD;
      reminders plus identification of local opinion leaders and establishment of local consensus&#xD;
      processes (a &quot;Cadillac intervention&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine which of the three intervention strategies are most effective&#xD;
      at lowering the rate of hospital days per 1,000 disease episodes. The null hypothesis is that&#xD;
      none of the intervention strategies reduce hospital utilization rates from baseline. The&#xD;
      alternate hypothesis is that the intervention strategies will have a graded degree of effect&#xD;
      on hospitalization rates, with the 'Standard intervention' having minimal to no effect, the&#xD;
      'Saturn intervention' having moderate but significant effect, and the 'Cadillac intervention'&#xD;
      having the greatest effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To determine which of the three dissemination strategies are most&#xD;
      effective at increasing the use of therapies of known benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic Analysis: To determine which of the three intervention strategies will most&#xD;
      effectively reduce total societal costs including all health care costs, costs borne by the&#xD;
      family, and costs stemming from the strategies for disseminating guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Objectives: To determine which dissemination strategy will most effectively maintain or&#xD;
      improve clinical outcomes and maintain or reduce the family psychosocial burden. Clinical&#xD;
      outcomes assessed will include both uncommon severe events such as endotracheal intubation,&#xD;
      respiratory arrest, and death, as well as average duration of clinical symptoms. The&#xD;
      assessment of family psychosocial burden will include the number of hours of sleep missed by&#xD;
      the child, and the stress experienced by the primary caregiver (most commonly the mother).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: The study objectives will be achieved through the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We are completing a baseline survey which a) documents Alberta-wide utilization rates&#xD;
           for health care services; b) documents severe adverse outcomes Alberta-wide; c) rank&#xD;
           orders Alberta hospitals based on rates of hospitalization; d) documents therapeutic&#xD;
           practices in 24 selected Alberta hospitals; and e) documents, through the use of a&#xD;
           prospectively administered survey, the psychosocial burden of the disease on families in&#xD;
           the same 24 Alberta hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We are developing clinical guidelines that address indications for drug therapy and&#xD;
           hospital admission/discharge criteria. Development of these guidelines have included the&#xD;
           following: a)convening an expert panel; b) critically reviewing the published&#xD;
           literature; c) drafting guidelines which meet standard criteria for developing&#xD;
           guidelines; d) obtaining approval of the guidelines by the Canadian Pediatric Society,&#xD;
           Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, and the Alberta Medical Association; and&#xD;
           e) publishing the guidelines in journals such as the CMAJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. We have identified 24 Alberta hospitals and will randomize them to one of the three&#xD;
           dissemination strategies outlined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. We will complete a follow-up survey which a) documents Alberta-wide severe adverse&#xD;
           outcomes and utilization rates; b) documents practice patterns in the same 24 Alberta&#xD;
           hospitals surveyed at baseline; and c) documents the psychosocial burden of the disease&#xD;
           on families in these same hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. We will complete a statistical analysis comparing the three randomized groups of&#xD;
           hospitals in terms of the change in health care utilization, change in physician use of&#xD;
           effective therapies, and change in the psychosocial burden of the disease on families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. We will complete an economic analysis that compares the change in benefits derived from&#xD;
           the three types of dissemination strategies with the relative costs (change in health&#xD;
           care costs, relative costs associated with the three types of dissemination strategies,&#xD;
           and change in costs borne by the family such as lost wages).&#xD;
