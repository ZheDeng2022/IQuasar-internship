  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wuchereria bancrofti, is a mosquito-transmitted parasite that causes deforming lymphatic&#xD;
      filariasis in the tropics. Improved treatment methods have led to new thinking that it should&#xD;
      be possible to interrupt transmission and eliminate this major public health problem by&#xD;
      repeated, annual cycles of mass treatment with new single dose combination drug regimens.&#xD;
      Egyptian villages involved in the study will be surveyed. Household members above 4 years of&#xD;
      age will be tested for filariasis. Also, children in the first year classes of primary&#xD;
      schools (5 to 6 years of age) will be tested for parasite infection. Village populations will&#xD;
      be treated for filariasis as part of the MOH national filariasis elimination program.&#xD;
      Children under age 5, pregnant women, and people with severe underlying illness are excluded&#xD;
      from the program.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Approximately 100 million people are infected with Wuchereria bancrofti, a&#xD;
      mosquito-transmitted nemotade parasite that causes deforming lymphatic filariasis in the&#xD;
      tropics. Improved therapies and diagnostic methods have led to new thinking about lymphatic&#xD;
      filariasis and the realization that it should be possible to interrupt transmission and&#xD;
      eliminate the major public health problem by repeated, annual cycles of mass treatment with&#xD;
      new single dose combination drug regimens. The Egyptian Ministry of Health is about to&#xD;
      institute annual mass therapy with Albendazole (ALB) and diethylcarbamazine (DEC) in all&#xD;
      filariasis endemic villages in the country with the aim of eliminating filariasis. This study&#xD;
      comprises 4 different activities involving human subjects: These are Village studies of&#xD;
      filariasis prevalence and intensity, school studies of antibody prevalence, A treatment trial&#xD;
      with an assessment of infectivity of humans with mosquito feeding before and after treatment.&#xD;
      Pre-control evaluations of villages will be performed in year 1. Mass treatment will be&#xD;
      conducted annually by the MOH, beginning late in year one or early in year 2. Timing of&#xD;
      annual follow-up evaluations in years 2-4 will be coordinated with the MOH so that specimens&#xD;
      are collected at least 6 months after mass treatment but prior to the next distribution of&#xD;
      medication. It is anticipated that the third follow-up collection will be completed by the&#xD;
      end of year 4. A final set of follow-up specimens will be collected in year 5 if time&#xD;
      permits. The treatment trial will compare effects of diethylcarbamzine (6 mg/kg) and&#xD;
      albendazole (400 mg) given as a single dose, 7 consecutive daily doses, or once weekly for 4&#xD;
      weeks. Antibody prevalence in young children (school studies), 200-300/school; infection&#xD;
      prevalence studies (village studies sampling humans and mosquitoes), 100 houses (approx. 500&#xD;
      people) per village; treatment trial, n = 60 (20 per treatment group). The project will&#xD;
      attempt to measure effects of mass therapy with tools developed in prior studies. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that infection prevalence rates and infection intensities will decrease following&#xD;
      mass therapy. A successful program should lead to elimination of filariasis over time.&#xD;
