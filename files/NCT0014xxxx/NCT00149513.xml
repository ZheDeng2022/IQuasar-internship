    <textblock>
      King County Lung Injury Project: Survivor Outcome Study (KCLIP:SOS) is a randomized trial for&#xD;
      individuals who have survived prolonged mechanical ventilation (5 days or more). The&#xD;
      objective is to enroll individuals who are likely to have impaired health status resulting&#xD;
      from prolonged critical illness but whose long term prognosis is good. Such individuals are&#xD;
      most likely to benefit from the study intervention of case management targeted at post&#xD;
      intensive care complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KCLIP:SOS will test whether an outpatient intervention based on a nurse using a targeted case&#xD;
      management tool can reduce patient morbidity and improve quality of life in the 6 months&#xD;
      following hospital discharge. This intervention will be compared to usual post-hospital care.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to understand individuals' physical and emotional conditions and&#xD;
      concerns after being ventilated in the hospital. Modern hospital care helps many people&#xD;
      survive even if they are on ventilators for long periods of time. Some individuals who leave&#xD;
      the hospital after this kind of intensive care suffer from depression, post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder, muscle weakness, tiredness or breathing difficulties that may decrease their&#xD;
      quality of life. Doctors know little about finding and treating these problems in survivors&#xD;
      of mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned in blocks of 10 (5 participants to usual care and 5&#xD;
      participants to case management) for home or skilled nursing facility discharges. The Outcome&#xD;
      Assessors (the interviewers collecting outcomes data) will be blinded to group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: All participants will have a baseline interview soon after hospital&#xD;
      discharge and a final interview at the end of the 6-month intervention period (outcome&#xD;
      assessments). All subjects will be asked to keep a diary/journal of their medical&#xD;
      appointments, health services, and medications. Participants will be called once a month to&#xD;
      collect this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key secondary outcomes: Case management participants will be contacted by the nurse case&#xD;
      manager who will provide follow-up care for 6 months. At the end of the study, interview&#xD;
      results will be sent to the personal physician of the usual care participants so that&#xD;
      appropriate care can follow.&#xD;
