  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this randomised trial is to determine the effects of a short&#xD;
      peri-operative course of treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID),&#xD;
      ibuprofen, on the long-term consequences of ectopic bone formation in patients undergoing&#xD;
      elective total hip replacement surgery. The specific hypotheses to be tested at that 6 to 12&#xD;
      months after surgery, patients assigned post-operative ibuprofen will have less self-reported&#xD;
      pain and physical disability, greater health-related quality of life and reduced ectopic bone&#xD;
      formation compared with those assigned placebo.&#xD;

      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. 1000 patients&#xD;
      undergoing elective total hip replacement surgery from 20 orthopaedic centres in Australia&#xD;
      and New Zealand will be assigned to receive either ibuprofen (1200mg daily) or matching&#xD;
      placebo in 3 divided doses for 14 days. Study treatment will be started postoperatively on&#xD;
      the day of surgery. Patient should not receive any other NSAIDs, apart from low dose aspirin,&#xD;
      during the 14-day treatment period, unless such treatment becomes definitely indicated, in&#xD;
      which case the study treatment should be withdrawn and open label treatment provided. There&#xD;
      will be no other changes to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient scheduled for elective total hip replacement surgery, or revision thereof, are&#xD;
      potentially eligible unless there is a definite indication for or contraindication to&#xD;
      treatment with a NSAID during the 14-day treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be performed centrally using a computer-based system that can be accessed&#xD;
      24 hours a day by a toll-free telephone call. A minimisation program will stratify treatment&#xD;
      allocation by centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome are self-reported pain and physical function, 6 to 12 months after&#xD;
      randomisation. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life, patients' global&#xD;
      assessment, radiographic evidence of ectopic bone.&#xD;
