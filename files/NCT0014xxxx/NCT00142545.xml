      The current protocol is designed to satisfy the need for a compassionate use treatment&#xD;
      protocol as well as for a long-term open label follow-up study.&#xD;

      The primary objective of APO401 was to gain additional safety data in the outpatient use of&#xD;
      apomorphine. APO401 provided an opportunity for all patients who had participated in a&#xD;
      Mylan-sponsored placebo controlled trial of apomorphine to receive apomorphine therapy as&#xD;
      ambulatory outpatients. Patients other than those enrolled in a Mylan-sponsored study were&#xD;
      allowed to participate. Additional data regarding the safety and effectiveness of outpatient&#xD;
      use of subcutaneous apomorphine were derived from this experience.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior participation in a MYLAN sponsored study of subcutaneous apomorphine&#xD;
             administration for the treatment of Off episodes due to end-of-dose motor&#xD;
             deterioration (&quot;Wearing-Off&quot; effect) or sudden loss of mobility at seemingly random&#xD;
             intervals (&quot;On-Off&quot; effect). With prior approval from MYLAN, patients other than those&#xD;
             enrolled in a MYLAN sponsored study were allowed to participate. Following approval of&#xD;
             Amendment 01, patients who met all other criteria for inclusion, regardless of&#xD;
             previous participation in an apomorphine study, were allowed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: Adults of any age &gt; 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sex: Men and non-pregnant, non-lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have had a negative serum (Beta HCG) pregnancy&#xD;
             test within 14 days of the study start.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have used an acceptable form of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's Disease, i.e., not&#xD;
             induced by drugs or caused by other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients classified as stage II - V of the Hoehn and Yahr scale for staging the&#xD;
             severity of Parkinson's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with refractory motor fluctuations of any frequency or duration. These&#xD;
             include but are not necessarily limited to patients with the following symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Immobility resulting from regular dose failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Severe Off period discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Nocturnal/early morning dystonias.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Voiding dysfunctions.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Swallowing difficulties associated with Off periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Off period visual hallucinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Severe biphasic dyskinesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient (or a caregiver) had to be able to recognize an Off state, and be&#xD;
             sufficiently motivated to learn how to use the apomorphine injection to control these&#xD;
             periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient (or a caregiver) had to be able to maintain On-Off diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unless otherwise specified, enrolled patients must be on an optimally maximized oral&#xD;
             therapy regimen. Optimized oral anti-PD medication included: levodopa/carbidopa in&#xD;
             either immediate or delayed release forms, plus at least one direct acting oral&#xD;
             dopamine agonist for at least 30 days prior to enrollment into study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients under medical therapy for clinically significant psychoses or dementia not&#xD;
             related to ingestion of anti-PD medications. (Patients with hallucinations or other&#xD;
             central adverse reactions associated solely with anti-PD medications were not&#xD;
             excluded.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of drug or alcohol dependency within one year prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with unstable and clinically significant disease of cardiovascular (including&#xD;
             orthostatic hypotension), hematologic (including Coombs' positive hemolytic anemia),&#xD;
             hepatic, renal, metabolic, respiratory, gastrointestinal or endocrinological systems&#xD;
             or neoplasm within the three months before the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of true allergy to morphine or its derivatives (including&#xD;
             apomorphine), sulfur, sulfur containing medication, sulfites, sulfates, Tigan(R)&#xD;
             (trimethobenzamide).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients treated with experimental agents (other than apomorphine intermittent&#xD;
             subcutaneous injections) within 30 days before study entry. Patients with&#xD;
             participation in Bertek-sponsored study APO202 were excluded from participation in&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose apomorphine regimen was characterized by administration methods other&#xD;
             than intermittent subcutaneous injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
