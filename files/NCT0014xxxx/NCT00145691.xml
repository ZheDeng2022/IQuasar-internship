  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We intend to conduct a phase III b trial to verify Oxcarbazepine's effect in agitation and&#xD;
      aggression in patients with dementia. We designed the study as a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled multi center trial. Hundred patients will be included. The treatment&#xD;
      period will be eight weeks, with a further follow up of four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the reduction in aggression and agitation as measured by&#xD;
      means of NPI-NH-subscale agitation / aggression (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Nursing Home&#xD;
      Version). Secondary outcomes are reduction in aggression as measured by BARS (Behavior&#xD;
      Agitation Rating Scale)and reduction in the burden to health-care personnel as measured by&#xD;
      NPI-NH.&#xD;
