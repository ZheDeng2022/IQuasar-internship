  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria and HIV are among the most important infectious diseases in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa. Approximately two-thirds of the estimated 35 million HIV infected persons&#xD;
      live in sub-Saharan Africa. Of the 300-500 million annual cases of malaria infection&#xD;
      occurring worldwide, about 90% of P. falciparum infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa,&#xD;
      resulting in approximately 1 million deaths, mostly in children under five years of age. It&#xD;
      is clear that HIV and malaria are responsible for substantial disease, suffering, and an&#xD;
      enormous economic burden on the people who can least afford it. Although a study in 1993 in&#xD;
      Tanzania showed significantly higher prevalence of malaria infections in HIV-positive&#xD;
      compared to HIV negative adults, until recently there have been few studies showing any&#xD;
      association between the two infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a study to measure the efficacy of the then-first line antimalarial drug&#xD;
      (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) among patients in three study arms: those who were HIV negative,&#xD;
      those who were HIV infected with CD4 cell counts &lt; 200, and among HIV infected patients with&#xD;
      CD4 cell counts &gt;= 200. Our hypothesis is that patients with HIV infection and low CD4 cell&#xD;
      count will not respond to antimalarial therapy as well as patients who are HIV infected with&#xD;
      higher CD4 cell counts or who are HIV negative.&#xD;

      The study was conducted at Siaya District Hospital, in Nyanza Province, Kenya. Non-pregnant&#xD;
      adults who provided consent to participate, who were found to have pure Plasmodium falciparum&#xD;
      malaria parasitemia with at least 500 asexual parasites per microliter, and who agreed to&#xD;
      undergo HIV counseling and testing were eligible for participation. Clients were then&#xD;
      followed with repeat physical examinations and blood smears on day 1,2,3,4,7,14,21 and 28 and&#xD;
      any non-scheduled day when they were sick. Those that failed therapy were treated with&#xD;
      quinine to clear parasitemia. Samples were also taken to measure reinfection vs.&#xD;
      recrudescence, pharmacokinetics, and antifolate resistance markers.&#xD;
