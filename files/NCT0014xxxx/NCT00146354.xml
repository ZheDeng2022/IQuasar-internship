  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to define the problem of results that return after patient discharge and to&#xD;
      study the implementation of an Electronic Medical Record (EMR)-based system for tracking&#xD;
      these results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The transfer of care at hospital discharge is complex and requires the transmission of large&#xD;
      amounts of data between inpatient physicians (hospitalists) and outpatient physicians (PCPs),&#xD;
      including information about pending tests. Frequently, laboratory and radiology tests are not&#xD;
      finalized until after a patient is discharged, and when the responsibility for these pending&#xD;
      results is not clearly defined, they can be missed. Our project aims to define the problem of&#xD;
      these post-discharge results and to study the implementation of an EMR-based system&#xD;
      (Hospitalist Results Manager, HRM) for tracking these results on the hospitalist services at&#xD;
      Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The project&#xD;
      consists of two phases: a cross-sectional study before intervention to define the&#xD;
      epidemiology of post-discharge results, and a randomized trial of HRM to determine its effect&#xD;
      on physician awareness of these results.&#xD;
