  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relapsed disease is the most common cause of death in children with hematological&#xD;
      malignancies. Patients who fail high-intensity conventional chemotherapeutic regimens or&#xD;
      relapse after stem cell transplantation have a poor prognosis. Toxicity from multiple&#xD;
      therapies and elevated leukemic/tumor burden usually make these patients ineligible for the&#xD;
      aggressive chemotherapy regimens required for conventional stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
      Alternative options are needed. One type of treatment being explored is called haploidentical&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional blood or bone marrow stem cell transplant involves destroying the patient's&#xD;
      diseased marrow with radiation or chemotherapy. Healthy marrow from a donor is then infused&#xD;
      into the patient where it migrates to the bone marrow space to begin generating new blood&#xD;
      cells. The best type of donor is a sibling or unrelated donor with an identical immune system&#xD;
      (HLA &quot;match&quot;). However, most patients do not have a matched sibling available and/or are&#xD;
      unable to identify an acceptable unrelated donor through the registries in a timely manner.&#xD;
      In addition, the aggressive treatment required to prepare the body for these types of&#xD;
      transplants can be too toxic for these highly pretreated patients. Therefore doctors are&#xD;
      investigating haploidentical transplant using stem cells from HLA partially matched family&#xD;
      member donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although haploidentical transplant has proven curative in many patients, this procedure has&#xD;
      been hindered by significant complications, primarily regimen-related toxicity including&#xD;
      graft versus host disease (GVHD), and infection due to delayed immune reconstitution. These&#xD;
      can, in part, be due to certain white blood cells in the graft called T cells. GVHD happens&#xD;
      when the donor T cells recognize the patient's (the host) body tissues are different and&#xD;
      attack these cells. Although too many T cells increase the possibility of GVHD, too few may&#xD;
      cause the recipient's immune system to reconstitute slowly or the graft to fail to grow,&#xD;
      leaving the patient at high-risk for infection. However, the presence of T cells in the graft&#xD;
      may offer a positive effect called graft versus malignancy or GVM. With GVM, the donor T&#xD;
      cells recognize the patient's malignant cells as diseased and, in turn, attack these diseased&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, a primary focus for researchers is to engineer the graft to provide a T&#xD;
      cell depleted product to reduce the risk of GVHD, yet provide a sufficient number of cells to&#xD;
      facilitate immune reconstitution, graft integrity and GVM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients were given a haploidentical graft engineered to with specific T cell&#xD;
      parameter values using the CliniMACS system. A reduced intensity, preparative regimen was&#xD;
      used to reduce regimen-related toxicity and mortality. The primary goal of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate overall survival in those who receive this study treatment.&#xD;

      Secondary objectives for this protocol are to 1) assess the kinetics of lymphohematopoietic&#xD;
      reconstitution and 2) describe the short and long-term (up to 5 years post- transplant)&#xD;
      toxicity of haploidentical stem cell transplantation, including GVHD, in children with&#xD;
      refractory hematological malignancies.&#xD;
