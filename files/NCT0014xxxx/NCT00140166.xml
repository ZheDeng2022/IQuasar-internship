  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controlled studies using the orthomolecular approach have been few (Deutsch, Ananth, &amp; Ban,&#xD;
      1977). Those that were done were performed in chronic schizophrenia or in populations that&#xD;
      included bipolar and schizoaffective patients. Both of these diagnostic groups are not today&#xD;
      considered to benefit from the orthomolecular approach. Moreover, some negative studies of&#xD;
      high-dose niacin were done in patients who were not otherwise given general counseling for&#xD;
      good diet as described above. Therefore, this proposal is to study in a controlled manner&#xD;
      carefully defined first onset schizophrenic patients using the protocol advocated by Osmond&#xD;
      and Hoffer (1962). Patients can enter the study if they have been ill less than 1 year and&#xD;
      are in their first hospitalization.&#xD;

      Controlled studies using the orthomolecular approach have been few (Deutsch, Ananth, &amp; Ban,&#xD;
      1977). Those that were done were performed in chronic schizophrenia or in populations that&#xD;
      included bipolar and schizoaffective patients. Both of these diagnostic groups are not today&#xD;
      considered to benefit from the orthomolecular approach. Moreover, some negative studies of&#xD;
      high-dose niacin were done in patients who were not otherwise given general counseling for&#xD;
      good diet as described above. Therefore, this proposal is to study in a controlled manner&#xD;
      carefully defined first onset schizophrenic patients using the protocol advocated by Osmond&#xD;
      and Hoffer (1962). Patients can enter the study if they have been ill less than 1 year and&#xD;
      are in their first hospitalization. Our Beersheba Mental Health Center is the only&#xD;
      hospitalization facility for Southern Israel, population of half a million. There about 2&#xD;
      thousand admissions to our hospital yearly and of those there are over 100 admissions with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder for whom this is the first lifetime&#xD;
      admission to hospital and their first episode of psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study I - Open Pilot The pilot study will be carried out exactly as below, except&#xD;
      without a control group. Results from the pilot will be evaluated before continuing to the&#xD;
      controlled study, and protocol modifications presented to the Helsinki Committee if&#xD;
      necessary. Ten patients will be studied in this open pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study II - Controlled Study, Not Blind Inclusion and exclusion criteria Patients can be&#xD;
      accepted to the study age 18-30, if admitting diagnosis after review by the study coordinator&#xD;
      is schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder by DSM-IV. Since the diagnosis of schizophrenia&#xD;
      may be difficult in the early stages of acute psychotic disease, cases in which the clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis is consistent with and suspicious of schizophrenia (and inconsistent with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder) even if they do not fulfill all the diagnostic criteria in DSM-IV will be accepted.&#xD;
      Patients with alcohol or drug abuse in the last 6 months will be excluded. Patients with&#xD;
      significant physical illness including peptic ulcer, or a history of hepatitis or baseline&#xD;
      abnormal liver function tests will be excluded. Patients with mental retardation will be&#xD;
      excluded. Baseline screening will be done for liver function (including AST, bilirubin,&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase and LDH) and blood glucose and then repeated after 6 weeks. Elevations&#xD;
      of AST over three fold will lead to dropping patient from study. Patients who are unlikely to&#xD;
      be able to continue in the study as outpatients will be excluded. Patients will be admitted&#xD;
      to study only if this is their first lifetime psychiatric admission and their first episode&#xD;
      of psychosis and only if history supports that they have been mentally ill for less than one&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Patients who enter the program will be treated with risperidone, 2-8mg daily at&#xD;
      physician's discretion . They will be randomized according to a predetermined random order to&#xD;
      vitamin regime or Centrum forte. Doses of risperidone will be lowered as clinically possible.&#xD;
      Risperidone dose will be recorded weekly and will serve as a secondary outcome measure. A&#xD;
      registered dietician will meet with each patient weekly and discourage refined sugar or&#xD;
      excess fat and encourage regular fruit and vegetable consumption. High protein breakfast will&#xD;
      be emphasized. Fifteen patients will be started yearly for three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vitamin regimen will be as follows twice daily with food:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ascorbic acid 1.5 g twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 150 mg vitamin B6 twice daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Niacinamide 500 mg tablets, 3 tablets (1.5g) twice daily with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Centrum Forte, one tablet each morning with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison group will receive Centrum Forte once per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be rated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) at baseline and weekly&#xD;
      for 6 months. All patients will receive supportive psychotherapy both during the&#xD;
      hospitalization and in clinic follow-up. Discharged patients will be followed in the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic of the Beersheba Mental Health Center by a physician plus dietician team&#xD;
      dedicated to this study. Each patient will be followed for six months. Outcome measures will&#xD;
      be BPRS ratings over the course of the half year, readmissions, Global Clinical Assessment of&#xD;
      function at the end of the half year, and risperidone dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin test A blunted response of dermal erythema to niacin has been widely reported in&#xD;
      schizophrenia, and it is possible that this response might predict clinical response to&#xD;
      niacin treatment. All patients will have the Horrobin niacin patch test (Smesny et al., 2003)&#xD;
      on admission to the study and it will be repeated after 6 months of continuous therapy.&#xD;
      Niacin is applied simultaneously in four dilutions (0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001M) of 50microl&#xD;
      each (approximately one drop of a standard eye-dropper) to the skin at the inner side of the&#xD;
      forearm using chambered plaster for epicutaneous testing. After 90 seconds the plaster is&#xD;
      removed. Skin reaction is quantitated at 3 minute intervals up to 21 minutes starting 90&#xD;
      seconds after removal of the plaster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks The risks of high dose ascorbic acid have been reviewed extensively but these refer to&#xD;
      doses such as 10g daily and the present dose of 3g daily is associated with minimal risk eg&#xD;
      diarrhea. Doses greater than 3gm daily can cause increases in ALT and uric acid but risk of&#xD;
      kidney stones has not been substantiated (Russel, 2005). Niacin at 3g daily is now widely&#xD;
      used as a cholesterol lowering agent (Alpers, Stenson, &amp; Bier, 2002) and is associated with&#xD;
      minimal side effects or dangers eg, up to 5% increased glucose, elevations of liver enzymes&#xD;
      and exacerbation in peptic ulcer, but these effects are rarely if ever seen with the&#xD;
      derivative nicotinamide (Guyton, 2005). The other B-vitamins in the doses given would not be&#xD;
      associated with any side effects.&#xD;
