  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether estrogens specifically promote a reduction&#xD;
      in fat from abdominal regions during weight loss and/or prevent the accumulation of abdominal&#xD;
      fat during weight gain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of this study is to determine whether estrogen-based hormone therapy (HT) in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women reduces the accumulation of abdominal visceral fat and whether this is a&#xD;
      contributing factor to the effects of estrogens on cardiovascular risk factors. An additional&#xD;
      aim is to determine whether raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that&#xD;
      is suggested to be a safer alternative to estrogen for the prevention of osteoporosis, exerts&#xD;
      similar effects as estrogen on fat distribution. Mechanisms for possible regional differences&#xD;
      in the regulation of fat metabolism in estrogen-sufficient vs estrogen-deficient states will&#xD;
      be investigated, as will the extent to which estrogen status and changes in visceral&#xD;
      adiposity are associated with changes in risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) and Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (DM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses being tested include 1) reductions in total fat mass and total abdominal and&#xD;
      visceral fat will be significantly greater in women treated with HT or raloxifene than in&#xD;
      those receiving placebo treatment, 2) the accumulation of total fat mass and total abdominal&#xD;
      and visceral fat during the 12-month follow-up period will be significantly less in women on&#xD;
      HT or raloxifene than in those receiving placebo treatment, 3) a reduction in visceral fat&#xD;
      mass will be associated with increased sensitivity to insulin in the breakdown of fat in the&#xD;
      whole body, and there will be an independent enhancing effect of HT and raloxifene on insulin&#xD;
      action, and 4) changes in risk factors for CAD and Type 2 DM will be more closely associated&#xD;
      with changes in visceral adiposity than with changes in total fat mass or other measures of&#xD;
      regional adiposity, independent of and in addition to the effects of HT and raloxifene on&#xD;
      risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To meet these aims, a reduction in visceral fat will be induced in 108 postmenopausal women&#xD;
      through a 6-month program of supervised exercise training plus mild caloric restriction.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive HT, raloxifene, or placebo. The drug treatment&#xD;
      will continue, but the fat reduction program will cease, during a 12-month follow-up period.&#xD;
      Risk factors for CAD and Type 2 DM and insulin sensitivity in terms of the breakdown of fat&#xD;
      on total body and regional adipose tissue will be evaluated before and after treatment and&#xD;
      after the follow-up period (risk factors only). For the purpose of this application, HT&#xD;
      refers to a regimen involving daily conjugated estrogens and, in women with a uterus,&#xD;
      tri-monthly progestin treatment.&#xD;
