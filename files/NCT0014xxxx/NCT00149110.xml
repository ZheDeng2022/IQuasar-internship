      The primary objective of the present study is to examine whether the combination of the&#xD;
      antidepressant duloxetine and chronotherapeutic methods (including sleep deprivation, light&#xD;
      therapy, and maintaining a regular sleep-wake rhythm) in patient with major depression, will&#xD;
      induce an immediate improvement from depression and whether this antidepressive effect will&#xD;
      be maintained in the long term (29 weeks). Patient will be randomised to the above mentioned&#xD;
      treatment or to an active group receiving exercise.&#xD;

      Protocol synopsis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Psychiatric Research Unit at Frederiksborg General Hospital, with professor Per Bech as&#xD;
      the driving force, has been working with sleep in relation to affective disorders for many&#xD;
      years. During the last 4 years we have performed and been involved in several light therapy&#xD;
      studies in depression, both in seasonal affective disorder (SAD), with light as an&#xD;
      augmentation strategy in nonseasonal depression, in post-stroke depression and in Tourette's&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In relation to the dissemination of results from Klaus Martiny's Ph.D. thesis on bright light&#xD;
      therapy as an augmenting strategy in major depression, our research unit has achieved close&#xD;
      collaboration with some of the world's leading experts in chronotherapeutics: Professor Anna&#xD;
      Wirz-Justice in Basel, Switzerland, Franscesco Benedetti in Milano, Italy, Michael Terman in&#xD;
      New York, Mathias Berger in Freiburg, Germany and Joseph Wu at the University of California,&#xD;
      Irvine. The basic idea of the present study comes from this group which over many years has&#xD;
      performed and reported clinical studies in chronotherapeutics. We hope that our research unit&#xD;
      will be able to conduct this study, as required, in a large patient sample and under the&#xD;
      guidance of this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will fulfill the research unit's ambition to investigate antidepressive treatment&#xD;
      algorithms with the propensity to lead to an earlier and sustained onset of action and a&#xD;
      higher remission rate. Remission from depression does not only restore the patients' normal&#xD;
      social functioning, but also reduces the risk of recurrence of depression. To attain this&#xD;
      goal we regard the combination of new and powerful antidepressive drugs and&#xD;
      non-pharmacological therapies most interesting and promising. This study has full support&#xD;
      from the hospital administration who welcomes the active involvement of the nursing staff in&#xD;
      the chronotherapeutic part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study incorporates the combination of duloxetine and chronotherapeutics: sleep&#xD;
      deprivation, sleep phase advance, and light therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duloxetine is a new dual action antidepressant drug that has shown an early onset of action&#xD;
      and a high remission rate, with acceptable side effects. It is thus a promising drug for new&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronotherapeutic approaches such as total or partial sleep deprivation, phase advance of the&#xD;
      sleep-wake cycle, and light therapy have been investigated over the last thirty years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total or partial sleep deprivation in the second half of the night and phase advance of the&#xD;
      sleep-wake cycle have shown to have rapid and profound effects on depressed mood in all&#xD;
      diagnostic subgroups. Sleep deprivation attains an immediate response in around 60% of the&#xD;
      cases and smaller reported studies using combinations of sleep deprivation with lithium,&#xD;
      antidepressant drugs, pindolol, sleep phase advance, or morning light therapy have indicated&#xD;
      that the response after initial sleep deprivation can be maintained. Light treatment has&#xD;
      become an accepted and effective treatment of seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and recent&#xD;
      studies have document accelerated and augmented response in non-seasonal, and even in chronic&#xD;
      depression,as adjunctive treatment to medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of the effect of chronotherapeutics and new powerful antidepressant drugs&#xD;
      thus is a very interesting and promising approach. While light treatment is widely used,&#xD;
      sleep deprivation and sleep phase advance are therapies that are in need of studies with&#xD;
      sufficient numbers of patients to evaluate their applicability and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duloxetine, a new dual action drug, has shown promising efficacy with an early onset of&#xD;
      action and a high remission rate both in short- and long-term treatment. Thus, Raskin found&#xD;
      an impressive remission rate of 50.8% after six weeks and 81.8% after 52 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
      The primary objective of the present study is to examine whether the combination of&#xD;
      duloxetine and chronotherapeutic methods induces higher remission rates at an earlier time&#xD;
      point and obtains a 50% percent remission rate after three weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomised controlled, semi-blind (rater-blind) trial with a fixed dosage&#xD;
      trial length of nine weeks. Within this nine weeks period study drugs will be given at a dose&#xD;
      of 60 mg duloxetine. Patients will be randomized and start medication with duloxetine one&#xD;
      week before starting the chronotherapeutic intervention. This is a precaution not to cause&#xD;
      any distress in patients (as could be expected with new possible side-effects and the&#xD;
      chronotherapeutic intervention introduced at the same time). The following chronotherapeutic&#xD;
      intervention covers one week (seven days) where patients will be admitted to an open ward. If&#xD;
      improved sufficiently patients can be discharged at this time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently patients will be seen monthly in an uncontrolled follow-up period ending with a&#xD;
      last visit at 6 month after inclusion into the study. In this follow-up period starting from&#xD;
      week nine, patients will have the opportunity to alter dosage of study drug or to shift into&#xD;
      other medication. The only intervention in this follow up period will be to encourage the&#xD;
      patients to keep the daily time structure as instructed during their admittance to the ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomised to group A will be treated with a combination of duloxetine 60 mg per day&#xD;
      for 29 weeks and a chronotherapeutic intervention of one weeks duration (see below). Patients&#xD;
      randomised to group B will be treated with duloxetine in a dose of 60 mg per day for 29 weeks&#xD;
      and individual exercise instructed by a physiotherapist. Patients will be informed that the&#xD;
      two intervention groups are based on different time-structuring regimes. The placebo&#xD;
      condition has been chosen to secure an similar expectancy rate in the two treatment&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A. Duloxetine treatment with 60 mg per day for 29 weeks plus chronotherapeutic&#xD;
      intervention of 1 week duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duloxetine dosage will be 60 mg daily with the possibility of increasing dosage to 90 or&#xD;
           120 mg at week nine for patients with incomplete response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronotherapeutic intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Light treatment: Light treatment will be given with 10.000 lux for 1 hour,&#xD;
                individually timed according to the MEQ score.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Sleep deprivation and sleep phase advance: Sleep will be scheduled as shown below.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Day one to two: Total sleep deprivation I&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Day two to three: from 9 pm to 7 am. Sleep-phase-advance I&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Day three to four: Total sleep deprivation II&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Day four to five: from 9 pm to 7 am. Sleep phase advance II&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Day five to six: Total sleep deprivation III&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Day six to seven: from 9 pm to 7 am. Sleep phase advance III&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B. Duloxetine treatment with 60 mg per day for nine weeks plus chronotherapeutic&#xD;
      intervention with moderate time structure and exercise of 1 weeks duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duloxetine dosage will be 60 mg daily with the possibility of increasing dosage to 90 or&#xD;
           120 mg at week nine for patients with incomplete response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From day seven and on, sleep is regulated according to two rules:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Not taking naps in the daytime.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Getting out of bed by 8 am at the latest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxazepam is allowed for severe agitation and sleep disturbances (except at days of sleep&#xD;
      deprivation) in daily doses as mentioned earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychometrics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of major depression will be made by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Interview (M.I.N.I.). Severity of depression will be assessed by weekly ratings using the&#xD;
      interview-based Hamilton Depression Rating scales (17 and 6 items versions, Bech et al 2000)&#xD;
      and the newly developed 6 item self-assessment Hamilton scale. Patients will fill in the&#xD;
      Global Rating Scale (Preskorn) daily. Side effects will be monitored weekly by the UKU scale.&#xD;
      At baseline, the Morningness Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) will be used to calculate the&#xD;
      individual timing of light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time line:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study starts in September 2005. The inclusion period is 2 years and data will be&#xD;
      published in a 6 months' period thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome criteria will be response and remission. Secondary outcome criteria will be&#xD;
      the mean of weekly Hamilton ratings (17-items and 6-items versions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary outcome criterion will be the time until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and has obtained approval from&#xD;
      the local ethical committee, the Danish Data Protection Agency and the Danish Medicines&#xD;
      Agency. Patients will sign informed consent forms after written and oral descriptions of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Events, serious Events, Adverse drug reactions and Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse&#xD;
      Reactions will be reported according to the regulatory authorities' rules. Side effects will&#xD;
      be monitored.&#xD;
