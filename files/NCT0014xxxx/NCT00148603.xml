  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site study of the effect of montelukast on eosinophil and mast cell counts&#xD;
      and activation in the lining of the duodenum in 24 children with dyspepsia in association&#xD;
      with duodenal eosinophilia in association with measuring the concentration of the medication&#xD;
      in the lining of the duodenum. Patients will be endoscoped with biopsies obtained from the&#xD;
      duodenum as part of routine clinical care. Participants in the study will then receive&#xD;
      montelukast daily and the endoscopy with biopsies will be repeated on day 21 to measure cell&#xD;
      counts and activation and tissue montelukast levels. Cell counts and measures of activation&#xD;
      will be compared to pre-treatment levels.&#xD;

      I. Background/Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent abdominal pain is a common complaint among school-age children, being present in up&#xD;
      to 15% at any given time. It represents the most common chronic pain entity in pediatric&#xD;
      patients. These patients frequently have dyspepsia defined as upper abdominal pain or&#xD;
      discomfort. (1) Eighty-three percent of children referred to our institution for recurrent&#xD;
      pain have dyspepsia. Shaffer, et al, found dyspepsia to be present in 73% of 154 children&#xD;
      with recurrent abdominal pain. (2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have found mucosal eosinophilia in 71% of children undergoing endoscopy with mucosal&#xD;
      biopsy for dyspepsia. However, eosinophil density does not necessarily correlate with&#xD;
      eosinophil activation and many eosinophil-derived mediators are bioactive in a&#xD;
      concentration-dependent fashion. (3) In previous investigations, we have found evidence of&#xD;
      moderate to extensive eosinophil degranulation in the biopsies of dyspeptic children who had&#xD;
      normal mucosal eosinophil densities. (4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Montelukast is a competitive antagonist of the cys LT1 receptor with an affinity that is&#xD;
      similar, but lower than that of leukotriene D4. (5) We and others have previously reported&#xD;
      good clinical response to montelukast in patients with eosinophilic gastroenteritis. (6-9)&#xD;
      Recently, Vanderhoof and Young (8) reported eight patients with dysphagia, diarrhea, and/or&#xD;
      constipation associated with tissue eosinophilia who had prolonged remission of symptoms with&#xD;
      montelukast therapy. This experience prompted us to undertake a double-blinded&#xD;
      placebo-controlled cross-over trial of montelukast in dyspeptic children with duodenal&#xD;
      eosinophilia. We were able to demonstrate the superiority of montelukast as compared to&#xD;
      placebo in the relief of pain. (9) Despite an average duration of pain of nearly 22 months&#xD;
      prior to study enrollment, approximately one-half of the patients became pain free or nearly&#xD;
      pain-free during the two week course of therapy with montelukast. Also of interest from this&#xD;
      particular study was the finding that montelukast pharmacokinetics, and thus exposure, were&#xD;
      different than previously observed in children receiving the drug. Specifically, the average&#xD;
      population elimination t-1/2 for montelukast in our subjects (1.8 hours) was substantially&#xD;
      shorter than mean values for this parameter (3.4 hours) determined from children without&#xD;
      concurrent intestinal disease. (5, 10) While the reasons for this apparent disparity are not&#xD;
      clear, it is possible that local montelukast metabolism (ie., in the small intestine) may&#xD;
      vary as a consequence of disease state. Nonetheless, what remains to be determined is whether&#xD;
      there is a link between systemic and tissue levels and whether an exposure-response relation&#xD;
      can be established for montelukast in pediatric patients with eosinophilic duodenitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the mechanism responsible for the demonstrated clinical efficacy of montelukast in&#xD;
      this disorder has not been established. It is possible that the therapeutic effect might&#xD;
      result consequent to a lowering in eosinophil density, alteration of the eosinophil&#xD;
      activation state, blocking leukotrienes released by eosinophils (or other cells) at their&#xD;
      site of action, or any combination of the aforementioned effects. The clinical effectiveness&#xD;
      of medications for eosinophilic esophagitis has been previously found to be associated with a&#xD;
      decrease in eosinophil density, but the activation state was not assessed. (11-12) As well,&#xD;
      no previous investigations of therapeutic interventions for this disorder have addressed&#xD;
      exposure-response relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The beneficial therapeutic effect of montelukast in patients with eosinophilic duodenitis is&#xD;
      determined by the activation state and local density of eosinophils, and by attainment of&#xD;
      sufficient systemic and local exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Objectives / Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. To determine the effect of montelukast on mucosal eosinophil density and activation state&#xD;
      in pediatric patients with eosinophilic duodenitis presenting as dyspepsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. To evaluate the relationship between clinical response, systemic drug exposure, local&#xD;
      tissue drug concentration, and the eosinophil density and activation state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 24 patients evaluated at the Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study if all of the following criteria&#xD;
           are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patients with dyspepsia defined as upper abdominal pain or discomfort of at least&#xD;
                two months duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Male and female subjects 6 - 17 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Endoscopic mucosal biopsies revealing at least 20 eosinophils in a high power field&#xD;
                on specimens from the duodenum in the absence of other defined duodenal pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Written informed consent signed by the subject's legal guardian and by the&#xD;
                investigator and patient assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following&#xD;
           criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. A subject who has previously been treated with montelukast.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Treatment with steroids or oral cromolyn in the four weeks prior to endoscopy or&#xD;
                during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Any history, clinical, and/or biochemical evidence of clinically significant renal&#xD;
                or liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Treatment with any inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Intake of grapefruit juice or oral vitamin E supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Patients meeting all criteria except 1.c. will be approached for enrollment&#xD;
                     prior to the initial endoscopy. With consent, two duodenal biopsies will be&#xD;
                     obtained and processed for EM evaluation as below pending histologic&#xD;
                     evaluation to determine whether the patient meets criteria 1.c. If the patient&#xD;
                     does not meet criteria 1.c., EM specimens will be discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Treatment: All patients will receive an open-label, 21 day course of montelukast at&#xD;
                a dose of two 5 mg tablets daily, given between 0700 and 0800.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Assessment of treatment response&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. . Global evaluation - A five point global pain relief evaluation will be&#xD;
                     conducted by a single investigator on day 21. The evaluation will employ a&#xD;
                     Likert-type scale adapted to assess change in pain or discomfort as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Grade 1: Worse - clinical deterioration with increasing pain intensity and/or&#xD;
                     frequency&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Grade 2: No change - no increase or decrease in pain intensity or frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Grade 3: Moderate improvement - partial clinical response with definite&#xD;
                     improvement in pain, but not meeting the criteria for a Grade 4 response.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Grade 4: Good - nearly complete relief of symptoms with minimal residual pain&#xD;
                     or discomfort. Relief denoted as adequate by patient. Pain not interfering&#xD;
                     with daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Grade 5: Excellent - complete relief of pain or discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. . Mucosal Eosinophils&#xD;
&#xD;
                     On day 21 of therapy, all patients will undergo a follow up endoscopy to&#xD;
                     obtain mucosal biopsies. All endoscopies will be performed in the usual&#xD;
                     fashion, which includes obtaining standard biopsies (2 esophageal, 2 antral,&#xD;
                     and 4 duodenal). Patients will also have two additional duodenal biopsies&#xD;
                     obtained for electron microscopic (EM) evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Both peak and mean eosinophil density will be determined by a single observer&#xD;
                     on both pre- and post-treatment specimens. The observer will be blinded to&#xD;
                     which specimens are pre- and which are post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. . Laboratory&#xD;
&#xD;
                On day 21, at the time of endoscopy, a blood sample will be obtained on all&#xD;
                patients for the determination of serum eosinophil cationic protein concentration.&#xD;
                Serum will be frozen and saved for a period not to exceed 24 months from study&#xD;
                completion to be used for determination of other serum protein concentrations which&#xD;
                may be determined to have possible clinical or physiologic relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Pharmacokinetic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
                On day 21, all patients will report to the GI procedure room three hours prior to&#xD;
                their endoscopy. An intravenous catheter will be placed for the procedure. At 2.5&#xD;
                hours prior to the procedure, patients will receive two, 5 mg montelukast tablets&#xD;
                with 2 oz of water and the time will be recorded. Blood samples will be obtained at&#xD;
                1, 2.5, and 6 hours post-dosing. Plasma will be moved following centrifugation and&#xD;
                stored at -70ºC. At the time of endoscopy (approximately 2.5 hours post-dosing),&#xD;
                multiple duodenal mucosal biopsies (appx. aggregate tissue yield = 0.5 gm) will be&#xD;
                obtained for determination of tissue drug concentration. All serum and tissue drug&#xD;
                determinations will be determined by the manufacturer (Merck) using a validated&#xD;
                HPLC method that has been used to support two previous pharmacokinetic studies of&#xD;
                montelukast (9,10) conducted in pediatric patients, both of which have successfully&#xD;
                used the aforementioned approach for pharmacokinetic data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
                V. Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
                Pre- and post-treatment eosinophil densities, degranulation indexes, and ECP&#xD;
                concentrations, respectfully, will be compared using paired t-tests. Changes in&#xD;
                density, degranulation index, and ECP from pre- to post-treatment will be compared&#xD;
                between responders (Grade &gt; 3) and non-responders (Grade 1 or 2), respectively, by&#xD;
                repeat measures ANOVA. Statistical analysis of pharmacokinetic data will utilize a&#xD;
                combination of approaches to assess the potential interactions between montelukast&#xD;
                disposition and response. Relationships between continuous variables (eg., dose,&#xD;
                ECP concentrations) will be evaluated by linear and nonlinear regression&#xD;
                techniques. A two-tailed, Student's t test will be used to evaluate differences in&#xD;
                disposition (eg., plasma vs. tissue concentrations) and response associated with&#xD;
                gender and also, to examine exposure-response relationships for subjects classified&#xD;
                by pain relief assessment. Finally, logistic regression techniques will be used to&#xD;
                examine the interaction between multiple covariates (eg., pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
                pharmacodynamic parameters, biochemical parameters reflective of eosinophil&#xD;
                activation, demographic parameters, etc.). All statistical analyses will be&#xD;
                completed using the SSPS software package (version 9.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and&#xD;
                will use a significance limit of α = 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
                VI. Sample Size Estimate/Power Calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
                Calculations were completed based on tissue eosinophil density estimates. The&#xD;
                initial (pre-treatment) eosinophil counts were obtained from data obtained in the&#xD;
                initial montelukast trial (9) and we assumed the standard deviation would remain an&#xD;
                equal percent of the mean post-treatment. Calculations were based on achieving 80%&#xD;
                power performing a two-sided paired t-test and a significance level of α = 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
                1 2 3 4 Pre-treatment mean 34 34 34 34 Post-treatment mean 10 20 25 27 N = 5 10 20&#xD;
                30&#xD;
&#xD;
                We chose a sample size of 24 patients to allow for a patient drop out rate of&#xD;
                approximately 15% (twice the rate of the original study).&#xD;
&#xD;
                VII. Projected Timeline for Study Completion&#xD;
&#xD;
                It is estimated that it will take 16 weeks to enroll the entire cohort of subjects.&#xD;
                An additional 8 to 12 weeks is allocated for sample analysis by Merck, followed by&#xD;
                an additional 4 to 6 weeks for data analysis and report generation. All data (in&#xD;
                the form of a final study report) will be submitted for review and comment by the&#xD;
                study sponsor (appx. 4-6 weeks). Manuscript generation and submission will then&#xD;
                follow (appx. 6-8 weeks).&#xD;
