      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Healthy People 2010 Objectives address the importance of smoking cessation during&#xD;
      pregnancy and the importance of reducing ETS exposure among children and adults. This study&#xD;
      will use a new combination of existing technologies to maximize the appropriateness of&#xD;
      prenatal and postpartum education concerning ETS exposure in an innovative, inexpensive, and&#xD;
      widely applicable approach. The use of tailored DVDs is practical, feasible, and inexpensive&#xD;
      enough to be attractive to clinics serving low-income and minority women. A large number of&#xD;
      video segments will be produced utilizing live actors, animation, and word slates. About 10&#xD;
      segments will be computer-selected for the videos for each woman based on her responses to&#xD;
      four self-assessments. No studies to date have included multiple doses of tailored video&#xD;
      education, or used DVDs in this way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This two-arm randomized study is designed to develop and evaluate the efficacy of five&#xD;
      tailored DVDs in reducing exposure to ETS among low-income pregnant/postpartum women. The&#xD;
      overall purposes of the study are 1) to develop an innovative intervention (tailored&#xD;
      &quot;take-home&quot; DVDs) to help pregnant women maximize their pregnancy outcome and their new&#xD;
      infant's health through reduction in exposure to ETS and 2) to study the feasibility and&#xD;
      efficacy of this intervention compared with a usual care group. This innovative technology&#xD;
      will be field tested in collaboration with six prenatal clinics that serve primarily&#xD;
      low-income, African American, Latina, and minority women to address two specific aims.&#xD;
      Specific aim 1: To test the efficacy of tailored video (TV) versus usual care (UC) approaches&#xD;
      in terms of reducing the ETS exposure among fetuses of nonsmoking, low-income women during&#xD;
      pregnancy (assessed at 34 weeks gestation using saliva cotinine concentration and ETS&#xD;
      self-report) and among infants (as measured by saliva cotinine concentration and mothers'&#xD;
      self-reports at 6 months postpartum). Specific aim 2: To test the efficacy of TV versus UC&#xD;
      approaches in terms of reducing the exposure of the fetuses of low-income, smoking women to&#xD;
      tobacco smoke during pregnancy (assessed at 34 weeks gestation using saliva cotinine&#xD;
      concentrations of the pregnant women and smoking and ETS self-reports) and to their infants&#xD;
      (as measured by saliva cotinine concentration from the infant at 6 months postpartum and&#xD;
      self-reports of infant exposure by the new mothers). Because of the lack of data on reducing&#xD;
      ETS exposure amongst low-income and minority women, intensive formative and extensive process&#xD;
      evaluation components are included.&#xD;
