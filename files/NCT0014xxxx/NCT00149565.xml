      1. TREATMENT PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Eligible patients are randomized to receive adjuvant IFN-α for 53 wks or 1.2&#xD;
           Administration of IFN-α 1.21 IFN-α will be started after randomization. 1.22 IFN-α will&#xD;
           be administered by subcutaneous injection at the bed time. 1.23 Escalation of IFN-α&#xD;
           dosage. 1.231 During the first 2 days, 1 x 106 u/day will be given. 1.232 If tolerable,&#xD;
           the dose of IFN-α will be escalated to 3 x 106 u/day in days 3 and 4, and to 5 x 106&#xD;
           u/day at day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.24 After dose escalation, IFN-α 5 x 106 u/day will be given in the following ways&#xD;
           1.241 induction therapy: 5 times per week for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1.242&#xD;
           maintenance therapy: 3 times per weeks for additional 48 weeks. 1.25 Modification of&#xD;
           IFN-α dosage 1.251 In the presence of any moderate adverse events (as listing in&#xD;
           Appendix II) it required a dose reduction to 3 x 106 u/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2511 If any moderate adverse events occur at the 3 x 106 u/day level, the patients&#xD;
           will be withdraw from the study; 1.252 In the presence of any severe adverse events (as&#xD;
           listing in Appendix II), it requires immediate discontinuation of therapy; 1.2521 IFN-α&#xD;
           will be discontinued until a return to baseline or moderate toxicity. Then IFN-α will be&#xD;
           reinstituted at the dose level of 3 x 106 u/day; 1.2522 If moderate or severe adverse&#xD;
           events occur at the 3 x 106 u/day level, the patients will be withdraw from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.253 Flare-up of hepatitis activity, as manifested by increment of serum transaminase&#xD;
           per se is not an indication for dose modification; 1.254 If symptoms/signs (S/S) of&#xD;
           hepatic decompensation occur after the presence of ALT flare-up during IFN-α therapy,&#xD;
           the drug will be held.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2541 The presence of two of following five criteria is considered as evidence of&#xD;
           hepatic decompensation: 1.25411 Presence of ascites; 1.25412 Presence of hepatic&#xD;
           encephalopathy; 1.25413 hypoalbuminemia with serum albumin &lt; 3 g/dl; 1.25414&#xD;
           hyperbilirubinemia with serum bilirubin &gt; 3 mg/dl; 1.25415 Prolongation of prothrombin&#xD;
           time with PT &gt; 2 sec above base-line. 1.2542 Serial workup have to be taken to rule out&#xD;
           the presence of other predisposing factor (such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,&#xD;
           constipation, electrolyte imbalance,...ect) to cause the S/S of hepatic decompensation.&#xD;
           If any, start specific treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2543 If S/S of hepatic decompensation recovered with a return of serum ALT to ≦1.5&#xD;
           times upper limit of normal range, IFN-α will be restarted at the level of 3 x 106 u/day&#xD;
           and escalated to 5 x 106 u/day within 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2544 If S/S of hepatic decompensation recovered with persistent elevation of serum ALT&#xD;
           &gt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal range, IFN-α will be given and maintained at the level&#xD;
           3 x 106 u/day 3 times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2545 After excluding other specific etiologies and S/S of hepatic decompensation&#xD;
           persist longer than 4 weeks, patients will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2546 Recurrent episodes of hepatic decompensation will be considered as severe adverse&#xD;
           events and managed as listing in section 5.252.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.255 If symptoms/signs (S/S) of hepatic decompensation occur in the absence of ALT&#xD;
           flare-up, the patients will be managed as listing in section 5.252.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.256 In the presence of severe bacterial infection such as: bacterial peritonitis,&#xD;
           bacterial pneumonia, and .. etc., IFN-a will be held until resolution of infection after&#xD;
           adequate antibiotics therapy. Then the patients will be managed as listing in section&#xD;
           5.252.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.26 Before IFN-α, if necessary patients will be pretreated with acetaminophen 500 -&#xD;
           1,000 mg, q 6 hours for 4 doses, started 12 hours before IFN-α administration to&#xD;
           alleviate the associated flu-like symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
           2.0 Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following tests should be performed within 2 weeks before the initiation of therapy&#xD;
           ( as the baseline data) and then repeated as request following the initiation of&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;

           After first year, patients will be followed bi-monthly. After 6 years, patients will be&#xD;
           followed 3 monthly..&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3 Chest PA every 4 months for one year and then every 6 months. 2.4 ECG for those with&#xD;
           history of cardiac disease at time of symptom recurrence.&#xD;

           monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.7 Abdominal computed tomography performed every 12 months or whenever abdominal&#xD;
           sonography shows suspicious recurrent lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.8 Any suspicious lesion found on abdominal sonography and/or computed tomography&#xD;
           should undergo angiography and sono-guided biopsy for histological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.9 UGI endoscopy at the time of UGI bleeding or dyspepsia. [CANCEAL] 2.91 Preoperative&#xD;

           followed 6 monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.13 HBsAg will be checked every 6 months in those with HBsAg(+).&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.0 Off-study Criteria 3.1 Development of a serious medical condition which makes&#xD;
           administration of IFN-α life threatening.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.11 Patients present with S/S of hepatic decompensation should be managed as list in&#xD;
           sections 5.2544 and 5.2545.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.12 as those listed in 5.2511 and 5.2522. 3.2 Occurrence of tumor recurrence. 3.3&#xD;
           Non-compliance by a patient with protocol requirement. 3.4 Patient refusal further&#xD;
           therapy. 3.5 Patient death. 3.6 Interruption of IFN-α therapy &gt;4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.0 Statistical Consideration 4.1 Sample size Review of literatures showed that the&#xD;
           2-year survival rate of post-operative HCC was 25% to 60% [7-14]. We estimate that&#xD;
           adjuvant IFN-α can improve the 2-year survival rate from 50% to 70%. According to the&#xD;
           methods of Casagrande et al.[129], to give a 90% power for detecting the increase of 20%&#xD;
           for a two-sided statistical significance test, 134 patients for each of the two&#xD;
           treatment arms are needed. 4.2 Randomization Patients are stratified into two strata :&#xD;
           one with HBsAg(+),another with HBsAg(-) but with anti-HCV(+). Randomization of patients&#xD;
           into control or treatment group is taken within each stratum. Balanced block sizes of&#xD;
           two strata for randomization are different. 4.3 Analysis 4.31 The primary objectives are&#xD;
           as follows: 4.311 To determine if adjuvant IFN-α can reduce or delay the occurrence in&#xD;
           curatively resected HCC. 4.312 To determine if adjuvant IFN-α prolong disease-free&#xD;
           survival (DFS) and/or overall survival (OS) in curatively resected HCC. 4.313 To&#xD;
           determine the safety and tolerance of IFN-αin post-operative H.C.C patients. 4.314 To&#xD;
           evaluate the anti-viral activity of IFN-α in post-operative HCC patients. 4.32 DFS and&#xD;
           OS are computed from the date of randomization. 4.321 In analysis of DFS, patients died&#xD;
           without disease recurrence will be censored for recurrence at the date of death. 4.322&#xD;
           In analysis of OS, an event is defined as death from any cause. 4.323 The survival&#xD;
           distributions of DFS and OS will be estimated by the Kaplan and Meier method [130]. 4&#xD;
           4.324 Statistical comparisons of DFS and OS between the two treatment arms will be&#xD;
           performed with the log-rank statistic [131]. 4.325 Cox proportional hazards model [132]&#xD;
           will be used to assess the importance of potential prognostic factors, as well as to&#xD;
           test the significance of treatment when adjusting for factors. 4.33 Tumor size, Liver&#xD;
           inflammation, viral status such as HBsAg. anti- HCVand&#xD;

           Presence of capsule Tumor type Venous invasion Tumor size (the largest in multiple&#xD;
           lesions) Histological grading will be treated as potential prognostic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4 Interim Analysis The interim analyses will be conducted according to the alpha&#xD;
           spending function approach proposed by DeMets and Lan (1994) which provides flexibility&#xD;
           about the time for interim analysis. The a1 spending function, which generates the&#xD;
           approximate O'Brien-Fleming boundaries (O'Brien and Fleming, 1979), will be used for a&#xD;
           conservation termination at the early stage of the study. In addition, the method of&#xD;
           B-value developed by Lan and Wittes (1988), Li (1998) will be used to monitor the data&#xD;
           and to compute the conditional probability of detecting either a positive or negative&#xD;
           treatment effect at the scheduled end of the study given the present status. The primary&#xD;
           efficacy endpoint for the interim analyses is the time to occurrence of second primary&#xD;
           tumors. The toxicity will be monitored constantly throughout the study. The conduct of&#xD;
           interim analyses and dissemination of the results of the interim analysis will follow&#xD;
           the TCOG Data and Safety Monitoring guidelines for confidentiality. The TCOG Data and&#xD;
           Safety Monitoring Committee will review the results of interim analyses for a possible&#xD;
           early termination of the trial.&#xD;
