  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to see if the administration of sildenafil (Viagra) in patients&#xD;
      with portopulmonary hypertension could be a safe and effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Portopulmonary hypertension (PTPH) is a special type of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension is high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries that carry unoxygenated blood&#xD;
      from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs. Pulmonary hypertension results from&#xD;
      constriction, or tightening, of the blood vessels that supply blood to the lungs.&#xD;
      Consequently, it becomes difficult for blood to pass through the lungs, making it harder for&#xD;
      the heart to pump blood forward. This stress on the heart leads to enlargement of the heart&#xD;
      and eventually fluid can build up in the liver and tissues, such as in the legs. Affected&#xD;
      patients can sometimes notice increasing shortness of breath and dizziness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing body of evidence suggesting a potential therapeutic role for this&#xD;
      sildenafil in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. Studies are ongoing regarding&#xD;
      this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that chronic oral sildenafil will successfully reduce pulmonary artery&#xD;
      pressures by at least 25% (reduction in mean pulmonary artery pressure) and could be an&#xD;
      effective treatment for PTPH, especially in candidates for liver transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis To measure the effects of a single dose of sildenafil on pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial pressure in patients with PTPH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis To measure the effects of chronic (3 month) treatment with sildenafil on&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial pressure, safety, and tolerability in patients with PTPH&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a single center (only takes place at University of Chicago), open-label (doctor and&#xD;
      subject know that the subject is taking the experimental drut), pilot study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of sildenafil on pulmonary artery pressures in patients with portopulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are diagnosed with PTPH after having routine care right heart catheterization&#xD;
      will be asked if they are interested in participating. Approximately ten subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Subjects will undergo the following experimental procedures as part of their&#xD;
      participation in this study: blood laboratory tests, medical history, physical exam, inhaled&#xD;
      nitric oxide test, study drug (sildenafil) administration, and a pill count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sildenafil will be given to these patients 3 times a day for a 12 week period to see if the&#xD;
      study drug can lower their pulmonary artery pressures by at least 25%.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Candidates for enrollment in this clinical trial are limited to adult patients diagnosed&#xD;
        with severe portopulmonary hypertension (PTPH). Specifically, other causes of pulmonary&#xD;
        hypertension (PH) such as left ventricular dysfunction, valvular heart disease, chronic&#xD;
        lung disease, chronic thromboembolic disease, chronic hypoxemia, rheumatologic conditions,&#xD;
        and significant untreated obstructive sleep apnea will be excluded in the usual fashion in&#xD;
        patients with underlying portal hypertension and usually cirrhosis. The diagnosis of&#xD;
        pulmonary hypertension will be confirmed by invasive hemodynamic measurements (i.e. right&#xD;
        heart catheterization) and severe PH is defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP)&#xD;
        &gt;35 mmHg. If evidence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is present (RV dilation,&#xD;
        reduced RV ejection fraction (EF), or elevated RV end-diastolic pressure (&gt;10 mmHg) and the&#xD;
        MPAP is 30-35 mmHg, then the patient may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study participants will be selected from those patients referred for hemodynamic assessment&#xD;
        of pulmonary hypertension, such as potential liver transplant recipients. They must be&#xD;
        capable of giving informed consent. The University of Chicago referring physician will be&#xD;
        contacted for concurrence of agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, but not portopulmonary hypertension will be&#xD;
        excluded. Patients will be excluded from consideration if they do not have severe PTPH, if&#xD;
        invasive hemodynamic assessment is contraindicated, or if there are any contraindications&#xD;
        to sildenafil. Patients with unstable coronary syndromes or otherwise significant&#xD;
        unrevascularized coronary artery disease and myocardial ischemia as determined by cardiac&#xD;
        stress testing and/or coronary angiography will also be excluded. Moribund patients will&#xD;
        not be considered for enrollment.&#xD;
