  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and rising PSA, after primary tumor&#xD;
      treatment, will be treated with the P501-AS15 vaccine as out-patients. The maximum dose will&#xD;
      be 16 vaccinations, given over a period of approximately one year. Thereafter, the patients'&#xD;
      long-term safety and PSA status will be followed over a period of approximately 11 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I/II study will be conducted according to a multicenter, open-label, single-group&#xD;
      design at approximately ten centers in Europe. At least 21 HSPC patients with rising PSA&#xD;
      after primary tumor treatment will be enrolled in this study. All patients will be treated as&#xD;
      out-patients and will receive the same treatment. The maximum dose will be 16 vaccinations.&#xD;
      Follow-up: The patients' long-term safety and PSA status will be followed over a period of 48&#xD;
      weeks. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act,&#xD;
      Sep 2007.&#xD;
