      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a tailored problem solving&#xD;
      intervention in increasing adherence to asthma management behaviors in African American&#xD;
      adolescents with asthma.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adolescents who are unable to adhere to their medical regimen for the management&#xD;
      of chronic illness present considerable challenges to health care providers and researchers.&#xD;
      Pediatric asthma is a chronic illness where the consequences of non-adherence are&#xD;
      particularly detrimental and widespread, especially among economically disadvantaged minority&#xD;
      children and their families. Studies of intervention of asthma management are needed for this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed study is to test the efficacy of a problem solving intervention that&#xD;
      is tailored to the observed adherence behaviors and identified barriers to increasing&#xD;
      adherence in African American children and adolescents with asthma, and their families.&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to either a Tailored Problem Solving Intervention, or a control group&#xD;
      who will receive Family Education Intervention. Duration of the intervention is four months.&#xD;
