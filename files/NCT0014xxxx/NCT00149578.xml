  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induction chemotherapy will be administered every 2 weeks for 6 cycles (about 3 months).&#xD;
      Patients who have radiological evidence of progressive disease will be shifted to salvage&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Patients who have responsive or stable disease after induction chemotherapy&#xD;
      will receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy 3-4 weeks after the last dose of induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Surgical evaluation will be performed 4-6 weeks after the completion of&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy. Patients who have resectable disease will undergo surgical resection.&#xD;
      Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with GOFL for 6 cycles will be given for those who have&#xD;
      curative resection. Patients who still have unresectable disease or non-curative resection&#xD;
      will receive systemic chemotherapy of GOFL till disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induction chemotherapy will be administered on a biweekly basis. Reported adverse events and&#xD;
      potential risks for gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, 5-FU and leucovorin are described in Section 6.&#xD;
      Appropriate dose modifications for are described in Section 5. No investigational or&#xD;
      commercial agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered with the&#xD;
      intent to treat the patient's malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.1 Treatment schedule of induction chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each dose of GOFL chemotherapy, intravenous infusion of gemcitabine at a fixed rate of 10&#xD;
      mg/m2/min will be immediately followed by a 2-hour intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin and&#xD;
      then a 48-hour intravenous infusion of 5-FU and leucovorin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.2 Premedication before chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 4mg of dexamethasone and anti-histamine and appropriate anti-emetics&#xD;
      (serotonin antagonists) before each dose of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Supportive Care Guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic G-CSF or GM-CSF will not be routinely used in this study. In case of febrile&#xD;
      neutropenia, patients should be treated with appropriate antibiotics. Therapeutic G-CSF may&#xD;
      be used at the discretion of attending physicians&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Duration of Induction Chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for 6 cycles&#xD;
      or until one of the following criteria applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      C Disease progression, C Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of&#xD;
      treatment, C Unacceptable adverse events(s), C Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or&#xD;
      C General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for&#xD;
      further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Agents and Radiation Administration during Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.1 Treatment schedule during concurrent chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.1.1 Patient selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were evaluated after 6 cycles of induction chemotherapy. Patients who have&#xD;
      progressive disease either due to distant metastasis or locoregional progression will be&#xD;
      given salvage systemic chemotherapy and will not be enrolled into concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy. Patients who achieve complete remission, partial remission or stable&#xD;
      disease will be enrolled into 2nd phase of the study, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, 3-4 weeks&#xD;
      after the last dose of induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.2 Study Agents&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine 400mg/m2 will be dissolved in 250ml normal saline and infused intravenously at a&#xD;
      fixed rate of 10mg/m2/min for 40 mins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.1.2 Treatment schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine 400mg/m2 in 250ml normal saline will be iv infused for 40mins, 2hrs before RT on&#xD;
      day 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36. Radiation will be given 180cGy per day, 5 days a week for 28&#xD;
      fractions to totally 5040cGy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.1.3 Premedication for concurrent chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were given dexamethasone 2mg orally three times a day (tid) from the morning of&#xD;
      their first radiotherapy fraction. The prophylactic dexamethasone will be continued until&#xD;
      after they had received their fifth radiation treatment. Therefore, depending on the day of&#xD;
      the week the patients started treatment, dexamethasone will be taken for 5 to 7 days. All&#xD;
      patients will be issued with rescue medication, prochlorperazine 10mg every 6 hours orally if&#xD;
      they develop nausea and vomiting. If patients still have nausea and/or vomiting during&#xD;
      treatment of dexamethasone and prochlorperazine or after the fifth day of radiotherapy,&#xD;
      ondansetron 8mg orally or iv one to three times per day or granisetron 1mg per os or iv once&#xD;
      everyday 30mins before radiotherapy should be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.3 Radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.3.1 Radiation technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation should be performed by high-energy linear accelerators. Three-dimensional radiation&#xD;
      treatment planning was used in all cases. Patients will be immobilized in a foam cradle in a&#xD;
      supine position, and the treatment planning CT was obtained. Tumor mapping should be&#xD;
      performed according to treatment planning CT and the diagnostic CT before induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Treatment planning was performed with the isocenter calculated at 100% and the&#xD;
      95% line encompassing the planning target volume. The spinal cord was limited to 4600cGy. If&#xD;
      one kidney was to receive more than 20Gy then more than 90% of the remaining kidney was&#xD;
      excluded from the primary beam. Generally, a three-field no-axial beam arrangement (opposed&#xD;
      lateral with an anterior-inferior oblique) was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.3.2 Radiation volume&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gross tumor volume is the primary tumor identifiable on CT scan before induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The clinical target volume was defined as the gross tumor volume plus 0.5cm.&#xD;
      The planning target volume was the clinical target volume plus 0.5cm for daily patient set-up&#xD;
      variation. No prophylactic nodal irradiation will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.3.3 Radiation dosage&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total dose of 5040cGy in 28 fractions, 180cGy per fraction, one fraction per day, 5 days&#xD;
      per week, will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5 Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5.1 Surgical evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients completed induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy will be evaluated&#xD;
      for surgical resection. If there is evidence of distant metastasis, surgery will not be&#xD;
      arranged. The feasibility of surgical resection will be evaluated by qualified surgeon&#xD;
      according to contrast-enhanced abdominal CT or MRI. Laparoscope is optional for pre-surgical&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5.1.1 Resectable l No distant metastases l Clear fat plane around celiac and superior&#xD;
      mesenteric arteries (SMA) l Patent superior mesenteric vein (SMV)/portal vein 4.5.1.2&#xD;
      Borderline resectable l Severe unilateral SMV/portal impingement l Tumor abutment on SMA l&#xD;
      Gastroduodenal artery (GDA) encasement up to origin at hepatic artery l Colon or mesocolon&#xD;
      invasion l Adrenal, colon or mesocolon, or kidney invasion 4.5.1.3 Unresectable l Distant&#xD;
      metastases l SMA, celiac encasement l SMV/portal occlusion l Aortic, inferior vena cava (IVC)&#xD;
      invasion or encasement l Invasion of SMV below transverse mesocolon l Rib, vertebral invasion&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5.2 Treatment schedule of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery will be performed within 4-6 weeks after chemoradiotherapy complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5.3 Surgical technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose tumor are considered to be resectable will undergo laparotomy. If complete&#xD;
      surgical resection is feasible, optimal surgery will be performed. If complete surgical&#xD;
      resection is impossible, biopsy with or without palliative surgery (eg. bypass surgery) may&#xD;
      be performed. 4.6 Adjuvant/Maintenance Chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.6.1 Treatment schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have curative surgical resection will receive 6 cycles of adjuvant GOFL&#xD;
      chemotherapy within 4 weeks after surgery and then followed up until tumor progression.&#xD;
      Patients who are not feasible for curative resection, will receive continued chemotherapy of&#xD;
      GOFL 3-4 weeks after chemoradiotherapy complete. The regimen will continue till disease&#xD;
      progression. Patients who develop progressive disease during GOFL will shift to salvage&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
