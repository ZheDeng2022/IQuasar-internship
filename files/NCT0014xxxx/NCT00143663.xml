    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if patients with elevated cholesterol, but not&#xD;
      taking any other lipid medication, could lower their cholesterol with administration of&#xD;
      lapaquistat acetate, once daily (QD).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAK-475 (lapaquistat acetate) compared to&#xD;
      placebo in subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia. Subjects who have signed the informed&#xD;
      consent will undergo necessary evaluations to determine eligibility for a dietary run-in&#xD;
      phase. Subjects who meet randomization criteria will enter treatment with one of the&#xD;
      following randomized treatments: lapaquistat acetate or placebo.&#xD;
