  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women are vulnerable to malaria, with significant implications both for their health&#xD;
      and for the pregnancy. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is currently the first line drug for&#xD;
      the treatment of malaria in pregnancy in Tanzania and surrounding countries, but resistance&#xD;
      is emerging rapidly. Alternative drugs must be found, and new drugs and drug combinations are&#xD;
      being recommended by many for deployment as first line treatment at the point that SP&#xD;
      resistance forces a policy change. However, there are few data on the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      these combinations in pregnant women. This randomised trial aims to assess efficacy and&#xD;
      safety, including birth outcome, in pregnant women with malaria in the second or third&#xD;
      trimesters. A total of 900 pregnant women will be randomised either to standard treatment&#xD;
      (SP) or to one of three potential drugs, or drug combinations recently recommended by a WHO&#xD;
      expert panel. These will be SP-amodiaquine, chlorproguanil-dapsone (Lapdap), and&#xD;
      amodiaquine-artesunate. Primary outcome will be treatment failure. Secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      include 28 day slide clearance, maternal side effects, foetal viability and birth outcome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of SP as the&#xD;
      current first line drug, and three other potential alternative combinations in treating&#xD;
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria during pregnancy, in an area with appreciable levels of SP&#xD;
      resistance and rising HIV seroprevalence. Specifically the study will compare the clinical&#xD;
      and parasitological response to and the side effects of the following drug regimes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SP&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SP + amodiaquine (SPAQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Chlorproguanil+dapsone (Lapdap)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Amodiaquine + artesunate (AQAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point of the trial will be treatment failure. This will be defined as:-&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a need for rescue treatment due to clinical deterioration defined by altered sensorium,&#xD;
           convulsions, persistent vomiting, renal impairment, respiratory distress, a fall in Hb&#xD;
           below 75g/dl, or in cases where initial haemoglobin was less than 9 g/dl a drop of 20%&#xD;
           from the starting Hb if the initial Hb was less than 9g/dl, at any time during&#xD;
           admission;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. persistence of fever with parasitaemia on day 32;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. increasing parasite load on day 3;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. failure to clear parasites on day 7;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. rescue medication for recurrent malaria before day 14;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. slide parasite positivity at day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will include the following:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incidence of foetal death during treatment, defined as absence of foetal heartbeat&#xD;
           assessed by Doppler&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypoglycaemia requiring treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Parasite recrudescence or re-infection on day 28&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Parasite clearance on day 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Level of recovery of haemoglobin on day 14&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Fever clearance time&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Incidence of perinatal and neonatal mortality, assessed 4-6 weeks after due date of&#xD;
           delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Clinically apparent neonatal abnormality, assessed 4-6 weeks after due date of delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Placental malaria&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Preterm delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Other adverse events during treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This will be a randomized controlled trial with four arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The slide reader assessing the primary endpoint will be blind to treatment allocation,&#xD;
           and analysis will be performed by intention-to-treat&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Direct Observed Therapy (DOT) of all doses of study regimens will be employed&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Drug doses packed in blister packs, labelled with the patient number will be used where&#xD;
           possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Selection and Withdrawal of Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women with mild-moderate, slide proven, falciparum malaria will be recruited from&#xD;
      the Antenatal wing (ANC) of the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) clinic at Muheza (Teule)&#xD;
      Hospital. Pregnant women from Muheza Township and surrounding villages attend this clinic.&#xD;
      Nurses attending the clinic will interview all febrile women and women with a recent (past 24&#xD;
      hours) history of fever and those with a probable diagnosis of malaria will be referred to&#xD;
      the study team. Those with signs/symptoms of mild-moderate anaemia will also be referred. All&#xD;
      referrals will be re-interviewed and examined by the Medical Officer of the study team to&#xD;
      exclude concomitant infection(s). Duplicate thick and thin blood smears will be made, Giemsa&#xD;
      stained at pH 7.2, and examined microscopically. The consent form will be administered to&#xD;
      those meeting the inclusion criteria and they will be enrolled upon consenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pregnant woman who has:-&#xD;
&#xD;
      either a positive blood smear for P.falciparum with at least 1000 asexual parasites/uL in an&#xD;
      asymptomatic woman or any of the following symptoms within 2 days prior to consultation:&#xD;
      history of fever; headache, vomiting, chills/rigors, and/or any of the following signs:&#xD;
      temperature &gt;37.50C and &lt;39.50C, Hb &gt;5 and &lt;9 g/dl) together with P.falciparum parasitaemia&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. has no exclusion criterion (see below)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. is 14-34 weeks pregnant on the day of attending the ANC clinic or OPD;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. has a viable foetus, defined by presence of foetal heartbeat by sonicaid or pinnard&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. is able to take study drugs by the oral route&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. is able to attend stipulated days for follow up clinic and provide specimens&#xD;

           through her parent/guardian if aged &lt;15 years (in conformity to Tanzania Law)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those &gt; 34 weeks are excluded because they are close to term and may deliver during the 28&#xD;
      day follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. severe and complicated forms of malaria (as defined by WHO, 1996);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. pregnancy in the first trimester;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. a mixed plasmodial infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. complicated pregnancy e.g. signs/symptoms of toxaemia of pregnancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 23 or more abortions or stillbirths;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. presence of concomitant disease masking assessment of the response to treatment ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. an intake of drugs contraindicated in pregnancy e.g. tetracycline, cotrimoxazole or a&#xD;
           macrolide antibiotic;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. an intake of drugs with effective antimalarial activity within the last 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. significantly abnormal baseline haematology (except anaemia) or clinical chemistry&#xD;
           parameters e.g. laboratory evidence of renal impairment (serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dl) or&#xD;

&#xD;
       10. previous participation in the study: Women having a second episode of malaria after&#xD;
           completing the 28-day follow up will have details recorded and offered quinine but not&#xD;
           be re-enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. multiple gestation pregnancies eg twins&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Mother aged 38 years or above&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with malaria who do not enter the trial because they fulfil an exclusion criterion&#xD;
      will be treated in the optimum way decided by the attending physician. In general, those with&#xD;
      severe disease will receive parenteral quinine whilst those with mild disease will receive&#xD;
      SP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal criteria will include:-&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. protocol violation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If it is necessary to withdraw a patient during the treatment phase, administration of&#xD;
           the study drug will be discontinued. If the patient is still parasitaemic, quinine will&#xD;
           be given as a rescue therapy unless there are clinical reasons to use another drug. For&#xD;
           withdrawals outside the treatment phase the team will carry out all the safety and&#xD;
           efficacy assessment measurements that would have been carried out at the next scheduled&#xD;
           visit and the same will apply at delivery (unless the patient is lost to follow up).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients who fail on treatment will be treated with rescue treatment and counted as&#xD;
           treatment failures (see above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT OF PATIENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drugs will be purchased or sourced from reputable sources with Good Manufacturing&#xD;
      Practice (GMP). Dosages will be based on the body weight (kg) of the patient and the schedule&#xD;
      will be as below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SP (sulfadoxine 25mg/kg stat)(SP)&#xD;
&#xD;
