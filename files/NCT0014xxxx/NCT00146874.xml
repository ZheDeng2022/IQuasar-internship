      This registry will provide detailed patient demographics and characteristics at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment and will also provide data regarding predictors of clinical outcomes such as heart&#xD;
      failure decompensation, heart failure hospitalization, NYHA class, and quality of life.&#xD;

      The CRT RENEWAL Registry aims to characterize patient demographics and clinical attributes at&#xD;
      enrollment and overall event rates as defined by heart failure decompensation, heart failure&#xD;
      hospitalization, death, and ventricular arrhythmic events. The registry will also assess&#xD;
      clinical outcomes including quality of life (QOL), physical activity habits, and events&#xD;
      rates, along with device diagnostics such as Activity Log Index and heart rate&#xD;

             non-Guidant epicardial leads&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had an ejection fraction measured within six months of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who sign and date a Patient Informed Consent form at the enrollment visit&#xD;
