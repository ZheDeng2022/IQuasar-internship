  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from diabetes through many years have a risk of developing late diabetic&#xD;
      complications including changes in eyes, kidney, vessels and nerves. Late complications can&#xD;
      be postponed or avoided when assuring a good diabetes control, i.e. sensible diet, exercise,&#xD;
      frequent blood glucose measurements and a good medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood glucose regulation depends on two different factors i.e. the insulin need of the body&#xD;
      and the amount of insulin in the body. The amount of insulin, in blood, is decided by the&#xD;
      amount of insulin infused daily, whereas the insulin need depends on the patient's weight,&#xD;
      physical activity and diet. Overweight type 2 diabetes patients have a large insulin need and&#xD;
      especially this need is decisive for their development of diabetes. If these patients are&#xD;
      treated with Metformin, blood glucose decreases and the result is an easier weight loss for&#xD;
      the patient. Especially, when these patients take this drug, the development of late diabetic&#xD;
      complications, especially arteriosclerosis, can be avoided or postponed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether these favourable effects of Metformin are also present in type 1 diabetic patients&#xD;
      remains to be fully clarified, but some studies have indicated that this is the case. This&#xD;
      results in a better regulation of diabetes on a smaller insulin dose than the one given to&#xD;
      the patients before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin probably takes effect by increasing the glucose uptake in muscles and by reducing&#xD;
      the hepatic glucose production. The drug usually has no side-effects, but some patients do,&#xD;
      however, suffer from abdominal pain, small tendency to nausea, loose defaecation and a&#xD;
      metallic taste in the mouth. These side-effects are often temporary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project description&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 50 type 1 diabetic patients are offered to participate in the project. All are from&#xD;
      the outpatient clinic at the Department of Endocrinology. The project lasts 7 months divided&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An introductory period of one month introducing an optimisation of the insulin treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A 6 month period (in which neither the patients nor the treating doctor know which&#xD;
           medication is given) with either T. Metformin treatment twice daily or T. Placebo (lime)&#xD;
           twice daily together with the usual insulin treatment four times daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choice of either T. Metformin or T. Placebo will be made by draw, and as stated above, the&#xD;
      drug type will be unknown for both the patient and the treating doctor in order to make sure&#xD;
      that the investigation is as objective as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the examination period, the patients are asked to measure blood glucose four times&#xD;
      daily, i.e. before main meals and before bed time. These values will be used for regulating&#xD;
      the fasting insulin dose with help from the treating doctor, and for adjusting the daily&#xD;
      insulin dose. During the first and the last two days of the examination period we will also&#xD;
      ask the patients to measure blood glucose at 03h00 for two days. Those diurnal profiles will&#xD;
      be included in the evaluation of the blood glucose control during the treatment period.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the patients' blood pressures are determined during 24 hours before and after&#xD;
      the 6 months' treatment period. This will be carried out automatically by means of a blood&#xD;
      pressure cuff around the arm connected to a small apparatus registering the values during 24&#xD;
      hours. The apparatus can be taken home after installation at the outpatient clinic and can be&#xD;
      carried around in a belt around the waist until next day where the apparatus will be&#xD;
      dismantled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first and the last of 5 outpatient visits, blood tests will be taken (for evaluation&#xD;
      of the long-term blood glucose, kidney, liver, insulin and fat in blood) and nocturnal urine&#xD;
      must be collected and disposed in order to evaluate protein secretion and thereby kidney&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
