  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of E2007&#xD;
      given twice daily (bid) or once a day (qd) in patients with refractory partial-onset seizures&#xD;
      (including secondarily generalized seizures). The secondary objectives are to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, efficacy, concentration-efficacy relationship, and pharmacokinetics of E2007 and the&#xD;
      effects of E2007 on the Profile of Mood States (POMS) test.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provide written informed consent signed by patient or legal guardian prior to entering&#xD;
             the study or undergoing any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are reliable and willing to make themselves available for the study period and are&#xD;
             able to record seizures and report adverse events themselves or have a caregiver who&#xD;
             can record and report the events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female patients will be eligible for enrollment. Females should be either of&#xD;
             non-childbearing potential as a result of surgery, radiational therapy, menopause (one&#xD;
             year post onset), or of childbearing potential and practicing a medically acceptable&#xD;
             method of contraception (eg, abstinence, a barrier method plus spermicide, or&#xD;
             intrauterine device [IUD]) for at least three months before Visit 1 (Screening) and&#xD;
             for two months after the end of the study. They must also have a negative serum&#xD;
             beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) at Screening. Pregnant and/or lactating&#xD;
             females are excluded. Those women using an oral contraceptive must also be using an&#xD;
             additional approved method of contraception (eg, a barrier method plus spermicide, or&#xD;
             IUD) starting with the Baseline Phase and continuing throughout the entire study&#xD;
             period.&#xD;

             generalized seizures according to the International League Against Epilepsy's&#xD;
             Classification of Epileptic Seizures (1981). Diagnosis should have been established by&#xD;
             clinical history, electroencephalogram (EEG) and computed tomography/magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (CT/MRI) of the brain performed within the last 10 years and&#xD;
             consistent with localization-related epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have uncontrolled partial seizures despite having been treated with at least three&#xD;
             different anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) (given concurrently or sequentially) for at&#xD;
             least 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To be enrolled, patient must have averaged at least 4 partial seizures per month, with&#xD;
             no 21-day seizure-free period during the 2 months preceding randomization. To be&#xD;
             randomized, the patient must have had at least 3 seizures during the prospective&#xD;
             Baseline Phase (28 days), with no 21-day seizure-free period. This should be&#xD;
             documented in the form of medical history, medical records, or photocopied records of&#xD;
             the patient diary/patient chart. Simple partial seizures without motor signs will not&#xD;
             be counted towards this inclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;

             to take their medication(s) as directed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are on a stable dose(s) of the same AED(s) for the 2 months prior to Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If using a vagal nerve stimulator, it must have been implanted for at least 5 months&#xD;
             prior to Visit 1. Stimulator parameters may not be changed for at least 1 month prior&#xD;
             to Visit 1 or thereafter during the study. Magnet use will be allowed and documented&#xD;
             throughout the study.&#xD;

             investigational compound, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of non-motor simple partial seizures only.&#xD;
&#xD;

             epilepsies, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;

             seizures cannot be counted.&#xD;
