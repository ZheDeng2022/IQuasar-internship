    <textblock>
      Valproic acid is a leading mood stabilizer for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Its&#xD;
      well-known teratogenicity limits its use in young women of childbearing age. According to&#xD;
      toxicologic studies the teratogenicity of valproate stems from its free carboxylic group.&#xD;
      Valnoctamide is an isomer and an analog of valpromide. Unlike valpromide, valnoctamide does&#xD;
      not undergo a biotransformation to the corresponding free acid. It is also likely or at least&#xD;
      possible that valnoctamide is anti-bipolar. In mice valnoctamide has been shown to be&#xD;
      distinctly less teratogenic than valproate. An injection at day 8 of gestation produced only&#xD;
      1% exencephaly (as compared to 0-1% in control mice and 53% in valproate treated mice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are performing a double-blind controlled trial of valnoctamide as an&#xD;
      anti-bipolar drug. If shown to be anti-bipolar, valnoctamide could be an important valproate&#xD;
      substitute for young women with bipolar disorder who are at risk of pregnancy. Patients newly&#xD;
      admitted to the Beersheva Mental Health Center may participate if they meet Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria for mania or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder, manic type. Patients admitted to the study are treated with&#xD;
      risperidone at doses of the physicians' discretion beginning with 2 mg daily on days 1 and 2.&#xD;
      Valnoctamide or placebo is begun at doses of 600 mg per day (200 mg three times daily) and&#xD;
      increased to 1200 mg (400 mg three times daily) after four days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly ratings by a psychiatrist blind to the study drug are conducted using the Brief&#xD;
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMS), and the Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impression (CGI). Weekly blood is drawn for drug levels of valnoctamide to be measured by gas&#xD;
      chromatography. Each patient receives valnoctamide or placebo for 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low teratogenic mood stabilizers are a high priority for current research.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Valproic acid is a leading mood stabilizer for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Its&#xD;
      well-known teratogenicity limits its use in young women of childbearing age (1-3). The&#xD;
      alternative mood stabilizers such as lithium and carbamazepine also have teratogenic&#xD;
      potential so the treatment of bipolar disorder in young women is problematic. The&#xD;
      difficulties are particularly acute in those young women patients who respond well to&#xD;
      anti-bipolar therapy and maintain or begin normal interpersonal and marital relations and&#xD;
      desire to have children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One approach to this problem has been the search for valproic acid derivatives with less&#xD;
      teratogenic potential (4). According to toxicologic studies the teratogenicity of valproate&#xD;
      stems from its free carboxylic group (2, 3). Valpromide is an amide derivative of valproate&#xD;
      without the suspect free carboxylic group. It was synthesized and marketed and has&#xD;
      anticonvulsant efficacy, at least as good as valproic acid (1). There are some reports of its&#xD;
      efficacy in bipolar disorder as well (5). In some animal species, only a small amount of&#xD;
      valpromide is metabolized to valproic acid. However, in humans valpromide is metabolized to a&#xD;
      large degree to valproic acid and so it does not solve the problem of teratogenicity (1, 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valnoctamide is an isomer and an analog of valpromide. Unlike valpromide, valnoctamide does&#xD;
      not undergo biotransformation to the corresponding free acid (6-9). In animal studies it is&#xD;
      at least as anticonvulsant as valproate and valpromide (1, 6, 10). It has been marketed as an&#xD;
      anxiolytic and sedative in several European countries (as Nirvanil) including Italy, Holland&#xD;
      and Switzerland but has not actively been promoted as an anticonvulsant. It was marketed in&#xD;
      the USA as Axiquel by McNeil in the 1970's. Unfortunately, despite considerable efforts we&#xD;
      have not been able to obtain pharmacovigilance data from this period. Given its equivalence&#xD;
      to valproate and valpromide as an anticonvulsant in animal models of epilepsy (1, 6, 10), it&#xD;
      is reasonable to assume that valnoctamide is also anticonvulsant in humans. It is also likely&#xD;
      or at least possible that valnoctamide is anti-bipolar. In mice valnoctamide has been shown&#xD;
      to be distinctly less teratogenic than valproate (11). Injection at day 8 of gestation&#xD;
      produced only 1percent exencephaly (as compared to 0-1percent in control mice and 53 percent&#xD;
      in valproate treated mice). Embryolethality rates showed similar results: 52 percent with&#xD;
      valproate vs. 5percent in the controls and 2 percent with valnoctamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valnoctamide's patent is expired (12) and it is not the property of any major pharmaceutical&#xD;
      company. Pharmaceutical company support cannot be obtained for our trial; therefore it is&#xD;
      investigator initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valnoctamide will be synthesized for our study by Banyan Chemical in India (which has been&#xD;
      inspected by the FDA) by GLP (good laboratory practice) in a manner acceptable for human use&#xD;
      by the Israel Ministry of Health (and in principle for an IND by the FDA). Banyan&#xD;
      manufactures at the same site generic compounds, atenolol for instance, sold in the USA and&#xD;
      distributed by international companies, Novartis for instance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been submitted to our Helsinki Committee and only patients who give informed&#xD;
      written consent will be accepted. Patients newly admitted to the Beersheva Mental Health&#xD;
      Center may participate if they meet DSM-IV criteria for mania or schizoaffective disorder,&#xD;
      manic type. Minimal Young Mania Scale = 20. Only patients admitted to the hospital within the&#xD;
      previous 72 hours will be eligible for the study. Exclusion criteria will be as in previous&#xD;
      studies of mania with this design by our group (15-17) and will include drug abuse, active&#xD;
      physical illness, and of course pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to the study will be treated with risperidone at doses of physicians'&#xD;
      discretion beginning with 2 mg daily on days 1 and 2. On days 3 and 4 the risperidone dose&#xD;
      could be increased to a maximum of 4 mg daily or decreased to 1mg daily. On days 5 to study&#xD;
      end the dose could be increased to a maximum of 6 mg daily or decreased to a minimum of 1mg&#xD;
      (see ref #18). Dose of risperidone will be a secondary outcome measure (see reference #15 &amp;&#xD;
      #16). No washout from previous medication is required but patients who received depot&#xD;
      neuroleptics within the past 2 weeks or more than 300 mg of chlorpromazine equivalents in the&#xD;
      past three days will be excluded. Trihexyphenidyl (up to 4 mg daily) will be available as&#xD;
      necessary for extrapyramidal symptoms and benzodiazepines for sleep. Valnoctamide or placebo&#xD;
      will be begun at doses of 600 mg per day (200 mg three times daily) and increased to 1200 mg&#xD;
      (400 mg three times daily) after four days. This dose is based on relative anticonvulsant&#xD;
      effects of valproate and valnoctamide in animal studies (1, 6, 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive valnoctamide or identical capsules of placebo as assigned by the&#xD;
      control psychiatrist according to random order; manic and schizoaffective manic patients will&#xD;
      be randomized separately. Weekly ratings by a psychiatrist blind to the study drug will be&#xD;
      conducted using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Young Mania Rating Scale&#xD;
      (YMS), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Primary outcome measure will be BPRS. Weekly&#xD;
      blood will be drawn for drug levels of valnoctamide to be measured by gas chromatography&#xD;
      (19). Each patient will receive valnoctamide or placebo for 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have demonstrated significant effects as add-on in mania in this design with lithium (15),&#xD;
      carbamazepine (16), and phenytoin (17). Each study had an N of about 40 patients, recruited&#xD;
      over 18 months in each study. In each study as in the present proposal, a mood stabilizer or&#xD;
      potential mood stabilizer was added to haloperidol at doses of physician's discretion for&#xD;
      five weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lithium adds clinically and statistically significant benefit to haloperidol treatment of&#xD;
      mania (15) as does carbamazepine (16) and phenytoin (17). Such an &quot;add-on&quot; design is&#xD;
      consistent with clinical practice and makes sense since dopamine blockers and mood&#xD;
      stabilizers probably work by different mechanisms in mania. Valproate is typically used&#xD;
      clinically in acute mania as an add-on to neuroleptics as well. Three positive studies&#xD;
      published in excellent journals (15-17) from our group using this design are probably better&#xD;
      than formal power analysis, which depends on a range of assumptions that are collapsible into&#xD;
      the experience of our three studies. Because the prior probability of an effect of&#xD;
      valnoctamide is lower than that of the above well-known compounds, we suggest recruitment of&#xD;
      80 patients over 36 months to adequately power this study rather than the 40 patients in each&#xD;
      of our previous studies. Since valnoctamide is no longer patented, orphan drug procedures or&#xD;
      a use patent of the type granted to Abbott for divalproex sodium will be necessary to make&#xD;
      this drug available for bipolar patients at risk for pregnancy in the future. An adequately&#xD;
      powered study is therefore important at this stage.&#xD;
