      Pulmonary inflammation plays an important role in the development of chronic lung disease&#xD;
      (CLD) in preterm infants. This inflammation occurs very early in postnatal life. Any therapy&#xD;
      that could be beneficial in preventing CLD should be started very early. The investigators'&#xD;
      previous double-blind study has shown that early (&lt; 12 hours) postnatal use of intravenous&#xD;
      dexamethasone for 4 weeks significantly suppressed pulmonary inflammation and significantly&#xD;
      reduced the incidence of CLD. However, the use of dexamethasone was associated with increased&#xD;
      incidence of infection and sepsis. Their follow-up study also suggested an increase in the&#xD;
      incidence of psychomotor anomalies. As compared to intravenous administration, endotracheal&#xD;
      instillation will provide more local anti-inflammatory effects and less systemic side&#xD;
      effects. Infants will be eligible for the study if their birth weight (BW) is &lt; 1500 gm and&#xD;
      if they had severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) requiring mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      shortly after birth. After informed consent is obtained, the infant will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      depending on the condition of the infant. The primary outcome is the change in cytokines&#xD;
      (interleukin-6, 8, 10 and TNF-α) levels in BAL fluid. Chronic lung disease (CLD) was judged&#xD;
      at 36 postmenstrual weeks. Infants in the study group (S/B group) received surfactant&#xD;
      (Survanta®, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL; 100 mg or 4 mL/kg/dose) and Budesonide&#xD;
      (Pulmicort®, AstraZeneca Pty Ltd., Australia; 0.5 mg or 1mL/kg/dose), while those in the&#xD;
      control group (S group) received surfactant (Survanta® Abbott, 100 mg/kg/dose) and saline&#xD;
      (1mL/kg).&#xD;

      Growing evidence suggests that early, postnatal pulmonary inflammation may play an important&#xD;
      role in the development of chronic lung disease (CLD) in preterm infants on mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation.The investigator's previous study demonstrated that interleukin-8 (IL-8), a&#xD;
      marker of inflammation, in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid increased by as early as 2 days&#xD;
      of age in infants who subsequently developed CLD compared with infants who did not develop&#xD;
      the disease. Thus for any therapy to be beneficial in preventing CLD, it should be started&#xD;
      very early. Early postnatal use of intravenous dexamethasone therapy for 4 weeks&#xD;
      significantly suppressed pulmonary inflammation and significantly reduced the incidence of&#xD;
      CLD. However, the use of dexamethasone was associated with increased incidence of infection&#xD;
      and sepsis which affected the immediate outcome and contributed significantly to mortality.&#xD;
      It was shown that school age children who had received early postnatal dexamethasone therapy&#xD;
      for the prevention of CLD showed a significant increase in incidence of neuromotor and&#xD;
      cognitive delay. Based on the results of these studies, early systemic dexamethasone therapy&#xD;
      should not be recommended. Budesonide has high local anti-inflammatory activity and is one of&#xD;
      the most extensively used inhaled glucocorticoids. Budesonide decreases airway&#xD;
      hyperresponsiveness and reduces the number of inflammatory cells and mediators present in the&#xD;
      airways of patients with asthma. A previous study indicated that the addition of Budesonide&#xD;
      to Survanta did not affect the surface tension. We proposed a randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      study whether early endotracheal instillation of Surfactant-Budesonide (S/B) mixture would&#xD;
      reduce lung inflammation and improve pulmonary outcome. We will measure the cytokines levels&#xD;
      in BAL fluid to evaluate the local anti-inflammatory effect of S/B treatment.&#xD;
