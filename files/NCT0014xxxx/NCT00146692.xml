  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective control strategies for malaria depend both on preventing disease and on treating&#xD;
      those who become infected to prevent significant morbidity and mortality. There are many&#xD;
      barriers to preventing access to prompt and effective treatment, some of which are amenable&#xD;
      to intervention, others (such as distance to healthcare) less so. This study will concentrate&#xD;
      on modifiable financial barriers to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the aim of increasing health service utilization and reducing morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      among children under five, some governments are currently implementing policies aimed at&#xD;
      reducing financial barriers to health care. There is at the same time an on-going debate&#xD;
      concerning the relative importance of cost as a barrier to health care. Though theoretically&#xD;
      the aim for reducing these barriers should be achieved, its actual impact has not been&#xD;
      directly assessed or demonstrated by means of an intervention trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine by means of a randomized trial the impact of reducing such&#xD;
      barriers on morbidity due to severe malaria among children 6 months to five years and on&#xD;
      outpatient utilization. An existing pre-payment scheme in the study area will be utilized to&#xD;
      improve financial access for half of 2500 households who have not registered for either year&#xD;
      I or II. The impact on severe anaemia, mean haemoglobin and anthropometric measurements will&#xD;
      be assessed. Health service utilisation rates will be measured in both groups by active and&#xD;
      passive surveillance. Patient perceptions and health-seeking behaviour will be compared. The&#xD;
      study will contribute to the current debate on the relative importance of cost of care as a&#xD;
      barrier to health care and the potential for the removal of this barrier as a strategy for&#xD;
      malaria control, and on methods to optimise this.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      General:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess by means of a randomized trial, the impact of improving financial access to primary&#xD;
      health care on morbidity due to severe malaria and utilization of health services among&#xD;
      children six months to five years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare rates of severe anaemia in children under five years of age from households&#xD;
           randomized to those with improved financial access and those without for the first year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the number of admissions to hospital with malaria among children under five&#xD;
           years of age from households with improved access and households without.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the health service utilization rate among children under five years of age&#xD;
           from households with improved access and households without.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the reported median period between the onset of febrile (presumed malaria)&#xD;
           illness and reporting at health facilities among children under five years of age from&#xD;
           households with improved access and households without.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To document community knowledge, attitude and practice with regards to severe malaria&#xD;
           user fees, exemptions pre-payment schemes and indicators of poverty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of improved&#xD;
      financial access to primary health care on morbidity due to severe malaria and utilization of&#xD;
      services among children 6 months to 5 years. It will have a quantitative element based on&#xD;
      pre-determined outcomes as well as a qualitative element.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The intervention group will be enrolled into a pre-payment scheme operating in&#xD;
      the area which will allow them free access to primary care including diagnosis and drugs&#xD;
      whenever they are ill with no limit, and limited access to secondary health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will have to pay user fees for their health care as pertains normally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Enrolment Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be selected using the process outlined in the trial profile in the&#xD;
      annexe. The actual study participants will be children between 6 months and five years of age&#xD;
      in the households selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Child in household aged between 6 months and 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent from parents&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Household to which child belongs resident in the Dodowa sub-district and intending to&#xD;
           remain resident until the end of the next two years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents refuse to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Household due to emigrate from study area within two years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Household currently enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Procedure A stratified randomization procedure will be used. Households will be&#xD;
      divided into three strata based on residence being ≤5km, 5-10km, and &gt;10km from the health&#xD;
      centre respectively since distance from health facility is known to be a major determinant to&#xD;
      its use and may not be adequately taken care of with simple random allocation. Allocation of&#xD;
      the intervention will be carried out separately within each stratum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Household heads within each stratum will be invited to meetings at which random numbers will&#xD;
      be allocated to each household. The numbers on raffle tickets will then be dropped into a&#xD;
      rotating barrel and mixed up thoroughly in the view of all after which the barrel will be&#xD;
      rotated. A child will be invited to pick the papers which will be allocated to intervention&#xD;
      or control as they are drawn, alternately. Those in the intervention group will have&#xD;
      pre-payment made for year one; the others will have it in year 2. After each draw the barrel&#xD;
      will be rotated once more. This process will be used to make the trial more acceptable to&#xD;
      community members by showing them the lack of favouritism and randomness of the allocation&#xD;
      (Adapted from [43]. Since registration would have closed for the year, households will not be&#xD;
      able to change their group until the study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Prevalence of severe anaemia among children under five years of age in both groups after&#xD;
      one peak malaria transmission season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean haemoglobin count among the two groups at study end&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of admissions to hospital with malaria among children under five years of age in&#xD;
           both groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Average number of visits to per child under five years to primary care facility among&#xD;
           both groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric measurements of children in the two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All cause mortality in both groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      All households in the Dodowa sub-district with at least one child 6 months to 5 years who do&#xD;
      not register in the pre-payment scheme for the year will be eligible to participate in the&#xD;
      study. The information will be obtained from the data base of households at the DHIMT&#xD;
      offices. This sub-district, which is mainly forest with an estimated 2003 midyear population&#xD;
      of 30,154, has been selected because earlier studies have shown that it has the highest&#xD;
      incidence of malaria in the district. Household heads or their representatives will be&#xD;
      invited to either of three locality meetings based on distance from the health facility,&#xD;
      where the study will be explained to them and consent sought for their participation in the&#xD;
      study. Those agreeing to participate will have their particulars recorded and enrolled into&#xD;
      the study. They will then be randomized into two groups using the procedure already&#xD;
      described. Baseline data collection including haematological, anthropometric assessments and&#xD;
      interviews will then be carried out on all participants and slides for parasites in a random&#xD;
      subset. Background variables about the household including known risk factors for malaria&#xD;
      such as type of housing, use of insecticide treated materials, use of other preventive&#xD;
      measures and some indicators of household wealth will be documented. Children found to have&#xD;
      haemoglobin count less than 6g/dl, fever or a history of fever and patent parasitaemia will&#xD;
      be treated according to local guidelines; this will not be a reason for withdrawal from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between those who voluntarily registered in the pre-payment scheme and those who&#xD;
      did not, in terms of health service utilization, health status, household wealth and other&#xD;
      variables will be documented as a subsidiary part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidity monitoring will be carried out through a hospital/clinic based passive case&#xD;
      detection system throughout the malaria transmission season from May to October. This will be&#xD;
      complemented by one cross-sectional household survey at the end of the malaria transmission&#xD;
      season in November during which interviews, haematological, parasitological and&#xD;
      anthropometric assessments will be repeated. Children found to have severe anemia during the&#xD;
      second survey will have a haematological work-up comprising Hb electrophoresis, full blood&#xD;
      count, and stool examination. All study participants who visit the clinic will be treated by&#xD;
      the health workers as usual in accordance with the current standard treatment guidelines in&#xD;
      Ghana. In the case of mortality, at a culturally appropriate time, a trained field worker&#xD;
      will visit the home and a standard questionnaire will be administered to the child's mother&#xD;
      or caretaker. The results will be reviewed by three independent physicians to arrive at a&#xD;
      possible diagnosis. If two out of three agree on a diagnosis of malaria, this diagnosis will&#xD;
      be accepted. For children who visited hospital or died in the hospital, hospital case notes&#xD;
      will be reviewed and where necessary, the attending physician will be interviewed for more&#xD;
      complete information on the child's illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard clinic record forms will be used to collect data from the primary care clinic or&#xD;
      hospital through a combination of direct interviews and abstraction of information from their&#xD;
      case notes by trained research health staff. Any unclear information in the case notes will&#xD;
      be verified with the clinician concerned immediately. Field data will also be collected by&#xD;
      means of standard pre-coded questionnaires administered to household heads. Individual&#xD;
      in-depth interviews will also be administered to respondents using an interview guide. Focus&#xD;
      groups will be organized by contacting the participants and arranging for a suitable meeting&#xD;
      date, time and venue, the previous week. Focus groups will consist of 8-12 discussants with a&#xD;
      moderator and an observer/notetaker. Discussions will be recorded by means of a tape recorder&#xD;
      with permission from discussants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A finger-prick sample of blood will be obtained using a haemocue® microcuvette for&#xD;
      haemoglobin count estimation. Thick and thin blood films will be obtained from the same&#xD;
      finger prick sample for parasitological measurements for both surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children will be weighed using infant weighing scales or hanging scales that are usually&#xD;
      used for weighing children during child welfare clinics for children unable to stand alone&#xD;
      and a mechanical stand-on scale for older children who can stand alone. Supine length of&#xD;
      children will be recorded using a measuring board whilst a height measure will be used to&#xD;
      take the standing height of all children 2 years and above. The mid upper arm circumference&#xD;
      (MUAC) of each child will be measured with a MUAC tape (TALC Institute of Child Health).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be recorded on pre-coded questionnaires or clinical data record forms&#xD;
      whilst qualitative data will be recorded both on tape recorder and small notebooks. Data will&#xD;
      be checked daily for accuracy and consistency, correctly labelled, and stored for data entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For quantitative data, data entry clerks will carry out double entry of the raw data from&#xD;
      questionnaires and clinical record forms in an electronic form into Microsoft Access. After&#xD;
      data entry, data cleaning will be carried out to identify errors and inconsistencies for&#xD;
      correction. Analysis will be carried out using Stata version 8. Summary statistics, odds&#xD;
      ratios, confidence limits and p-values will all be calculated to compare outcomes between the&#xD;
      two groups for the primary end point and secondary endpoints. Stratified analysis will be&#xD;
      carried out based on age, sex, distance from health facility and household wealth. Means of&#xD;
      continuous variables such as rise in haemoglobin count will be compared using the Student&#xD;
      t-test. Geometric means will be used to compare parasite densities. Qualitative data will be&#xD;
      analysed using Textbase Alpha after converting the transcribed text file into an ASCII file.&#xD;
