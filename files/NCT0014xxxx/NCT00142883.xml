  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a type of neurotransmitter, which is a chemical that&#xD;
      transmits information within and from the brain to all parts of the body. By lowering the&#xD;
      level of another neurotransmitter called dopamine, GABA may have the ability to diminish&#xD;
      cocaine cravings in addicts. The purpose of this study is to gather information on the&#xD;
      interaction between cocaine and selected GABA enhancing medications in individuals addicted&#xD;
      to cocaine. This may lead to future clinical studies using GABA medications to treat cocaine&#xD;
      addiction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that is found primarily in the brain. High GABA levels&#xD;
      result in low levels of dopamine, another neurotransmitter that is the brain's &quot;feel good&quot;&#xD;
      chemical and which plays a primary role in cocaine drug addiction. Cravings for cocaine can&#xD;
      be reduced by lowering dopamine levels. This makes GABA-altering medications a potential&#xD;
      treatment for cocaine addiction. This study will involve five GABA enhancing medications:&#xD;
      tiagabine, topiramate, valproic acid, baclofen, and progesterone. The purpose of the study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the interaction between GABA medications and cocaine in terms of safety and&#xD;
      craving responses. In turn, these findings may guide future cocaine pharmacotherapy trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 6-day inpatient study will begin with an orientation session to familiarize participants&#xD;
      with study procedures. The evening of Day 1, all participants will receive placebo&#xD;
      medication. On Days 2 through 4, participants will receive one of five GABA medications. The&#xD;
      GABA medications will be given in gradually increasing doses to attain therapeutic levels&#xD;
      while maintaining safety and minimizing side effects. Three experimental cocaine sessions&#xD;
      will take place; one while the participants are receiving the placebo medication and two&#xD;
      while the participants are receiving the GABA medications. During these sessions, cocaine&#xD;
      will be administered intravenously in three increasing doses, each separated by 30-minute&#xD;
      intervals. This will allow the participants' subjective and physiological responses during&#xD;
      cocaine administration to return to baseline levels before the next dose. Blood will be drawn&#xD;
      after each dose; heart rate, blood pressure, and an ECG will be monitored throughout the&#xD;
      sessions. At the end of each session, questionnaires will be administered to assess the&#xD;
      effects of cocaine and related mood states, as well as allow the participants to report any&#xD;
      adverse events, depression, craving, or withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is now closed and published.&#xD;
