  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if 3% hypertonic saline (salt-water solution) given&#xD;
      in a vein improves the headache that may be caused by a concussion. 3% hypertonic saline may&#xD;
      also improve some of the other symptoms that may be caused by concussion (for example:&#xD;
      confusion, nausea, vomiting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is being done because there have been previous experience which suggests that&#xD;
      3% hypertonic saline has been beneficial in the treatment of children with more severe brain&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A concussion is formally described as a clinical syndrome characterized by immediate and&#xD;
      transient changes in brain function including alteration of mental status and level of&#xD;
      consciousness, resulting from mechanical force or trauma. Despite its prevalence, its&#xD;
      pathophysiology remains a mystery as does its spectrum of clinical presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A concussion, sometimes described as a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), can often present&#xD;
      with initial loss of consciousness, change in behavior, confusion, amnesia, or aphasia which&#xD;
      all result in a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) that is less than normal. As the time from the&#xD;
      initial injury lengthens, these symptoms can progressively worsen and new symptoms such as&#xD;
      vomiting and headaches can also develop. Usually, there is no evidence of a significant&#xD;
      intracranial injury by computed tomography (CT) imaging and these symptoms often improve with&#xD;
      a gradual progression towards a normal neurologic baseline; in fact, the risk of complication&#xD;
      in this population is very rare. The time for this improvement varies greatly and can occur&#xD;
      over a period ranging from hours to days. During this transient time, the patient is often&#xD;
      very uncomfortable due to persistent headaches, inability to tolerate oral intake due to&#xD;
      nausea and/or vomiting, confusion, and episodes of amnesia. In some instances, the combative&#xD;
      behavior of the patient can be difficult to tolerate both by the family and the medical&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Just as the symptoms caused by a concussion vary greatly in presentation and duration, so do&#xD;
      the theories behind the pathophysiology of mild TBI. The transient loss of cerebral function&#xD;
      after a head injury was formally differentiated from severe head injury for the first time by&#xD;
      the Persian physician Rhazes in 900 AD and has since caused much speculation and varying&#xD;
      clinical descriptions throughout history. It took another 500 years before a &quot;commotion&quot; or&#xD;
      shaking of the brain was theorized to be responsible for clinical signs. Presently, the exact&#xD;
      cause of concussive symptoms continue to remain an enigma; a major question however, is&#xD;
      whether a concussion is due to a lesser degree of diffuse structural change seen in severe&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury, or if it is in fact a mechanism caused by reversible functional&#xD;
      changes of the neurons and axons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal models have demonstrated altered metabolic profiles of the brain tissue which resolves&#xD;
      within hours of initial insult. Other animal models have demonstrated a change in the&#xD;
      integrity of the microvascular endothelium after TBI. It can be hypothesized that there are&#xD;
      areas of &quot;microcontusion&quot; and pericontusional edema that maybe responsible for alterations in&#xD;
      brain chemistry which may ultimately lead to the clinical symptoms associated with mild TBI.&#xD;
      Multiple other studies have theorized that the direct and indirect effects of trauma on&#xD;
      cerebral vasculature may lead to a vasoconstrictive phenomenon that may be responsible for&#xD;
      postconcussive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the management of patients with mild traumatic brain injuries includes observation&#xD;
      and symptomatic therapies including analgesia without obscuring a neurologic exam&#xD;
      (acetaminophen) and antiemetic measures (ondansetron). While many patients are often&#xD;
      discharged home after initial evaluation in the Emergency Department, some are admitted to&#xD;
      the hospital for supportive care. The symptoms may resolve in a period of hours to days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been substantial retrospective data and limited prospective data in children which&#xD;
      suggests that hypertonic saline (HTS) can improve the control of intracranial pressure (ICP)&#xD;
      in patients with acute brain injury. In 1992, a report published by the Journal of&#xD;
      Neurosurgical Anesthesiology indicated that HTS reduced elevated ICP in children after head&#xD;
      injury. This study looked at a single intravenous bolus of HTS in comparison to the same&#xD;
      volume of normal saline and demonstrated a clear difference. Subsequently, it was&#xD;
      demonstrated that HTS appears to be efficacious in controlling ICP. In a retrospective chart&#xD;
      review, 68 children with closed head injury were cared for using a standardized protocol and&#xD;
      the intravenous infusion of 3% HTS in quantities designed to drive the serum sodium to levels&#xD;
      that would reduce the ICP to less than 20 mmHg. Of the patients in who HTS was used, only 3&#xD;
      patients (4%) died of uncontrolled ICP. Of note, there were no adverse effects of&#xD;
      super-physiologic hyperosmolarity such as renal failure, pulmonary edema, or central pontine&#xD;
      demyelination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of 3% hypertonic saline in traumatic brain injury has recently been investigated by&#xD;
      many centers and is now included as first tier therapy in the management of decreasing&#xD;
      intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to severe traumatic brain injury in the pediatric&#xD;
      population. Its mechanism in ICP reduction lies in its favorable rheologic and osmolar&#xD;
      gradient effects; it concomitantly augments intravascular volume and increase mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure to provide optimum cerebral perfusion pressure. Again, multiple studies have shown&#xD;
      the direct effect of HTS in lowering ICP along with its safety in a pediatric population. HTS&#xD;
      has also been used to treat altered mental status in diabetic ketoacidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the symptoms associated with mild traumatic brain injury may be due to mild&#xD;
      elevations in intracranial pressure, minimal cerebral edema, and/or vasospasm of the cerebral&#xD;
      vasculature. Hypertonic saline may be instrumental in improving the symptoms of concussion by&#xD;
      addressing the commonly suspected mechanisms responsible for these symptoms. By reducing mild&#xD;
      cerebral edema and/or improving cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral vasospasm may be&#xD;
      overcome by reversal or by improved flow; thus, 3% HTS may allow favorable treatment of&#xD;
      postconcussive symptoms.&#xD;
