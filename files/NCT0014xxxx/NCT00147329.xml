  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Merrimack is conducting a research study to see if an experimental drug, called MM-093, is&#xD;
      safe and effective in the treatment of psoriasis. MM-093 is a genetically engineered version&#xD;
      of a naturally occurring protein called alpha fetoprotein (AFP). Adults normally have very&#xD;
      small amounts of AFP in their bloodstream. However, during pregnancy, AFP levels in both the&#xD;
      mother and the fetus are much higher than normal. It has been observed that some women with&#xD;
      psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis have fewer symptoms&#xD;
      during pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester. At this time, the levels of AFP in&#xD;
      the blood of the mother and fetus are the highest. This observation led Merrimack to begin&#xD;
      examining MM-093 as a potential treatment for psoriasis. This study is designed to further&#xD;
      test the safety and effectiveness of MM-093 in patients with psoriasis.&#xD;
