  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor inhibitory control has been proposed to be central to the cognitive deficits and&#xD;
      symptomatology associated with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD is a&#xD;
      highly heritable disorder with an increased incidence among the siblings of affected&#xD;
      individuals. In the current proposal we investigate the expression of genetic susceptibility&#xD;
      for ADHD in brain functioning. We will study cognitive functioning in patients with ADHD,&#xD;
      their unaffected siblings and healthy matched controls. Our aims are 1) to determine whether&#xD;
      increased familial risk for ADHD is associated with differential patterns of brain activation&#xD;
      compared to normally developing children, during the performance of tasks designed to probe&#xD;
      cognitive functions that are compromised in ADHD and 2) to determine whether differential&#xD;
      patterns of activation are similar for boys with ADHD and their unaffected siblings.&#xD;

      Poor inhibitory control has been proposed to be central to the cognitive deficits and&#xD;
      symptomatology associated with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD is a&#xD;
      highly heritable disorder with an increased incidence among the siblings of affected&#xD;
      individuals. Although studies investigating candidate genes are underway, as yet it remains&#xD;
      unclear via which mechanisms the presence of risk genes leads to symptomatology. There is&#xD;
      evidence to suggest that individuals at increased genetic risk display some of the cognitive&#xD;
      deficits associated with the disorder. In particular poor inhibitory control has been put&#xD;
      forward as a potential marker for familial ADHD. Neuroimaging techniques now make it possible&#xD;
      to investigate the neural substrate of cognitive deficits associated with psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to demonstrate that the neural&#xD;
      substrate of cognitive brain function is affected in ADHD. Using a task that taxes inhibitory&#xD;
      systems at varying levels of task demands, we demonstrated that increased susceptibility to&#xD;
      interference in children with ADHD is paralleled by differences in brain activation, with&#xD;
      these children displaying a relative lack of fronto-striatal activation. In a recent study,&#xD;
      we demonstrated that the unaffected siblings of patients with ADHD show cortical volumetric&#xD;
      deficits, similar to patients themselves. This suggests that individuals at increased risk&#xD;
      for ADHD share some of the neural basis of cognitive deficits associated with this disorder.&#xD;
      In the current proposal we set out to investigate the expression of genetic susceptibility&#xD;
      for ADHD in brain functioning. We will study cognitive functioning in patients with ADHD,&#xD;
      their unaffected siblings and healthy matched controls focusing on cognitive control. Our&#xD;
      aims are 1) to determine whether increased familial risk for ADHD is associated with&#xD;
      differential patterns of brain activation compared to normally developing children, during&#xD;
      the performance of tasks designed to probe cognitive functions that are compromised in ADHD&#xD;
      and 2) to determine whether differential patterns of activation are similar for boys with&#xD;
      ADHD and their unaffected siblings. We intend to include 30 boys with ADHD, 30 of their&#xD;
      brothers without ADHD, and 30 matched normal controls in 3 studies focusing on cognitive&#xD;
      control and similar cognitive functions that are compromised in ADHD. We will include 10 boys&#xD;
      in each group for each study. The proposed studies will utilize variations of a parametric go&#xD;
      nogo paradigm previously developed. All subjects will be asked to participate in a functional&#xD;
      MR scanning session lasting up to an hour. The whole visit will last a maximum of two hours.&#xD;
      There are no known risks associated with MR scanning, therefore this procedure is considered&#xD;
      completely safe. By participating in a simulation prior to the scan, we will also minimize&#xD;
      anxiety for the subjects. Furthermore, the study will immediately be terminated if a subject&#xD;
      becomes anxious, or otherwise indicates that he no longer wishes to participate. All subjects&#xD;
      will be offered a gift certificate as a token of appreciation for their effort. In addition,&#xD;
      they will be reimbursed for travel expenses.&#xD;
