  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a single application of Lidocaine gel topical&#xD;
      anesthesia is as effective in decreasing the discomfort associated with urinary&#xD;
      catheterization as two applications, within our pediatric population. Currently, two&#xD;
      applications is our standard of care within our pediatric Radiology Department. Urinary&#xD;
      catheterization is the process of placing a flexible tube into the urinary opening (urethra),&#xD;
      to drain urine or instill radiographic solution for study of the anatomy and/or function of&#xD;
      the urinary system. Members of the study team hypothesize equivalence in the observer&#xD;
      reported catheterization pain scores as measured by the FLACC pain scale. The study is&#xD;
      designed to obtain conclusive data to guide clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team hypothesizes that statistically similar levels of analgesia will be observed&#xD;
      with the single application procedure as compared to the multiple application technique.&#xD;

      This randomized control trial is designed to obtain conclusive data to guide clinical&#xD;
      practice and will be a single site study. The study examines variations in observer reported&#xD;
      catheterization pain levels when pre-treatment occurs through either a single application&#xD;
      technique or a double application strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two treatment groups have been established for this investigation with individual assignment&#xD;
      into either of the two cohorts occurring through randomization. These two intervention groups&#xD;
      include (1) usual care with two applications (the control group) and (2) single application&#xD;
      (study group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients randomized to the control group will receive one application of gel externally&#xD;
      and one internal application of Lidocaine gel internally into the urethra, five minutes&#xD;
      apart. The final application occurs five minutes prior to catheterization. The second group&#xD;
      of patients is randomized to a pre-catheterization analgesia strategy that uses one internal&#xD;
      application five minutes prior to catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      400 patients from two months through 7 years of age will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      study. The primary outcome variable will be the cumulative FLACC pain score. The FLACC pain&#xD;
      scale is a simple graph for scoring the distress behavior or observed pain responses in&#xD;
      children who may not be able to rate the presence or severity of pain. One consistent&#xD;
      observer will be utilized to provide the scoring of this pain scale, and will remained&#xD;
      blinded to the method of Lidocaine application to which the child is randomized. A Child Life&#xD;
      Specialist will be responsible for offering age-appropriate diversion and comfort techniques&#xD;
      during the procedure. A parental survey will be completed by the parent(s) at the conclusion&#xD;
      of the study, to be collected in a locked survey box.&#xD;
