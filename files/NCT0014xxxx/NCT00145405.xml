  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The morbidity and the mortality in acromegalic patients closely correspond to growth hormone&#xD;
      (GH) levels and therefore efficient long-term treatment is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurosurgery is the first choice of treatment in acromegalic patients. Surgery normalizes GH&#xD;
      levels in about 80% of patients with microadenomas, but less than 50 % of patients with&#xD;
      macroadenomas respond sufficiently to surgery alone. In most patients, additional medical&#xD;
      therapy is therefore needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somatostatin analogues have successfully been used in treatment of acromegaly if surgery or&#xD;
      radiotherapy can not lead to normal GH and IGF-I levels. Lanreotide Autogel (LAN) is a new&#xD;
      formulation of lanreotide consisting of a prolonged release aqueous formulation, which can be&#xD;
      injected intramuscularly or deep subcutaneously once every 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of OCT and LAN in obtaining GH and&#xD;
      IGF-I levels according to the 2000 Consensus. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate which&#xD;
      treatment modality resulted in the lowest possible IGF-I and GH levels and the highest&#xD;
      patient satisfaction.&#xD;

      Introduction The morbidity and the mortality in acromegalic patients closely correspond to&#xD;
      growth hormone (GH) levels and therefore efficient long-term treatment is important (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurosurgery is the first choice of treatment in acromegalic patients. Surgery normalizes GH&#xD;
      levels in about 80% of patients with microadenomas, but less than 50 % of patients with&#xD;
      macroadenomas respond sufficiently to surgery alone (1). In most patients, additional medical&#xD;
      therapy is therefore needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somatostatin analogues have successfully been used in treatment of acromegaly if surgery or&#xD;
      radiotherapy can not lead to normal GH and IGF-I levels (2, 3, 4, 5). Lanreotide Autogel&#xD;
      (LAN) is a new formulation of lanreotide consisting of a prolonged release aqueous&#xD;
      formulation, which can be injected intramuscularly or deep subcutaneously once every 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of OCT and LAN in obtaining GH&#xD;
      and IGF-I levels according to the 2000 Consensus. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate which&#xD;
      treatment modality resulted in the lowest possible IGF-I and GH levels and the highest&#xD;
      patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  all the patients which receive octreotide LAR can be included;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  new diagnosed patients with clinical and biochemical acromegaly , if medicine therapy is&#xD;
           indicated;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  as long as they do not fit in the exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  which had not given their consent after they received standard information about the&#xD;
           study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  current malign disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  somatostatin analogues intolerance;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  elevation of lever enzymes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The study is designed as a randomized cross-over trial. Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either OCT or LAN for 6 months and will be then changed to the opposite therapy for 6&#xD;
      months without interruption between the two therapies Both OCT and LAN will be administered&#xD;
      once every 28 days. OCT will be given intramuscularly and LAN deep subcutaneously by the&#xD;
      patients' general practitioner or by a study nurse. At times 0, 4, 6, 10, and 12 months, the&#xD;
      patients will be attended for clinical evaluation, at the department of Endocrinology, Odense&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients previously treated with OCT will receive unchanged doses of OCT during the study&#xD;
      period and OCT dose will use to calculate LAN doses. The administered OCT dose will be&#xD;
      determined as the dose necessary to obtain normal IGF-I levels and/or GH&lt;1mU/l (&lt;0.4 μg/ l)&#xD;
      or alternatively the highest tolerated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LAN doses will be calculated using the OCT doses as follows: 10 mg OCT ≈ 60 mg LAN; 20 mg&#xD;
      OCT ≈ 90 mg LAN; 30 mg OCT ≈ 120 mg LAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation program (at 0, 4, 6, 10, 12 months) Clinical evaluation: weight, blood pressure,&#xD;
      inspection of the injection site and evaluation of possible side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: GH and IGF-I, prolactin, thyroid hormone, oestrogen, testosterone, LH, and FSH,&#xD;
      fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin, liver enzymes levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be supported by Beaufor Ipsen Industry and further technical assistance will&#xD;
      be supplied by Endocrinology Department, Odense University Hospital.&#xD;
