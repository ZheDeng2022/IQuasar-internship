  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of Hylan G-F 20 as a treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee has become popular&#xD;
      in recent years. Typical treatment of OA of the knee includes NSAIDs and physical therapy&#xD;
      protocols to strengthen local muscle groups and decrease pain. When these conservative&#xD;
      treatment modalities have been exhausted, the next step is arthroplasty of the knee. Hylan&#xD;
      G-F 20 treatments provide physicians with an intermediate mode of treatment prior to surgery.&#xD;
      Hylan G-F 20 is a cross-linked, high molecular weight derivative of hyaluronan which can be&#xD;
      found within the synovial capsule of the knee. This form of viscosupplementation is intended&#xD;
      to reduce the pain suffered by those with OA by increasing the fluid levels within the&#xD;
      synovial space, providing a cushion between the bony surfaces within the knee joint. Current&#xD;
      studies have only looked at self-reported pain relief or Outcomes Inventories. This study&#xD;
      aims to determine the ability of Hylan G-F 20 treatment to improve the parameters of gait of&#xD;
      individuals who suffer from OA.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Typically, when an adult suffers from OA of the knee, they are presented with two choices:&#xD;
      conservative treatments consisting of NSAID therapy and physical therapy or surgical&#xD;
      intervention to replace the affected knee joint. There is a third avenue of treatment that&#xD;
      has become available in recent years. This treatment modality is viscosupplementation.&#xD;
      Viscosupplementation consists of replacing hyaluronic acid in the synovial fluid contained in&#xD;
      the knee joint. It has been observed that the synovial fluid of OA sufferers has less&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid (HA), and the HA that remains is of lower molecular size and concentration&#xD;
      Replacement of the HA contained in the synovial fluid through the use of Hylan G-F 20 has&#xD;
      been shown in clinical studies to be clinically safe, and have the ability to provide pain&#xD;
      relief with a minimum of adverse reactions. Clinical studies concerning the use of Hylan G-F&#xD;
      20 have focused on safety and efficacy in regards to pain relief in those who suffer OA. To&#xD;
      date, there have been few studies performed looking at the efficacy of Hylan G-F 20 on the&#xD;
      kinematics and kinetics of gait. This study will provide data on the ability of Hylan G-F 20&#xD;
      treatment to improve the temporal-spatial parameters of gait in those who suffer OA, as well&#xD;
      as the ability of Hylan G-F 20 to reduce joint reaction forces in the affected knee.&#xD;
