  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial tests the hypothesis that a reduction in intake of dietary&#xD;
      fat will reduce the incidence of breast cancer. Women with more than 50% of the breast&#xD;
      occupied by dense tissue on a mammogram have been recruited and allocated by a random (ie&#xD;
      chance) process, to an intervention or control group. The intervention group has been taught&#xD;
      how to reduce their fat intake to a target of 15% of total calories, while the control group&#xD;
      continued their usual consumption of fat. Both groups have then been followed for at least 7&#xD;
      years and the number who develop breast cancer in each group will be compared&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long term goal of this trial is to determine if intervention in subjects with extensive&#xD;
      mammographic densities (a risk factor for breast cancer) with a low fat-high carbohydrate&#xD;
      diet will reduce the incidence of breast cancer by 37%. We propose to meet this goal by&#xD;
      carrying out a randomized multi-centre trial of dietary intervention in subjects at increased&#xD;
      risk of breast cancer that is now in progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method used is to recruit subjects with extensive mammographic densities and enrol them&#xD;
      in a randomized trial in which they receive one of two kinds of dietary counselling. A&#xD;
      control group receives general advice about nutrition but is not counselled to change their&#xD;
      intake of dietary fat or carbohydrate, and an intervention group is given intensive&#xD;
      counselling to reduce their intake of total fat to a target of 15% of calories and increase&#xD;
      intake of carbohydrate to maintain intake of total calories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment to this trial has been in progress in Toronto, Hamilton, London and Windsor since&#xD;
      1991, and in Vancouver since 1994, and all of the 4,615 subjects required for the trial were&#xD;
      recruited by November 1998.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is explanatory in that it seeks to determine if there is a biological effect of&#xD;
      dietary fat reduction in terms of a reduction in breast cancer incidence. To meet this goal&#xD;
      we will select as participants highly motivated subjects who are at increased risk of breast&#xD;
      cancer, provide them with a high level of assistance in making a dietary alteration, follow&#xD;
      them carefully to ensure the correct identification of subjects who develop breast cancer,&#xD;
      and analyse the results both according to intention to treat and dietary compliance. This&#xD;
      trial does not attempt to assess directly the possible effects of dietary counselling on the&#xD;
      health of the general public.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To recruit 4,615 Canadian women with extensive mammographic density and to enrol them in&#xD;
           a randomized trial of dietary fat reduction and follow up until 2006.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare in the control and intervention groups of this trial the incidence of breast&#xD;
           cancers, as well as other histological changes in the breast tissue of patients&#xD;
           undergoing surgical biopsy of the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if a reduction in dietary fat intake will reduce either the proportion of&#xD;
           the breast area occupied by radiological signs of density or the total quantity of&#xD;
           density.&#xD;
