  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation (BMT), resulting in death in the majority of steroid resistant patients. The&#xD;
      study was designed to assess the efficacy of regional intra-arterial treatment in patients&#xD;
      with resistant hepatic and/or gastro-intestinal GVHD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is the most ominous side effect of allogeneic bone marrow or&#xD;
      blood stem cell transplantation (BMT). GVHD causes a severe inflammatory process, which&#xD;
      affects primarily the skin and the GI) system, including the liver. Pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      of GVHD includes various immunosuppressive and immune-modulating drugs, including steroids,&#xD;
      cyclosporin, tacrolimus, methotrexate and anti-lymphocyte agents. These agents can aggravate&#xD;
      immunologic incompetence, exposing the patient to infections and secondary malignancy, as&#xD;
      well as reducing the efficacy of graft versus leukemia / graft versus tumor (GVL / GVT)&#xD;
      effects induced by alloreactive donor lymphocytes. In spite of this effect on the immune&#xD;
      system, only 50-70% of the patients achieve partial control of GVHD, which can rapidly&#xD;
      deteriorate and result in death. Despite the use of innovative immunosuppressive modalities,&#xD;
      the prognosis of steroid resistant GVHD is usually poor. GVHD can be mostly localized to a&#xD;
      specific organ (skin, liver, GI) with liver involvement tending to be more chronic and&#xD;
      resistant. The bile ducts are the main target for GVHD, with their blood supply originating&#xD;
      from the hepatic artery. This may explain the ineffective nature of oral steroids absorbed&#xD;
      through the gut into the portal vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sato et al reported that an infusion of steroids to the superior and inferior mesenteric&#xD;
      arteries induced remission in a patient with refractory GI GVHD. This method has never been&#xD;
      tested in patients with fulminant liver GVHD. We decided to test this approach in a larger&#xD;
      cohort of patients with steroid resistant hepatic and intestinal GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were eligible for inclusion if they developed grade 3-4 hepatic and/or GI GVHD&#xD;
      unresponsive to treatment with IV cyclosporin 3 mg/kg and IV methylprednisolone (MP) 2 mg/kg.&#xD;
      GVHD diagnosis was based upon clinical criteria and in some of the patients supported by&#xD;
      biopsy. GVHD grading was graded according to the Seattle severity index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with hepatic GVHD were first treated with slow intra-arterial (hepatic artery)&#xD;
      infusion of methotrexate (Pharmachemie, Netherland) (10mg/m2) and MP (Pharmacia and Upjohn,&#xD;
      Belgium) (75mg/m2). The protocol was later on changed with the exclusion of methotrexate and&#xD;
      increase of MP dose to 1000mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with GI GVHD were treated with intra-arterial (SMA, IMA) infusion of MP (40-60&#xD;
      mg/vessel). In cases of upper GI GVHD intra-arterial infusion of MP was given to the&#xD;
      gastro-duodenal artery (GDA). Later on, injections to the internal iliacs were added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique Angiography was performed using standard sterile technique, local anesthesia with&#xD;
      lidocaine 1% and conscious intravenous sedation. Visceral arteriography was performed in&#xD;
      order to determine anatomy and identify variant arterial blood supply to the gut. A selection&#xD;
      of 3 - 5 Fr. angiographic catheters was used at the discretion of the angiographer performing&#xD;
      the procedure. The most frequently used catheters were 4 Fr. &amp; 5 Fr. Cobra 2 and Rim&#xD;
      catheters (Cook Inc., Bloomington, In.). Other catheters used included the Sos 2&#xD;
      (Angiodynamics Inc., Queensbury, NY.) and the 3Fr. Terumo SP co-axial catheter (Terumo&#xD;
      Europe, N.V., Leuven, Belgium.). Once the catheter was in position, each drug was injected&#xD;
      into the artery over approximately three minutes. After completion of the procedure, the&#xD;
      catheter was removed and direct manual pressure over the arteriotomy maintained until&#xD;
      hemostasis was achieved. Patients remained on complete bed rest with the involved extremity&#xD;
      extended for 6 hours, in accordance with standard angiographic practice. Compression devices&#xD;
      were not used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions Hepatic response: initial response - the day in which bilirubin level began to&#xD;
      decrease, partial response - the day in which bilirubin level decreased below 70% of basal&#xD;
      level, complete response - the day in which bilirubin level decreased below 30% of basal&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GI response: initial response - the day in which symptom amelioration appeared (diarrhea&#xD;
      volume and abdominal pain). Complete response - the day in which symptoms resolved.&#xD;
