  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is a three-armed study designed to evaluate the efficacy of amodiaquine(AQ),&#xD;
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine(SP) and(AQ+SP) in three sites in Cameroon that differ in their&#xD;
      baseline characteristics for malaria. In addition, drug resistance will be determined by&#xD;
      measurement of blood drug levels,and identification of molecular markers of resistance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The objectives of this study are:- .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of amodiaquine(AQ), Fansidar(SP) and the&#xD;
           combination amodiaquine/Fansidar in three sites in Cameroon namely, Garoua&#xD;
           (Sahel-savanna), Yaounde (Forest-savannah mosaic) and Limbe (Littoral-forest)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the prevalence of molecular markers associated with resistance to&#xD;
           chloroquine,AQ,and SP in Limbe and Garoua and of mefloquine in Yaounde.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate biological factors that may enhance anti-malaria therapeutic efficacy.&#xD;
           This will involve an exploratory, pilot study conducted during the second year of the&#xD;
           program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be rapidly screened for temperature and sent to the laboratory to determine the&#xD;
      presence or absence of malaria parasites. The patients will then be examined clinically for&#xD;
      inclusion or exclusion. Consent will be sort from the parents and the children randomised and&#xD;
      assigned study numbers. To avoid bias in assigning the patients to groups and to ensure equal&#xD;
      numbers in the treatment groups, blocked randomization will be performed, using a table of&#xD;
      random variables of varying block sizes. The physician is blinded to what treatment the&#xD;
      patient gets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amodiaquine will be administered at 10mg/kg on each of the three days to children in the AQ&#xD;
      treatment group, together with Fansidar dummy tablets. Fansidar will be given at 25 mg/kg on&#xD;
      day 0 and quinine as rescue drug at 10mg/kg per 8H for 6 days. For the AQ/SP combination, on&#xD;
      D0, patients will be given both 25 mg/kg SP and 10mg/kg AQ. On subsequent days the AQ or its&#xD;
      dummy tablets(SP arm) will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment during the study will include: physical examination and monitoring of&#xD;
      vital signs on D0, D3, D7, D14 and D28. Hematological measurements will include: blood films,&#xD;
      haemoglobin,glucose,blood drug levels,and baseline haematology. A maximum of 3ml of blood&#xD;
      will be withdrawn from the patients in Yaoundé for complete analyses(see below). For patients&#xD;
      recruited at Limbe and Garoua only finger prick blood filter paper samples will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0 blood samples (3mL) will be collected aseptically by venepuncture before therapy from&#xD;
      each of 50 patients in Yaoundé using acid-citrate-dextrose buffer (ACD) as anticoagulant.&#xD;
      This will be processed to provide plasma for immunological determinations and for haematology&#xD;
      and blood drug level determinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The molecular characterization of diversity and mutations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the genetic heterogeneity of the study population will be established using primers for&#xD;
           msp1 and msp2 shown previously to distinguish between strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PCR products will be digested with restriction enzyme (RFLP-PCR) for pyrimethamine&#xD;
           resistance genes dhfr and dhps, and for chloroquine resistant strains of the pfcrtgene.&#xD;
