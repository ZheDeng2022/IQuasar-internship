  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hirsutism is the presence of terminal hairs in a male-like pattern in females, due to&#xD;
      elevated male hormone levels. Females with hirsutism are often overweight and have metabolism&#xD;
      disturbances as insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The previous studies showed that patients with hirsutism (especially them with polycystic&#xD;
      ovarian syndrome (PCOS)) have an increased risk to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus on the&#xD;
      background of insulin resistance / hyperinsulinemia: 30-35 % of females with PCOS had&#xD;
      impaired glucose tolerance and 5-10 % of them diabetes. Hyperinsulinemia increases the risk&#xD;
      to develop dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous study in our department who included 340 females with hirsutism (210 with&#xD;
      idiopathic hirsutism and 134 with PCOS) showed that 6.6% of them had diabetes and 55% insulin&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were only few long-term follow up studies of patients with hirsutism concerning their&#xD;
      risk to develop diabetes. As far as we now, such studies on patients with idiopathic&#xD;
      hirsutism are not available until now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hirsutism is been treated with low dose oral contraceptives, which are suppressing androgen&#xD;
      production. This treatment can also influence the risk to develop diabetes and atheromatosis.&#xD;
      The previous studies showed that the low dose oral contraceptives had modest influence on the&#xD;
      lipid profiles and carbohydrate metabolism in patients with hirsutism, but increased the risk&#xD;
      to develop coronary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study and quantify, in patients with hirsutime, the risk to develop type 2 diabetes&#xD;
           on the background of insulin resistance / decreased glucose tolerance and atheromatosis&#xD;
           on the background of insulin resistance / hypercholesterolemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To clarify the effect of P-pills on patients hair growth and metabolism.&#xD;

      impaired glucose tolerance and 5-10 % of them diabetes (1, 2, 3, 4). Hyperinsulinemia&#xD;
      increases the risk to develop dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases (5, 6, 7, 8, 9).&#xD;

      A previous study in our department who included 340 females with hirsutism (210 with&#xD;
      idiopathic hirsutism and 134 with PCOS) showed that 6.6% of them had diabetes and 55% insulin&#xD;

           on the background of insulin resistance / hypercholesterolemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To clarify the effect of P-pills on patients hair growth and metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The patients who had previously included in the study between1997 - 2000 (231) will be&#xD;
      contacted in order to be followed. We will estimate the grad of excess hair growth, the&#xD;
      hormonal and metabolism profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria The patients which had been included in the previous study between 1997 -&#xD;
      2000, oral glucose tolerance test included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anamnesis: previous treatment, pregnancy / in-utero fertilisation history, family&#xD;
      predisposition to diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination: Ferriman-Gallwey score, body mass index (BMI), waist / hip ratio (WHR),&#xD;
      blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolism profile (oral glucose tolerance test, lipid profile);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hormonal profile (androgen and oestrogen levels, prolactin, FH, FSH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ethic aspects&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to evaluate the effect of the treatment and how the risk factors are influenced by&#xD;
      the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will receive both oral and written information about the study. It will be&#xD;
      emphasised at participation is voluntary and the informed consent can be retracted at any&#xD;
      time and this will not influence the treatment of them.The trial is validated by the local&#xD;
      ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be carried on The Endocrinology Department, Odense University Hospital,&#xD;
      Denmark, which will supply technical assistance. Blood analyses will be founded by private&#xD;
      founds.&#xD;
