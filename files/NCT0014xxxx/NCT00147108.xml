  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pivotal study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FUS&#xD;
      treatment of breast fibroadenomas. Our hypothesis is that FUS lesion ablation of a&#xD;
      fibroadenoma will have the following results: a. lead to a decrease in lesion cross-sectional&#xD;
      area of &gt; 50% on palpation, and &gt;65% in lesion volume as measured by MRI (both calculations&#xD;
      assume an elliptical shape of the lesion in all 3 dimensions). b. this decrease in size,&#xD;
      along with the softening of the treated volume will result in satisfactory clinical results&#xD;
      in greater than 50 % of the patients.&#xD;

      Many patients are now diagnosed with breast fibroadenomas. These are generally detected&#xD;
      during breast self-exams, or annual physicals as a smooth, rubbery, oval/elliptical lump in&#xD;
      the breast. These patients then go on to receive mammograms, sonograms and usually a core&#xD;
      biopsy for the differential diagnosis of benign disease (fibroadenoma) vs breast cancer.&#xD;
      Although fibroadenomas are benign, they can be of great concern to the patient because of&#xD;
      their ability to mask the presence of other lumps in the breast, they can be painful, cause a&#xD;
      physical deformity of the breast or have other symptoms. The current treatment is surgical&#xD;
      excision. Surgical removal is invasive and may be cosmetically undesirable to some patients.&#xD;
      It would be advantageous to develop a non-invasive ablative method for treatment of this&#xD;
      disease. Measures of the clinical success of patients who elect surgical removal of&#xD;
      fibroadenomas are generally subjective, and evaluated primarily by the patient (lack of&#xD;
      palpable lesion, pain free, and an acceptable cosmetic result). A non-randomized study is&#xD;
      proposed to allow for a more practical approach in subject recruitment. Analysis on safety&#xD;
      and efficacy will be performed through the use of MRI evaluation and physical exams.&#xD;
