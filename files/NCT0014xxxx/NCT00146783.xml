    <textblock>
      In areas of stable transmission, pregnant women, especially during the first and second&#xD;
      pregnancies, have an increased susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum malaria,&#xD;
      malaria-related anaemia and an increased risk of having low birthweight babies. Intermittent&#xD;
      Preventive Treatment in pregnancy(IPTp) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in reducing the effects of malaria in pregnancy. This has mainly been in areas of&#xD;
      perennial transmission and there is a need to study this effect in intense seasonal&#xD;
      transmission settings. The emergence and spread of resistance to SP is likely to undermine&#xD;
      its useful lifespan and it is important that other antimalarials that are safe and effective&#xD;
      are identified for use in IPTp. The options are however limited. Amodiaquine has been shown&#xD;
      to be effective in treatment of clinical cases of malaria, even in areas where chloroquine&#xD;
      resistance is prevalent, and its combination with SP has been associated with favourable&#xD;
      results. Both are affordable. However, there is limited data on their use in pregnancy. This&#xD;
      study aims to assess the efficacy of SP in an area of intense seasonal transmission, and&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of amodiaquine and a combination of&#xD;
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine as possible alternatives to SP for use as IPTp.&#xD;

      Background Pregnant women, particularly during the first and second pregnancy, have a high&#xD;
      risk of Plasmodium falciparum infection and these infections are often asymptomatic but lead&#xD;
      to maternal anaemia and low birth-weight. One approach to preventing malaria in pregnancy is&#xD;
      prompt effective management of clinical malaria. In areas of moderate and high transmission&#xD;
      however, peripheral parasitaemia is not a sensitive indicator as many women with placental&#xD;
      parasitaemia may not have peripheral parasitaemia. Another option is to administer full&#xD;
      curative doses of an effective antimalarial drug at predefined intervals during pregnancy&#xD;
      (IPTp) without screening for parasitaemia. The efficacy of IPTp has been studied mostly in&#xD;
      areas of high perennial transmission in Kenya and Malawi. IPTp has however been little&#xD;
      investigated in West Africa where transmission is often intense and highly seasonal. It may&#xD;
      not be appropriate to translate results between areas with different ranges of transmission&#xD;
      intensities across the sub-Saharan African region and there is a need to study the effect of&#xD;
      IPTp in highly seasonal intense transmission areas in West Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPTp with SP has been shown to be effective in reducing maternal anaemia, prevalence of&#xD;
      placental parasitaemia and the incidence of low birth weight. SP offers a reasonable&#xD;
      combination of ease of use and associated increased compliance, low cost, and relatively good&#xD;
      tolerance and safety. However, the useful therapeutic life (UTL) predicted for SP is likely&#xD;
      to be short, in part due to its prolonged half-life, causing a higher probability of&#xD;
      selecting resistant strains and consequent rapid development of resistance. The emergence and&#xD;
      spread of SP resistance will increasingly undermine this strategy, depleting the currently&#xD;
      available and affordable drugs usable for intervention during pregnancy. It is therefore&#xD;
      important that alternative antimalarials that are safe and effective in pregnancy are&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific primary objective To assess and compare the efficacy of a combination of&#xD;
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine or amodiaquine used as&#xD;
      IPTp, in reducing the incidence of anaemia(Hb&lt;11g/dl) at weeks 34-36 among primigravidae and&#xD;
      secundigravidae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of SP/AQ, SP or AQ on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The mean birthweight of infants among primigravidae and secundigravidae&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The incidence of clinical malaria during pregnancy among primigravidae and&#xD;
           secundigravidae&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The prevalence of anaemia (Hb &lt;11g/dl) at delivery among primigravidae and&#xD;
           secundigravidae&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The prevalence of placental parasitaemia among women in their first or second&#xD;
           pregnancies delivering at health facilities or by trained TBAs&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The prevalence of peripheral parasitaemia at weeks 34-36 among primigravidae and&#xD;
           secundigravidae&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The prevalence of maternal peripheral parasitaemia at delivery among primigravidae and&#xD;
           secundigravidae&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To determine the safety and tolerability of AQ, SP used alone and in combination, among&#xD;
           pregnant women of all parities&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To determine the prevalence of molecular markers of resistance to AQ and SP among&#xD;
           pregnant women who have malaria parasitaemia at enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To document the factors that influence women's attitude towards ANC attendance, use of&#xD;
           chemoprophylaxis and ITNs, and to determine what informs their choice to deliver at a&#xD;
           particular facility&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SITE The study will be carried out in the Kassena-Nankana district of northern Ghana.&#xD;
      The residents are mainly subsistence farmers. There are two main seasons, a short wet season&#xD;
      from June to September, during which the transmission of Plasmodium species peaks and a long&#xD;
      dry season. The primary resource of the Navrongo Health Research Centre is a district-wide&#xD;
      surveillance system, the Navrongo Demographic Surveillance System (NDSS), a longitudinal&#xD;
      population registration system that is updated every 90 days. The district has 4 health&#xD;
      centres, 3 clinics and a 140-bed hospital that serves as a referral centre. Information&#xD;
      collated for the year 2002 in the Kassena-Nankana district indicated that out of an expected&#xD;
      6050 pregnancies, 95% registered for ANC, the average number of visits being 2.7. There were&#xD;
      2173(36%) supervised deliveries, 1279 of these at health facilities and 894 by trained TBAs.&#xD;
      794 out of 2405(33%) pregnant women had haemoglobin levels less than 10g/dl at registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION Pregnant women between 16 -32 weeks gestation attending antenatal care&#xD;
      clinics at the district hospital or any of the four main health centres in the district will&#xD;
      be eligible to join the study. The main endpoints will be assessed in primigravidae and&#xD;
      secundigravidae however safety data will be collected for all women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN The study will be carried out in two phases, a pre-intervention phase which will&#xD;
      document women's knowledge, attitudes and practices on antenatal care, chemoprophylaxis and&#xD;
      use of insecticide treated bednets and factors that influence their choice of where to&#xD;
      deliver. The second phase, which is the intervention, will be a three-arm randomized blinded&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention study - Enrolment procedure The study will be explained to women as a group&#xD;
      before each day's ANC activities begin. In order not to interfere with the routine ANC&#xD;
      activities women who may want to be recruited will then proceed to the study team after their&#xD;
      routine ANC care. After obtaining informed consent, socio-demographic information, an&#xD;
      obstetric history including previous ANC attendances during current pregnancy, a history of&#xD;
      any illness in the past week, and information on bed net use will be collected. Gestational&#xD;
      age will be obtained from the ANC card as assessed by the midwife. Anthropometric indices&#xD;
      measured will be weight, height and mid-upperarm circumference. The blood pressure and&#xD;
      axillary temperature will also be measured. Fingerstick blood sample will be drawn for&#xD;
      haemoglobin testing, malaria thick blood smear and filter paper samples, after which each&#xD;
      woman will be assessed for eligibility. Subjects will be randomized individually to receive&#xD;
      the study drugs. The code on the envelope will be written on all the study forms and samples.&#xD;
      The subject's name, address and date of first dosing will be noted on the envelope, to ensure&#xD;
      that each woman receives the right regimen over the three-day period and also during&#xD;
      subsequent doses of IPTp. To ensure compliance, all doses will be supervised either at the&#xD;
      health facility, or through home visits (on Days 1 and 2). Women will receive between one and&#xD;
      three doses of the drugs, depending on gestational age at recruitment, thus women recruited&#xD;
      at 16 - 19 weeks will receive three doses, those recruited at 20 -26 weeks, two doses and&#xD;
      those recruited from 27 -32weeks, one dose. The interval between dosing schedules will be 8&#xD;
      weeks, however the minimum interval allowed will be 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women will be encouraged to deliver at a health facility or by a trained traditional&#xD;
      birth attendant, and they will be given an identification card to take to the health facility&#xD;
      so that the necessary samples can be taken and labelled adequately during delivery. These&#xD;
      identification cards will also bear a note that the woman may have received AQ, SP or a&#xD;
      combination as IPTp and should therefore not be given those drugs for clinical malaria, to&#xD;
      avoid women being given repetitive doses within short intervals of time. Such women will be&#xD;
      given Quinine 10mg/kg 8 hourly for 7days as recommended by the national treatment guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of drug tolerance and adverse drug reactions All women will be visited at home&#xD;
      between Days 7 and 10 to look for any adverse events due to the study drugs. They will be&#xD;
      advised to report to a health facility if they should experience any untoward effect of the&#xD;
      drugs prior to, or after this home visit. The frequency and severity of spontaneous and&#xD;
      elicited adverse events will be recorded. In the light of the information obtained, the&#xD;
      association between the event and any of the study drugs will be judged as per the WHO&#xD;
      guidelines52. All serious and adverse events will be reported to the DSMB immediately, and&#xD;
      followed up with a written report which will fully document the event, and any available&#xD;
      laboratory information or clinical data, will be included in the report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up At subsequent visits for IPTp and at weeks 34 -36, a simple questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered to assess the presence of malaria symptoms, potential side effects of the study&#xD;
      drugs since the last assessment, and bednet use. To ensure that women complete subsequent&#xD;
      doses of IPTp, lists of women due for second or third doses will be computer-generated, and&#xD;
      they will be reminded at least a week before the next dose is due to attend the ANC. At 34&#xD;
      -36 weeks blood samples will be taken to assess for haemoglobin levels (Hb) and peripheral&#xD;
      parasitaemia. Women with severe anaemia (Hb levels &lt;7g/dl) will be referred to the hospital&#xD;
      for further investigations and management. Women who do not turn up at the ANC will be&#xD;
      followed up at home to collect the blood sample. Blood slides from symptomatic women will be&#xD;
      read immediately and women found to have parasitaemia will be given Quinine 10mg/kg 8 hourly&#xD;
      for 7 days as per national treatment guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery Women delivering at the hospital will have bloodsmears made from a fingerprick, and&#xD;
      maternal side of the placenta, and have Hb level assessed. Women delivering at the health&#xD;
      centre will have placental blood smears, and a peripheral blood smear taken. Those delivered&#xD;
      by TBAs will have the placental smear taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for haemoglobin estimation for women delivering at the health centre or by TBAs&#xD;
      will be taken at home within 7 days of delivery. Assessment of Hb will be carried out on&#xD;
      women who delivered spontaneously without any complications such as post-partum haemorrhage&#xD;
      at the hospital on day of delivery to 7days post delivery, to construct a nomogram which&#xD;
      would be used to estimate the haemoglobin levels at delivery for women who delivered at the&#xD;
      health centre or by TBA who could not have an Hb done on day of delivery for logistic&#xD;
      reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All infants delivered at the hospital or health centre will be weighed and gestational age&#xD;
      assessed by a modification of Dubowitz's examination within 24 hours of delivery53. To ensure&#xD;
      that birthweights of infants delivered at home are taken within seven days of delivery, a&#xD;
      list of women with gestation of 34 weeks or more will be generated according to area of&#xD;
      residence. This would be given to Community Key Informants (CKI) who would be contacted&#xD;
      weekly by field staff for information on those who were delivered by TBAs or at home. A&#xD;
      follow-up will then be made to take the weight of the babies. Mothers will be encouraged to&#xD;
      inform CKIs soon after delivery. The TBAs will be asked to inform CKIs whenever they&#xD;
      delivered a study subject, so that the samples can be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants for whom the Dubowitz score is obtained will be classified as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premature -LBW : gestational age is &lt;37weeks and birthweight is &lt;2500g IUGR-LBW: gestational&#xD;
      age is ≥ 37weeks and birthweight is &lt;2500g Normal birthweight : birthweight is ≥ 2500g&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal from study A withdrawal shall be any enrolled subject who does not complete the&#xD;
      study as planned. This may be due to (a) withdrawal of consent, (b) reaction attributable to&#xD;
      any of the study drugs or (c) termination of pregnancy (abortions or miscarriages). A&#xD;
      withdrawal form shall be filled for such persons, indicating reasons for withdrawal, and they&#xD;
      will be followed up for outcome measures, unless they decline to give consent.&#xD;
