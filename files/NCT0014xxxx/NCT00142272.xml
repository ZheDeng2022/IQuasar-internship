  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of a single dose of&#xD;
      ciprofloxacin oral suspension 20 mg/kg with a 3-day course of erythromycin oral suspension&#xD;
      administered in a dose of 12.5 mg/kg every 6 hours (12 doses) in the treatment of children,&#xD;
      aged 2-15 years with clinically severe cholera due to V. cholerae O1 or O139.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that single dose ciprofloxacin would result in similar outcome in the&#xD;
      clinicalcurewith that of erythromycin given in multiple doses.&#xD;

      Eligible patients will be admitted to the Clinical Study Ward of the Dhaka and Matlab&#xD;
      Hospitals of ICDDR,B. Upon admission, their weight (dehydrated weight) and vital signs will&#xD;
      be recorded, and a thorough physical examination, including assessment of dehydration&#xD;
      (following WHO guidelines), will be made. Patients will then be rehydrated using intravenous&#xD;
      Dhaka Solution (133, 13, 98 and 48 mmol/l of sodium, potassium, chloride and bicarbonate,&#xD;
      respectively) over 3-4 hours. Thereafter, they will be observed over a 4-hour Observation&#xD;
      Period when their hydration will be maintained using the rice-based oral rehydration solution&#xD;
      (ORS) (containing 3.5, 2.5, 1.5 and 50 gram/l of sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate,&#xD;
      potassium chloride and rice powder). Dhaka Solution, as used for initial rehydration, will be&#xD;
      used for patients whose hydration cannot be maintained by rice-based ORS.Patients who have a&#xD;
      stool output of 20 ml/kg or more during the Observation Period, and who have V. cholerae&#xD;
      demonstrated in dark-field microscopic examination of their freshly passed stool sample, will&#xD;
      be enrolled upon obtaining written informed consent of their parents or guardians. If&#xD;
      possible, assent must be obtained from the child. Patients will then be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive one of the two treatment regimens. Children will be hospitalised for 5 days, from the&#xD;
      initiation of study drug or until resolution of their diarrhoea, whichever will be longer,&#xD;
      and they will be asked to return for a follow-up evaluation 10 to 14 days after study entry.&#xD;
      Patients are to return for a further follow-up visit at 4 to 6 weeks (Day 28 to Day&#xD;
      42).Patients who develop joint changes during therapy, or during the follow-up period, must&#xD;
      be followed up. Any new objective finding noted on clinical joint or gait assessment will be&#xD;
      thoroughly evaluated by the investigator. This evaluation may include diagnostic procedures,&#xD;
      such as MRI and/or joint fluid assessments, as appropriate. Patients with joint changes&#xD;
      during therapy, or during the follow-up period, should be followed up until:a) The adverse&#xD;
      event has been resolved orb) Until further change in the patient's condition is unlikely and&#xD;
      a final causality assessment has been made. This may be shorter or longer than 3 months from&#xD;
      the time of discharge.Medical history will be obtained and a thorough physical examination&#xD;
      will be performed daily. Vital signs and intake/output records will be maintained as from the&#xD;
      initiation of rehydration.Patients will be closely monitored through bacteriological and&#xD;
      laboratory assessments. Blood, urine and stool specimens will be taken at various time&#xD;
      points. Stool culture for enteric pathogens will be done before initiation of the study drug,&#xD;
      on study Day 3 and at follow-up visits. Rectal swab culture for V. cholerae will be done on&#xD;
      each day of the study during the hospitalisation period, and at follow-up (10 to 14 days and&#xD;
      4 to 6 weeks). Complete blood count, serum electrolytes and creatinine, total bilirubin, SGPT&#xD;
      and alkaline phosphatase will be determined before initiation of study drug and on study Day&#xD;
      5. (If the baseline creatinine is &gt; 200 mcmol/L, creatinine will also be determined 24 hours&#xD;
      post-administration of first dose of study medication, and any patient with a creatinine &gt;&#xD;
      than 200 mcmol/L will be considered as suffering from renal failure and will be withdrawn&#xD;
      from the trial.) If possible, urinalysis will be done before initiation of drug therapy and&#xD;
      on Day 5 of the study. Serum concentration of ciprofloxacin will be determined on the first&#xD;
      day of the study at various time intervals after the first dose of the study drug.&#xD;
