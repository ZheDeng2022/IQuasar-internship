  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While patient held guidelines for the management of chronic diseases have been employed in&#xD;
      some countries. There is little evidence of their effectiveness in improving patient&#xD;
      outcomes. We hypothesised that a patient held guideline on the management of hypertension&#xD;
      combined with a specific exhortation to patients to challenge their medical care where the&#xD;
      guidelines did not appear to have been applied would improve blood pressure control, lower&#xD;
      average blood pressure, lower average cholesterol, increase the appropriate use of statins&#xD;
      and aspirin, and have no impact on patient anxiety. Patients were randomised to the guideline&#xD;
      or to standard hypertension information. Measures of anxiety were taken at baseline 2 weeks&#xD;
      and one year, blood pressure and cholesterol was measured at one year and case notes examined&#xD;
      to determine appropriate statin and aspirin usage.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prevention and treatment of hypertension and target organ disease remain important public&#xD;
      health challenges which must be addressed (SIGN 2001). There is sound evidence that control&#xD;
      of hypertension can significantly reduce the incidence of stroke and cardiac events (Mulrow&#xD;
      and Pignone 2001). National guidelines for the identification and treatment of hypertension&#xD;
      have been issued (Ramsey et al 1999, SIGN 2001) and a local version of the national&#xD;
      guidelines has been issued to all GPs in Lothian. However, although there is evidence that&#xD;
      most patients with hypertension are identified, many do not have their hypertension&#xD;
      adequately controlled (Colhoun et al 1998), and GPs are reluctant to treat mild hypertension&#xD;
      or hypertension in the elderly (Dickerson et al 1995a,b, Frijlen et al 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without additional interventions to encourage change in medical practice, the effects of&#xD;
      clinical guidelines are generally limited (Effective Health Care 1994, Oxman et al 1995). A&#xD;
      large number of additional interventions have been used to encourage the adoption of clinical&#xD;
      guidelines including continuing medical education, dissemination of educational materials,&#xD;
      educational outreach, local opinion leaders, audit and feedback, manual or computerised&#xD;
      reminders, mass media campaigns, continuous quality improvement programmes (Effective Health&#xD;
      Care 1999). All have some effect, but none are overwhelmingly successful or effective in all&#xD;
      circumstances (Effective Health Care 1999, Davies et al 1995, Grimshaw et al 1995) It is&#xD;
      suggested that multiple interventions may be more effective than single ones (Wensing and&#xD;
      Grol 1994, Greco and Eisenberg 1993).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing evidence that in Primary Care patients' expectations have a significant&#xD;
      effect on the treatment they get from their GP (Tomlin et al 1999, Howitt and Armstrong&#xD;
      1999). Mass media campaigns targeting patients have been found to influence professional&#xD;
      practice (Grilli et al 2000). However, evaluation of the effect of locally provided patient&#xD;
      information has been limited to the effect that it has on patient behaviour (e.g. compliance&#xD;
      with dietary advice or medication) and not on the effect in may have on medical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One initiative, which has not been fully evaluated, is distribution of the guidelines to&#xD;
      patients. The large AHCPR guideline programme in the United States included the full&#xD;
      guideline, a summary for professionals and a summary for patients (Colling 1994). Evaluation&#xD;
      appeared to be limited to the distribution of these guidelines and the impact on practice was&#xD;
      not measured (Colling 1994). When the Scottish (SIGN) clinical guideline programme was&#xD;
      initiated much of the AHCPR methodology was adopted and acknowledged, but the patient&#xD;
      guideline was not included. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of providing&#xD;
      patients with a clinical guideline (edited to be understandable to a lay person) on the&#xD;
      overall management and control of their hypertension coupled with an explicit exhortation&#xD;
      from the medical team to become involved in their own care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Trial objectives and purpose: The trial aims to determine if the provision of a patient&#xD;
      guideline on the management of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improves control of hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improves compliance by doctors with established guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increases patient anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three research questions have been set up in an attempt to meet these aims. Does provision of&#xD;
      a patient guideline on the management of hypertension along with explicit exhortation to&#xD;
      patients to challenge care that does not meet the guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improve control of hypertension, as evidence by average blood pressure achieved and&#xD;
           numbers of patients who achieve control (i.e. BP &lt; 150/90)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improve compliance by doctors with established guidelines as evidenced by recorded&#xD;
           calculation of 10 year cardiovascular risk, appropriate use of aspirin and cholesterol&#xD;
           lowering agents, checking of cholesterol and level of blood cholesterol achieved,&#xD;
           appropriate checking of urea and electrolytes and frequency of blood pressure&#xD;
           monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increase patient anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) A randomised trial has been set up to assess these research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Selection and withdrawal of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) All hypertensive patients from the Ashgrove Health Centre Blood Pressure Clinic (435) for&#xD;
      whom recent baseline information on their blood pressure and control is available (these data&#xD;
      were recently collected for an extensive audit) will be selected for invitation to take part&#xD;
      in the study. All will be sent an invitation/ information letter to their home address asking&#xD;
      them to consent to the study Those participants who consent to the study will also be asked&#xD;
      to complete a questionnaire to measure anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: HADS)&#xD;
      and return it to the surgery using an SAE. Those who fail to return a response will be sent a&#xD;
      reminder in two weeks. Information booklets will be sent to all participants who have&#xD;
      consented (whether their anxiety questionnaire has been returned or not).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Treatment of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) All hypertensive patients( at least one systolic BP &gt; 150) in Ashgrove Health Centre for&#xD;
      whom recent baseline information is available will be invited to take part in this study. As&#xD;
      there are many households (approx. 30) with more than one hypertensive patient, randomisation&#xD;
      will take place at household, rather than individual level, so that people living at the same&#xD;
      address will receive the same treatment. Participants will be randomised into two groups&#xD;
      (using a random number generator). One group will receive a detailed guideline and record&#xD;
      card derived from the Lothian Hypertension Guideline which gives general information about&#xD;
      blood pressure, but also provides the patient with clear guidelines as to how their blood&#xD;
      pressure should be managed by medical and nursing staff and a clear exhortation to question&#xD;
      their care if the guideline is not being adhered to (see attached draft). They will also be&#xD;
      given a standard, high quality patient information booklet produced by the British&#xD;
      Hypertension Society. The second group will be given the British Hypertension Society booklet&#xD;
      only . This group will not be specifically exhorted to challenge their care in the same way&#xD;
      as the other group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors in the study will not be told to treat the groups differently. We anticipate a&#xD;
      Hawthorn effect in that doctors will inevitably be sensitised to comply with guidelines more&#xD;
      rigorously for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be sent a letter explaining the study, a consent form and a Hospital&#xD;
      Anxiety and Depression Score questionnaire. Those wishing to take part in the study will be&#xD;
      asked to return the consent form and questionnaire in the accompanying stamped addressed&#xD;
      envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be sent the booklet and in the intervention groups case the booklet and&#xD;
      guideline. A further HADS score will be sent two weeks after the guideline to identify any&#xD;
      immediate anxiety caused by the guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be called in at the end of a year for BP measurement. Case notes will be&#xD;
      searched for records of BP monitoring, cardiovascular risk recording, cholesterol estimation,&#xD;
      appropriate use of cholesterol lowering agents, appropriate use of aspirin, actual blood&#xD;
      cholesterol level, appropriate checking of Urea and Electrolytes. Patients will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a further HADS and a questionnaire which ask them how they found the intervention&#xD;
      and their perception of their involvement in the management of their blood pressure. Doctors&#xD;
      and nurses in the practice will be interviewed about their experience in relation to the&#xD;
      project in terms of perceived increased workload and their experience (if so perceived) of&#xD;
      managing consultations with empowered patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) This project is a pilot and will help in calculating the power of future studies. However,&#xD;
      we have calculated that this study has 80% power to detect as significant at the 5% level&#xD;
      differences in mean blood pressure of the order of 2-3 mm Hg, or of 10-15% in the percentage&#xD;
      of patients achieving BP targets. Statistical analyses will be carried out by Dr. Rob Elton,&#xD;
      statistical consultant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Data handling and record keeping:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patient records will be pulled and perused only by the research nurse who is a&#xD;
           member of staff at Ashgrove Health Centre. While research data are being collected, they&#xD;
           will be kept completely confidential and stored on a password protected computer at&#xD;
           Ashgrove Health Centre. Once all data are collected, they will be anonymised. No&#xD;
           patients will be identifiable from any of the results, published or otherwise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Audio taping of focus groups with staff on completion of the study will take place. The&#xD;
           tapes will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in the Department of General Practice at&#xD;
           the University of Edinburgh. On completion of tape transcription, the tapes will be&#xD;
           destroyed. All transcripts of tapes will be anonymised so that staff participants will&#xD;
           not be identifiable.&#xD;
