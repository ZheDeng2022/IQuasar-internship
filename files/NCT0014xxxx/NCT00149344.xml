      Main research question: Is vertical scar reduction mammoplasty superior when compared to&#xD;
      inferior pedicle reduction mammoplasty in terms of patient quality of life and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why is this research important?: There is on-going controversy among plastic surgeons as to&#xD;
      the superiority of one technique (vertical scar mammoplasty versus inferior pedicle reduction&#xD;
      mammoplasty) over the other in terms of patient health related quality of life and health&#xD;
      care resource utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is being studied?: We are studying (comparing) two surgical procedures for breast&#xD;
      reduction mammoplasty (vertical scar mammoplasty versus inferior pedicle reduction&#xD;
      mammoplasty).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast reduction is one of the most common procedures performed by plastic surgeons. Because&#xD;
      it is common and in most jurisdictions requires at least one day of hospital stay, it&#xD;
      consumes considerable health care resources. Although multiple techniques have been reported,&#xD;
      the two top competing techniques used in North America are the inferior pedicle technique and&#xD;
      the vertical scar technique. There is on-going controversy as to the superiority of one&#xD;
      technique over the other in terms of patient satisfaction and health care resource&#xD;
      utilization. In the last few years, third party payers have been concerned with the&#xD;
      unnecessary consumption of scarce health care resources due to the variation of practice&#xD;
      mostly influenced by surgeon preferences rather than valid evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that Vertical Scar Reduction Mammoplasty&#xD;
      (VSR) is superior to the Inferior Pedicle Reduction Mammoplasty (IPR) in terms of patient&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQL). Health related quality of life will be measured by the&#xD;
      Health Utilities Index Mark 2/3 (HUI) providing the outcome, quality adjusted life years&#xD;
      (QALYs) and the Breast Reduction Assessment Value and Outcomes (BRAVO) instruments. The BRAVO&#xD;
      instruments consist of a set of separate instruments including the Short Form 36 (SF-36), the&#xD;
      Multidimensional Body Self Relations Questionnaire Appearance Assessment (MBSRQ-AS), and the&#xD;
      Breast Related Symptoms Questionnaire (BRSQ). The MBSRQ-AS provides a measure of&#xD;
      self-evaluation of appearance, and the BRSQ measures the breast symptom score. Secondly, we&#xD;
      will test whether the VSR is a more cost-effective procedure. If the hypothesis is confirmed&#xD;
      that the VSR technique is more cost-effective, then there will be compelling evidence to&#xD;
      adopt it. Regardless of whether VSR is found to be cost-effective, the plastic surgery&#xD;
      community, third party payers, and patients will be informed about the results.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients suffering from breast hypertrophy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received OHIP approval for reduction mammoplasty&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidate for both surgical procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is willing to complete quality of life questionnaires and follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient will provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unilateral Breast Hypertrophy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients under the age of 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to complete questionnaires due to language problems&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilateral mastopexy (breast lift)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous breast reduction surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who will require greater than 1000 grams to be removed from either breast (to&#xD;
             be assessed by the Archimedes principle* preoperatively; patients who by the&#xD;
             Archimedes principle displace 1400 cc of volume will be excluded from the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-operative radiation after lumpectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If another procedure is to be &quot;piggy backed' to the reduction mammoplasty (e.g.&#xD;
             liposuction to breast or elsewhere, abdominoplasty, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The Archimedes principle is as follows: In the privacy of her bathroom the&#xD;
                  patient will immerse each breast separately into a large pot filled to the brim&#xD;
                  with tap water. The breast will displace some of the water which will be&#xD;
                  collected into another larger container e.g. plastic dish pan placed underneath&#xD;
                  the pot. The patient will be asked to measure the volume of the displaced water&#xD;
                  in ml. The volume that will be displaced will approximate the weight of the&#xD;
                  breast. The measurement will be done 3 times and the average for each breast will&#xD;
                  be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (The surgeon will explain this principle only to those patients where there is uncertainty&#xD;
        whether the resection will exceed 1000 grams. For the rest of the patients this is not&#xD;
        necessary.)&#xD;
