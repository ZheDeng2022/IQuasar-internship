  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is clear evidence diagnosis of malaria in much of Africa is sub-optimal and this has a&#xD;
      negative impact on patient care. Many of those treated for malaria do not have it. Rapid&#xD;
      diagnostic tests (RDTs) are dipsticks which diagnose malaria rapidly and accurately. The main&#xD;
      objective of this trial is to determine by means of a randomised trial the impact of&#xD;
      introducing RDTs into a standard outpatient setting in Tanzania has on the appropriate&#xD;
      prescription of antimalarials. Other objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare at high, moderate and low P.falciparum transmission intensity the sensitivity&#xD;
           and specificity of malaria diagnosis using hospital slide results and RDTs, using&#xD;
           research quality slides as the reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate the specificity of clinical diagnosis of malaria at high, moderate and low&#xD;
           transmission intensity of P. falciparum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the proportion of cases reported as slide-negative who are treated for&#xD;
           malaria with the proportion of RDT-negative cases treated for malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the cost effectiveness of introducing RDTs compared to current diagnostic&#xD;
           practice in facilities with microscopic diagnosis of malaria at different levels of&#xD;
           transmission of P.falciparum.&#xD;

      In each of the hospital outpatient facilities, patients consenting to participate will have a&#xD;
      free malaria test but the test will be randomly assigned to hospital laboratory blood slide&#xD;
      or RDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitisation of sites and information displayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the start of the intervention study we will conduct meetings with the medical staff to&#xD;
      explain the intervention and standard study procedure. We will provide information from&#xD;
      published sources of the accuracy of 'Paracheck' compared to expert slide reading. Staff will&#xD;
      be encouraged to use the RDT result in the same way that they would use a blood slide result&#xD;
      of equivalent accuracy. We will consult with the Malaria Control Programme what additional&#xD;
      information they would disseminate if they were deploying the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information will be displayed for patients attending the clinic that, for the period of the&#xD;
      trial, malaria diagnosis will be free if requested by the clinic doctor. Patients consenting&#xD;
      to participate will be randomly allocated to receive either a slide test or RDT. Patients who&#xD;
      do not consent to participate will receive free hospital slide testing if requested by the&#xD;
      clinic doctor and their treatment will follow routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients of any age attending the outpatient facility will be eligible to be&#xD;
           considered for the trial with the exception of those who are admitted from outpatients&#xD;
           to the ward or those who appear to the study clinical officer to be too distressed or&#xD;
           ill to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The inclusion criteria will be a clinician decision to request a malaria test. The only&#xD;
           exclusion to this will be where a clinician decides that they would prefer a hospital&#xD;
           slide to the patient entering the trial- these cases will be noted but excluded from the&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment and informed consent All patients attending the clinic will be informed&#xD;
      of the trial, either by means of a written information sheet or, if they cannot read&#xD;
      verbally. They will be asked for verbal informed consent to provide baseline information&#xD;
      before they are seen by the clinic doctor. Consenting patients will be assigned a screening&#xD;
      number and asked questions as in the baseline study relating to personal and socio-economic&#xD;
      characteristics and the main presenting symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On exit from the consultation patients will be asked to show what treatment has been given&#xD;
      and if a request for a malaria test has been made. Clinicians will indicate where they have a&#xD;
      preference for a hospital slide- these patients will be excluded. Those eligible for the&#xD;
      trial for whom a malaria test has been requested will be invited to participate in the trial.&#xD;
      Further information about the trial will be provided, and they or their guardians will&#xD;
      provide written informed consent (or witnessed where they cannot read). Those who consent to&#xD;
      the trial will be assigned to RDT or hospital slide by opening an opaque sealed envelope&#xD;
      within which will be a slip with the study allocation, generated by computer randomisation&#xD;
      (see below, randomization)). These will be numbered, and the number will become the study&#xD;
      number for the patient. Opening the envelope defines entering the trial. If on discovering&#xD;
      the allocation the patient demands a different test this will be deemed a withdrawal from the&#xD;
      trial and this outcome will be noted. Patients who withdraw will be offered standard care&#xD;
      (see below- ethical issues).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If RDT has been allocated, the rapid test and malaria slide (for later expert reading) will&#xD;
      be taken by a qualified member of the survey team who will label slides and RDTs with the&#xD;
      patient's name, date and study number. The result of the RDT will be read and recorded by the&#xD;
      research assistant and then the test given back to the patient to present to the doctor in a&#xD;
      consultation. Clinic doctors will read the result and give treatment according to their&#xD;
      clinical judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If hospital slide has been requested the patient will present the slide request slip to the&#xD;
      hospital laboratory according to normal clinic practice. In addition to taking a blood slide,&#xD;
      laboratory staff will be asked to take a duplicate slide which will be retained, stained and&#xD;
      double-read at a later time according to research methodology. The result will be given back&#xD;
      to the patient for the review consultation according to normal clinic practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On exit from the consultation any patient who has been seen for a review of a blood slide or&#xD;
      RDT result will be briefly interviewed to collect data on any treatment given or changed as a&#xD;
      result of the review of results by the doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients may choose to leave the clinic once they have their result without a review&#xD;
      consultation. This will be determined from their failure to appear on the exit survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of clinical treatments that are consistent with the parasitological diagnosis&#xD;
      in those randomised to RDT compared to those randomised to hospital slide. This is a&#xD;
      composite measure defined as an antimalarial given where the research slide is positive or no&#xD;
      antimalarial given where the research slide is negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of slide negative cases given an antimalarial (overprescription of&#xD;
      antimalarials) in the RDT arm compared to the standard care arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of slide positives not given an antimalarial who are slide positive&#xD;
      (underprescription of antimalarials).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of cases who are treated for malaria on clinical grounds alone Sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of RDT and hospital malaria slide compared to double read research slide results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of patients receiving additional or alternative treatments to antimalarials&#xD;
      following a negative blood slide or RDT result. This will inform cost-effectiveness models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 1 published study and 1 unpublished study we estimate that an antimalarial will be&#xD;
      prescribed in at least 45% of cases who have had a negative blood slide result. This is&#xD;
      expected to apply to all transmission settings. To detect a minimum 25% reduction we require&#xD;
      a total of 820 at each transmission band.&#xD;
