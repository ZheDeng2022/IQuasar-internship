  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The success of sildenafil in the treatment of erectile dysfunction has led to efforts to find&#xD;
      similar treatments for prevalent disorders of female sexual dysfunction. Daily transdermal&#xD;
      testosterone has been shown to improve sexual function in women after oophorectomy (Shifren&#xD;
      et al, Transdermal testosterone treatment in women with impaired sexual function after&#xD;
      oophorectomy, New England Journal of Medicine, 343; 682-8, 2000). In laboratory measures of&#xD;
      sexual arousal, a single application of transdermal testosterone enhanced vaginal blood and&#xD;
      increased erotic fantasy in normal volunteer women in the laboratory setting, four hours&#xD;
      after application (Tuiten et al, Can sublingual testosterone increase subjective and&#xD;
      physiological measures of laboratory-induced sexual arousal?, Arch Gen Psychiatry,&#xD;
      59;465,2002). We therefore planned a study of transdermal testosterone (25mg) marketed as&#xD;
      Androgel in female hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Patients are recruited from the&#xD;
      sexology clinics at Soroka Hospital and the Beersheva Mental Health Center. They are&#xD;
      randomized to Androgel or placebo and given 10 packets and instructed on application to the&#xD;
      abdomen and shoulders, four hours before planned intercourse. Patients unable to discuss&#xD;
      planned intercourse with their partner are offered psychosexual counseling and those still&#xD;
      unable after three sessions are excluded. After one month patients on active Androgel are&#xD;
      crossed over to placebo or vice versa. Patients self-rate sexual response after each&#xD;
      intercourse using the Brief Index of Sexual Functioning for Women, and Arizona Sexual&#xD;
      Experiences Scale (ASEX)-Female and are rated in interview at the end of each month of&#xD;
      treatment using the Sexual Function Questionnaire (SFQ-V1). Our prn technique avoids the&#xD;
      androgenizing side effects of continuous daily treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The role of androgens in addition to estrogens in female sexual health has been known for&#xD;
      several decades [Davis and Tran 2001]. Recently methods of delivering testosterone other than&#xD;
      by injection have made the use of androgens in treatment more available. Testosterone gel is&#xD;
      absorbed well [Wang, et al. 2000] and has been shown to be effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      hypogonadal men. Doses of 100 mg gel rubbed into skin increased testosterone levels to 30-40&#xD;
      nmoles/L within 8-20 hours. Levels returned to baseline in this study within 1-2 days after&#xD;
      cessation of chronic treatment although return to baseline after a single application was not&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study [Shifren, et al. 2000] has shown that transdermal continuous patch&#xD;
      testosterone dose 150micro g or 300micro g vs. placebo daily during the 12 week study&#xD;
      improved sexual health including desire, arousal, and orgasm frequency in women with&#xD;
      surgically induced menopause after oophorectomy. Blood levels reached 3.0nmoles/L (5x&#xD;
      baseline). Shrifren et al [2000] found no significant side effects with transdermal sustained&#xD;
      testosterone treatment. Another study [Goldstat, et al. 2003] looked at transdermal&#xD;
      testosterone given in gel, 10mg a day given for 12 weeks in a double-blind design for 31&#xD;
      pre-menopausal women with a mean age of 40 years. The women entered the study presenting with&#xD;
      low sexual desire. Testosterone treatment resulted in a significant improvement in&#xD;
      psychological general well being and sexual self rating scale. No adverse effects were&#xD;
      reported. Blood levels of testosterone increase about 2.5 times baseline to 2.6nmoles/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the absence of side effects reported in the small studies for relatively short&#xD;
      periods of time done up till now in women with testosterone treatment, in the treatment of a&#xD;
      long term disorder such as diminished sexual desire it is reasonable to be concerned with&#xD;
      androgenizing side effects. Therefore, it would be extremely useful if testosterone could be&#xD;
      given on a prn (as needed) basis before sexual intercourse. Recently Tuiten et al [2000]&#xD;
      studied normal volunteer women with vaginal flow measures using photoplethysmography in&#xD;
      addition to questionnaire data on sexual arousal after exposure to erotic movies with pre&#xD;
      treatment of sublingual testosterone vs. placebo in a single dose sublingually of 0.5mg.&#xD;
      Testosterone significantly enhanced vaginal blood flow response to the erotic movies and also&#xD;
      the subjective sexual interest, desire and arousal to the movies. The psychophysiological&#xD;
      effect was maximal 4 hours after the sublingual testosterone. Blood levels of 25nmol/L&#xD;
      testosterone, 10 times baseline, were maximal 10 minutes after sublingual delivery and&#xD;
      returned to baseline within 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study suggested that it may be possible to give transdermal testosterone 4-8 hours&#xD;
      before intercourse in couples where the female partner suffers from low sexual interest or&#xD;
      desire and /or difficulties in arousal, but where the couple is able to plan intercourse&#xD;
      several hours in advance, which is possible in many couples, based on our clinical&#xD;
      experience. In such couples androgen could be given on a prn basis and the possibility of&#xD;
      side effects with long term use greatly reduced. We therefore propose such a study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study will be done as a double-blind randomized crossover study. Women entering&#xD;
      the study will be pre-menopausal ages 21-40 with a diagnosis of hypo-active sexual disorder&#xD;
      by an experienced sexologist diplomate of the Israel Society for Sexual Therapy. Patients&#xD;
      will be accepted for study only if they can plan intercourse with their partner. Patients&#xD;
      unable to do so will be offered 3 sessions of counseling about sexual communication and those&#xD;
      still unable to plan intercourse after those 3 sessions will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
      Patients accepted for the study after written informed consent will be given 8 packets of&#xD;
      Testosteron Gel (Androgel) 50mg and shown how to spread the gel on the skin of the lower&#xD;
      abdomen or upper shoulders. They will be told that they can use the gel up to twice weekly&#xD;
      for one month. Patients will be instructed to spread the gel 4-8 hours before planned&#xD;
      intercourse. The patients will be instructed to shower to remove any remaining gel after&#xD;
      intercourse. After each intercourse they will fill out the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale&#xD;
      (ASEX)- Female [McGahuey, et al. 2000]. At baseline and at the end of the month they will be&#xD;
      interviewed and rated for the month as a whole using the Sexual Function Questionnaire&#xD;
      (SFQ-V1) [Quirk, et al. 2002]. They will then be given a package of 8 placebo gels with the&#xD;
      same instruction and invited back after a month for another rating. Half of the women will be&#xD;
      given placebo and then switched over to active androgen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We request permission to advertise on the internet and/or in newspapers for symptomatic&#xD;
      volunteers for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible (but improbable due to the low doses and the prn use) side effects include: Increase&#xD;
      in total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose and insulin; changes in blood counts and changes&#xD;
      in liver function tests (serum aspartate aminotransferase, serum glutamyltransferase, serum&#xD;
      albumin); hirsutism and acne, increase in facial hair or loss of hair; diarrhea, nipple and&#xD;
      breast enlargement or breast pains; headache; elevation of blood pressure, changes in mood or&#xD;
      aggressiveness. Slight local skin irritation or dryness of skin. However, as stated before,&#xD;
      these side effects are unlikely using prn treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose: The recent study of Shifren et al [2000] used continuous transdermal patch and reached&#xD;
      blood levels of 3.0nmoles/L (5x baseline) in post-menopausal women, with no side effects over&#xD;
      12 weeks. Goldstat et al [2003] looked at transdermal gel 10mg, which is applied daily but&#xD;
      washes off as the day wears on, for 12 weeks with no side effects in pre-menopausal women.&#xD;
      They reached blood levels of 2.6nmoles/L (2.5x baseline). Tuiten et al [2000] used sublingual&#xD;
      one time dose of 0.5mg, reaching a peak blood level of 25nmoles/L (10x baseline) at 10&#xD;
      minutes which returned to baseline within 90 minutes. We propose to minimize side effects and&#xD;
      maximize benefit by single application use of 50mg testosterone in transdermal gel to be used&#xD;
      only up to twice a week. Blood levels from this dose from Wang et al [2000] should be about&#xD;
      20nmoles/L. Since patients are instructed to shower after intercourse, these blood levels&#xD;
      should exist for only 4-8 hours twice a week. Based on Tuiten et al [2000] a short pulse of&#xD;
      testosterone up to these levels is necessary to achieve psychophysiological effects, and thus&#xD;
      we request permission to use a dose of 50mg Androgel which would be too high if used daily&#xD;
      chronically in women.&#xD;
