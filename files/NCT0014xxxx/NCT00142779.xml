  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine addiction is a serious health problem with no available medical treatment for&#xD;
      preventing relapse. Fluoxetine, a medication that is currently used to treat depression and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders, may also be effective at diminishing cocaine use in individuals with&#xD;
      severe cocaine addiction. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of fluoxetine at&#xD;
      reducing cocaine use in individuals addicted to cocaine and opioids who are concurrently&#xD;
      receiving methadone treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Individuals addicted to cocaine often experience feelings of restlessness, irritability,&#xD;
      anxiety, and paranoia. Reducing cocaine use can lead to depression. In an attempt to&#xD;
      alleviate the depressive symptoms, individuals may resume drug use. Fluoxetine, a medication&#xD;
      that is currently used to treat depression and panic attacks, may assist at reducing cocaine&#xD;
      use in individuals addicted to cocaine. By increasing serotonin, a chemical in the brain that&#xD;
      helps maintain mental balance, fluoxetine may lessen depressive symptoms and decrease the&#xD;
      reinforcing effects of cocaine. Voucher incentive programs, in which items or services are&#xD;
      offered as a reward for remaining drug-free, are also a useful component of substance abuse&#xD;
      treatment. Preliminary research has shown that fluoxetine, when combined with an incentive&#xD;
      program, is an effective treatment for reducing cocaine use. Further research is needed to&#xD;
      confirm the benefits of fluoxetine for cocaine and opioid addicts. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoxetine, in combination with a voucher incentive&#xD;
      program, at reducing cocaine use in methadone-maintained cocaine and opioid addicts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 33-week study will enroll individuals addicted to both cocaine and opioids who are&#xD;
      concurrently enrolled in a methadone treatment program. Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either 60 mg of fluoxetine or placebo on a daily basis for 12 weeks from&#xD;
      Weeks 8 through 19. Study visits will occur once a week. Questionnaires and self-reports will&#xD;
      be completed to assess medication side effects and cocaine use. Cocaine levels will be&#xD;
      monitored three times a week with urine tests. During the 12 weeks of treatment, participants&#xD;
      will also be randomly assigned to either take part in a voucher incentives program or not&#xD;
      take part in the program. Participants in the voucher program will receive a voucher that may&#xD;
      be exchanged for various items and services for each urine test with a negative cocaine&#xD;
      result.&#xD;
