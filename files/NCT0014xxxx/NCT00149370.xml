  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the growing evidence showing that breast hypertrophy is associated with reduced&#xD;
      Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) and that reduction mammoplasty has a significant&#xD;
      positive impact on HRQL, there are unresolved issues that need to be addressed. These include&#xD;
      our ability to measure quantitatively the change that occurs after reduction and the ongoing&#xD;
      restriction or denials of third party payments based on body mass index (BMI). The primary&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to assess and measure the HRQL experienced by breast reduction&#xD;
      patients using four reliable and validated HRQL measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty-two consecutive patients with the diagnosis of breast hypertrophy were invited to&#xD;
      participate in this prospective study. Participants completed the Health Utilities Index Mark&#xD;
      2 (HUI2) and Mark 3 (HUI3) and the Breast Reduction Assessment Value and Outcomes (BRAVO)&#xD;
      instruments (the Short Form 36, the Multidimensional Body-Self Rating Questionnaire&#xD;
      Appearance Assessment, and the Breast Related Symptom Questionnaire) at one week and one day&#xD;
      pre-surgery and one, six, and 12 months post-surgery.&#xD;

      This study addresses the following questions of clinical and policy relevance: 1) Is the&#xD;
      pre-surgery HRQL of these patients compromised and, if so, in which areas? 2) Do patients'&#xD;
      HRQL improve after surgery and, if so, when and in which areas and by how much? 3) Is there a&#xD;
      relationship between BMI and pre-/post-surgery changes in HRQL (i.e., is the pre/post effect&#xD;
      similar for both obese and non-obese patients)? and 4) Is there a relationship between tissue&#xD;
      re-section weight and pre-/post-surgery changes in HRQL (i.e., is the pre/post HRQL effect&#xD;
      similar for patients having small and large amounts of tissue resected)?&#xD;
