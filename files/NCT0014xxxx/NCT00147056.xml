  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of MRI-guided focused ultrasound thermal&#xD;
      ablation of brain tumors performed through intact human skull using the ExAblate transcranial&#xD;
      system. We will collect data to establish the basic safety of this type of treatment as the&#xD;
      basis for later studies that will evaluate its clinical efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this non-randomized feasibility study, FUS under MRI-guidance and thermometry will be&#xD;
      given through intact human skull to brain tumor in up to ten (10) subjects. These subjects&#xD;
      will be followed over a 3-month period with contrast MRI and clinical exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety of ExAblate TcMRgFUS treatment delivered through intact human&#xD;
           skull to the brain, during the treatment, and during the follow-up period of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effect of thermal ablation in the target tumor with contrast MR imaging&#xD;
           to identify viable tumor, and non-viable thermally ablated tissue.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Men or women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age between 18 and 70 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able and willing to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with (newly diagnosed or recurrent) metastatic cancer for whom surgery,&#xD;
             radiation, or radiosurgery has not been advised by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The targeted tumor tissue is located in the cerebral hemispheres, &gt; 2.5 cm from the&#xD;
             inner table of the skull. Non-targeted parts of the tumor may extend outside the&#xD;
             treated tumor limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Tumor(s) are clearly defined on pre-therapy contrast enhanced MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Size of the targeted portion of the tumor (i.e. prescribed Region Of Treatment) is&#xD;
             less than 2.5 cm in diameter or 8 cm3 in volume. The non-targeted tumor tissue may&#xD;
             exceed the targeted volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Karnofsky rating 70-100 (See Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. ASA score 1-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Able to communicate sensations during the ExAblate MRGFUS procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Able to attend all study visits (i.e. life expectancy of at least 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. At least 14 days passed since last brain surgery, or intracranial radiation&#xD;
             therapy/radiosurgery&#xD;
