      The SUN Study is a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-sponsored multi-site&#xD;
      prospective observational cohort study designed to better understand the incidence and&#xD;
      etiology of metabolic and other complications related to effective HIV treatment and longer&#xD;
      survival. The SUN Study is also providing a platform to evaluate a behavioral intervention&#xD;
      designed to reduce HIV transmission through prevention counseling in routine care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective antiretroviral therapy has significantly improved and prolonged the lives of&#xD;
      HIV-infected persons. However, antiretroviral use has also been associated with a diverse&#xD;
      array of &quot;unnatural&quot; metabolic complications and other adverse medical conditions. These&#xD;
      problems, together with subsequent longer survival, have increased patients' risk for&#xD;
      developing renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, neurological, rheumatologic, and other end-organ&#xD;
      diseases, and cancers. Longer survival is also increasing the pool of HIV-infected persons&#xD;
      capable of transmitting the virus, which could accelerate the pace of the U.S. epidemic;&#xD;
      however, the ability of physicians caring for HIV-infected persons to incorporate prevention&#xD;
      into their clinical practices and the effectiveness of this intervention have not been&#xD;
      extensively evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of the Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV and AIDS (&quot;SUN&quot; Study) are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to monitor the incidence of metabolic and other medical complications related to the&#xD;
           treatment of HIV infection and attendant prolonged survival,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify risk factors associated with the development of these metabolic and other&#xD;
           medical complications,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to monitor the contribution of these complications and other conditions to the morbidity&#xD;
           and mortality of HIV infection, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the efficacy of a structured program of prevention activities, which are&#xD;
           integrated into the routine medical care of HIV patients to reduce HIV transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SUN Study is designed to enroll and follow for 5 or more years a cohort of up to 1,000&#xD;
      HIV-infected adults at HIV specialty care centers in four U.S. cities: Denver, Minneapolis,&#xD;
      Providence, and St. Louis. Data will be gathered through longitudinal real-time chart review,&#xD;
      biannual physical examination (e.g., body mass index [BMI], blood pressure), repeated&#xD;
      non-invasive imaging (e.g., dual energy x-ray absortiometry [DEXA] scanning, carotid&#xD;
      ultrasonography) and regularly scheduled laboratory testing (e.g., serum lipids, pap smears,&#xD;
      and urinary microalbumin). Data collection and quality control will be managed by Cerner&#xD;
      Corporation. After sufficient enrollment, (circa 200 persons per site) a structured&#xD;
      prevention program to reduce HIV transmission will be introduced. The impact of this&#xD;
      intervention will be evaluated both subjectively (e.g., self-reported change in behavior on&#xD;
      an audio computer-assisted self-interviewing [ACASI] questionnaire) and objectively (e.g.,&#xD;
      change in sexually transmitted disease [STD] incidence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes include determination of the incidence of therapy-related metabolic complications&#xD;
      and other adverse conditions associated with longer survival, identification of risk factors&#xD;
      for these complications and conditions, and reduction in both reported and objective measures&#xD;
      of risky sexual behavior.&#xD;
