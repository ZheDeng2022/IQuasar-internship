      Creatine plays a pivotal role in brain energy homeostasis. Creatine supplementation is widely&#xD;
      used in enhancing sports performance, and has been tried in the treatment of neurological,&#xD;
      neuromuscular and atherosclerotic disease with a paucity of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dechent et al (1999) studied the effect of oral creatine supplementation for 4 wk&#xD;
      demonstrating a statistically significant increase of mean concentration of total creatine&#xD;
      across brain regions. These findings suggest the possibility of using oral creatine&#xD;
      supplementation to modify brain high-energy phosphate metabolism in subjects with various&#xD;
      brain disorders, including schizophrenia and major depression. Recently, Rae et al (2003)&#xD;
      reported that creatine supplementation for 6 weeks had a significant positive effect on both&#xD;
      working memory and Raven matrices. Several independent lines of evidence suggest the possible&#xD;
      involvement of altered cerebral energy metabolism in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are performing a double blind cross-over study of creatine in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty patients will be treated with creatine for 3 months in a double-blind crossover design.&#xD;
      Rating scales will include scales for assessing negative and positive symptoms of&#xD;
      schizophrenia, clinical global impressions scale, scales for side-effects and a cognitive&#xD;
      battery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creatine effects on brain energy metabolism and its possible cognitive enhancing properties&#xD;
      raise the possibility of developing a new therapeutic strategy in schizophrenia focusing on&#xD;
      treating metabolic hypoactive brain areas including frontal regions.&#xD;

      Creatine plays a pivotal role in brain energy homeostasis, being a temporal and spatial&#xD;
      buffer for cytosolic and mitochondrial pools of the cellular energy currency adenosine&#xD;
      triphosphate (Wyss &amp; Kaddurah-Daouk, 2000). Recent studies have suggested increased brain&#xD;
      utilization of oxygen following oral creatine supplementation (Persky &amp; Brazeua, 2001).&#xD;
      Creatine supplementation is widely used in enhancing sports performance, and has been tried&#xD;
      in the treatment of neurological, neuromuscular and atherosclerotic disease with a paucity of&#xD;
      side effects (Persky &amp; Brazeua, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creatine enters the brain via a specialized sodium dependent transporter. Dechent et al&#xD;
      (1999) studied the effect of oral creatine supplementation of 20g/day for 4 wk demonstrating&#xD;
      a significant increase of mean concentration of total creatine across brain regions (8.7%&#xD;
      corresponding to 0.6mM, P &lt; 0.001). Lyoo et al (2003) studied magnetic resonance spectroscopy&#xD;
      of high-energy phosphate metabolites in human brain following oral supplementation of&#xD;
      creatine reporting that creatine (0.3 g/kg/day for the first 7 days and 0.03 g/kg/day for the&#xD;
      next 7 days) significantly increased brain creatine levels. These findings suggest the&#xD;
      possibility of using oral creatine supplementation to modify brain high-energy phosphate&#xD;
      metabolism in subjects with various brain disorders, including schizophrenia and major&#xD;
      depression, where alterations in brain high-energy phosphate metabolism have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kieburtz et al (see: http://www.huntington-study-group.org/Creatine%20abstract.htm) are&#xD;
      conducting a double blind clinical trial of creatine in 50 ambulatory Huntington disease&#xD;
      subjects randomized to creatine or placebo. Those randomized to creatine receive 3g for 2&#xD;
      months and then 5g for an additional 2 months. There have been no significant adverse events&#xD;
      associated with creatine or significant changes in laboratory tests or vital signs. In the&#xD;
      creatine treated group creatine plasma levels approximately doubled (210 ± 335 µM vs. 500 ±&#xD;
      125 µM). Kieburtz et al are currently also conducting a multi-center, double-blind study of&#xD;
      creatine in patients with Parkinson's disease, funded by the National Institute of&#xD;
      Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). Recently, Rae et al (2003) reported that creatine&#xD;
      supplementation (5 grams per day for 6 weeks) had a significant positive effect (p &lt; 0.0001)&#xD;
      on both working memory (backward digit span) and Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices. These&#xD;
      findings suggest a role of brain energy capacity in influencing brain cognitive performance&#xD;
      and that creatine via its effects on brain energy metabolism may exert beneficial effects on&#xD;
      cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several independent lines of evidence suggest the possible involvement of altered cerebral&#xD;
      energy metabolism in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Imaging studies have used positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) with flurodeoxyglucose (FDG), or functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI), 15O magnetic resonance spectroscopy with 31P (31P-MRS) and single photon&#xD;
      emission tomography (SPECT), to investigate cerebral metabolic rates in schizophrenia. Most&#xD;
      but not all studies reveal decreased metabolism in the frontal cortex in schizophrenia, which&#xD;
      was termed hypofrontality. Several studies also observed alterations in brain metabolic rates&#xD;
      in other brain regions including the temporal lobes, the thalamus and the basal ganglia,&#xD;
      leading to the suggestion of an impairment in the fronto-striatal-thalamic circuitry in&#xD;
      schizophrenia rather than in a specific brain region (Andreasen et al. 1997). A direct link&#xD;
      to phosphocreatine and ATP energy systems came from studies using 31P-MRS with or without&#xD;
      chemical shift imaging, which enabled the measurement of ATP, phosphocreatine and inorganic&#xD;
      phosphate. These studies showed reduced ATP in the frontal lobe and in left temporal lobe of&#xD;
      schizophrenic patients as compared to controls (Volz et al. 2000). Altered brain energy&#xD;
      metabolism could be due to impairment of mitochondria and a variety of studies reviewed&#xD;
      recently by Ben Shachar (2002) suggest impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism in&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, creatine besides its energy sparing properties was also shown to have&#xD;
      neuroprotective properties in a variety of animal models for brain diseases including&#xD;
      Huntington and Parkinson diseases, as well as exerting protective effects in animal models&#xD;
      for cerebral hypoxia (Persky &amp; Brazeua, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are performing a double blind cross-over study of creatine in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty consenting schizophrenic patients, 18-60 years old, physically healthy, with more than&#xD;
      2 years of illness in a stable condition (no gross changes in clinical presentation in the&#xD;
      last 6 months as judged by the patient's psychiatrist) and presenting negative and cognitive&#xD;
      symptoms (as judged by the patient's psychiatrist along with score in at least 3 items of the&#xD;
      PANSS negative subscale =4 points, while items of the PANSS positive subscale scored = 3&#xD;
      points). These patients will be recruited into the study over two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excluded will be patients with alcohol or drug abuse in the 6 months prior to entry into the&#xD;
      study or any clinically significant medical condition or laboratory abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty patients will be treated with creatine for 3 months (3 g daily in the first month and&#xD;
      then 5 g daily for another 2 months) and then for 3 months with placebo. The other twenty&#xD;
      patients will be administered placebo for 3 months and then creatine for 3 months in the same&#xD;
      dosages and procedure. Patients' neuroleptic treatment will not be affected by study&#xD;
      participation. Mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines and anticholinergic medications are allowed&#xD;
      but doses will be documented throughout the study. Routine blood tests including kidney&#xD;
      function, liver function as well as plasma creatine and creatinine will be monitored at&#xD;
      baseline and monthly throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), and Adverse&#xD;
      effect/side effects assessment will be administered at baseline and then monthly. A Cognitive&#xD;
      Battery will be administered at baseline, three months, and six months consisting of the&#xD;
      California Verbal Learning Test; Trail making A&amp;B; Purdue Pegboard; Digit Symbol Coding;&#xD;
      Continuous performance test ; Reaction Time performance Test and Wisconsin Card Sort Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Analysis: We have demonstrated significant effects as add-on in schizophrenia in this&#xD;
      design with folate treatment as a homocysteine lowering strategy in schizophrenia. A sample&#xD;
      of 36 subjects recruited over 24 months showed a statistically significant, clinically&#xD;
      relevant difference between the active treatment and placebo in a similar design to that&#xD;
      proposed here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creatine administration is safe with a paucity of side effects. Creatine effects on brain&#xD;
      energy metabolism and its possible cognitive enhancing properties raise the possibility of&#xD;
      developing a new therapeutic strategy in schizophrenia focusing on treating metabolic and&#xD;
      energetic hypoactive brain areas including frontal regions. My personal research experience&#xD;
      and position at the Beersheva Mental Health Centre make such a trial eminently feasible.&#xD;
