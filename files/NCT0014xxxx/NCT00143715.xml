      Excessive prolongation of the international normalized ratio (INR) occurs frequently in&#xD;
      patients taking warfarin; in fact, about one in six INR values is above the desired range.&#xD;
      Excessive prolongation of the INR is clinically important because the risk of bleeding&#xD;
      approximately doubles for each one point increase in the INR beyond the usual therapeutic&#xD;
      range. Thus, treatment strategies which rapidly and reliably lower an excessively prolonged&#xD;
      INR into the desired range have the potential to reduce bleeding. When taken by patients with&#xD;
      INR values between 4.5 and 10, a small dose of oral vitamin K (1 mg to 2.5mg) reduces the INR&#xD;
      into the desired INR range in about 75% of cases within 24 hours of its administration. If&#xD;
      warfarin is simply withheld, and no vitamin K is given, about 25% of patients will have an&#xD;
      INR in the desired range at 24 hours. However, vitamin K is rarely given to such patients. In&#xD;
      a recent survey carried out by our group, less than 20% of such patients would have been&#xD;
      given low dose oral vitamin K by a group of physicians who regularly supervise warfarin&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common treatment for excessive prolongation of the INR is to simply withhold&#xD;
      warfarin and allow the INR to fall into the therapeutic range. Although this strategy is&#xD;
      effective its safety has never been adequately examined. In fact, recent evidence suggests&#xD;
      that patients with INR values of more than 6.0 who are treated with simple warfarin&#xD;
      withdrawal have a risk of major bleeding of 4% in the two weeks after they develop their&#xD;
      prolonged INR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When asked why they did not give oral vitamin K to a non-bleeding patient who has an&#xD;
      excessively prolonged INR, physicians generally give one of three reasons: (1)They are not&#xD;
      convinced that oral vitamin K reduces bleeding. (2) They are concerned that oral vitamin K&#xD;
      may cause thrombosis. (3) In contrast with simply withholding warfarin, giving oral vitamin K&#xD;
      requires a patient to visit the physician, and the physician must have a supply of vitamin K.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the routine practice of not administering oral vitamin K&#xD;
      to patients with excessively prolonged INR values is causing patients to have major,&#xD;
      life-threatening and fatal bleeds. To convince physicians that oral vitamin K should be&#xD;
      administered to all non-bleeding patients with INR values of more than 4.5, the investigators&#xD;
      propose a study which the investigators anticipate will demonstrate that oral vitamin K&#xD;
      reduces bleeding, does not cause thrombosis, and can be administered at home without direct&#xD;
      physician supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish these goals, the investigators propose a multinational, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial. The investigators will randomize patients with INR values between&#xD;
      4.5 and 10.0 to receive 1.25 mg of oral vitamin K or placebo and follow them for bleeding and&#xD;
      thrombosis. Patients with INR values of more than 10.0 will receive a single 1.25 mg dose of&#xD;
      oral vitamin K.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful completion of this study will establish a treatment standard supported by clinical&#xD;
      data which will, in turn, change the way that patients taking warfarin who present with an&#xD;
      excessively prolonged INR are treated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      What is the problem to be addressed ? Although warfarin is a highly effective anticoagulant,&#xD;
      it causes bleeding. The risk of bleeding in an individual is increased by a number of&#xD;
      factors, including age, gender and previous hemorrhage. However, the single strongest&#xD;
      predictor of hemorrhage is excessive prolongation of the international normalized ratio&#xD;
      (INR). We have shown that low-dose oral vitamin K reliably reduces an excessively prolonged&#xD;
      INR; we hypothesize this treatment will also reduce the risk of hemorrhage without increasing&#xD;
      the risk of thrombosis. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that low dose oral&#xD;
      vitamin K improves the safety of oral anticoagulant therapy, by reducing the risk of bleeding&#xD;
      without causing thrombosis, in patients presenting with INR values of more than 4.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and rationale for the study (Efficacy and toxicity of warfarin): Warfarin reduces&#xD;
      the risk of first or recurrent venous thrombosis by 80 to 90 percent, and reduces the risk of&#xD;
      first or recurrent arterial thrombosis by 50 to 65 percent (1;2). In North America more than&#xD;
      1 million patients receive warfarin on a daily basis and in Ontario more than 300,000&#xD;
      prescriptions for warfarin are filled annually. The major toxicity of warfarin is bleeding,&#xD;
      which may be fatal. Although bleeding may occur when the international normalized ratio (INR)&#xD;
      is in the &quot;therapeutic range&quot; (2.0 to 3.0 for most indications), many patients who bleed have&#xD;
      supratherapeutic INR values. Indeed, large studies suggest patients spend 10 to 20 percent of&#xD;
      their time with excessively prolonged INR values and one anticoagulation clinic has reported&#xD;
      that out of 7,279 patients managed over a 5 year interval, 1,995 had at least one INR greater&#xD;
      than 6.0 (3). Furthermore, the risk of hemorrhage approximately doubles for each increase in&#xD;
      the INR of 1.0 unit (4-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and rationale for the study (Risks of an excessively prolonged INR) The risk of&#xD;
      hemorrhage in patients with asymptomatic warfarin-associated coagulopathy has been&#xD;
      highlighted by Hylek and colleagues (8). In this study, 114 patients who presented with INR&#xD;
      values of more than 6.0 simply had their warfarin withheld until the INR had declined to the&#xD;
      desired range. In the two-week follow-up period, 10 of the 114 (8.8%, 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      (CI) 3.6 to 14.0) patients experienced bleeding including 5 major and two fatal bleeds. Thus&#xD;
      the risk of major hemorrhage and fatal hemorrhage was 4.4% (95% CI 0.6, 8.1), and 1.7% (95%&#xD;
      CI 0, 4.2), respectively. Similarly, Oden and colleagues (4) demonstrated the mortality rate&#xD;
      attributable to bleeding per 100 patient years of follow-up was 22 fold higher in patients&#xD;
      with INR values between 6.0 and 6.9, compared with patients with an INR between 2.0 and 2.4.&#xD;
      The observation that excessive elevation of the INR is associated with bleeding suggests that&#xD;
      identifying an effective technique to lower the INR will reduce bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Rationale (Treatment of warfarin associated coagulopathy) Other than simply&#xD;
      withholding warfarin and allowing the INR to fall to the desired range, two &quot;active&quot;&#xD;
      approaches are used to lower the INR in excessively anticoagulated patients. Transfusion of&#xD;
      coagulation factor concentrates replaces missing coagulation factors. Supplemental vitamin K&#xD;
      antagonizes the effect of warfarin, thus increasing endogenous synthesis of these same&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfusion with human derived or recombinant clotting factors can rapidly normalize the INR.&#xD;
      However, this treatment is expensive, inconvenient, associated with infectious or other&#xD;
      complications such as allergy or thrombosis, and has never been prospectively studied in&#xD;
      non-bleeding patients (9). Thus, transfusion therapy should not be used to correct an&#xD;
      excessively prolonged INR value in non-bleeding patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is this study designed to prove ?&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that this study will prove that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Oral vitamin K reduces the risk of bleeding in patients taking warfarin who present with&#xD;
           INR values between 4.5 and 10.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. That oral vitamin K does not increase the risk of thrombosis when given to such&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. That low dose oral vitamin K will reduce the INR to an acceptable range in a high&#xD;
           proportion of patients presenting with an INR of more than 10.0&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why is this trial needed now ? This trial is needed now because there is new evidence&#xD;
      confirming the association between prolonged INR values and the risk of bleeding (4;8),&#xD;
      because new evidence suggests that oral vitamin K effectively lowers the INR (12-15;17) and&#xD;
      thus may reduce bleeding (13), and because the risk:benefit ratio of oral vitamin K remains&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies which have been previously published by our group suggests that oral vitamin K&#xD;
      effectively reduces the INR value. However, despite their rigour, and their publication in&#xD;
      high-impact journals, our studies have not yet influenced clinical practice. A recent US&#xD;
      survey confirmed that most clinicians faced with an excessively anticoagulated, non-bleeding&#xD;
      patient would simply withhold warfarin and not give oral vitamin K (18). The lack of use of&#xD;
      vitamin K is attributable to at least four factors; first, no study has unequivocally shown&#xD;
      that oral vitamin K reduces the risk of hemorrhage. Although our first randomized trial (13)&#xD;
      did find less bleeding in patients who received vitamin K, the bleeding in the placebo group&#xD;
      occurred more than one week after randomization, making it possible that this observation was&#xD;
      attributable to the play of chance. Second, there is concern that, irrespective of its route&#xD;
      of administration, vitamin K may place patients at risk of thrombosis by &quot;over-correcting&quot;&#xD;
      the INR. Although our two randomized trials showed no evidence that low dose vitamin K causes&#xD;
      either warfarin resistance or thrombosis, at least one other publication has suggested this&#xD;
      might occur (19). Third, the &quot;passive&quot; strategy of merely withholding warfarin is simple,&#xD;
      inexpensive and easily applied. Finally, access to a convenient form of vitamin K is a major&#xD;
      barrier as there is no convenient and easily administered form of oral vitamin K in many&#xD;
      jurisdictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design: This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre&#xD;
      clinical trial with a concurrent cohort study (Appendix 1 - Study Flow Diagram). The&#xD;
      randomized trial will enrol patients with INR values of 4.5 to 10.0. The cohort study will&#xD;
      enrol patients with INR values of more than 10.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZED TRIAL (INR 4.5 to 10.0): Eligible, consenting patients will temporarily&#xD;
      discontinue warfarin and will be randomized to receive a single capsule containing either&#xD;
      1.25 mg of oral vitamin K or no active drug.() COHORT STUDY (INR more than 10.0): All&#xD;
      eligible consenting patients will receive 2.5 mg of vitamin K.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation to study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three types of anticoagulant clinics exist. In the first type, patients present to the clinic&#xD;
      for blood-drawing, and wait for their INR. Their dose of warfarin is then prescribed based on&#xD;
      these results. Within this type of clinic, patients will be identified at the time that their&#xD;
      INR prolongation is discovered. Consent for the study will be obtained, and the patient will&#xD;
      be provided with the next numbered study kit, from which a single capsule containing either&#xD;
      vitamin K or placebo will be administered. In clinics in which a point-of-care device is used&#xD;
      for INR determinations the INR will be confirmed with a venous sample before the patient is&#xD;
      enrolled. For the purposes of this study, such centres will be called &quot;group 1&quot; sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The more common anticoagulant clinic is one within which patients have their INR determined&#xD;
      by an outside laboratory, with the results called to a clinic physician, nurse or pharmacist.&#xD;
      Within such a clinic, it is impractical to require patients to present to the hospital for&#xD;
      assessment and randomization on the day that their INR is prolonged. For clinics using this&#xD;
      model, we propose that when patients are found to have an INR of more than 4.5 they be&#xD;
      assessed over the telephone for inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study. Patients&#xD;
      meeting inclusion criteria, with no exclusion criteria, will be asked to provide consent over&#xD;
      the telephone for the study. Once consent is obtained, and study forms are completed using&#xD;
      information obtained over the telephone, the study centre will arrange to have the next&#xD;
      numbered study drug allocated to the patient. The study drug will then be shipped to the&#xD;
      patient using taxi cabs or a dedicated courier service. Receipt and consumption of the drug&#xD;
      will then be confirmed at the time of the mandatory in centre assessment the following day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of this study, all centres using this form of allocation to study drug will&#xD;
      be called &quot;group 2&quot; centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both group 1 and group 2 centres patients with INR values of more than 10.0 will be given&#xD;
      two capsules each containing 1.25 mg of oral vitamin K. A supply of such capsules will be&#xD;
      provided to all participating centres in a clearly marked container. This drug will be&#xD;
      provided to the patient in the same fashion as drug is provided to patients in the cohort&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timely return of INR values is a problem when INR values are obtained outside the hospital.&#xD;
      In some cases, for example, the INR may not be available until late in the evening or the day&#xD;
      following the blood draw. If more than 24 hours has elapsed since the blood draw and the time&#xD;
      at which a patient would be eligible for randomization the patient will be deemed ineligible&#xD;
      for the study. In such cases however, the INR can be repeated (for example at the hospital or&#xD;
      clinic laboratory) and if the INR remains above 4.5, the patient can then be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who self-administer study drug will be asked to bring their unused capsule to the&#xD;
      clinic on the day following randomization. This will ensure that they took the correct&#xD;
      capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The least frequently used mechanism for monitoring warfarin therapy is patient&#xD;
      self-monitoring using a point of care testing (POCT) device. Patients monitored with POCT are&#xD;
      responsible for determining their INR and adjusting their warfarin dose based on their INR&#xD;
      result. Patients who self-monitor using point of care testing and who find themselves to have&#xD;
      an INR of more than 4.5 will be asked to contact their clinic staff. Prior to being&#xD;
      approached for consent to enter this study the patient's INR will be confirmed on a venous&#xD;
      blood sample organized by their host anticoagulant clinic. Given that patients in this group&#xD;
      will be randomized while at the study centre, for the purposes of this study such patients&#xD;
      will be considered to be in group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 and group 2 defines arbitrary groups. Clinics may have a mixture of group 1 and group&#xD;
      2 patients; such clinics will have some patients who have signed consents and who will be&#xD;
      randomized &quot;at home&quot; (group 2 patient) and others who are randomized and receive study drug&#xD;
      &quot;in centre&quot;. Irrespective of where patients are at the time of randomization they will be&#xD;
      allocated the next available study drug supply at the time of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for dealing with patients who are eligible for the study on more than one occasion:&#xD;
      Patients can only be enrolled in either the randomized trial or the cohort study once.&#xD;
      However, a patient previously enrolled in the cohort study who presented on a later occasion&#xD;
      with an INR of 4.5 to 10 would be eligible for the randomized trial. Similarly, patients&#xD;
      previously enrolled in the randomized trial are eligible for the cohort study. To ensure that&#xD;
      the results of the randomized trial are not confounded by participation in the cohort study,&#xD;
      a minimum of one month must pass between the time a patient is enrolled in the cohort study&#xD;
      and their subsequent enrollment in the randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of randomization: Randomization will be performed using a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization sequence. This sequence will guide drug packaging. Study drug supply will be&#xD;
      packaged and dispensed to each study centre in lots of sequentially numbered appropriately&#xD;
      labeled pill bottles. An additional, clearly labeled, supply of capsules containing 1.25 mg&#xD;
      of oral vitamin K will be dispensed to each participating centre. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      by allocating the next, sequentially numbered pill bottle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the frequency of study follow-up ? Patients will be seen at each participating&#xD;
      clinical centre by study staff on days 1 and 14 (+/- 2 days) after randomization. All&#xD;
      patients will be contacted by telephone on days 3, 7, 28 and 90. Additional contact and INR&#xD;
      sampling necessary to manage the patient's anticoagulant therapy will be made as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the study outcome measures ? The primary outcome measure is &quot;all clinically overt&#xD;
      bleeding&quot;. Secondary outcome measures are &quot;all adjudication-confirmed major hemorrhage&quot;, &quot;all&#xD;
      adjudication-confirmed thrombotic events&quot;, &quot;changes in INR values&quot; and &quot;cost effectiveness&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why include all bleeding, and how is this endpoint defined ? Previous studies of both&#xD;
      antithrombotic treatment and the treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy have used only&#xD;
      major hemorrhage as the measure of bleeding. In those studies, &quot;major hemorrhage&quot; has been&#xD;
      chosen as the primary measure because it is both detected and independently adjudicated more&#xD;
      easily than &quot;all hemorrhage&quot;. In addition, in most such studies of antithrombotic therapy,&#xD;
      patients with acute thrombosis (or those at high risk of acute thrombosis) are enrolled. In&#xD;
      the setting of acute thrombosis it is likely that physicians and patients are willing to&#xD;
      tolerate minor bleeding as one of the &quot;unavoidable&quot; complications of antithrombotic therapy.&#xD;
      Neither patients nor physicians would be willing to stop an effective treatment for acute,&#xD;
      life threatening thrombosis because of minor bleeding. In the setting of warfarin maintenance&#xD;
      therapy, however, minor bleeding such as unanticipated bruising, epistaxis or excessive&#xD;
      menstrual blood loss in the setting of an excessively prolonged INR value is disconcerting,&#xD;
      disruptive, costly if patients seek medical attention and likely to reduce compliance. Since&#xD;
      we believe that reducing all bleeding complications (major and minor) is necessary to&#xD;
      maximize the utility of warfarin therapy, we have chosen to measure all bleeding as our&#xD;
      primary outcome measure of efficacy. We feel this is appropriate since the study intervention&#xD;
      is masked; thus although minor bleeding is subjective, patients should be unaware of their&#xD;
      treatment allocation and thus the treatment they receive will not influence their reporting&#xD;
      of clinical events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major Hemorrhage: Since we anticipate that many clinicians will wish to know the impact of&#xD;
      vitamin K on &quot;major bleeding&quot;, we will also compare the rates of all adjudication-confirmed&#xD;
      major bleeds between groups. All bleeding events will be submitted to the central&#xD;
      adjudication committee and major bleeding will be confirmed by standardized, masked central&#xD;
      adjudication (see appendix 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombotic Events: At each clinic visit and telephone follow-up signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      thrombotic events will be sought. If a thrombotic event is suspected, appropriate objective&#xD;
      documentation will be obtained and will be forwarded to the Central Adjudication Committee.&#xD;
      The committee will adjudicate these thrombotic events using validated, pre-specified criteria&#xD;
      (see appendix 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness: Details on the number and frequency of interventions, outcomes and their&#xD;
      associated morbidity will be collected. This material will form the basis for a subsequent&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness study. Given that vitamin K is very inexpensive (oral vitamin K costs less&#xD;
      than 5$ Canadian per dose in most jurisdictions) and the expense of bleeding is high&#xD;
      (previous cost effectiveness studies have estimated that an episode of major bleeding costs&#xD;
      more than 5000 $ Canadian per event (20)) it is very likely that the use of oral vitamin K&#xD;
      will be highly cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for ascertaining outcome events: Signs or symptoms of all (major and minor) bleeding and&#xD;
      thrombosis will be sought at each clinic visit or telephone call. If bleeding or thrombosis&#xD;
      is reported, all available objective documentation such as hospital records, transfusion&#xD;
      records or results of diagnostic or therapeutic investigations (such as endoscopy) will be&#xD;
      obtained. Minor bleeding will frequently not have led to medical evaluation; in cases where&#xD;
      minor bleeding is reported the specific setting, nature, duration and required actions will&#xD;
      be sought for each event reported by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of the sample size (INR 4.5 to 10.0): The estimated rate of all bleeding in&#xD;
      patients who present with excessive, warfarin-associated prolongation of the INR, treated&#xD;
      with simple warfarin withdrawal, is 8% over the ensuing 30 days (8). We believe that&#xD;
      clinicians would be willing to treat a minimum of 20 patients with oral vitamin K to prevent&#xD;
      one episode of bleeding, thus the &quot;minimally clinically important difference&quot; that we wish to&#xD;
      reliably detect is 5% (21;22). This reduction in the risk of bleeding (from 8% in those who&#xD;
      receive placebo to 3% in those who receive vitamin K) represents about a 60% risk reduction.&#xD;
      It is reasonable to expect that 1.25 mg of oral vitamin K will produce at least a 60%&#xD;
      reduction in the risk of bleeding based on the following assumptions: (a) The INR in the&#xD;
      placebo arm is likely to decline by about one INR point over the first 24 hours while the INR&#xD;
      in the vitamin K group is likely to decline by about 3.9 INR points. These declines are based&#xD;
      on the results achieved in our 3 published studies of oral vitamin K (10;12;13). (b) A 2.9&#xD;
      point reduction in the INR should be associated with a 6 fold reduction in the risk of&#xD;
      hemorrhage (based on the assumption that a 1 point increase in the INR doubles the risk of&#xD;
      bleeding (4-7)). (c) The 60 percent risk reduction is a conservative interpretation of the&#xD;
      effect of a 6 fold decrease in the risk of hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish our goal of reliably detecting a 5% reduction in the risk of hemorrhage we will&#xD;
      need to enrol 330 patients into each arm of the study to have 80% power with a two sided&#xD;
      alpha of 0.05. This sample size calculation is based on the following assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 4: Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      2N = 4(Zα + Z)2 * (1-p)/(pc-pi)2 where Zα = 1.96, Z = 0.84&#xD;
&#xD;
      pc is the proportion with success in the control group (no bleed) and is equal to 0.92 pi is&#xD;
      the proportion with success in the intervention group (no bleed) and is equal to 0.97&#xD;
&#xD;
      and p = (pi + pc)/2&#xD;
&#xD;
      thus the total sample size is 652&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accommodate for anticipated losses to follow up (which have been minimal in our previous&#xD;
      studies) we will increase the sample size by 5% (to 690 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination (cohort study): The sample size for the cohort study is entirely&#xD;
      one of convenience; since there is no good quality data on the efficacy of oral vitamin K in&#xD;
      patients with INR values of more than 10.0 we will simply enrol and follow such patients as&#xD;
      they become available. Data derived from this cohort might then be used as the basis for&#xD;
      future investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accounting for non-compliance: The sample size has not been adjusted to reflect&#xD;
      non-compliance. It is unlikely that patients will be non-compliant with a single dose of&#xD;
      study drug administered at the time of randomization. For example, in our previous studies&#xD;
      none of the 134 patients receiving oral vitamin K have been non-compliant or lost to&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accounting for &quot;loss to follow-up&quot;: We have not previously had patients lost to follow-up in&#xD;
      our vitamin K studies, and we anticipate the rate in this study will be negligible (i.e. less&#xD;
      than 5%). The low rate of loss to follow-up is due, in large part, to the fact that (a)&#xD;
      patients will have only 2 clinic visits over the course of the study (day 1 and 14) and (b)&#xD;
      all other follow-up will be performed over the telephone, Further, patients receiving&#xD;
      warfarin are aware of the need for monitoring of their warfarin and thus accept the need for&#xD;
      periodic medical and laboratory re-assessments. This increases the likelihood that they will&#xD;
      be willing and able to participate in study follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coordination of the study: The study will be coordinated by the Thromboembolism Research Unit&#xD;
      at St Joseph's Hospital in Hamilton, Ontario. Data submission to the coordinating centre will&#xD;
      occur over a secure, web-based database system, which will be supplemented by paper copies of&#xD;
      the case report forms which will be maintained at each clinical centre. Details of the&#xD;
      web-based data-entry system are currently being determined; a revised study manual with full&#xD;
      data entry details will be included in the subsequent versions of this study manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be coordinated by a professional data coordinator, who is based at St Joseph's&#xD;
      hospital. Data integrity will be ensured by manually reviewing the electronic database for 5%&#xD;
      of submitted records, and comparing these with copies of the paper CRFs from the relevant&#xD;
      centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization sequence for all patients will be generated at the coordinating centre; the&#xD;
      coordinator will remain masked to treatment allocation at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provision of study drug: There is no oral form of vitamin K currently marketed in Canada,&#xD;
      thus our previous investigations have used the intravenous formulation administered by mouth.&#xD;
      Demonstration that a tablet form is effective would further simplify (and encourage) the use&#xD;
      of oral vitamin K. A 5 mg vitamin K tablet is available in both Canada and the United States&#xD;
      (in Canada the drug is available only after Health Canada approval). For this study, a supply&#xD;
      of the 5 mg vitamin K tablets will be obtained from Merck Frosst Incorporated. Study&#xD;
      pharmacies will compound this drug to produce matching capsules containing either lactose or&#xD;
      lactose and 1.25 mg of vitamin K. This pharmacy will also provide drug packaging and will be&#xD;
      responsible for preparing study drug kits which consist of sequentially numbered drug&#xD;
      supplies for each clinical centre (following a randomization list provided by the study&#xD;
      coordinating centre) and a supply of labeled 1.25 mg capsules (for the cohort study). These&#xD;
      supplies will then be distributed, by the coordinating centre to each participating clinical&#xD;
      centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of the participating investigators: Dr Mark Crowther is the principal applicant and will&#xD;
      be primarily responsible for all aspects of the study. Drs Ageno and Garcia, in addition to&#xD;
      fulfilling the roles of co-investigators, will coordinate recruitment and management of&#xD;
      centres in Italy, and the United States, respectively. Drs Crowther, Ageno and Garcia will&#xD;
      comprise the executive steering committee which will meet by teleconference at least monthly&#xD;
      to discuss specific trial implementation and management issues. The steering committee will&#xD;
      consist of the members of the executive steering committee, as well as the Canadian&#xD;
      participating investigators (Drs Blostein, Anderson, Wells, Kahn, Ginsberg, Kovacs, Kearon&#xD;
      and Selby) and Dr Witt from the United States. Telephone Steering Committee meetings will&#xD;
      occur six monthly, or more frequently as determined by the Principal Investigator. The&#xD;
      Steering Committee is responsible for the overall conduct of the study, and will act on the&#xD;
      recommendations of the study's subcommittees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating centres represented by letters of support on this grant include; Duke&#xD;
      University (Dr Ortel); University of Washington (Dr Wittkowsky); University of Massachusetts&#xD;
      (Dr Becker); IRCCS Maggiore Hospital of Milano (Dr Moia); Centro Emostasi e Trombosi Reggio&#xD;
      Emilia (Dr Silingardi); Instituti Ospitalieri di Cremona (Dr Testa and Alatri); Dr. Siragusa&#xD;
      (Policlinico Palermo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjudication committee: An Adjudication Committee of three thromboembolism experts not&#xD;
      otherwise involved in this study will be convened.All reported hemorrhagic and thrombotic&#xD;
      events will be reviewed by this committee, which will use all available source documentation&#xD;
      to adjudicate clinical events. This committee will be convened when complete data are&#xD;
      available on the first 20 bleeds or clots, and subsequently with each multiple of 20 events.&#xD;
      To ensure uniformity, all episodes of hemorrhage will be adjudicated according to&#xD;
      pre-specified criteria. The committee will report the results of their adjudication to the&#xD;
      Coordinating Centre for inclusion in the study database. Although adjudication of all events&#xD;
      may seem excessive it is possible that adjudication could &quot;upgrade&quot; events deemed minor by&#xD;
      the site investigator, highlighting the need for central review of all bleeding events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DSMB: An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be constituted. The committee&#xD;
      will consist of 2 experts who are not otherwise involved in the study. Proposed members are&#xD;
      Dr Martin O'Donnell (Thromboembolism expert, Henderson Hospital, Hamilton, Ontario) and Dr&#xD;
      William Geerts (Thromboembolism expert, Sunnybrook Hospital, Toronto, Ontario). The number of&#xD;
      outcome events will be recorded for the cohort study and the randomized trial separately. The&#xD;
      DSMB will be convened when a total of 20 (or multiples thereof) adjudication-confirmed major&#xD;
      bleeds or thrombi have occurred in either of the randomized trial or the cohort study. While&#xD;
      remaining masked to treatment allocation, the DSMB will review the source material describing&#xD;
      the events. If the DSMB is concerned about the type or number of events, they will have the&#xD;
      right to ask the steering committee to allow them to contact the study statistician and have&#xD;
      an unblinded, unplanned, interim analysis for safety performed. Only experienced&#xD;
      thromboembolism experts have been invited onto this committee, to ensure that such an interim&#xD;
      analysis is not performed in response to less significant observations. If the interim&#xD;
      analysis suggests that there is a significant safety concern (for example, if there is&#xD;
      evidence of excess major bleeding or thrombotic events, as indicated by a P value of less&#xD;
      than 0.05) the DSMB will have the right to recommend to the Steering Committee that the study&#xD;
      be closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis (Randomized trial): The primary analysis will be a simple comparison of the&#xD;
      proportion of patients in the placebo and vitamin K arm with adjudication-confirmed bleeding.&#xD;
      The proportion in each group will be compared using a Chi square or Fisher's exact test, as&#xD;
      dictated by the number of events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analysis: The proportion of patients in each group with major hemorrhage,&#xD;
      thrombosis and a composite of all adverse outcomes (thromboembolism, death and major&#xD;
      hemorrhage) will be performed using a Chi square or Fisher's exact technique, as indicated. A&#xD;
      regression analysis will be performed to determine if baseline variables including the&#xD;
      receipt of drug or placebo, demographic characteristics, degree of prolongation of the&#xD;
      international normalized ratio or other baseline variables predict adverse events. Finally,&#xD;
      the mean INR values in the two groups will be compared using ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis (cohort study): The change in the INR, and the number of bleeds and clots&#xD;
      will be presented graphically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency of analyses (Randomized trial): Three interim analyses are planned. The first will&#xD;
      occur after 200 patients have been enrolled. In this analysis, the statistician will not be&#xD;
      aware of treatment allocation; the overall rate of bleeding for the entire population will be&#xD;
      computed. Assuming balanced allocation, we anticipate the event rate will be 5.7 percent. If&#xD;
      the observed rate of hemorrhage is more than 2.5 percent above or below 5.7 percent, a&#xD;
      revised sample size will be calculated. If the revised sample size suggests an unfeasibly&#xD;
      large study (defined by the need for more than 500 patients per arm), the statistician will&#xD;
      determine whether limiting enrollment to patients with INR values of more than 6.0 will&#xD;
      enrich the event rate sufficiently to allow completion of the study with less than 500&#xD;
      patients per arm. In these analyses, blinding to treatment allocation will be maintained and&#xD;
      the sample size will be revised assuming a 60 percent reduction in the risk of bleeding in&#xD;
      the vitamin K arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second and third interim analyses will be performed after 350 and 500 patients have been&#xD;
      enrolled. If the sample size is adjusted at the first interim analysis, the second and third&#xD;
      analyses will be performed after 60% and 75%, respectively, of the required sample size is&#xD;
      enrolled. For these analyses, the study statistician will be unblinded to treatment&#xD;
      allocation and the proportion of patients suffering adjudication confirmed major hemorrhage&#xD;
      will be compared between the two groups. If there is a treatment advantage as measured by a&#xD;
      two-tailed Chi-square or Fisher's exact test with a P value of less than 0.001 the&#xD;
      statistician will recommend to the study Steering Committee that the study be stopped. Any&#xD;
      other result will result in a recommendation to continue this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency of analyses (Cohort study): No interim analyses are planned. The Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB, see below) will be instructed to monitor the frequency of hemorrhage&#xD;
      in this group. If the upper limit of the 95% CI about the risk of hemorrhage exceeds 5% after&#xD;
      a minimum of 20 patients have completed the 90 day outcome ascertainment, the DSMB will&#xD;
      notify the Steering Committee that the risk of hemorrhage in the cohort study is excessive.&#xD;
      The steering committee will then decide whether this arm of the study should be discontinued&#xD;
      or the intervention modified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned subgroup analyses The response to vitamin K or placebo is measured in two ways in&#xD;
      this study. The first way is by observing the number of clinical events (thrombosis and&#xD;
      hemorrhage) and the second is by observing changes in the INR values between the day of study&#xD;
      drug and the next day. The number of clinical events in the study is likely to be relatively&#xD;
      low, reducing the power of subgroup analyses to determine if baseline variables such as the&#xD;
      degree of prolongation of the INR influence the response to oral vitamin K. However, since&#xD;
      changes in the INR value will occur in all patients and since the INR is a continuous&#xD;
      variable, a subgroup analysis which examines the influence of baseline variables (such as the&#xD;
      degree of prolongation of the INR) on the response to vitamin K will have more power if&#xD;
      performed with the change in the INR value as the dependant variable. This analysis will&#xD;
      include: baseline demographic variables (such as gender, weight, presence of cancer, and&#xD;
      age), the degree of prolongation of the INR, baseline maintenance warfarin dose and the&#xD;
      indication for warfarin therapy. The ability of these variables to predict changes in the INR&#xD;
      in both the vitamin K and placebo groups will be calculated. The ultimate goal of this line&#xD;
      of investigations is to generate hypotheses about those factors (if any) that influence the&#xD;
      response to vitamin K. These hypotheses could be tested in future studies within which the&#xD;
      dose of vitamin K is modified based on the presence or absence of these risk factors.&#xD;
