      The purpose of this study is to better understand disparities in insulin dosing, hemoglobin&#xD;
      A1c, and self-reported patient self-care behaviors among non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, and&#xD;
      African American veterans with type 2 diabetes receiving VA care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Minority populations are disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (T2DM), likely due to an interaction of genetic and environmental risk factors. Several&#xD;
      studies have documented a higher prevalence of insulin resistance, disparities in quality of&#xD;
      care, and more microvascular and macrovascular complications in minority groups. Recent&#xD;
      evidence by our research group indicates that insulin-using minority veterans have poorer&#xD;
      glycemic control (as measured by HbA1c) and receive lower doses of insulin than do&#xD;
      non-Hispanic white patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The goal of this mixed methods descriptive, cross-sectional study is to elucidate&#xD;
      the patient, provider and interactive patient/provider reasons for this discrepancy, to&#xD;
      determine and validate these findings in a much larger sample, and to use what is discovered&#xD;
      to develop strategies to remedy provider and patient behaviors in order to optimize health&#xD;
      outcomes. The objective of this mixed method study is to unpack provider decision-making and&#xD;
      patient self-care behaviors responsible for ethnic and racial variation in the use of insulin&#xD;
      in veterans with T2DM receiving VA care, while adjusting for important covariates and&#xD;
      confounders. Aim 1: Perform a qualitative provider Nominal Group Technique designed to&#xD;
      elucidate insulin prescribing decision-making behaviors, and possible reasons for&#xD;
      racial/ethnic variation in insulin use. Aim 2: Perform a qualitative content analysis of&#xD;
      patient focus group data on insulin-using veterans in VA care across African American,&#xD;
      Hispanic and non-Hispanic White (NHW) contrasts. Psychosocial determinants of self-care,&#xD;
      diabetes care preferences, patient/provider relationship issues, and possible reasons for&#xD;
      racial/ethnic variation in insulin use will be explored. Aim 3: Construct a) patient, and b)&#xD;
      provider questionnaires reflective of qualitative focus group data, nominal group process and&#xD;
      extant evidence-base findings, and Aim 4: Administer surveys to a) a racially/ethnically&#xD;
      diverse random sample of insulin-using diabetic veterans receiving care within VISN 18, and&#xD;
      b) their assigned primary care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a mixed methods descriptive, cross-sectional study using 1) qualitative&#xD;
      nominal group technique data (from providers), focus group data (from patients) and 2)&#xD;
      provider and nested patient survey data. The investigators will use qualitative methods to&#xD;
      explicate and deconstruct the etiologic associations and management strategies of&#xD;
      insulin-using patients and their providers using focus group content analytical methods.&#xD;
      Next, the investigators will use the extant evidence from the evidence-base, focus group data&#xD;
      and conventional survey methods to construct two surveys-one targeted to providers and&#xD;
      another to survey a randomly selected population of representative veterans nested within&#xD;
      their providers VA care, following the recommendations of Hughes, O'Brien and Dillman.&#xD;
