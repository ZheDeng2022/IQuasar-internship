  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erythropoietin (EPO) is a naturally occuring hormone which regulates the body's response to&#xD;
      lack of oxygen and controls the number of red cells in the blood. Recent studies in animals&#xD;
      have shown that EPO has protective effects when organs such as the heart and brain are&#xD;
      injured by lack of oxygen due to reduced blood supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We wish to test the idea that giving a patient, who is having a heart attack, an injection of&#xD;
      EPO will reduce the size of the heart attack.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We wish to perform a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to examine&#xD;
      the effects of EPO given at the time of primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (MI) on myocardial infarct size. In this trial the null hypothesis is that there is no effect&#xD;
      of EPO on myocardial infarct size, the alternative hypothesis is that EPO reduces myocardial&#xD;
      infarct size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      124 subjects with acute ST-elevation MI who fulfil the inclusion/exclusion criteria and give&#xD;
      informed consent to participate in the study will be recruited from patients referred to the&#xD;
      cardiac catheterisation laboratories at the Hammersmith Hospital and King's College Hospital.&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo primary percutaneous coronary angioplasty (primary PCI) according to&#xD;
      standard clinical protocols. Subjects will be randomised to either placebo or EPO at the time&#xD;
      of primary PCI. EPO will be given as a bolus of 12ml containing 33,000U over 30 mins via a&#xD;
      peripheral vein followed by an infusion of 24ml containing 67,000 U over 12 hours. Placebo&#xD;
      will be identical to EPO without the active ingredient. After the PCI subjects will receive&#xD;
      standard care on the coronary care unit. An additional 20ml of blood will be taken each day&#xD;
      at the time of routine clinical venesection for storage and subjects will have gadolinium&#xD;
      enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) performed before discharge to evaluate&#xD;
      infarct size. Follow-up will be performed at 30 days (clinical, ECG and 20ml blood sample)&#xD;
      and at 90 days (clinical, ECG and CMR scan and blood sample). The study will end at 90 days&#xD;
      and patients will continue with standard clinical care under the direction of a consultant&#xD;
      cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMR will be performed in the Robert Steiner MR Unit/Imaging Department, Hammersmith Hospital&#xD;
      using a 1.5 tesla scanner according to standard protocols. Each scan will last about 1h and&#xD;
      information will be collected on tissue characteristics, left ventricular function, wall&#xD;
      motion abnormalities, myocardial perfusion. Myocardial infarcts will be detected by late&#xD;
      contrast gadolinium enhancement. Gadolinium will be used at doses up to 0.2mmol/kg and is&#xD;
      safe with an incidence of mild and transient side effects including headache and nausea of&#xD;
      ~1%. Scans will be performed with under continuous ECG monitoring with a doctor and at least&#xD;
      1 other person present. Resuscitation facilities will be available at all times and the MRI&#xD;
      facility is covered by an experienced 24 hour a day cardiac arrest team.&#xD;
