  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center open label, randomized phase-3 study with stratification according to&#xD;
      diagnosis and baseline serum-EPO level. The correction of mild or moderate anemia and the&#xD;
      effect on iron kinetics by the rHuEPO treatment with or without intravenous iron&#xD;
      supplementation in anemic patients with LPD not receiving antineoplastic therapy will be&#xD;
      studied. The study will be performed according to the ICH-GCP guidelines. In order to be&#xD;
      eligible, the patient must consent in writing that he/she agrees to participate in the study.&#xD;
      The patient recruitment period is estimated to be no longer than 18 months.&#xD;

      In this multi-center, randomized, open label phase-3 study, the correction of mild or&#xD;
      moderate anemia and the effect on iron kinetics by rHuEPO treatment, with or without&#xD;
      intravenous iron treatment, in patients with LPD not receiving antineoplastic therapy will be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LENGTH OF STUDY 16 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF CENTERS 15&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF SUBJECTS 66&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATIFICATION 1. According to diagnosis; CLL and indolent NHL vs. MM. 2. According to level&#xD;
      of S-epo &gt; 100 IU/L vs £ 100 IU/L at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT The patients will be randomized to receive 30 000 IU Neorecormon â (epoetin beta)&#xD;
      s.c. once / week for 16 consecutive weeks +/- 100mg/week of Venofer â (iron sucrose) from&#xD;
      week 0 to 6, followed by one 100mg dose every 2 week from weeks 8 until 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the increase in Hb concentration is less than 10g/L from baseline (week 0) until week 4&#xD;
      weeks, the dose of epoetin beta will be increased to 60 000 IU weekly from week 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the Hb concentration exceeds 140 g/L, the epoetin beta therapy will be suspended. The&#xD;
      treatment will be resumed once the Hb concentration falls below 130 g/L. This resumed dose&#xD;
      will be 75% of the previous dose (e.g. if the previous dose was 30 000 IU before suspension,&#xD;
      the continued dose should be 22 500 IU. If the dose was 60 000 IU before suspension, the dose&#xD;
      should be 45 000 IU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the level of S-ferritin reaches &gt;1000 ug/L iron sucrose should be suspended until the&#xD;
      S-ferritin level falls below 500 ug/L.&#xD;
