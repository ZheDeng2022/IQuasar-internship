      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a&#xD;
      combination therapy interferon beta-1a(Avonex) plus simvastatin (Zocor) vs. interferon&#xD;
      beta-1a plus placebo in patients with clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of Multiple&#xD;
      Sclerosis.&#xD;

      Interferon beta-1a (IFNB-1a), a FDA approved therapy for relapsing-remitting (RR) MS has&#xD;
      several mechanisms of action. It lowers proinflammatory cytokine production and inhibits&#xD;
      antigen presentation by class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. It also&#xD;
      reduces metalloproteinase activity, which all lead to decreased migration of T-lymphocytes&#xD;
      into the central nervous system (CNS), and subsequent inhibition of inflammatory lesion&#xD;
      formation. We propose that combination therapy during early stages of the disease with second&#xD;
      immunomodulatory agent that targets different steps in the pathogenesis of the disease may&#xD;
      add to the effectiveness of IFNB-1a. IFNB-1a administered intramuscularly at 30 mg per week&#xD;
      is particularly suitable for combination therapy due to its proven efficacy in Clinically&#xD;
      Isolated Syndrome (CIS),favorable safety profile and low frequency of neutralizing antibodies&#xD;
      (NABs) against IFNB-1a in comparison to other forms of IFNB-1a. Recent studies have reported&#xD;
      a significant anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of statins, cholesterol-lowering&#xD;
      agents. Statins disrupt cellular membrane lipid rafts, which inhibit the clustering of T-cell&#xD;
      receptor (TCR), co-stimulatory, and adhesion molecules, required for optimal T-cell&#xD;
      activation. Along with inhibiting T-cell activation, statins decrease IFNB inducible MHC&#xD;
      class II expression, suppressing an effective antigen presentation. They block migration of&#xD;
      activated mononuclear cells from peripheral circulation into the CNS by blocking LFA-1&#xD;
      adhesion molecule and by reducing metalloproteinase type 9 secretion. While their&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects at tolerable oral doses may not justify their use as monotherapy&#xD;
      for RR MS, their pleiotropic mechanisms of action showed synergistic effects with IFNB-1a in&#xD;
      studies in vitro. We propose that simvastatin may enhance the immunomodulatory effects of&#xD;
      INFB-1a in patients with CIS suggestive of MS and that this combination may even more&#xD;
      effectively prevent further disease activity if administered early in the course of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
