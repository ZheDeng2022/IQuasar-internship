  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms whereby lung function is decreased in&#xD;
      COPD. The hypothesis is that in diseases such as COPD, inflammatory cells including&#xD;
      neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes migrate to the lung and release either more or&#xD;
      different types of inflammatory mediators and/or destructive enzymes compared to subjects&#xD;
      without COPD. We aim to investigate these separate cell types in the blood of subjects with&#xD;
      COPD and identify which genes are more highly expressed when compared to cells obtained from&#xD;
      patients without COPD. We will also investigate the lung macrophages from these subjects to&#xD;
      identify whether the same or different genes are expressed in these cells. We will isolate&#xD;
      different leukocyte populations from the blood and extract ribonucleic acid (RNA) from these&#xD;
      samples. The type and quantity of RNA in these samples is a reflection of the specific genes&#xD;
      expressed in these cells. This RNA will be sent to Gene Logic and this company will test&#xD;
      these samples to identify which genes have been expressed. Similar experiments will be&#xD;
      performed using macrophages obtained following bronchoalveolar lavage of these subjects. We&#xD;
      would aim to examine the responses of leukocytes from three groups of subjects, namely (i)&#xD;
      non-smoking controls (ii) smokers without clinical or histological signs of COPD and (iii)&#xD;
      smokers with COPD. The isolated leukocytes will either be immediately solubilized in&#xD;
      solutions to purify RNA or we will then use these isolated cells in vitro and following&#xD;
      stimulation investigate whether different genes are expressed or at a differential rate in&#xD;
      the disease state. The objective is to identify which genes are specifically expressed in&#xD;
      patients with COPD with a view to identify novel targets for drug therapy. We will examine&#xD;
      both leukocytes derived from peripheral blood and macrophages obtained from bronchoalveolar&#xD;
      lavage with the aim to determine whether differences attributable to disease can be&#xD;
      identified in both circulating cells and those at the site of disease. This is a preliminary&#xD;
      study to determine the profile of inflammatory mediator expression from leukocytes and as&#xD;
      such power calculations to determine the number of subjects is not appropriate.&#xD;

      This study involves a comparison of the inflammatory responses of leukocytes derived from 3&#xD;
      separate subject groups. The aim of the study is to compare the responses of leukocytes from&#xD;
      patients with COPD with subjects that smoke and healthy non-smokers. One part of the study&#xD;
      will involve isolation of different leukocyte populations from blood from each of the subject&#xD;
      groups. In a second part of the study, we will examine the expression of inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators in leukocytes derived from bronchoalveolar lavage samples from patients with COPD,&#xD;
      smokers without COPD and healthy non-smokers. In subjects that are willing to participate, we&#xD;
      will compare blood derived leukocytes and cells derived from those undergoing BAL, although&#xD;
      not every subject will provide both blood and BAL samples. The isolated leukocytes (both from&#xD;
      blood and BAL) will be used for in vitro experiments to determine the differences in gene&#xD;
      expression in inflammatory cells from patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of interventions to subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical History and Physical Examination A full medical history and physical examination&#xD;
           (including height and weight) will be performed on the initial screening visit, in&#xD;
           addition to that recorded in the clinical case notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Respiratory Assessments Forced Expiratory Volume per second (FEVI) will be measured&#xD;
           using a dry wedge spirometer (Vitalograph, Buckingham, UK) and expressed as a percent of&#xD;
           predicted value. Subjects will be trained in the use of the apparatus before beginning&#xD;
           the study. The baseline value at each visit will be measured after at least fifteen&#xD;
           minutes of quiet rest, and will be taken as the highest of three readings made at&#xD;
           one-minute intervals. Single readings only will be taken at other times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Endoscopic Bronchoscopy An operator approved by the Royal Brompton Ethics Committee will&#xD;
           perform all bronchoscopies. The bronchoscopist that will perform these procedures is Dr&#xD;
           Borja Cosio. Subjects will attend the bronchoscopy suite at 8.30 am after having fasted&#xD;
           from midnight. Subjects will have pre-treatment with atropine (0.6 mg iv) and midazolam&#xD;
           (5-10 mg iv). Oxygen (3 l/min) will be administered via nasal prongs throughout the&#xD;
           procedure and oxygen saturation monitored with a digital oximeter. Using local&#xD;
           anaesthesia with lidocaine (4%) to the upper airways and larynx, a fibreoptic&#xD;
           bronchoscope (Olympus BF10 Key-Med) will be passed through the nasal passages into the&#xD;
           trachea. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be performed from the right middle lobe using&#xD;
           warmed 0.9% NaCl with 4 successive aliquots of 60 ml. This is well-tolerated in subjects&#xD;
           with COPD. Patients may experience pharyngeal irritation following the procedure; there&#xD;
           is a 5% chance of fever following the procedure. Subjects undergoing bronchoscopy for&#xD;
           clinical reasons will also be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Venous Blood Sampling 60 ml of blood will be taken by venopuncture.&#xD;
