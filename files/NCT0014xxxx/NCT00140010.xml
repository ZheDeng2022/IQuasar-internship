      ABSTRACT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed ischemic deficits (DID) and strokes caused by low cerebral blood flow (CBF) are major&#xD;
      sources of poor outcome following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). DID are often&#xD;
      accompanied by vasospasm and abnormalities in cerebrovascular autoregulation, an important&#xD;
      reflex involved in the defense against low CBF. Assessment of vasospasm and impaired&#xD;
      autoregulation can be conveniently measured non-invasively by use of transcranial Doppler&#xD;
      (TCD) and the transient hyperaemic response test (THRT). Vasospasm and abnormalities in the&#xD;
      THRT can predict those patients who are at risk of developing DID. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators wish to explore the neuroprotective and angiogenic effects of systemic&#xD;
      erythropoietin (EPO) therapy on vasospasm and autoregulation following SAH, and examine&#xD;
      whether any improvements translate into reduced incidences of DID and poor outcome. Eighty&#xD;
      patients with SAH will be recruited over one year to receive three doses in the first week of&#xD;
      either intravenous epoetin beta 30000 IU or placebo (0.9% saline) 50 ml/30 min as part of a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The investigators propose daily TCD&#xD;
      assessment for detecting vasospasm and abnormal autoregulation. Outcome measures will examine&#xD;
      the influence of EPO therapy on the incidence, severity, and duration of vasospasm, abnormal&#xD;
      autoregulation, and DID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the&#xD;
      potentially beneficial effects of systemic recombinant human erythropoietin therapy (Epoetin&#xD;
      beta, NeoRecormon®, Roche, 30000IU/50 ml/30 min, three times in the first week) on cerebral&#xD;
      autoregulation and incidence of delayed ischemic deficits (DID) following aneurysmal&#xD;
      subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS Systemic recombinant human erythropoietin therapy can be used safely following SAH&#xD;
      to ameliorate vasospasm, improve cerebral autoregulation, reduce DID, and facilitate&#xD;
      neurological recovery.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Delayed ischaemia deficits in subarachnoid haemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
           Seven thousand patients suffer SAH each year within the UK with young adults (&lt;55 years)&#xD;
           being equally affected. Cerebral vasospasm and related cerebral ischemia are the major&#xD;
           causes of delayed morbidity and mortality in patients who survive the initial SAH&#xD;
           episode. Previous studies have revealed that immediate low cerebral blood flow (CBF)&#xD;
           accompanies SAH, particularly in those in coma. However, for better grade patients the&#xD;
           low CBF is often delayed and associated with cerebral vasospasm [Knuckey 1985].&#xD;
           Vasospasm often precedes the onset of DID which commonly occurs in the 2nd week after&#xD;
           SAH [Knuckey 1985]. Autoregulation is the most accomplished reflex mechanism and&#xD;
           reflects an intrinsic ability of the cerebral vessels to dilate in an attempt to&#xD;
           maintain constant CBF in the face of poor cerebral perfusion. Following SAH, impairment&#xD;
           of autoregulation affects prognosis [Lam 2000]. Indeed, daily assessment of&#xD;
           autoregulation can help to identify patients at high risk of clinical deterioration&#xD;
           [Smielewski 1997].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Autoregulation can be conveniently measured non-invasively from the bedside using&#xD;
           transcranial Doppler (TCD). Direct measures of middle cerebral artery flow velocities&#xD;
           (FV) are predictive of DID; elevated mean FV (&gt;120cms/sec) and increased ratio of mFV&#xD;
           between MCA and extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) (Lindegaard ratio &gt;3) being&#xD;
           associated with cerebral vasospasm and higher incidence of adverse events [Lindegaard&#xD;
           1988]. The rapid increase of FV with time is also predictive, as is the relationship&#xD;
           between FV and spontaneous changes in blood pressure (correlation index Mx) [Czosnyka&#xD;
           2000].&#xD;
&#xD;
           A more sophisticated measure of abnormal cerebrovascular haemodynamics involves the&#xD;
           transient hyperaemic response test (THRT) [Giller 1991]. This is used routinely in our&#xD;
           department where we have demonstrated a relationship between an abnormal THRT and&#xD;
           clinical outcome following SAH [Lam 2000]. The THRT assesses the FV response to a manual&#xD;
           carotid compression (Figure 1) and can be repeated within a few minutes providing a&#xD;
           reliable and readily accessible method for assessing autoregulation. When THRT is used&#xD;
           for day-to-day assessments for the same patient, this test can provide a valuable&#xD;
           monitor of sequential changes in autoregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Autoregulation after SAH&#xD;
&#xD;
           Autoregulation is often impaired after SAH, even in patients presenting in good clinical&#xD;
           grade [Voldby 1985]. An abnormal THRT response commonly develops either early during&#xD;
           days 0 to 3 (primary), or late around days 7 to 14 (secondary) after the initial bleed.&#xD;
           Primary abnormalities in THRT are far more common in poor grade patients, while&#xD;
           secondary abnormalities occur more regularly in the initially good grade patients who&#xD;
           later develop signs of DID with clinical deterioration [Ratsep 2002]. Routine and daily&#xD;
           assessment of autoregulation with TCD helps to identify patients at higher risk for DID.&#xD;
           This delay in the evolution of an abnormal autoregulation response in better grade&#xD;
           patients presents an opportunity to introduce early therapeutic strategies designed to&#xD;
           offset the potentially harmful effects. Indeed, routine use of plasma expansion is&#xD;
           already adopted with this aim in mind [Origitano 1990].&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Therapeutic opportunity; why recombinant human erythropoietin?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently attention has been focused on potential therapeutic roles for endogenous brain&#xD;
      proteins possessing neuroprotective properties. This neuroprotective approach of using&#xD;
      erythropoietin (EPO) is aimed at protecting potentially viable brain tissue from apoptosis&#xD;
      [Ehrenreich 2002]. EPO, a 34-kDa hydrophobic sialoglycoprotein, is responsible for the&#xD;
      survival, proliferation, and differentiation of committed erythroid progenitor cells. It is&#xD;
      produced by foetal liver and adult kidney, which is accelerated during hypoxia [Lacombe&#xD;
      1999]. Because there is no pre-formed EPO storage, therefore, the control of EPO gene&#xD;
      transcription involves complex interactions with hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a&#xD;
      transcription factor which is activated during hypoxia, hypoglycaemia, and seizures [Lacombe&#xD;
      1999].&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPO receptor (EPO-R), like other members of the haematopoietic receptor family, does not&#xD;
      possess an endogenous tyrosine kinase activity. However, its close association with Jak2&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase can induce a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation on a number of proteins [Lacombe&#xD;
      1999]. Hypoxia can induce an increased EPO-R expression, which in turn causes increased&#xD;
      sensitivity to EPO [Chin 2000].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both EPO and EPO-R are ubiquitously distributed in neural tissues [Digicaylioglu 1995].&#xD;
      Except larger vessels, EPO-R is abundantly distributed in astrocytes, neurons, and cerebral&#xD;
      capillary endothelia [Marti 1996, Yamaji 1996, Bernaudin 1999, Brines 2000].&#xD;
      Immunohistochemistry shows that these distributions of EPO-R are consistent with the&#xD;
      anatomical location of blood-brain barrier (BBB) [Brines 2000]. Such a condensed distribution&#xD;
      of EPO-R within and surrounding the cerebral capillaries implies that a small amount of EPO&#xD;
      is sufficient to mediate physiological function in the central nervous system [Chin 2000].&#xD;
      The increased production of EPO in response to hypoxia and anemia by astrocytes and neurons&#xD;
      corresponds to that which occurs in kidney and liver [Masuda 1994]. Thus, during hypoxia, EPO&#xD;
      acts directly on cerebral capillary endothelial cells as an angiogenic factor through a&#xD;
      paracrine mechanism from the astrocytes and an endocrine mechanism from the kidney&#xD;
      [Digicaylioglu 1995].&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPO protects nervous tissue under any conditions characterised by a relative deficiency of&#xD;
      ATP [Brine 2000]. This neuroprotective effect is achieved by several mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EPO can induce expression of several glycolytic enzymes, which re-directs energy&#xD;
           metabolism toward favouring survival during oxygen deprivation [Digicaylioglu 1995].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During cerebral ischemia, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated glutamate&#xD;
           toxicity is the major cause of neuron death [Morishita 1997]. Glutamate toxicity is in&#xD;
           part mediated by nitric oxide (NO). EPO up-regulates the expression of antioxidant&#xD;
           enzymes on a transcriptional level in vascular smooth muscle cells [Kusano 1999], and&#xD;
           can potentially protect neurons from NO-generating agents [Sakanaka 1998]. Furthermore,&#xD;
           EPO can suppress the increase in Ca2+ concentration induced by glutamate and the nitric&#xD;
           oxide (NO)-induced apoptosis [Morishita 1997].&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPO has been shown to provide neurotrophic [Konishi 1993] and angiogenic effects [Yamaji&#xD;
      1996], and it has the potential for neural regeneration [Siren 2001]. These effects are&#xD;
      dose-dependent and unrelated to the nerve growth factor (NGF) [Konoshi Y 1993]. The&#xD;
      distributions of EPO and EPO-R correspond to the sequence of histopathological changes of&#xD;
      cerebral ischemia/infarction. In acute hypoxia (cardiac arrest), strong immunoreactivity of&#xD;
      EPO can be found in vascular endothelium, while the EPOR is expressed strongly in neurons&#xD;
      [Siren 2001]. After cerebral ischemia, EPO plays an important role in angiogenesis and glial&#xD;
      reaction. EPO immunoreactivity appears in the endothelium, intravascular inflammatory cells&#xD;
      and neurons of the penumbra. Also EPO-R is expressed in neurons, astrocytes and endothelial&#xD;
      cells [Bernaudin 1999, Siren 2001]. Because the expression of EPO-R precedes the&#xD;
      up-regulation of EPO synthesis [Bernaudin 1999], the sensitivity to EPO increases [Chin&#xD;
      2000]. In contrast, these changes are not detectable in non-ischemic cortex [Bernaudin 1999],&#xD;
      indicating an increased potential for EPO to act where neurons are at risk [Siren 2001]. By&#xD;
      protecting endothelial cells from apoptosis, EPO can increase cerebral blood flow, improve&#xD;
      microcirculation of the penumbra, and improve tissue oxygenation by angiogenesis, thus&#xD;
      significantly reduce the infarct volume [Bernaudin 1999, Siren 2001]. This angiogenesis&#xD;
      corresponds to the finding that under hypoxic conditions such as exposure to high altitudes,&#xD;
      the brain increases the mean microvascular density [Lamanna JC 1992]. In old infarcts, EPO&#xD;
      and EPO-R are strongly expressed in reactive astrocytes. Thus the EPO system may participate&#xD;
      in the repair process [Siren 2001]. The persistent up-regulation of EPO production by&#xD;
      astrocytes after stroke also provides rapidly available sources of EPO to make neurons more&#xD;
      tolerate ischemia [Siren 2001]. These endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms are insufficient&#xD;
      to cope with acute injuries, as severe ischemic insult can exhaust the EPO/EPO-R&#xD;
      neuroprotective capacity of the brain or the latency of de novo synthesis is too long.&#xD;
      Clinical application of EPO should be administered rapidly to provide additional&#xD;
      neuroprotection [Brines 2000].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epoetin beta is a 165-aa glycoprotein manufactured by using recombinant DNA technology, which&#xD;
      contains the identical amino acid sequence of isolated human EPO and possesses the same&#xD;
      biological activity. It is similar to the endogenous EPO except for minor differences in the&#xD;
      pattern of 4 carbohydrate chains. [Brine 2000] The recombinant human EPO has been widely used&#xD;
      for treating anaemia associated with chronic renal insufficiency, HIV infection, cancer, and&#xD;
      surgery, and has an excellent safety record in wide clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Why 90,000 IU Epoetin beta?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy of epoetin beta for treating acute stroke (within 8 hours) in humans&#xD;
      have been confirmed in a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, which&#xD;
      uses high dose intravenous epoetin beta (3,3000 IU/50 ml/30min/day, three days, with a&#xD;
      cumulative dose 100,000IU) [Ehrenreich 2002]. No associated changes in blood pressure,&#xD;
      haematocrit, haemoglobin, and red blood cell count are found in this trial [Ehrenreich 2002].&#xD;
      Only the reticulocyte count increases 29.2 ±10.0% on the 4th day after the last dose of EPO&#xD;
      [Ehrenreich 2002]. This systemic administration of EPO also has led to a 60- to 100-fold&#xD;
      increase in CSF levels and does not require a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB)&#xD;
      [Ehrenreich 2002]. Patients who are treated with EPO have a lower and earlier surge of serum&#xD;
      S100 (secreted by reactive astrocytes and functional disturbances of membrane integrity of&#xD;
      brain cell membrane) and thereafter return to within the normal limits sooner than the&#xD;
      placebo [Ehrenreich 2002]. This earlier return of serum S100 towards the normal level implies&#xD;
      that the inflammatory processes and/or BBB integrity can be improved more rapidly by systemic&#xD;
      EPO therapy [Ehrenreich 2002]. The beneficial effects on stroke patients continue throughout&#xD;
      30 days, particularly for those with moderate to severe strokes [Ehrenreich 2002].&#xD;
&#xD;
      By activation of endothelial EPO receptors, the circulating EPO may appose inflammatory&#xD;
      pathways in cerebral arteries and attenuate vasospasm induced by SAH. In vivo studies have&#xD;
      found that systemic administration of EPO (i.p. 1000units/kg) immediately after SAH can&#xD;
      improve survival and motor functions [Buemi 2000]. The systemic delivery of EPO has the&#xD;
      advantage that it is universally available to the capillary endothelium in the whole brain,&#xD;
      in contrast to intraventricular injection, which is highly localized and not practical in&#xD;
      clinical settings [Brines 2000]. Because the concentration of EPO in CSF is independent of&#xD;
      the serum level and the extent of BBB disruption in patients suffering from aneurysmal SAH,&#xD;
      the EPO in CSF is predominantly produced by the brain in order to match its need [Springborg&#xD;
      2003]. Therefore, an early activation of endothelial EPO-R may be a potential therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy, which in fact has been proved by a reduction of S100 protein in CSF (a marker of&#xD;
      brain damage) and restoration of cerebral autoregulation (for at least 48 hours) after&#xD;
      systemic administration of recombinant human EPO [Springborg 2002]. Therefore, 90,000 Iuof&#xD;
      epoetin beta will be use to achieve the maximal effects on CBF and autoregulation in these&#xD;
      SAH patients to be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We wish to address the following hypotheses for SAH patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Systemic treatment with epoetin beta (90,000IU) is safe following SAH&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Systemic treatment with epoetin beta reduces the incidence of abnormal FV and cerebral&#xD;
           autoregulation following SAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Systemic treatment with epoetin beta reduces the incidence of acute neurological&#xD;
           deterioration following SAH If primary endpoints are improved with epoetin beta therapy,&#xD;
           the data will be used to formulate the power calculation for design of a Phase III&#xD;
           clinical outcome study. However, we will assess clinical outcome at the end of the trial&#xD;
           and at discharge to detect any indication of adverse effect after EPO therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent, patients with angiography-positive aneurismal SAH will be&#xD;
      randomised to receive either intravenous epoetin beta 30,000IU or placebo (0.9% saline)&#xD;
      50ml/30min, three times in the first week after SAH (total dose 90,000IU). The number in each&#xD;
      group will be 40. For blinding, the Pharmacy Manufacture Unit (PMU) will prepare and number&#xD;
      identical vials containing either saline (0.9% NaCl) or epoetin beta reconstituted in saline.&#xD;
      The vials will be randomly assigned to patients upon enrollment with the contents of each&#xD;
      vial known only by the PMU. Trial medication will be started as soon as possible within 72&#xD;
      hours of the ictus. As approximately 70% of aneurysms will be treated with open clipping, and&#xD;
      the remainder with endovascular coils, we do not consider the method of treatment to&#xD;
      represent a contaminating factor, but it will be included in the final analysis. Location,&#xD;
      size, and morphology of the culprit aneurysm are not believed to affect outcome in our&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomisation and start of trial therapy the clinical management of each patient&#xD;
      will be as routine. Arterial blood pressure will be continuously monitored (Finapress, or via&#xD;
      radial arterial line).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full blood cell count, reticulocyte count, blood viscosity, coagulation profile, serum&#xD;
      biochemistry, serum iron levels, and C-reactive protein (CRP) at the time of admission will&#xD;
      be checked as clinical routine. Although EPO has effects of erythropoiesis and&#xD;
      thrombopoiesis, associated deterioration or adverse events have not been observed in&#xD;
      short-term treatment [Ehrenreich 2002]. However, in the face of any abnormalities the trial&#xD;
      drug will be stopped and the safety committee informed. A safety committee (chaired by Dr Ken&#xD;
      Smith, Consultant nephrologist) will review the safety data at monthly intervals or, if&#xD;
      concerns arise, on a patient-by-patient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures: Vasospasm and abnormalities in AR:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial patients will be examined daily with TCD (DWL, Germany) using a 2-MHz probe mounted on&#xD;
      a purposed head frame for two weeks since SAH ictus. The systolic, diastolic, and mean FV&#xD;
      will be recorded (trans-temporal) by a single user (MT). Vasospasm will be defined as mean FV&#xD;
      &gt; 120 cm/sec and Lindegaard ratio &gt;3 [Lindegaard 1988]. The regression index (Mx) between&#xD;
      mean FV and spontaneous changes in ABP will be calculated. Two carotid compressions lasting 5&#xD;
      seconds will be performed. The criteria for an acceptable THRT includes a sudden decrease in&#xD;
      middle cerebral artery FV at the onset of compression, a stable TCD signal during&#xD;
      compression, and a minimum of 30% decrease in FV with no blood pressure instability&#xD;
      [Smielewski 1997]. The THRT ratio (THRR) is calculated using the formula: THRR = FVs&#xD;
      (hyperaemia) / FVs(baseline), where FVs denotes systolic FV (Figure 1). THRR is classified as&#xD;
      normal (≥l.10) or impaired (&lt;1.10), and will be repeated 2 minutes later. The average value&#xD;
      of the two tests will be recorded. Quality issues concerning the THRT response have been&#xD;
      extensively evaluated in this laboratory [Smielewski 1997].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint measures: Development of DID:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical progress of each patient will be monitored daily. The development of a focal&#xD;
      neurological deficit and/or a drop in the Glasgow Coma Scale by 2 points or more following&#xD;
      vasospasm will be the criteria adopted to define an episode of DID [Pickard 1989]. Other&#xD;
      factors which can affect consciousness, including systemic infection and infection of central&#xD;
      nervous system, will be recorded for final analysis. Clinical outcomes will be assessed at&#xD;
      the end of the trial and at the time of discharge. Durations of hospitalisation and NCCU stay&#xD;
      will be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will be performed by using statistical software, STATA (Texas, USA). Data will&#xD;
      be expressed as mean±standard deviation. The multivariate analysis will be performed on the&#xD;
      timings of vasospasm and abnormal AR, which will be computed as the number of days between&#xD;
      the date of diagnosis of SAH and the date of the first detection of vasospasm and abnormal&#xD;
      autoregulation in respect of variables likely to influence their occurrence: age, WFNS grade,&#xD;
      Fisher's grade on CT scans, and treatment procedures, intraventricular haemorrhage and/or&#xD;
      hydrocephalus by using the Cox Proportional Hazards regression. The measure of outcome will&#xD;
      be the hazards ratio (HR), which expresses the probability of vasospasm or abnormal&#xD;
      autoregulation for a specific category relative to the placebo group. Variables associated&#xD;
      with EPO treatment (haematocrits, erythrocyte counts, reticulocyte counts, thrombocyte&#xD;
      counts, serum iron levels, and viscosity) will be collected. The improvement in fit due to&#xD;
      each variable will be tested for statistical significance at the 5% level with the likelihood&#xD;
      ratio test. The test for departure from a linear trend (one degree of freedom) was used to&#xD;
      assess the potential linear trend in certain categorical variables. Daily results from each&#xD;
      patient will also be averaged to produce a patient-oriented database to satisfy the&#xD;
      independence assumption for linear regression. The day-to-day variations in parameters will&#xD;
      be calculated as the standard deviation divided by the average value from all examinations in&#xD;
      each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous observations indicate that vasospasm and abnormal THRT occur in 64% and 90% SAH&#xD;
      of patients respectively. To demonstrate a 50% reduction in duration of vasospasm or abnormal&#xD;
      autoregulation with a power of 80% and a significance level of 5% we will require&#xD;
      examinations from 80 patients. This number of patients also has an 83% chance of&#xD;
      demonstrating a 50% reduction in the incidence of clinical DID in the first 2 weeks following&#xD;
      the ictus. The study is not powered to show a reduction in clinical endpoints although trends&#xD;
      will be sought to identify any potential adverse effects.&#xD;

&#xD;
           The Neurosurgical Unit at Addenbrookes treats 80 aneurysmal SAH patients per annum.&#xD;
           Previous studies in our unit have shown high ascertainment, and we were the largest&#xD;
           contributor to the International Hypothermia for Aneurysm Surgery Trial (IHAST). We do&#xD;
           not foresee difficulties with recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The safety and efficacy of using high dose intravenous epoetin beta (100,000IU) for&#xD;
           treating human acute stroke (within 8 hours) have been confirmed [Ehrenreich 2002]. The&#xD;
           therapeutic margin of EPO is very wide. Even at very high serum levels no adverse&#xD;
           effects have been observed [NeoRecormon information sheet, Roche].&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment of AR using TCD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control for THRT assessment has been vigorously addressed, failure to complete the&#xD;
      test is rare [Ratsep 2002]. The incidence of significant carotid atherosclerotic disease&#xD;
      precluding safe carotid compression is less than 1% [Lam 2000]. The test is well tolerated&#xD;
      and we know of no patient who requested to withdraw from the investigation in previous&#xD;
      studies due to discomfort etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FUTURE RESEARCH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this phase II study will be used to design a phase III clinical outcome trial&#xD;
      using the Spontaneous Intracranial Haemorrhage Group mechanism. Any potential benefits may&#xD;
      extrapolate to other cerebrovascular conditions where low CBF states and loss of&#xD;
      autoregulation occur (e.g. acute cerebral vasculitis).&#xD;
