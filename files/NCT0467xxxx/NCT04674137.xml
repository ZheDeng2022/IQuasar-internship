      A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, pilot study in parallel groups to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of XC8 at a dose of 100 mg versus placebo over a 12-week treatment period&#xD;
      in non-smoking patients with a confirmed bronchial asthma (BA) and the eosinophil blood level&#xD;
      2 times within 1 week interval of ≥ 300 cells/μl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design was developed by Chemlmmune Therapeutics LLC, Russia in cooperation with Eurrus&#xD;
      Biotech GmbH, Austria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 3 periods: screening (2 weeks), treatment period (12 weeks) and&#xD;
      follow-up (2 weeks). All eligible patients are randomized into one of two treatment groups in&#xD;
      a ratio of 1:1. During the study patients will continue to receive stable doses of inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids (ICS) with or without the long-acting β2-agonists; when required, patients&#xD;
      will receive short-acting β2-agonists.The randomized patients will be stratified by the site,&#xD;
      baseline forced expiratory volume (FEV1) in the range of 55 to 70% and 71% to 85%, and&#xD;
      therapy of BA (inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with or without long-acting β2 agonists).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study drug is produced by Hennig Arzneimittel GmbH und Co., Germany.&#xD;
