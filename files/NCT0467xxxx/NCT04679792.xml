      BACKGROUND: Chiari I malformation is a rare disease characterized by cerebellar amygdalae&#xD;
      descent under the level of the foramen magnum. It causes troubles in cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      circulation and direct compression on brainstem, producing characteristic headaches,&#xD;
      neurological impairment and syringomyelia. Surgery is the only treatment, indicated when&#xD;
      symptomatology exists. However, sometimes patients complaint about atypical symptoms that are&#xD;
      difficult to interpret.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to study one of these atypical symptoms, gait imbalance, in a pediatric&#xD;
      population thanks to a computerized dynamic posturography (EquitestÂ®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: infants from 6 to 18 years of age presenting a radiologically confirmed Chiari I&#xD;
      malformation will be included in the study. We will compare posturographic results of&#xD;
      patients which will be operated on with the results of the patients which will not;&#xD;
      furthermore, we will compare preoperative and postoperative results in operated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESULTS: 19 patients have been enrolled in the study, and data have been collected for 12 of&#xD;
      them. Seven patients belong to operated population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCLUSIONS: even if enrolment of the patients is satisfactory, disposable data are not&#xD;
      enough to perform statistical analysis and to put forward any conclusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chiari malformation is characterized by at least 5 mm descent of cerebellar tonsils below the&#xD;
      foramen magnum, into the vertebral canal. Historical classification of this malformation&#xD;
      consists in four different types, but it is the first one, due to a congenital small&#xD;
      posterior fossa, which represent our focus of interest. Chiari malformation may leads to&#xD;
      direct brainstem compression and to cerebrospinal fluid circulation trouble at this level,&#xD;
      being cause of classical associated phenomena such as syringomyelia formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical manifestation may be resumed as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exertional headaches or neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brainstem compression signs and symptoms (central apneas syndrome, tetraparesis,&#xD;
           paresthesia, cranial nerves disfunction...).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Syringomyelia signes and symptoms (neuropathic pain, suspended hypo-anesthesia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only treatment for Chiari I malformation is the surgical one. It consists in an&#xD;
      osteo-dural decompression of the posterior fossa. Surgical decision is formal when at least&#xD;
      one of the following criteria is satisfied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  presence of syringomyelia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  coexistence of central apneas syndrome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  presence of the classical symptomatology. Nevertheless, the spectrum of symptoms which&#xD;
           might be reported by the patient, and which has even been described in the non&#xD;
           neurosurgical literature, is largely wider than the previously thought and assumed by&#xD;
           the neurosurgeons. There are so several &quot;atypical symptoms&quot; in which neurosurgeons&#xD;
           doesn't believed, and that don't constitute an indicator for surgical intervention.&#xD;
           Among these &quot;atypical symptoms&quot; one cas find those ones who bring back to ear, nose and&#xD;
           throat domain, such as nystagmus, dizziness, tinnitus, hear loss, and gait instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We decided to focalise about one of these symptoms, the gait instability, trying to find the&#xD;
      link between Chiari malformation and postural control. In the literature, there are only one&#xD;
      study concerning this aspect, conducted on an adult population with the help of a static&#xD;
      posturography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will focus on pediatric patients, who will be evaluated by a dynamic posturography,&#xD;
      the Equitest platform (NeuroCom, Clackamas, OR). This platform is able to quantify the&#xD;
      contribution of each of the three sensory informations (visual, vestibular and somatosensory)&#xD;
      necessary to maintain equilibrium, realising a specific test (Sensory Organisation Test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Equitest can elaborate a Composite Equilibrium Score (CES), that will be our PRIMARY&#xD;
      JUDGMENT CRITERIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients for which ENT evaluation is indicated for medical reasons (for example,&#xD;
      children presented frequent falls, dizziness, nystagmus, motion sickness...) will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation won't change habitual neurosurgical care for the patients presenting Chiari I&#xD;
      malformation, so two groups of patients will be identified: children who will be operated on&#xD;
      and children who won't. CES of the two groups will be calculated and compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, we will compared CES results of the operated patients group before and after&#xD;
      surgery, to evaluate the impact of surgery on postural control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, we will evaluate others SECONDARY CRITERIA in operated patient, before and after&#xD;
      surgery, such as :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  signe and symptomss modification;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decompression result on MRI images;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  syringomyelia modification, if present before;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  central apnea syndrome modification, if present before;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  scoliosis modification, if present before;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  behavioral modification. Anamnestic and clinical data will be part of the habitual&#xD;
           computerized medical folder, as well as polysomnographic, posturographic and imaging&#xD;
           ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical elements of recruited patients will be collected by principal investigator in an&#xD;
      anonymous database, secured by a password.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning primary criteria, collected qualitative data will be analysed by Chi-2 or Fischer&#xD;
      test, while quantitative ones will be analysed by Student's test or Mann-Whitney one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning secondary criteria, collected qualitative data will be analysed by Mc Nemar test&#xD;
      or symmetry test, while quantitative ones will be analysed by Student's test Wilcoxon one.&#xD;
