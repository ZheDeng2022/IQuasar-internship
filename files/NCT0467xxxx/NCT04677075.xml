  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mastectomy is a cornerstone operative procedure in breast cancer treatment leaving a raw area&#xD;
      behind with possibility of failure of primary closure sometimes with unavailability of&#xD;
      facilities of reconstruction. This opened the door for this research to find a formula to&#xD;
      predict the need of reconstruction&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical intervention for breast cancer includes dealing with the primary tumour, added to it&#xD;
      is the axillary dissection with variable options in both of them according to multiple&#xD;
      factors. Mastectomy represents a part of several operations as radical and modified radical&#xD;
      mastectomy, while in others it may be the whole operation as in palliative simple mastectomy.&#xD;
      Moreover, re-excision of local recurrence is another form of surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the step of mastectomy or re-excision of locally recurrent disease, the challenge of&#xD;
      closure may arise, as simple primary closure may not be possible because of wide wound gap.&#xD;
      In this situation, reconstruction is unavoidably needed and this situation represents one of&#xD;
      two situations in which reconstruction is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As reconstruction sometimes needs certain expertise which may not be available momentarily&#xD;
      and needs previous arrangement. Moreover sometimes mastectomy exceeds the previous&#xD;
      expectation leaving a big gap beyond simple approximation, so the investigators developed a&#xD;
      formula to assess the need of reconstructive coverage.&#xD;
