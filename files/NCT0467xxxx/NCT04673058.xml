  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether spinal manipulation, which is a potential&#xD;
      treatment method for musculoskeletal pain, has an additional contribution in patients with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia receiving standard pharmacological treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although fibromyalgia (FM) is quite common, success rates in conservative treatment are&#xD;
      unsatisfying. Combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological applications is&#xD;
      recommended in treatment. Although the etiology of FM is not well known, characteristic&#xD;
      findings such as hyperalgesia and allodynia suggest problems related to pain and sensorial&#xD;
      processing in the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been suggested that spinal manipulation can alter sensorimotor integration in the&#xD;
      central nervous system and therefore can be used in the treatment of central sensitization&#xD;
      syndromes. However, manual therapy applications, which were examined under the heading of&#xD;
      chiropractic in the 2016 EULAR treatment recommendations, were not recommended due to the low&#xD;
      quality (open-label, quasi-experimental) of the studies conducted so far. However, it has&#xD;
      been suggested for future studies to investigate whether the combined use of pharmacological&#xD;
      and non-pharmacological treatments is more effective than single modality management. But&#xD;
      since then unfortunately a high level of evidence also could not be obtained related to use&#xD;
      of spinal manipulation in FM due to reasons such as lack of reporting of the manual therapy&#xD;
      methods used in detail, conducting studies involving mostly soft tissue techniques and not&#xD;
      following CONSORT recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is planned as a prospective, triple-blinding, randomized controlled and 3-arm&#xD;
      parallel group design clinical study considering the concepts that have been lacking the&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Pain Intensity at 1 and 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, one week after the last treatment session (1st month) and 3rd month</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked to mark their pain on the visual analog scale (VAS) during each visits.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Tenderness (tender point pain threshold score) at 1 and 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, one week after the last treatment session (1st month) and 3rd month</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain threshold of 18 points specified in 1990 American Collage of Rheumatology (ACR) Fibromyalgia classification criteria will be evaluated with The Lafayette Manual Muscle Tester Model 01165 (Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette IN, USA). This device is a dynamometer. It has been shown that if circumference is used instead of area as the correction coefficient hand dynamometers with wider tips than standard algometers are also valid and reliable in the pressure pain threshold measurement. The Lafayette Hand-Held Dynamometer uses a tip with a circumference of 5.65 cm. The applied force (kg) / 5.65 will be used as the pressure pain threshold unit in the study. The arithmetic mean of the data obtained from 18 points will be recorded as the tender point pain threshold score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR) at 1 and 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, one week after the last treatment session (1st month) and 3rd month</time_frame>
    <description>FIQR consists of 3 domains. The first domain contains 9 questions that can be scored between 0 and 10 and the score of the physical function is found by dividing the total score by three. Second domain contains 2 questions and the overall impact score is the sum of the scores from these two questions. Third domain consists of 10 questions and symptom score is obtained by dividing the total score by two. Total FIQR score is the sum of 3 domain points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Pain Extent at 1 and 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, one week after the last treatment session (1st month) and 3rd month</time_frame>
    <description>The extent of the pain will be evaluated by widespread pain index (WPI). The WPI quantifies the extent of bodily pain on a 0-19 scale by asking patients if they have had pain or tenderness in 19 different body regions (shoulder girdle, hip, jaw, upper arm, upper leg, lower arm, and lower leg on each side of the body, as well as upper back, lower back, chest, neck, and abdomen) over the past week, with each painful or tender region scoring 1 point.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Fibromyalgia Severity Score (FSS) at 1 and 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, one week after the last treatment session (1st month) and 3rd month</time_frame>
    <description>FSS is the sum of the WPI and symptom severity scale (SSS) scores. SSS consists of two domains. For the first domain, the complaints of fatigue, waking unrefreshed and cognitive symptoms are scored between 0 (no problem) and 3 (life-disturbing problems&#xD;
). For the second domain, headaches, pain or cramps in lower abdomen, and depression are scored between 0 (absent) and 1 (present). The total score gives the SSS score.</description>

    <description>After the patients were evaluated in terms of somatic dysfunction, the appropriate techniques of Cervical Upglide Thrust, Cervical Downglide Thrust, Cervical Traction Thrust, Cervical Rotation Thrust, Cervico-Thoracic Distraction Manipulation, Cervico-Thoracic Lateral Glide (Spinous Push) Manipulation, Supine Screw Thoracic Thrust, Prone Thoracic Thrust, and Lumbar Spine Rotation Manipulation will be applied to patients.</description>

    <description>A treatment will be applied which is very similar to active treatment but aimed to have minimal therapeutic effect. For this, the practitioner will primarily identify the areas where somatic dysfunction is detected and keep the application away from these areas. The patient will be positioned for treatment as in active therapy, but once in the lock position, a lower thrust will be given by releasing some back from the position. In this way, the movement will be imitated without reaching the elastic zone and a stronger similarity will be provided compared to sham treatments such as light touch or massage.</description>
