  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a chronic disease characterized by a progressive&#xD;
      increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), which leads to right ventricular (RV)&#xD;
      failure, and ultimately death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different studies have outlined how various factors as vascular resistance, functional class,&#xD;
      age, correlate with mortality. However, the modality of death and risk factors for mortality&#xD;
      in patients with PAH are little known. For this purpose, more studies are necessary to&#xD;
      analyze the risk factors related to modality of death in PAH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a disease characterized by dyspnea, fatigue, chest&#xD;
      pain, and syncope. PAH results from a narrowing of the small arteries and arterioles,&#xD;
      resulting in elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance and leading to the development of&#xD;
      right ventricular failure and death if untreated. Worldwide, it is estimated that between&#xD;
      130,000 and 260,000 persons have PAH. Mean age at diagnosis is 35 years, and most patients&#xD;
      present with moderate-to-severe disease. PAH occurs most often in otherwise healthy persons,&#xD;
      and more often in women than men. There is no known cure for PAH, and the goal of current&#xD;
      therapy is to control symptoms of the disease and hopefully slow its progression. Prognosis&#xD;
      is poor in patients with PAH, and is similar to that of many advanced cancers; five-year&#xD;
      survival in the absence of treatment is only about 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparatively little is known about the modality of death and risk factors for mortality in&#xD;
      patients with PAH. In a recent systematic review, a little consensus was found among the 54&#xD;
      studies identified, most of which involved relatively few patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of 107 risk factors that were found to be significantly related to mortality in at least one&#xD;
      study, only 10 demonstrated &quot;a reproducible predictive association with mortality.&quot; Benza and&#xD;
      colleagues recently reported on a retrospective analysis of information from 2716 PAH&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the US Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management&#xD;
      (REVEAL). This study was much larger than any previous one and too recent to be included in&#xD;
      the aforementioned systematic review. In multivariate analysis, they found that high&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR &gt;32 Wood Units), PAH secondary to portal hypertension,&#xD;
      NYHA Functional Class IV, male gender, older age (&gt;60 years), and family history of PAH were&#xD;
      all predictive of 1-year mortality. Interestingly, none of the 107 risk factors identified in&#xD;
      the systematic review concerned nutritional status (e.g., body mass index [BMI], serum&#xD;
      albumin). Preliminary results from an ongoing European study, however, suggest that low BMI&#xD;
      is an important independent predictor of mortality in patients with PAH, possibly including&#xD;
      death due to chronic heart failure, sudden cardiac death, and/or death due to extracardiac&#xD;
      causes. If this is indeed the case, then improvements inpatient nutrition may offer the&#xD;
      potential to extend life expectancy at the relatively low burden and minimal cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given current uncertainty about the mode of death and risk factors for mortality in PAH, a&#xD;
      new study is planned to examine this issue, with a particular focus on the independent&#xD;
      contribution of BMI as a risk factor for mortality.&#xD;
