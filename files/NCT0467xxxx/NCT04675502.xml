  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scleroderma, also called systemic sclerosis (SSc); It is a heterogeneous multiorgan disease&#xD;
      of unknown etiology characterized by vasculopathy, autoimmunity and fibrous tissue. It is&#xD;
      stated in studies that cardiac and pulmonary systems are affected in patients with SSc and&#xD;
      these effects affect the aerobic capacity, physical functions and quality of life of patients&#xD;
      negatively by disrupting their pulmonary and musculoskeletal functions. However, considering&#xD;
      the treatment approaches in scleroderma patients, the number of studies evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation and exercises is limited. Therefore, the purpose of&#xD;
      our study; Comparison of the effects of a supervised exercise program and a home exercise&#xD;
      program in patients with Systemic Sclerosis.&#xD;

      Cases are divided into two groups as supervised exercise and home exercise program by closed&#xD;
      envelope randomization method. All patients are informed about risk factors and risk factor&#xD;
      management. All patients are trained 3 days in the first week under the supervision of a&#xD;
      physiotherapist to learn individual exercise programs. Supervised exercise programs including&#xD;
      warm-up, loading, cooling, and relaxation exercises are shown. The warm-up period is consist&#xD;
      of light-paced walking, active movements of several large muscle groups. During the loading&#xD;
      period respiratory control training, breathing exercises (Shrunken lip breathing exhaustion,&#xD;
      diaphragmatic, thoracic expansion exercises), posture exercises with respiratory control&#xD;
      (pectoral stretching, four-way trunk exercises, head-neck exercises, bilateral shoulder&#xD;
      flexion and abduction exercises, sitting on a chair, standing up exercise. ), walking on the&#xD;
      treadmill for 5-15 minutes without inclination and at a constant speed, starting with 3&#xD;
      minutes without load, continuing with a load of 20 watts and 3 minutes, and reaching a&#xD;
      submaximal load with 3 watt increments every 10 seconds, pedaling in the bicycle ergometer is&#xD;
      taken. Stretching exercises are done during the cooling period. This group was included in an&#xD;
      exercise program 2 days a week, 45-90 minutes, for 12 weeks, accompanied by a specialist&#xD;
      physiotherapist in the pulmonary rehabilitation unit in the chest diseases ward. The same&#xD;
      exercises (respiratory control training, shrunken lip breathing exhaustion, diaphragmatic,&#xD;
      thoracic expansion exercises, posture exercises with respiratory control (pectoral&#xD;
      stretching, four-way trunk exercises, head and neck exercises, bilateral shoulder flexion and&#xD;
      abduction exercises), sitting and standing exhaustion, and brisk walking to reach 60-85% of&#xD;
      the person's maximum heart rate.)) were taught to the home exercise group and given in the&#xD;
      form of a brochure and they were asked to do these exercises at home 2 days a week for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Participants of the home exercise group are contacted every two weeks via&#xD;
      communication methods such as e-mail, message and telephone conversation. Exercise diary is&#xD;
      given to all patients and is taken from them at the end of the study&#xD;
