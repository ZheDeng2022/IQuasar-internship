  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being completed for patients with cirrhosis, including patients with a prior&#xD;
      history of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) to evaluate the feasibility and benefits of&#xD;
      medically-tailored meals as an intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled from the University of Michigan and will complete the baseline&#xD;
      assessments in-person or remotely. In addition participants will complete study related&#xD;
      materials before, during and after treatment with medically-tailored meals (MTM). After&#xD;
      completing the study meals, participants will return for follow-up or have this visit&#xD;
      completed remotely as well as have an observational period for 12 more weeks.&#xD;

    <description>This is a computerized, timed test of attention conducted on an Interactive Personal Application Device (iPad) or smart device by a phone application that asks patients to identify the color of words. The score is the sum of the time it takes to complete color-word concordance and color-word discordance. A score of less than 190 is considered 'normal' cognitive function. Subjects who are color-blind will be excluded from performing this test.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive meals that adhere to their specified nutritional targets dependent upon their cirrhosis complication of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and/or ascites. Participants with HE will receive high-protein (approximately 1 gram of medication per kilogram of the body weight (1g/kg/day) and high-calorie (approximately 30c/kg/day) meals. Participants with HE and ascites will receive high-protein and high-calorie meals that are also low-sodium (less than 2000 grams a day).</description>

This is provided to participants with ProCel Vanilla Whey Protein powder which provides 15 grams of protein per serving or the ProCel LiquaCel liquid protein supplement mango, grape, watermelon and/or lemon flavors which provides 16g of protein per serving.</description>
