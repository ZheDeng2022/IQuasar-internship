    <textblock>
      Acute Valproic acid (VPA) toxicity is an emergency condition which may commonly present with&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) depression(5). In mild poisoning, associated with VPA ingestions&#xD;
      of 200 mg/kg, sedation and lethargy commonly occur(6); while in severe VPA poisoning&#xD;
      associated with ingestions of 400 mg/kg or more, life threatening events are likely to occur&#xD;
      as respiratory depression, metabolic acidosis, encephalopathy, hemodynamic instability, and&#xD;
      cerebral edema which may progress to coma and even death -if not treated promptly. Supportive&#xD;
      care along with early gastric decontamination using activated charcoal (AC) (which may only&#xD;
      be given if patient presented early after ingestion), in addition to intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      administration of Levocarnitine (L-Carnitine) and ensuring adequate airway protection are the&#xD;
      cornerstone of treatment, but there remains no drug listed as a specific antidote for acute&#xD;
      VPA intoxication. Carbapenem antibiotics augment the clearance of VPA through suppressing its&#xD;
      enterohepatic recirculation, as they inhibit the acylpeptide hydrolase enzyme responsible for&#xD;
      the reabsorption of the hydrolyzed valproate back to VPA active molecule. Taking advantage of&#xD;
      this well-established drug-drug interaction between VPA and carbapenems resulting in&#xD;
      significant drop of VPA serum concentration during concomitant use, we propose that&#xD;
      administration of meropenem (member of carbapenems group) will prove effectiveness in&#xD;
      managing VPA toxicity by achieving lower plasma levels of VPA and/or enhanced alertness;&#xD;
      compared with standard care.&#xD;

      JUSTIFICATION AND SIGNIFICANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valproic acid (VPA) -a branched chain carboxylic acid- introduced by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration in 1978 for the treatment of seizure disorders(1). In the following years, VPA&#xD;
      gained further approved indications to treat bipolar and behavioral disorders(2), migraine&#xD;
      prophylaxis(3) as well as other psychiatric indications(4).The growing use of VPA and its&#xD;
      availability resulted in increased prevalence of VPA overdoses(5,6). The rising incidence of&#xD;
      acute VPA toxicity is either resulting from suicidal attempts, accidental ingestions, or&#xD;
      following VPA dose increments to achieve the desired therapeutic effect(7). Acute VPA&#xD;
      toxicity is an emergency condition which may commonly present with central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) depression(5). In mild poisoning, associated with VPA ingestions of 200 mg/kg, sedation&#xD;
      and lethargy commonly occur(6); while in severe VPA poisoning associated with ingestions of&#xD;
      400 mg/kg or more, life threatening events are likely to occur as respiratory depression,&#xD;
      metabolic acidosis, encephalopathy, hemodynamic instability, and cerebral edema which may&#xD;
      progress to coma and even death -if not treated promptly(5,8). Serum VPA concentration is the&#xD;
      most functional tool in diagnosing and determining the severity of toxicity. Supportive care&#xD;
      along with early gastric decontamination using activated charcoal (AC) (which may only be&#xD;
      given if patient presented early after ingestion), in addition to intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      administration of Levocarnitine (L-Carnitine) and ensuring adequate airway protection are the&#xD;
      cornerstone of treatment, but there remains no drug listed as a specific antidote for acute&#xD;
      VPA intoxication(5,9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbapenems are a group of β-lactam antibiotics with a growing need to use in the empiric and&#xD;
      definitive treatment, due to the emerging resistance to antibiotics(10). A multitude of case&#xD;
      reports(11-13), retrospective observational studies(14-19) and reviews(20-22) demonstrated&#xD;
      that combined use of VPA and carbapenem antibiotics -mainly meropenem (16)(23)- is associated&#xD;
      with a potential drug interaction that can significantly decrease VPA serum&#xD;
      concentration(24). One retrospective trial included 36 patients concluded that VPA mean ± SEM&#xD;
      serum concentration dropped from 50.8 ± 4.5 µg/mL to 9.9 ± 2.1 µg/mL(P &lt; .001) following&#xD;
      meropenem administration with a mean decrease of 82.1% ± 2.7%(18), while a recent prospective&#xD;
      observational trial determined that the mean drop in serum VPA level was 80% ranging&#xD;
      from(49%-99%)(23). However, despite VPA toxicity with fatal events being reported for over 20&#xD;
      years, only a few case reports documented successful intentional use of meropenem as an&#xD;
      antidote for VPA poisoning(25-27). To date, no randomized-controlled trials were conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims: Determine if meropenem is effective in treating acute VPA toxicity, manifested&#xD;
      by achieving reduced VPA plasma levels and/or enhanced mentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Administration of meropenem combined with standard care is effective in managing&#xD;
      VPA intoxication, affirmed by providing lower serum VPA concentrations and/or better level of&#xD;
      consciousness; in contrast to standard care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: VPA is an antiepileptic drug that has psychiatric indications as well(28). VPA&#xD;
      acute intoxication is a critical condition listed among fatal pharmaceutical exposures, with&#xD;
      CNS toxicity being the most common manifestation and may progress to respiratory depression&#xD;
      and/or coma(5). In 2018, the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) Toxic&#xD;
      Exposure Surveillance System (TESS) database reported 7699 VPA exposures, of which: 2079 were&#xD;
      treated in health care facilities, 87 resulted in major toxicity, and 19 resulted in&#xD;
      deaths(29). These data denote that VPA poisoning is becoming an area of growing concern among&#xD;
      toxicologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supportive care and ensuring adequate airway protection are the cornerstone of treatment;&#xD;
      yet, no drug specified as an antidote for managing VPA intoxication(5). Carbapenem&#xD;
      antibiotics augment the clearance of VPA through suppressing its enterohepatic recirculation,&#xD;
      as they inhibit the acylpeptide hydrolase enzyme responsible for the reabsorption of the&#xD;
      hydrolyzed valproate back to VPA active molecule(21). Taking advantage of this&#xD;
      well-established drug-drug interaction between VPA and carbapenems resulting in significant&#xD;
      drop of VPA serum concentration during concomitant use(15,17,23), we propose that&#xD;
      administration of meropenem (member of carbapenems group) will prove effectiveness in&#xD;
      managing VPA toxicity by achieving lower plasma levels of VPA and/or enhanced alertness;&#xD;
      compared with standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design and methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operational definitions of research variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VPA toxicity: Ingestion of VPA, at doses higher than 60 mg/kg/day, with a serum VPA&#xD;
      concentration above the therapeutic threshold of 100 µg/mL and/or altered sensorium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard care: Encompasses supportive care: administration of IV fluids, endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation for securing airway in patients with altered sensorium, benzodiazepines should be&#xD;
      administered only if seizures occur and L-carnitine 100 mg/kg IV in cases of hyperammonemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Evaluate serum VPA concentrations among the two study groups. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome: Assess patients level of consciousness according to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)&#xD;
      among the placebo and treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Location: This is a multicentered, randomized (1:1), double blinded, placebo&#xD;
      controlled study where eligible patients will be randomly assigned into two groups using&#xD;
      simple random sample technique, each patient will either receive: IV meropenem 1gram every 8&#xD;
      hours together with standard care; or placebo along with standard care. Computer generated&#xD;
      random number tables, will be used to allocate patients to either treatment or placebo&#xD;
      groups. We will make the participant and the assessing physician unaware of the treatment.&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in three poison control centers (PCC) in Egypt: (1) poison&#xD;
      control center of Ain Shams university hospitals; (2) poison control center of Alexandria&#xD;
      university hospitals; (3) poison control center of Tanta university hospitals. We will obtain&#xD;
      their institutional review board and/or ethics committee approval to conduct the study&#xD;
      protocol prior to study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions and Monitoring: Serial VPA serum concentrations to be assessed every two to&#xD;
      four hours until a steady significant declined level is noted, while neurological status&#xD;
      assessment of patients will be performed according to the GCS three times daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size &amp; Power: Based on VPA toxicity levels, mean VPA serum level of 378.3 mg/mL ±&#xD;
      310.2 mg/mL were reported(7), following meropenem administration, the mean drop in serum VPA&#xD;
      level was 80%(18,23). Owing to this data, we estimated that a minimum of 48 patients will be&#xD;
      needed to confirm this effect (α= 5% and power of 90 %).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: Reviewing annual reports of PCCs in Egypt, a single PCC received 44 cases of&#xD;
      VPA toxicity throughout the year 2011(30). Hence, an estimated one-year duration will be&#xD;
      sufficient to conduct our study over three PCCs in Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed statistical analysis: Data will be presented as mean ± standard deviation or median&#xD;
      with interquartile range. Differences between the two groups will be tested using independent&#xD;
      sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test. Univariate analysis for comparing different demographic&#xD;
      data between meropenem group and placebo group using Chi square test and t-test as&#xD;
      applicable, Linear regression will be used to adjust for confounders. The analysis will be&#xD;
      carried out according to the intention to treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences will only be considered significant at P &lt;0.05 and statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed using the Stata statistical software, version 16.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Limitations: 1) VPA overdoses may occur among patients with history of epilepsy.&#xD;
      Meropenem is a drug that possess seizure potential, but mainly seizures were reported in&#xD;
      patients with history of epilepsy and patients with declined renal function. Meanwhile,&#xD;
      overall seizure rate being 0.7% among immunocompetent patients (24). Meropenem dosage&#xD;
      reduction is recommended in patients with advanced age and/or patients with renal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance to the recommended dosage regimens in addition to bedside digital&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) tracings will be urged in epileptic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) The results of this study would only apply to patients with the study inclusion criteria,&#xD;
      further studies should be conducted to cover the excluded criteria population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results: Meropenem with standard care will exhibit effectiveness in VPA toxicity&#xD;
      treatment, by achieving lower mean serum concentrations of VPA and/or higher median GCS&#xD;
      denoting improved sensorium; when compared with standard care alone.&#xD;
