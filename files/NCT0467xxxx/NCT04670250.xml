    <textblock>
      Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a disease known for repeated relapses and remissions. So,&#xD;
      meticulous follow-up is required to individualize treatment plans according to the status of&#xD;
      each patient. The currently used investigations are invasive, costy, and carry the risk of&#xD;
      several side effects, making it difficult for the patient to adhere to his continuous&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To evaluate the viability of fecal lactoferrin, serum ferritin, and IL6 as noninvasive&#xD;
      markers for detecting the activity and follow-up the patients of ulcerative colitis during&#xD;
      remission.&#xD;

      Introduction: Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a disease known for repeated relapses and&#xD;
      remissions. So, meticulous follow-up is required to individualize treatment plans according&#xD;
      to the status of each patient. The currently used investigations are invasive, costy, and&#xD;
      carry the risk of several side effects, making it difficult for the patient to adhere to his&#xD;
      continuous follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To evaluate the viability of fecal lactoferrin, serum ferritin, and IL6 as noninvasive&#xD;
      markers for detecting the activity and follow-up the patients of ulcerative colitis during&#xD;
      remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective cohort study will include 160 patients. The study will be&#xD;
      aMulticenterthat will be held in different Egyptian governorates. The patient must be,&#xD;
      firstly, confirmed to be an ulcerative colitis patient by complete physical examination,&#xD;
      laboratory evaluation by fecal calprotectin and CRP. Also, colonoscopy will be done for all&#xD;
      included patients and they will be classified according to the Modified Mayo Endoscopic Score&#xD;
      (MMES). Biopsies will be taken to confirm the diagnosis with histopathological examination.&#xD;
      Fecal lactoferrin, S ferritin, and IL6 (the investigated markers) will be conducted for&#xD;
      patients with confirmed diagnosis with UC. . All investigations, including colonoscopy, will&#xD;
      be done once again after 3 months to follow up the included patients. The results of all&#xD;
      tests will be correlated to the clinical and endoscopic findings of included patients to&#xD;
      detect a cut off values to be used during remission and activity.&#xD;
