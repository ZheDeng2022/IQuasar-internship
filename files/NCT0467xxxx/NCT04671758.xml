      The hypothesis is that TAVI using a SAPIEN 3 THV is feasible and safe for the treatment of&#xD;
      pure AR.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to now, the balloon-expandable valves have been considered contraindicated for patients&#xD;
      with pure AR due to the absence of calcium which is considered necessary for the anchoring of&#xD;
      the prosthesis. Nonetheless, several cases report have suggested the feasibility of TAVI&#xD;
      using the SAPIEN XT THV, in patients with no calcified valves suggesting that an appropriate&#xD;
      degree of oversizing might compensate the lack of calcium for the anchoring of these&#xD;
      prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new generation balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 THV has incorporated changes in the stent&#xD;
      frame geometry, leaflets configuration and an external sealing skirt resulting in an&#xD;
      increased stability and outstanding control during its implantation, a greater radial force,&#xD;
      a reduced rate of paravalvular leaks and a covering of a wider range of annulus dimensions.&#xD;
      These characteristics of the SAPIEN 3 THV might translate into a safer use of this device in&#xD;
      patients with pure AR and non-calcified valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant AR occurs in 2.0% of individuals of &gt;75 years, 13.3% of patients referred for&#xD;
      intervention, being severe in 5% of these patients. As for aortic stenosis, its prevalence&#xD;
      increases with age and the most frequent cause is degenerative although rheumatic and&#xD;
      endocarditis are present. Although patients with severe AR have an excess risk of mortality&#xD;
      and aortic valve replacement reduces mortality, only 1/3 of patients with significant AR&#xD;
      finally undergo intervention. Reasons for no intervention are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if it has been suggested that AR might be underestimated and the prevalence of this&#xD;
      disease might be higher than previously reported, and a percent of patients with indication&#xD;
      for aortic valve replacement are denied for surgery, pure AR is a small niche of patients for&#xD;
      TAVI. In terms of cost-effectiveness, both the development of a dedicated device and the&#xD;
      investment in the training of operators in the implantation technique might lack of interest.&#xD;
      However, performing TAVI with a device used in the routine practice might be appealing and,&#xD;
      importantly, safer. A preliminary case series including 3 patients have suggested the&#xD;
      feasibility of TAVI with the SAPIEN 3 device for pure AR (Urena M, Himbert D. JACC, 2016 ).&#xD;
      In this study we aim to evaluate the feasibility and long-term safety of the SAPIEN 3 THV in&#xD;
      patients with pure AR.&#xD;
