  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will advance understanding on the mechanisms that mediate improved outcomes for&#xD;
      chronic low back pain and provide specific directions for optimizing physical activity&#xD;
      interventions for this population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with chronic low back pain will be randomized to receive a&#xD;
      12-week physical activity intervention (2 times per week with encouragement for home&#xD;
      practice). The experimental condition will entail physical activity with components for&#xD;
      strengthening emotion regulation skills, behaviors, and attitudes while the control condition&#xD;
      will entail physical activity alone.&#xD;

    <masking_description>We will employ blinding whenever possible. Assessments, evaluations, and data analysis will be conducted without knowledge of participants' assigned group. Study personnel will be blinded to the assigned condition of subjects when conducting data collection by using unique study identification numbers, by following a strict script to refrain from discussing participant activities, and by using different members of the study team to coordinate assigned condition activities and to collect data. De-identified data with codes for assigned condition will facilitate blinded data analysis.</masking_description>

    <description>The intervention meet twice weekly for 12 weeks, 1.25 hrs./session. This intervention will be led by certified instructors trained in working with back pain patients. The instructor leads participants through a series of physical activity exercises at a slow-moderate pace. Participants will be asked to practice every day for 20 minutes to maximize the benefit of the intervention. Participants also receive a home practice manual containing some basic, safe postures that can be performed on days they are not attending the formal in-person sessions.</description>

    <intervention_name>Physical activity control intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>The interventions meet twice weekly for 12 weeks, 1.25 hrs./session. This intervention is designed to require a similar amount of physical exertion. Classes involve conventional exercises appropriate for patients with CLBP, including a comprehensive set of exercises that stretch all the major muscle groups, with an emphasis on the trunk and legs. The intervention will include all 12 stretching exercises used in the exercise intervention of previous studies that have successfully used it in comparison to yoga, plus 3 additional stretches (hip internal rotators, hip adductors and hip flexion).Participants will be asked to practice every day for 20 minutes home as well. Printed handouts will be provided to facilitate home practice. In addition, a video demonstrating all the exercises will be provided to assist participants in practicing safely. Classes will be led by a licensed physical therapist who has previous experience leading exercise classes.</description>
