    <textblock>
      Introduction: Complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (CAA) are defined as abdominal aneurysms&#xD;
      that are anatomically unsuitable for a standard endovascular repair because of a short&#xD;
      infrarenal neck or no infrarenal neck. These CAAA are usually treated either by fenestrated&#xD;
      endovascular aortic repair (FEVAR) or open repair (OR). Data comparing these thechniques&#xD;
      remain scarce, mainly consisting of systematic reviews based on retrospective studies.&#xD;
      Although mid-term and long-term results remain uncertain, FEVAR has gained widespread&#xD;
      acceptance in the vascular community. However, this practice is not evidence base. Beyond&#xD;
      clinical results, whether FEVAR is cost-effective or not is not demonstrated. A randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial comparing FEVAR and OR is unlikely to be conducted since centers have&#xD;
      developed specific expertise and practice, and most of surgeons are not keen to randomize&#xD;
      patients. Thus, we believe that a prospective comparative multicentric cohort, with a&#xD;
      propensity score and minimization of selection, classification and confusion bias is the most&#xD;
      realistic way to provide reliable comparative data on cost effectiveness of FEVAR and OR.&#xD;
      Overall, 382 patients are expected to be included (159 in each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of this prospective non-randomized comparative multicenter cohort&#xD;
      study is to compare the cost effectiveness incremental ratio at 36 months of FEVAR and OR for&#xD;
      CAAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Patients with CAAA discussed for FEVAR or OR in 37 french vascular centers in during&#xD;
      a two years inclusion period constitute the population study. Preoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      clinical and imaging data will are collected prospectively in eCRF forms. QOL before and&#xD;
      after treatment is assessed by the E5D5L. The follow-up period is three years. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is the Incremental cost-utility ratio (cost/QALY) at 36 months. We plan to minimize&#xD;
      indication biases by using a proposensity score (proposnsity score maching and Inverse&#xD;
      probablility of treatment weighting) based on clinical and anatomic characteristics. Patient&#xD;
      at prohibitive risk for OR are excluded. Patient anatomically unsuitable for FEVAR are also&#xD;
      excluded .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: This study should provided valuable data on cost effectiveness of FEVAR for CAAA.&#xD;
      Sub-goup analysis will be also conducted.&#xD;

    <description>Fenestrated endovascular aortic aneurysm repair consists in excluding a juxtrenal or suprarenal aneurysm by deploying a covered stent (stent graft) in the aorta so as to created sealing zones on both sides of the aneurysm. Since the proximal sealing is located in the visceral segment of the aorta, fenestrations are created to maintain blod flow in renal and visceral arteries. These fenestrations are custom made for each patient. Brindging covered stents are deployed between each fenestration and corresponding target arteries in order to insure sealing of the system.</description>
