      The aim is to provide a comprehensive assessment regarding the service provision and the&#xD;
      accessibility to intensive mental health care in Rwanda for patients with bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowing about the barriers to treatment, risk and protective factors as well as the current&#xD;
      treatment offered for patients with bipolar disorder is essential for the development of&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches and improvement in access to care. Up to now, no data on&#xD;
      characteristics of patients with bipolar disorder in Rwanda and related risk and protective&#xD;
      factors is available. For this purpose, all outpatients with bipolar disorder in Rwanda age &gt;&#xD;
      18 years, will over a 1-year period be invited to participate in a survey on their experience&#xD;
      living with bipolar disorder in Rwanda. Moreover, patients and relatives will be invited for&#xD;
      in-depth interviews to explore their perceptions and experiences with the mental health&#xD;
      system. Health care providers will meet for focus discussions on to assess the experience,&#xD;
      knowledge and practice of caregiving for individuals with bipolar disorder.&#xD;
