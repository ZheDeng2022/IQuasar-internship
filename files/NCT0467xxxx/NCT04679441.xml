  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with cognitive impairments such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), often experience&#xD;
      difficulty performing everyday routine activities. Further, normative age-related changes in&#xD;
      cognition often lead to deficits on previously learned skills and impede new learning such as&#xD;
      learning of new technology systems. This is of great concern, given population aging, the&#xD;
      increasing number of older adults with cognitive impairments, and the continual deployment of&#xD;
      new technologies in everyday contexts. The objectives of this SBIR Phase II study is to build&#xD;
      on a previous Phase I SBIR project and refine and further evaluate a novel integrated&#xD;
      computer-based functional skills assessment and training (CFSAT) program that provides&#xD;
      training on everyday tasks critical to independent living (e.g., financial and medication&#xD;
      management) with non-impaired older adults (NC) and adults with MCI.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CFSAT program provides training on everyday tasks critical to independent living (e.g.,&#xD;
      financial and medication management). The program currently includes six domain simulations&#xD;
      critical to independent living: ATM Banking/Financial Management, Online Banking,&#xD;
      Prescription Refill via Voice Menu, Kiosk Ticket Purchase, Online Shopping (and prescription&#xD;
      refill), and Medication Management. The simulations are in a multi-media format and include&#xD;
      graphic representations, voice and text. In the assessment component each of the six task&#xD;
      domains includes subtasks that graduate in difficulty (e.g., check savings account balance,&#xD;
      transfer money between accounts). The training component is designed to: 1) be consistent&#xD;
      with adaptive training models of learning (tailored to the individual's skills); 2) adhere to&#xD;
      current training guidelines for older adults, 3) identify the current levels of an&#xD;
      individual's ability on the task with Item response theory strategies; 4) use&#xD;
      dynamic-titration feedback from immediate task performance to adjust task difficulty to&#xD;
      optimize training potential; and 5) provide immediate feedback and graduated instruction&#xD;
      following errors, followed by repetition of the previously failed item. Performance metrics&#xD;
      are captured in real time and include measures of accuracy and efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research will involve two phases and will be conducted at two locations: South&#xD;
      Florida and New York City. Inclusion of two locations will allow us to expand the diversity&#xD;
      of our sample and the generalizability of the findings across different regions of the U.S.&#xD;
      Phase I will focus on validation of the 3rd alternative form of the fixed difficulty&#xD;
      assessment tasks (form C); refinement of tasks to improve the graphical representations,&#xD;
      enhance the difficulty level of the subtasks (based on findings from Phase 1), and ensure&#xD;
      currency of the tasks; and usability testing of the refined tasks using a user-centered&#xD;
      design approach. Data collection for Phase 1 will involve a sample of 24 older adults (8&#xD;
      non-impaired older adults aged 60+ (4 per site) and 16 with MCI aged 60+ (8 per site) (4&#xD;
      Spanish speaking in each group) and will take place in laboratory space at i-Function and a&#xD;
      community location in NYC. The usability testing will occur on one day and involve&#xD;
      approximately 2 hours. In Phase 1 the investigators will also develop browser-based version&#xD;
      of the CFSAT program so that it can be launched from web browsers such as Google Chrome or&#xD;
      Safari. This will greatly enhance the flexibility of the program, as the investigators will&#xD;
      be able to launch the program from a variety of settings including the home. This is also a&#xD;
      critical step for commercialization and direct to consumer sales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will involve a multi-site trial to gather continued data on the efficacy of the CFSAT&#xD;
      training with respect to functional gains and additional data on the usability, and&#xD;
      acceptability of the program. The investigators will also gather data on: optimal training&#xD;
      dosage; near and far transfer of training and environmental transfer of training (actual&#xD;
      performance in the real world on the tasks trained by the program as tracked by the EMA&#xD;
      protocol); the maintenance of training gains over time; the need for booster training; and&#xD;
      adherence to home-based training protocols for those with MCI and non-impaired older adults&#xD;
      (NC). In addition, the investigators will examine if computer-based cognitive training (CT)&#xD;
      provides a priming effect that further enhances the benefits of the CFSAT training program&#xD;
      for those with MCI.&#xD;
