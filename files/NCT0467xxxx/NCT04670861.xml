    <textblock>
      Strength, and proprioception training of upper body following injuries is commonly&#xD;
      recommended. However, there are no previous studies investigated the effects of Biodex&#xD;
      balance training on the strength, stability and function of the upper quarter. So, the&#xD;
      purpose of this study will investigate the effect of Biodex balance training on improving the&#xD;
      strength, dynamic stability and function of the upper quarter in young recreational&#xD;
      weightlifters.&#xD;

      Study design This is randomized controlled study. There are two groups classified randomly&#xD;
      (group A &amp; group B); group (A); will receive upper extremities biodex balance training. 3&#xD;
      times/week for 8 weeks and group B that receive no treatment just assessment pre and post.&#xD;
      Both groups will receive their regular weightlifting training exercises 4times/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Testing procedures Data collection from the testing procedures in the pre and post&#xD;
      interventional phase will take place over two days to avoid the impact of fatigue on the&#xD;
      participants' physical performance. In the first day, descriptive data will be measured and&#xD;
      recorded for each subject including age, height, weight, upper extremity dominance (defined&#xD;
      as the hand reported to be preferred for ball throwing). This will be followed by the upper&#xD;
      quarter Y- balance (UQ-YBT) and the Dynamic limits of stability (DLOS) using the Biodex&#xD;
      balance system. In the second day, data will be collected from the 2-minutes 90° push-up test&#xD;
      and the one-arm hop test. The order of days and testing procedures will be randomized for all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training procedure Total number of 24 training sessions will be scheduled to the participants&#xD;
      in group A over a period of eight weeks (three sessions/week). The Rating of perceived&#xD;
      exertion (RPE) or Modified Borg scale (MBS) was used to monitor and guide exercise intensity.&#xD;
      The scale allowed participants to subjectively rate their level of exertion during training.&#xD;
      It starts at number 0 where training is causing no breathing difficulty at all and progress&#xD;
      through to number 10 where breathing difficulty is maximal. Training will start with the&#xD;
      current level of balance of each participant at which he reports exertion level of ≥ 5 based&#xD;
      on modified Borg scale and progressed towards the more difficult ones. The Biodex display&#xD;
      screen will be connected to a computer screen that will be positioned at a level to allow&#xD;
      visual feedback to the participants during training The transition from one level to the more&#xD;
      difficult one will be based on composite score of &gt; 95% at the present level. Each training&#xD;
      session will consist of three minutes training and one-minute rest, repeated for a total of&#xD;
      20 minutes.&#xD;

    <description>The YBT-UQ consists of a platform to which three wooden rulers are attached in the medial, inferolateral, and superolateral reach directions. Each of the posterior rulers is positioned 135ᵒ from the anterior one. The posterior rulers are separated by a 90ᵒ angle between them.</description>

    <description>Dynamic stabilization of the upper quarter assessment and training was provided using Biodex SD system (Biodex, Inc., Shirley, NY, USA) to measure the composite score of the limits of stability (LOS). The system has a moveable multiaxial circular balance platform which can provide up to 20° of surface tilt within a 360° range of motion. The BBS is reported to be valid and reliable for balance assessment and treatment</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Two minutes (2-min) 90° push-up</measure>
    <time_frame>8weeks (pre/post)</time_frame>
    <description>The exercise was performed on a flat, stable surface, hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and fingers pointed forward. The participant &quot;begins&quot; the push-up by bending the elbows and lowering the body as a single unit until the upper arms are at least parallel to the ground (90° push-up) and then return to the starting position by raising the entire body until full extension of the arms. The aim of this test is to perform the maximum number of repetitions in two minutes</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>One-arm hop</measure>
    <time_frame>8weeks (pre/post)</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects were instructed to perform two sets of 10 standard 2-hand push-ups with 2-minute rest period in-between as warming up. This was followed by familiarization trials of the one arm hop test with the dominant and nondominant upper extremities. The subject first watched an instructional video depicting the one-arm hop test.</description>

    <description>The person assumes the prone plank posture with both hands poisoned in the area assigned for foot placement on the tilting balance platform. Using the four keypads, the person's left hand, left wrist, right hand and right wrist positions are entered into the system using the midline of the hand and the platform grid as reference points. The dot that appears on the position patient screen represents the person's segmental center of gravity.&#xD;
During each trial test, the person should shift his weight to move the cursor from the center along a target path and back as quickly and with a little deviation as possible. The same process is repeated for each of the targets. Target paths activate in a random order.</description>
