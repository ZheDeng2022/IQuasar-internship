      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect on the first mobility of inside bed&#xD;
      rotation and mobilization training to patients who will be lumbar disc surgery. This study Is&#xD;
      a randomized controlled clinical trial. The sample of this study consisted of 40 operated&#xD;
      with the diagnosis lumbar disc herniation patients that 19 of which were intervention and 21&#xD;
      of which were control patients between January- November 2019. The patients were taken to the&#xD;
      table randomization method in the study. While the patients receiving control treatment&#xD;
      received routine clinical care, the patients in the intervention group received in- bed&#xD;
      rotation and mobilization training with planned training with planned training one day before&#xD;
      the operation.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Operation day (8 hours after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's first postoperative in-bed turning, the intensive care nurse scored the patient's dependence-independence status/degree with the in-bed turning section of the Observer Mobility Scale. The Observer Mobility Scale: During the same four activities following the surgery, the patient's dependence-independence status on the nurse is scored between &quot;1- performing the activity independently&quot; and &quot;5-inability to perform the activity despite help&quot;. The score that can be obtained from each item varies between 1 and 5, and the total scale score ranges from 4 to 20. Increased scores indicate inadequate movement skills.</description>

    <measure>Pain during the first postoperative in-bed turning</measure>
    <time_frame>Operation day (8 hours after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>The patient scored the degree of the pain during in-bed turning with the related section of the Patient Mobility Scale. The Patient Mobility Scale: The level of pain and difficulty experienced during four activities performed after surgery is evaluated using a 15-cm-wide visual analog. The score that can be obtained from each item varies between 0-15, and the total scale score ranges from 0 to 120. Increased scores indicate an increased level of pain related to the activity.</description>

The score that can be obtained from each item varies between 0-15, and the total scale score ranges from 0 to 120.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The willingness of the patients for mobilization</measure>
    <time_frame>On the first postoperative day</time_frame>
    <description>Their willingness for mobilization was evaluated by the intensive care nurse just before the first mobilization by asking the patients and using the Numeric Rating Scale. The scores on the scale range between &quot;0 - I'm not ready for mobilization&quot; and &quot;10 - I feel ready for mobilization&quot; regarding the pre-mobilization willingness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety levels of the patients</measure>
    <time_frame>On the first postoperative day</time_frame>
    <description>Mobilization-related anxiety levels of the patients were evaluated with the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory filled out by the patient just before and after the first mobilization. The state anxiety scale consists of 20 items. It evaluates the feelings or behaviors experienced by the individual at a certain time or under certain conditions. The trait anxiety scale, on the other hand, requires the individual to describe how they generally feel. It consists of 20 items. The score that can be obtained from the scale ranges between 20 and 80. A high score indicates a high level of anxiety.</description>

    <description>Data about sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the patients in all groups were collected. Their mobility status and general anxiety levels were evaluated.&#xD;
The patients in the intervention group were given a planned &quot;in-bed turning and mobilization training&quot; in the patient's room by the researcher one day before the surgery. This training included explaining the importance of postoperative mobility, demonstrating the correct in-bed turning and mobilization steps through pictures with the &quot;Illustrated In-Bed Turning and Mobilization Training Material&quot;, answering questions (if any), and finally, simulating postoperative in-bed turning and the first mobilization using the role-playing technique in collaboration with the patient.</description>
