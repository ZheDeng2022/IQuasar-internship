  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: to demonstrate a 10% recurrence risk reduction for patients treated with Hypersal&#xD;
      versus normal saline immediately following TURBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: prospective randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial. Outline: eligible&#xD;
      patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who undergo TURBT at our center will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either 40ml of normal saline or 40 ml of hypersal intravesically. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint is tumor recurrence rate. Secondary endpoint are time to recurrence and side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients A total of 150 patients will be enrolled in this trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is associated with a high recurrence rate. As a result,&#xD;
      clinical guidelines mandate prophylactic treatment in all patients who experience tumor&#xD;
      recurrence after the initial resection. This is in contrast to newly diagnosed patients in&#xD;
      whom prophylactic intravesical treatment is usually not required. Intravesical prophylaxis&#xD;
      consists of weekly intravesical administration of either bacillus Calemtte-Guerin of&#xD;
      cytotoxic agents including mitomycin C. This is referred to as induction of therapy followed&#xD;
      by various maintenance protocols for periods between 6 months and 3 years duration. These&#xD;
      recommendations stand in addition to a single perioperative dose of chemotherapy which is the&#xD;
      subject of our research. Consequently, the observed risk reduction for a given patient&#xD;
      receiving both a solitary perioperative dose of chemotherapy and additional doses thereafter&#xD;
      is the combination of both regimens. To avoid possible bias from induction and maintenance&#xD;
      therapy, we decided to include in this phase II trial only newly diagnosed patients with&#xD;
      small, superficial-looking tumors who would receive only immediate post resection&#xD;
      chemotherapy and would not require subsequent chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention drugs Two NaCl in sterile distilled water solutions will be used. Normal saline&#xD;
      comes at a 0.9% concertation as opposed to hypersal with a 3% concertation volume by volume.&#xD;
      Both solutions are colorless fluids and both will come as 40ml doses in pre-loaded syringes.&#xD;
      All instillation syringes will be coded and the key will be kept concealed by our study&#xD;
      coordinator assuring complete double blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention All included patients will undergo a routine TURBT. The number, greatest&#xD;
      diameter and site of intravesical tumors will be recorded. Upon documented complete resection&#xD;
      blood samples for serum sodium will be drawn from all patients . Participants will then&#xD;
      receive a 40 ml intravesical instillation of either Hypersal or normal saline and the&#xD;
      catheter will be plugged for 60-90 minutes. After that the catheter will be opened and&#xD;
      allowed to drain into a urine bag and blood samples for sodium will be taken again. Patient&#xD;
      symptoms and postoperative complications will be recorded using the same instruments used in&#xD;
      the previous Phase I trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either intravesical&#xD;
      solution using a table of random numbers between 0-1.0. All patients with an allocated number&#xD;
      &lt;0.5 will receive normal saline whereas all with a number of 0.5-1.0 will receive hypersal.&#xD;
      Treatment allocations will be determined by the study coordinator before the TURBT and&#xD;
      analyses of endpoints will be based on intention to treat.&#xD;
