  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although many children with brain tumours are successfully cured of their disease, a&#xD;
      substantial proportion of patients suffer disease recurrence and require further treatment.&#xD;
      This therapy may involve a repeat course of radiation (RT2). Based on retrospective data,&#xD;
      re-irradiation may provide palliative and even potentially curative benefit. However, such&#xD;
      retrospective data are subject to bias, which may over-report survival and under-report&#xD;
      toxicity. Furthermore, we do not know how re-irradiation affects patients' HRQOL. The goal of&#xD;
      this research is to prospectively describe the HRQOL of patients diagnosed with DIPG and&#xD;
      recurrent brain tumors and their families before and after re-irradiation to more accurately&#xD;
      assess the benefit versus the toxicity of this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, if we are able to demonstrate the feasibility of collecting HRQOL information on&#xD;
      a routine basis we will be able to justify the need to conduct this research further and&#xD;
      implement HRQOL screening as a standard of care for these patients. Re-irradiation for&#xD;
      children with DIPG and recurrent brain tumours will not cure these children from their&#xD;
      disease but may improve neurological function and wellbeing. We postulate that the&#xD;
      opportunity of more time to say the final good bye and creating memories will facilitate&#xD;
      bereavement and prevent psychological dysfunction of parents and siblings. A greater&#xD;
      understanding of what helps these families may enable clinicians to better support these&#xD;
      children and their families in this difficult disease course. Ultimately our goal is to&#xD;
      improve the psychological experience of these patients and their families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many children diagnosed with brain tumours are at significant risk of disease recurrence&#xD;
      following their initial treatment, with recurrence rates ranging from 30-100% depending on&#xD;
      the type of brain tumour. Disease recurrence represents a serious clinical issue in brain&#xD;
      tumour patients and when this occurs, additional treatment is needed. These treatments may&#xD;
      result in further damage to the surrounding normal brain tissue, resulting in neurocognitive&#xD;
      decline (brain or mental function) and reduced quality of life. A novel treatment option for&#xD;
      these patients is to administer a second course of radiation (re-irradiation). However, the&#xD;
      effects of re-irradiation on quality-of-life are poorly studied. This study aims to increase&#xD;
      the knowledge surrounding re-irradiation, particularly with regards to HRQOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the proposed study is to describe the HRQOL and symptoms for&#xD;
      children diagnosed with DIPG or recurrent brain tumours treated with repeat radiation and&#xD;
      their caregivers over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have four Aims. Aim 1: To describe the HRQOL trajectory and symptoms for children&#xD;
      diagnosed with DIPG and in children treated with re-irradiation for a recurrent brain tumour&#xD;
      and their caregivers over time. Aim 2: To identify critical time points of HRQOL difficulty&#xD;
      across the trajectory of DIPG/recurrent brain tumour treatment and to ascertain demographic&#xD;
      and/or medical sequelae that are related to HRQOL outcomes. Aim 3: To determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of conducting routine assessment of HRQL in children diagnosed with&#xD;
      DIPG/recurrent brain tumours and their caregivers based on recruitment and retention rates.&#xD;
      Aim 4: To report the incidence of radiation necrosis (RN), local control, progression-free&#xD;
      survival and overall survival after re-irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal to is enroll 25 to 30 patient/caregiver dyads diagnosed with DIPG and 32&#xD;
      patient/caregiver dyads treated with re-RT for a recurrent/progressive brain tumour onto the&#xD;
      trial over the study period and to follow patients until their disease progresses again,&#xD;
      which has been, on average, 6 months after completion of RT2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once deemed eligible, individual patient recruitment will be the responsibility of the&#xD;
      institution Clinical Research Assistant (CRA). Upon consenting to take part in the study,&#xD;
      patients and families will be contacted using an online administration and scoring program.&#xD;
      HRQOL assessments will take 15-25 minutes to complete at each time point. Baseline&#xD;
      questionnaires will be completed at the time of recurrence or progressive DIPG or other brain&#xD;
      tumor (+/- 7 days from start of treatment, maximum 14 days). Patients will then complete&#xD;
      HRQOL measures at the end of re-irradiation and then again every two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Necrosis and local tumour control will be assessed using MRI ordered as part of&#xD;
      standard-of-care follow-up (recommended scan interval every 3-6 months until 5 years&#xD;
      post-treatment). Necrosis and other toxicities, if present without evidence of disease&#xD;
      recurrence, will be graded at baseline and each post-RT2 standard-of-care visit using CTCAE&#xD;
      v5.0 (a rating scale of side effects). Steroid use and Lansky play score will be recorded at&#xD;
      each visit. Progression and death will be collected from the health record. Re-irradiation&#xD;
      dosimetry (in electronic RT-DICOM format) will be requested for all enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study measures will be available in both English and French. HRQOL measures will include: the&#xD;
      Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) General module; the PedsQL Brain Tumour module; the PedsQL&#xD;
      Family Impact module; and the Short Form 36 (SF-36), to assess parent quality of life via&#xD;
      physical and mental health functioning subscales. Children who require help completing&#xD;
      questionnaires will be aided by a CRA. For those 2 to 5 years of age or those who have&#xD;
      cognitive disability that impairs their ability to self-report as assessed by their parents,&#xD;
      proxy-report by parent or caregiver will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Symptom Screening in Pediatrics Tool (SSPedi) will also be used to screen for pediatric&#xD;
      cancer symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety, Depressive&#xD;
      Symptoms, and Pain Interference measures short forms will be administered to screen for&#xD;
      current symptoms of anxiety, depression and assess pain interference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A linear mixed models approach will be used to compare HRQOL outcomes over time. Further,&#xD;
      HRQOL outcomes will be compared across assessment time points and paired sample t-tests will&#xD;
      be conducted to identify critical periods of significantly lower and/or higher HRQOL for&#xD;
      patients and caregivers. Correlational analyses will be used to explore variables that might&#xD;
      emerge as related to HRQL outcome scores. Recruitment rates (patients participating vs.&#xD;
      patients eligible) and retention rates (non-completion, lost to follow-up) will be examined.&#xD;
      Finally, all incident cases of radiation necrosis without obvious tumour progression will be&#xD;
      examined, while accounting for competing risks of disease progression and death from any&#xD;
      cause.&#xD;
