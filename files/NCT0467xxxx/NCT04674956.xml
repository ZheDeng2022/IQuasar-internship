      CPOG1210-07 is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, multi-center clinical trial in&#xD;
      China aiming to evaluate the efficiency and safety of anti-PD1 antibody (Camrelizumab)&#xD;
      combined with Paclitaxel(Albumin Bound) and Gemcitabine versus Paclitaxel(Albumin Bound) and&#xD;
      Gemcitabine as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anti-PD1 antibody(Camrelizumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody which can specifically&#xD;
      bind to PD-1 and block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligand (PD-L1), allowing T cells&#xD;
      to recover the immune response against tumors. It is proved to be effective in certain&#xD;
      cancers such as ovarian cancers and certification proved by Chinese Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration(CFDA) includes Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal&#xD;
      cancer and liver cancer.&#xD;
