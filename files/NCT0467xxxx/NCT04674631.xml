  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been suggested that veterans with chronic pain might be at increased risk for the&#xD;
      development of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. To date, most of the&#xD;
      published studies have focused on chronic pain as a whole, and there are limited studies&#xD;
      examining association of neuropathic pain with psychological comorbidity and quality of&#xD;
      life.Combat related extremity injury significantly influences the patients' quality of life&#xD;
      and psychological state. In this context, the purpose of this study is to illustrate to what&#xD;
      extent neuropathic pain influences the quality of life, depression level and sleep quality of&#xD;
      patients with combat-related extremity injury.&#xD;

      A total of 120 patients with combat-related extremity injury and 60 age and BMI-matched&#xD;
      healthy controls will be participated in this cross-sectional study. The presence of&#xD;
      neuropathic pain will be evaluated using Leeds assessment of neuropathic symptoms and signs&#xD;
      (LANSS) questionnaire. The impact of pain on health-related quality of life will be assessed&#xD;
      using the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36). Beck Depression Scale (BDS) will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate depression status of the patients. Quality of sleep will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).&#xD;

    <description>The impact of pain on health-related quality of life will be assessed using the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36). The validity and reliability of the Turkish version of SF-36 has been illustrated. SF-36 is a common questionnaire for the evaluation of quality of life, and it includes a total of 36 items in eight separate scales (physical functioning, general health, physical role, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, mental health and emotional role). Each subscale is scored between 0 and 100, and high scores indicate better quality of life</description>

    <description>Beck Depression Scale (BDS) will be used to evaluate depression status of the patients. Beck Depression Scale, which is a 21-item self report rating inventory, measures characteristic symptoms and attitudes of depression. The scale is scored between 0 and 63. The cut-off point considered is 17. Higher scores reflect more severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of one and a half months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of sleep will be assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which assesses the individual's self-reported quality of sleep during the last month [9]. This 19-item index evaluates seven components of quality of sleep: subjective quality of sleep, sleep duration, sleep latency, sleep disturbances, sleep efficiency, drug use for sleep, and daytime dysfunction. A total PSQI score (range, 0-21) is the total of particular scores from the seven components. A score of â‰¥6 is considered to indicate poor quality of sleep. The Turkish validation of PSQI was performed.</description>
