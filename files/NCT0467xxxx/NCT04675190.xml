    <textblock>
      Gall stone disease is one of the most common diseases occurring in the world as well as in&#xD;
      our country, Nepal. This disease is problematic to a lot of patients and poses a huge&#xD;
      economic burden to the country. Gall stone disease is usually diagnosed by abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasonography as echogenic foci that cast an acoustic shadow. The risk factors for the&#xD;
      development of gall stones are multiple; age, sex, genetic susceptibility, pregnancy,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, obesity, rapid weight loss, prolonged fasting and parenteral nutrition, spinal&#xD;
      cord injury, cirrhosis, hyperbilirubinemia, and Crohn's disease. In cases of prolonged&#xD;
      fasting, total parenteral nutrition, and spinal cord injury; biliary stasis due to lack of&#xD;
      enteral stimulation is thought to contribute for the development of gall stones.8 Biliary&#xD;
      stasis leads to the formation of sludge which consists of mucus, calcium bilirubinate, and&#xD;
      cholesterol crystals. It has been established that several drugs viz.fibrates, ceftriaxone,&#xD;
      somatostatin analogues and oral contraceptive pill can promote gall stone formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elective surgeries are performed after preoperative fasting &gt;6 hrs. as recommended by&#xD;
      different society of anesthesiology. Moreover, fasting continues throughout surgery and few&#xD;
      post-operative hours which usually lasts more than 12 hours. Also group of people after major&#xD;
      abdominal surgeries frequently develop post-operative hyperbilirubinemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these factors after any major surgeries may pose a risk for the development of Gall&#xD;
      stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major goal of this study is to look if the history of major surgery in the past is one of&#xD;
      the etiological factors for the development of gall stone disease. It is a case-control study&#xD;
      carried out in the Department of Surgery. It will also help us analyze other multiple&#xD;
      epidemiological factors like age, sex, BMI, drugs, lipid profile, family history lifestyle,&#xD;
      and dietary factors associated with the disease. The epidemiological data from this study can&#xD;
      also help us analyze other confounding and determining factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk factors for the development of gall stones are multiple which a reason for its high&#xD;
      prevalence. Past history of major surgeries does carry some of the biological causations of&#xD;
      the gall stones like prolonged fasting during the perioperative period and post-operative&#xD;
      hyperbilirubinemia, effects of stress in the gall bladder, and bile flow. However, there have&#xD;
      not been recent studies to redefine the etiology of gall stone and history of major surgery.&#xD;
      Meanwhile, some of the studies are found be of a great value for the background of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study published by J M Little and J Ivramovic in 1991 showed that the major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery had a statistically significant difference in a cumulative prevalence of the gall&#xD;
      stone compared to those who did not undergo any surgery. However, the exact mechanism behind&#xD;
      the formation of the stone was not revealed but the sludge formation during fasting was&#xD;
      assumed to be the common pathways. L Bolondi, S Gaiani have ultrasonographically assessed the&#xD;
      prevalence of sludge in a group of 48 fasting patients after gastrointestinal tract surgery&#xD;
      with a period of fasting lasting for 7 to 10 days. It showed the presence of gall stones with&#xD;
      different ultrasonographic patterns in three sludge positive patients after the end of six&#xD;
      months. They concluded in the early postoperative period there is a high risk for sludge&#xD;
      development and that in some cases sludge may subsequently evolve into gall stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another cross-sectional study by A F Attili,E Scafato showed that Prevalence of gallstone was&#xD;
      higher among subjects who had an overnight fasting period of over 12 hours than subjects with&#xD;
      that of less than 12 hours. H M Bloch et al studied the effects of fasting and composition of&#xD;
      gall bladder, where the mean cholesterol saturation index was significantly greater after a&#xD;
      15 hour fast (1.35+0.08) than after a 10 hour fast (105+0.10). The cholesterol saturation&#xD;
      index is the ratio of the cholesterol of the sample to the maximum soluble cholesterol of&#xD;
      that sample. In the study, it was determined by using the criteria of Hegardt and Dam. The&#xD;
      saturation index of greater than 1 represents the cholesterol is supersaturated and forms&#xD;
      gall stones. Henceforth, the findings suggested that fasting for between 10 to 20 hours&#xD;
      increases the risk for gallstones formation. Another study by Lee et al where they followed&#xD;
      the 94 patients with biliary sludge for the mean of 37.8 months. It was found that 8.3%&#xD;
      developed asymptomatic gall stones and 6.3% underwent cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another prospective study by Christine Evans et al followed 180 patients following major&#xD;
      operations found an incidence of 3.7% severe jaundice and 16.5% mild jaundice (serum&#xD;
      bilirubin 1.5-4 mg/dl) and a study by Stefan Stenderet al followed 61,212 patients for 34&#xD;
      years, which showed that the risk for gall stone disease is significantly higher in&#xD;
      population with bilirubin level in 10th decile (geometric mean 1.34 gm/dl). Though the&#xD;
      previous studies have examined the relationship between fasting and the formation of&#xD;
      gallstones, none of them examined the direct relationship between any major surgeries and the&#xD;
      incidence of gallstones. They also did not study the other factors like the effects of&#xD;
      stress, drugs during surgeries and anesthesia on the gall bladder, and the bile flow.&#xD;
      However, they have given enough background to establish a hypothesis that any major surgery&#xD;
      can be a significant risk factor for the development of gallstones. However, there is no&#xD;
      widely accepted consensus on the grading of surgery so by major surgery we mean all surgeries&#xD;
      done under general or regional anesthesia and involves procedures in abdominal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With our observation of the evidence, it indicates that any major surgery may itself is an&#xD;
      important determinant of the gallstone formation soon after the surgery and so a study can&#xD;
      address this gap of the knowledge. A case-control study can help us assess the past history&#xD;
      of major surgery as a significant risk factor for gallstone disease. Any significant findings&#xD;
      will warrant other higher studies like cohort study for a detailed assessment of the cause.&#xD;
      It has been evident that prolonged fasting or fasting over 10-12 hours imposes a risk factor&#xD;
      for gallstone disease. It has also been established that major gastrointestinal surgery,&#xD;
      hyperbilirubinemia is also a risk factor for gallstone disease. However, there is a clear gap&#xD;
      of knowledge whether any major surgery with similar biological causation imposes a risk&#xD;
      factor for gallstone disease or not. The rationale of the study is to look over this lack of&#xD;
      knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gall stone disease is itself a major economic burden to a lot of patients and the&#xD;
      development of symptomatic gallstone in patients who have undergone major surgery in the past&#xD;
      few years would be distressing to the patients and relatives. Even if few people after major&#xD;
      surgery develop gall stones in future, and those at such risks could be identified, then we&#xD;
      could institute surveillance ultrasonography or medical prophylactic measures like&#xD;
      ursodeoxycholic acid.&#xD;
