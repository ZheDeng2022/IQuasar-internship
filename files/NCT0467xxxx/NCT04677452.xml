        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. 18 years old and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Signed the Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) with relapsed and/or refractory disease. Subjects&#xD;
             must have received at least 3 prior anti-myeloma treatment regimens (note: induction&#xD;
             with or without bone marrow transplant and with or without maintenance therapy is&#xD;
             considered one regimen). Subjects must be refractory to the last anti-myeloma&#xD;
             treatment regimen prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A regimen that included an immunomodulatory agent (eg, thalidomide, lenalidomide,&#xD;
                  pomalidomide) and a proteasome inhibitor (eg, bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib),&#xD;
                  either alone or in combination. Subjects must have undergone at least 2&#xD;
                  consecutive cycles of treatment for each regimen unless progressive disease was&#xD;
                  the best response to the regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Anti-CD38 (eg, daratumumab) as part of a combination regimen or as a monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects who were not candidates to receive one or more of the above treatments (ie,&#xD;
             contraindicated) are eligible; the reason for not receiving treatment must be clearly&#xD;
             documented in the case report form.&#xD;

             Monoclonal plasmaproliferative disorder, Skin changes (POEMS) syndrome; or symptomatic&#xD;
             amyloidosis&#xD;

             curatively treated localized prostate cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ on biopsy or&#xD;
             a squamous intraepithelial lesion on Pap smear, and in situ breast cancer that has&#xD;
             been completely resected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Require systemic immunosuppressive therapies (eg, calcineurin inhibitors,&#xD;
             methotrexate, mycophenolate, rapamycin, thalidomide, immunosuppressive antibodies such&#xD;
             as anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-6 receptor [IL-6R])&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Prior CAR T-cell or other genetically-modified T-cell therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Prior treatment with a BCMA-targeted agent&#xD;
&#xD;

             paresis, aphasia, stroke, severe brain injuries, dementia, Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
             cerebellar disease, organic brain syndrome, or psychosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Untreated or active infection at time of initial screening, at the time of&#xD;
             leukapheresis, within 72 hrs before lymphodepletion, or 5 days before JWCAR129&#xD;
             infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of any of the following cardiovascular conditions within 6 months of initial&#xD;
             screening: Class III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association&#xD;
             (NYHA), myocardial infarction, unstable angina, uncontrolled or symptomatic atrial&#xD;
             arrhythmias, any ventricular arrhythmias, or other clinically significant cardiac&#xD;
             disease&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the protocol-mandated&#xD;
             or recommended agents used in this study&#xD;
