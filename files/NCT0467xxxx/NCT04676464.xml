  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to evaluate the validity of bedside US of QMLT and MF-BIA by&#xD;
      comparing measurements from US and MF-BIA to those estimates of lean body mass obtained from&#xD;
      CT Scan of abdomen when done for clinical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to observe a high degree of correlation between these 3 baseline&#xD;
      measures and the changes in US measures and MF-BIA over time to correlate with changes to CT&#xD;
      Scan measures of lean body mass.&#xD;

      The overall objective is to evaluate the validity of bedside US of QMLT and MF-BIA by&#xD;
      comparing measurements from US and MF-BIA to those estimates of lean body mass obtained from&#xD;
      CT Scan of abdomen when done for clinical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to observe a high degree of correlation between these 3 baseline&#xD;
      measures and the changes in US measures and MF-BIA over time to correlate with changes to CT&#xD;
      Scan measures of lean body mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi center, prospective, observation study across 5-6 intensive care units which&#xD;
      will enroll 200 participants over a 12 month enrollment period followed by a 6 month period&#xD;
      to complete data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll a broad heterogeneous participant population who will be admitted to&#xD;
      the ICU for inpatient care. We are particularly interested in the cohort of participant with&#xD;
      trauma but will enroll non-trauma participants who have CT scans as well to do some between&#xD;
      group comparisons. Participants enrolled to this study will be followed until they are&#xD;
      discharged from the index hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, observational study therefore no specific interventions will be&#xD;
      associated with this study. The following information will be collected and recorded during&#xD;
      ICU and hospital stay:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT Images - All abdominal CT images conducted during the index hospitalization ordered for&#xD;
      clinical purposes will be retrieved to precisely quantify muscle and adipose tissue mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound - A portable ultrasound will be completed as soon as possible following the&#xD;
      initial CT Scan, and again while a participant remains in hospital for each follow up CT of&#xD;
      the abdomen for clinical reasons, where feasible, unless it is within a week of the previous&#xD;
      CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple Frequency Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (MF-BIA) -MF-BIA is a non-invasive and&#xD;
      simple-to-use method of measuring body composition and nutritional status in the clinical&#xD;
      setting. MF-BIA measurements will be conducted every time an US measurement is done in the&#xD;
      ICU following a CT Scan done for clinical reasons, unless it is within a week of the previous&#xD;
      CT Scan and accompanying MF-BIA. After discharge from the ICU to the hospital, where&#xD;
      feasible, MF BIA will be done every time an ultrasound is done following CT scans done for&#xD;
      clinical reasons, unless it is within a week of the previous CT Scan and accompanying MF-BIA.&#xD;
      MF-BIA will not be done on individuals with a pacemaker, Baseline patient demographics data&#xD;
      and nutritional adequacy data will be collected.&#xD;
