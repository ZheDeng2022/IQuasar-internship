  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a powerful motivator of behavior and it is more than the perception of nociceptive&#xD;
      input. It is a complex experience that comprises different components: sensory&#xD;
      discriminative, emotional-motivational and cognitive components. In chronic pain, a negative&#xD;
      hedonic shift has been proposed that is characterized by disproportionally increased&#xD;
      emotional-motivational compared to sensory-discriminative pain components. Such a negative&#xD;
      hedonic shift is mirrored in a high comorbidity of chronic pain with affective disorders like&#xD;
      depression and anxiety. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying such a negative&#xD;
      hedonic shift i remain elusive. Animal work suggests an involvement of neuroinflammation,&#xD;
      caused by chronic pain, which in turn is related to impaired release of the neurotransmitter&#xD;
      dopamine. In line with this observation, impaired dopamine functioning has been described in&#xD;
      chronic pain. Importantly, dopamine acts also as a neuromodulator, regulating functional&#xD;
      connectivity between brain regions. Therefore, dysfunctional dopamine in chronic pain,&#xD;
      possibly caused by neuroinflammation, might lead to altered functional connectivity.&#xD;
      Correspondingly, altered functional connectivity in fronto-striatal brain networks has been&#xD;
      shown to be predictive of transition from subacute to chronic pain. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate the psychobiological mechanisms underlying the negative hedonic shift in&#xD;
      chronic pain with a focus on the causal role of neuroinflammation (substudy 1) and the role&#xD;
      of dopamine (substudy 2) in functional connectivity of fronto-striatal brain networks and&#xD;
      their relation to heightened emotional-motivational pain processing.&#xD;

      Pain is a powerful motivator of behavior and it is more than the perception of nociceptive&#xD;
      input. It is a complex experience that comprises different components: sensory&#xD;
      discriminative, emotional-motivational and cognitive components. In chronic pain, a negative&#xD;

      Correspondingly, altered functional connectivity in fronto-striatal brain networks has been&#xD;
      shown to be predictive of transition from subacute to chronic pain. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate the psychobiological mechanisms underlying the negative hedonic shift in&#xD;
      chronic pain with a focus on the causal role of neuroinflammation (substudy 1) and the role&#xD;
      of dopamine (substudy 2) in functional connectivity of fronto-striatal brain networks and&#xD;
      their relation to heightened emotional-motivational pain processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential benefit of the study will be an increase in our knowledge on mechanisms of the&#xD;
      development and maintenance of chronic pain in humans with a focus on emotional-motivational&#xD;
      processes, deemed to be of very high relevance in this context. Importantly, by implementing&#xD;
      and testing a novel conceptual framework, the results will be relevant not only to pain&#xD;
      research but also to a broader neuroscientific community, because the expected results also&#xD;
      relate to affective and motivational processes in other diseases (e.g. depression, anxiety,&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease). The proposed project offers novel avenues to pain treatment based on&#xD;
      pharmacological and psychological mechanisms-based approach instead of being&#xD;
      symptoms-oriented as most available pain treatments at the moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study entails more than minimal risks and burdens for participants, because both&#xD;
      substudies incorporate the intake of drugs. However, both substudies comprise only low doses&#xD;
      and/or single doses. Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) will be administered in substudy 1 for 12&#xD;
      weeks in chronic pain patients with fibromyalgia to down-regulate microglial activation.&#xD;
      Previous studies indicated only very few side-effects. In substudy 2, patients with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia and healthy participants will receive a single dose of the dopamine agonist&#xD;
      bromocriptine (1.25 mg, p.o.) or a placebo in separate testing sessions. Healthy participants&#xD;
      will receive in an additional testing session a single dose of the dopamine antagonist&#xD;
      amisulpride (400 mg, p.o.). Both drugs have been repeatedly used in research with the same&#xD;
      dosages with no or very few side effects. The methods that will be used in the experimental&#xD;
      testing sessions are within the range of standard procedures in pain research and&#xD;
      experimental psychology and are frequently used in healthy participants and patients.&#xD;
      Experimental pain stimulation will be adjusted to individual pain sensitivity, rendering the&#xD;
      applied stimulation tolerable. Magnetic resonance imaging, including spectroscopy, will be&#xD;
      performed without a contrast medium. Peripheral venous blood sampling will be performed by an&#xD;
      expert medical professional. The risk of unauthorized data access or unwanted identification&#xD;
      of participants will be minimized by the use of restricted access to data and facilities,&#xD;
      lockable cabinets, and password protected computers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will be divided into two groups, one receiving low dose naltrexone (LDN), the&#xD;
      other placebo for 12 weeks. Before and after this 12 week pharmacological intervention, each&#xD;
      patient will undergo a MRI testing session at Balgrist Campus, Balgrist Hospital ZÃ¼rich. A&#xD;
      placebocontrolled design is chosen here in addition to the pre-/post-pharmacological&#xD;
      intervention comparison, because microglia activation has been investigated only a few times&#xD;
      in chronic pain patients so far and due to unknown possible natural variation in microglia&#xD;
      activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent will be obtained from each participant after explaining the purpose and the&#xD;
      course of the experiment. At the beginning of each testing session, pain assessments will be&#xD;
      performed, which include assessment of participants' individual heat pain threshold and&#xD;
      tolerance. After this assessment, a blood sample will be taken to assess the erythrocyte&#xD;
      sedimentation rate (ESR), after which participants will be positioned inside the MRI scanner&#xD;
      for magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and to acquire fMRI (functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging) images while participants will perform a behavioral discrimination task and an&#xD;
      avoidance task to assess sensory-discriminative and emotional-motivational pain components.&#xD;
      After completion of these tasks, resting state fMRI will be performed followed by a&#xD;
      structural fMRI acquisition. Further, participants will be asked to complete some&#xD;
      questionnaires. In addition, some trait questionnaires will be filled out during the first&#xD;
      testing session. The duration of each of MRI testing session will be 2.5-3h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample consists of fibromyalgia patients and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. While&#xD;
      healthy controls undergo three testing sessions to assess the effects of a dopamine receptor&#xD;
      antagonist and agonist in comparison to placebo, fibromyalgia patients do only two testing&#xD;
      sessions assessing only the effects of a dopamine agonist in comparison to a placebo, because&#xD;
      for these patients the presence of a hypodopaminergic state is assumed. Thus, each session&#xD;
      comprises the intake of a single dose of a drug or placebo and MRI scanning. Healthy controls&#xD;
      will take in amisulpride (dopamine receptor antagonist), bromocriptine (dopamine receptor&#xD;
      agonist), and placebo and fibromyalgia patients bromocriptine and placebo in a&#xD;
      counterbalanced order. At the beginning of the first session, written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from the participants after explaining them the purpose and the course of the&#xD;
      experiment. After intake of the capsules containing drug/placebo, there will be a waiting&#xD;
      period to reach the peak plasma concentration of the drugs during MRI scanning. During this&#xD;
      waiting period, participants will fill out some questionnaires. Before the MRI scanning, in&#xD;
      each testing session, pain assessments will be performed, which includes assessment of&#xD;
      participants individual heat pain threshold and tolerance. This will be followed by taking a&#xD;
      blood sample to determine the plasma concentration of the drug after which participants will&#xD;
      be positioned inside the MRI scanner. During MRI scanning, participants will perform a&#xD;
      behavioral discrimination task and an avoidance task to assess sensory-discriminative and&#xD;
      emotional-motivational pain components. After completion of these tasks, resting state fMRI&#xD;
      will be performed followed by a structural MRI acquisition for obtaining anatomical images.&#xD;
      The duration for each testing session is 2.5-3h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample sizes for substudy 1 and 2 are based on a priori sample size calculations using&#xD;
      G*Power 3.1 with a desired medium effect size f= 0.25, alpha = 0.05, beta= 0.95, repeated&#xD;
      measures ANOVA within-between subject designs, and an attrition rate of 10%. Outcome&#xD;
      variables will be analyzed in separate mixed model analyses for ANOVA designs with&#xD;
      appropriate within- and between-subject factors. Associations of primary endpoints with&#xD;
      questionnaire scores (secondary outcomes) will be analyzed using Pearson- or Spearman&#xD;
      correlation coefficients, where appropriate. Significance levels will be set to 5%, adjusted&#xD;
      with false discovery rate for multiple testing. Effect sizes will be calculated in terms of&#xD;
      generalized eta-squared (Î·G2) and Cohen's d. Spectroscopy data will be analyzed using a&#xD;
      linear combination model. Concentrations of MI, Cho, and NAA (N-Acetyl Aspartate) will be&#xD;
      computed using peak height relative to creatine (Cr) and compared using mixed model analyses&#xD;
      for ANOVA designs. Images from fMRI analysis of each participant will undergo standard&#xD;
      preprocessing (including high-pass filtering, motion correction, spatial smoothing) and will&#xD;
      be entered into a voxel-wise analysis using a general linear model to estimate the effects of&#xD;
      pharmacological interventions on pain-related brain activity related to&#xD;
      emotional-motivational and sensory-discriminative pain responses. For all brain analyses, a&#xD;
      voxel-threshold of p&lt;0.01 and a cluster threshold for spatial extent of p&lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this study, pharmacological interventions, psychophysical methods, and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging will be utilized to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms involved in&#xD;
      a negative hedonic shift in chronic pain. Low dose naltrexone will transiently down-regulate&#xD;
      neuroinflammation in chronic pain patients. Pharmacological interventions (amisulpride and&#xD;
      bromocriptine) will only cause a transient manipulation of dopaminergic system in both&#xD;
      healthy controls and fibromyalgia patients. The pharmacological interventions proposed in the&#xD;
      current study does not have a clinical intervention value, instead they are only used for the&#xD;
      purpose of investigating psychobiological mechanisms underlying chronic pain. Psychophysical&#xD;
      methods will allow the investigators to dissociate the emotional-motivational component of&#xD;
      pain from its sensory discriminant component. Magnetic resonance imaging will allow the&#xD;
      investigators to investigate brain responses and neuroinflammation in relation to chronic&#xD;
      pain. Based on these methods, the investigators will get insights on the role of dopamine and&#xD;
      fronto-striatal connectivity in regulating the emotional component of pain in chronic pain.&#xD;
      The usage of the pharmacological interventions in this study hold more than minimal risks for&#xD;
      the participants, but according to previous research studies, in which the same dosage of&#xD;
      these pharmacologic drugs were used, only minimal side-effects have been observed (see above&#xD;
      &quot;Risk/Benefit Assessment&quot;). Psychophysical methods and pharmacological interventions based on&#xD;
      experimental psychology and pain research will be used in this study. These methods have been&#xD;
      shown to be successful in investigating the different aspects of pain perception and&#xD;
      modulation of pain perception. The methods used are in the standard range of methods from&#xD;
      human pain research and experimental psychology. The expected results will form the basis for&#xD;
      the development of novel mechanism-based pain therapies.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The drugs that will be used in both substudies will not be utilized as therapeutic clinical interventions, but as modulators of endogenous process and to assess psychobiological mechanisms in pain processing. Substudy 1 incorporates a 12-weeks a pharmacological intervention (low-dose naltrexone or placebo) in patients with fibromyalgia. Two MRI scanning sessions will be conducted (pre- and post-treatment). In substudy 2, healthy controls will be administered placebo or a dopamine agonist (bromocriptine) or a dopamine antagonist (amisulpride) on separate days to investigate the role of dopamine and fronto-striatal functional connectivity in relation to emotional-motivational component of pain. Fibromyalgia patients in substudy 2 will receive only placebo or a dopamine agonist to see the effects of normalization of dopamine on fronto-striatal connectivity, because a lowered dopamine level is assumed to decrease the emotional-motivational component of pain.</intervention_model_description>
