  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current prospective randomized controlled trial would aim to study the efficacy of&#xD;
      targeted albumin therapy versus standard medical treatment in reduction in 6-month mortality&#xD;
      in recurrent ascites in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Additionally, we aim to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of albumin in decreasing the incidence of complications: paracentesis&#xD;
      induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD), AKI, hyponatremia, bacterial infections, hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy and variceal bleed, impact on systemic hemodynamics and portal pressures,&#xD;
      renal reserve as assessed by biomarkers and on immunomodulation. In this open labeled&#xD;
      randomized study, consecutive cirrhotic patients, fulfilling the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized to 2 groups by the clinical trial coordinator (CTC). The CTC&#xD;
      will be blind to the patient and treatment received, and the allocation concealment by the&#xD;
      sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes (SNOSE) technique would be done. Patients would&#xD;
      be assessed every 2 weeks for first 8 weeks with serum albumin levels, ascites grade and use&#xD;
      of diuretics and then every 3 months. The treatment would receive targeted albumin therapy as&#xD;
      detailed in methods while patients in the other group would receive standard medical&#xD;
      treatment. The primary outcome of the study would be evaluation of 6-month mortality while&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures would be the incidence of liver-related complications at 3, 6 and&#xD;
      12 months, survival free of liver transplant and TIPS in both groups at 6 months and 1 year,&#xD;
      improvement in quality of Life as assessed by short form survey-36 version (SF-36) at 6 and&#xD;
      12 months, improvement in renal reserve (as assessed by renal biomarkers) at 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months, reduction in the frequency of large volume paracentesis at 3, 6 and 12 months and&#xD;
      change in immune parameters at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;

      Methodology DOSING REGIMEN (Describe the subject or animal dosing) In this open labeled&#xD;
      randomized study, consecutive cirrhotic patients, fulfilling the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Details of sample size calculation are&#xD;
      given under section of statistical methods. Severity of liver disease will be assessed&#xD;
      according to severity scores- CTP and MELD score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized to 2 groups by the clinical trial coordinator (CTC). The CTC&#xD;
      will be blind to the patient and treatment received, and the allocation concealment by the&#xD;
      sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes (SNOSE) technique would be done. Patients would&#xD;
      be assessed at 2 weeks, 4 weeks with serum albumin levels, ascites grade and use of diuretics&#xD;
      and then every 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A- Would receive standard medical treatment (details as in patients for Group B) plus&#xD;
      Targeted albumin therapy would be given as under:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with serum albumin &lt;3 g/L with recurrent ascites - Will receive 20 % albumin at 60&#xD;
      grams/week until target serum albumin of 3.0 g/L is achieved following this patients would&#xD;
      get 40 grams of albumin every week until ascites resolution or serum albumin &gt;3.5 g/L.&#xD;
      Patients who achieve this target will continue with 20 gm/week until patient has complete&#xD;
      resolution of ascites and serum albumin &gt;3.5 gm/L or a maximum of 6 months following this&#xD;
      patients would receive albumin 20 gms once every 2 weeks Group B: Standard Medical Treatment-&#xD;
      Salt-restriction, diuretics with large volume paracentesis These patients will be put on low&#xD;
      sodium diet (2 g/day) and will be given a combination of loop diuretic (furosemide 40-160&#xD;
      mg/day) and a distal acting diuretic (spironolactone 100-400 mg/day) with dose escalation by&#xD;
      one step at a time with monitoring for side-effects. Large volume paracentesis (LVP) will be&#xD;
      performed along with intravenous albumin (8 g/L ascites removed) as required with record of&#xD;
      the frequency of taps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: 2 week, 4 weeks then every 3 months for 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Important definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent ascites will be defined as ascites that recurs on at least three occasions within a&#xD;
      12-month period despite dietary sodium restriction and adequate diuretic doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ascites resolution would be defined as absence of clinical ascites (ascites grade 0 or 1)&#xD;
      which can either be partial- Would be defined as resolution of ascites on diuretics and&#xD;
      complete would be defined as resolution of ascites without the need of diuretics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations: Baseline HVPG with assessment of portal (systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics)&#xD;
      and cardiac hemodynamics, cystatin C, plain CT scan for assessment of sarcopenia. Body&#xD;
      weight, blood pressure and echocardiogram would be done for all patients. Glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (GFR) will be estimated by using eGFR equations -modification of diet in&#xD;
      renal disease (MDRD6) and Cystatin C based (Chronic kidney disease Epidemiology&#xD;
      Collaboration). Along with this, arterial blood sample will be collected after overnight fast&#xD;
      and bed rest at least for 8 h in supine position for plasma renin activity, plasma&#xD;
      aldosterone and plasma norepinephrine concentration. A baseline urinalysis with assessment of&#xD;
      urinary sodium would also be done for all enrolled patients. Patients would subsequently&#xD;
      undergo HVPG after 3-6 months and cystatin C every 3 months. Apart from this, urine&#xD;
      neutrophil-gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), plasma renin activity and serum&#xD;
      aldosterone levels would be performed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. A repeat plain CT scan to&#xD;
      assess sarcopenia would be done at 3 months and at 6 months. The follow up would be 1 year or&#xD;
      until TIPS or liver transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Albumin related immunological assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering immunomodulation as an important mechanism of action of albumin. Additional&#xD;
      experiments would be done at baseline, 3 and 6 months to assess the albumin isoforms (HMA,&#xD;
      HNA1, HNA2, IMA) , levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines (multiplex&#xD;
      luminex based cytokine array) , inflammatory mediators (C-Reactive Protein, endotoxin assay,&#xD;
      compliment proteins; DAMPS ); Frequency and functional profile of innate immune cells&#xD;
      (monocytes, neutrophills)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Albumin isoforms analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemicals Change in albumin isoform will be done by quantification of different albumin&#xD;
      modification(HMA, HNA1, HNA2, IMA) on an electron spray ionization orbitrap HRMS system &quot;(Q&#xD;
      Exative plus) mass spectrometer coupled to UHPLC from Thermoscientific USA.Briefly the&#xD;
      isolated plasma of patients blood at given time point (day 0 and three month) will be diluted&#xD;
      with distilled water at a 1:4,000 ratio, and then 8 uL of this diluted plasma will be&#xD;
      injected into the high performance liquid chromatography-electron spray ionization MS system.&#xD;
      High-performance liquid chromatography separation will be performed on a reverse-phase C8&#xD;
      column (Agilent ZORBAX RRHD 300SB-C8, 2.1 mm id 3 50 mm, 1.8 lm threaded column with a pore&#xD;
      size of 300 Ã…) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/minute using an H2O-acetonitrile (with 0.1% formic&#xD;
      acid) solvent system under a gradient of 90% H2O to 90% acetonitrile over a period of 25&#xD;
      minutes with acquisition starting at 3 minutes. Under auto-MS conditions, mass spectral&#xD;
      analysis will be performed. A similar analysis will also be performed with exogenous albumin&#xD;
      solution. The obtained compound electron spray ionization MS spectra will be analyzed using&#xD;
      the software Protein Deconvolution soft warre (thermoscientific germany). Here, after&#xD;
      minimizing the base peak chromatogram from the total ion chromatogram, albumin mass&#xD;
      chromatograms will be obtained and analyzed. The obtained albumin spectra will then be&#xD;
      deconvoluted within mass range from 66,000-67,000 Da (as the molecular weight [MW] of various&#xD;
      albumin isoforms fall within this range. Finally, from the intensity of the peaks, the&#xD;
      abundance of albumin isoforms will be measured and the relative abundance of the various HSA&#xD;
      isoforms will be reported as described in Das et.al 2017. This will be performed at baseline&#xD;
      and 3 months. ( Mass spectrometry (MS)-grade water, acetonitrile, and formic acid will be&#xD;
      purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Purified HSA was purchased from Baxter&#xD;
      (Gurgaon, India). All reagents will be of analytical grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokine array A panel of 45 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors will be analyzed in&#xD;
      blood plasma of patients group at baseline and 3 months using a Bio-Plex multiplex cytokine&#xD;
      bead assay system (Bio-Rad, CA) as per the manufacturer's protocol. The intra-assay and inter&#xD;
      assay coefficient of variation considered for multiplex assays will be &lt; 5%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innate Immune cells profiling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total whole blood will be collected from patients pre and post therapy and evaluated for %&#xD;
      frequency of monocytes by staining with fluorochrome labeled anti-CD14 anti CD16 and for&#xD;
      neutrophils anti-CD11b anti CD16 anti-CD15, anti-CD66b and will acquired and anlaysed using&#xD;
      flow cytometry FACS verse (BD biosciences). For the functional profiling of innate immune&#xD;
      cells, the blood will be divided into two parts. The PBMCs will be isolated using&#xD;
      ficoll-hypaque (Himedia) and monocytes will be isolated using CD14 isolation kit from&#xD;
      miltenyi biotech as per the manufacture protocol. Whereas, other part of the blood will be&#xD;
      used to isolate the neutrophils using gran-hypaque (Himedia). The intracellular cytokines&#xD;
      such as IFN-y, TNF-a, IL-1b will be analysed after low dose of LPS stimulation. Also,&#xD;
      phagocytic burst or ROS generation will be done using manufacturer's described protocol.&#xD;
      Again the data will be acquired and anlysed using FACS verse (BD biosciences).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seahorse metabolic analysis methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect on energy metabolism of monocytes (that guide the functional property of immune cells)&#xD;
      we be analyzed by measuring the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen&#xD;
      consumption rate (OCR) through Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer instrument in&#xD;
      peripheral blood monocytes of patients at baseline and 3 months as a measure of lactate&#xD;
      production (a surrogate for the glycolytic rate) and OXPHOS respectively. In brief, monocytes&#xD;
      will be isolated from freshly collected blood using CD14 isolation kit from miltenyi biotech&#xD;
      as per the manufacture protocol. Isolated monocytes will be seeded in triplicate at a density&#xD;
      of 1X105 cells per well. Prior to starting the assay, cells will be incubated in Seahorse&#xD;
      Assay Medium supplemented with 10 mM glucose and 1 mM sodium pyruvate and glutamine in 37Â°C&#xD;
      incubator without CO2 for 45 min. Further change in parameters of oxidative phosphorylation&#xD;
      will be calculated by a real-time change in OCR in response to treatment with Oligomycin&#xD;
      (ATPase inhibitor, 1 Î¼M), FCCP (0.2 Î¼M) and rotenone (0.5 Î¼M).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT POPULATION/PRE-CLINICAL MODEL (Describe the subject population including&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria or animal model)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A randomized controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted on patients admitted to Department of Hepatology from August&#xD;
           2020 to August 2022 at ILBS, New Delhi&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study group will comprise of patients of decompensated cirrhosis with recurrent ascites&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size calculation: In the randomized controlled trial by Singh et al (Journal of&#xD;
      Hepatology 2012) the 90-day mortality in patients of recurrent ascites on midodrine was 15/20&#xD;
      (75%) vs. 8/20(40% ) in the standard medical treatment group (large volume paracentesis and&#xD;
      albumin infusions). Assuming that the survival for albumin is 75% and with SMT is 40%, then&#xD;
      with alpha of 5% and power 90% we need to enroll 90 cases i.e 45 cases in each group. Further&#xD;
      assuming 10% drop out rate we need to enroll 100 cases 50 each group and randomly allocated&#xD;
      with block randomisation method with block size taken as 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proportion of survival in the treatment group at a given time point = 0.75 Proportion of&#xD;
      survival in the control group at a given time point = 0.40 Hazard ratio = 3.19 Power (%) = 90&#xD;
      Alpha Error (%) = 5 Sided = 2 Required sample size for treatment group = 45 Required sample&#xD;
      size for control group = 45 Alpha Error (%) Power (%) First Group Second Group 5 70 27 27 80&#xD;
      34 34 90 45 45&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Targeted albumin therapy Monitoring and Assessment: Follow up: 2 weeks, 4&#xD;
      weeks, 3 months, then every 3 months for 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All variables shall be expressed in mean (sd) or median (range)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variables will be compared by Mann- Whitney U test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Categorical variables we will use Chi-Square or Fisher's test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival analysis will be done using Cox-proportional regression analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Actuarial probability of survival shall be calculated by Kaplan- Meier graph and&#xD;
           compared by log- rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Competing risk survival analysis with competing events as TIPS and liver transplant&#xD;
           would be performed Adverse Effects: Allergic reactions to albumin, worsening of dyspnea,&#xD;
           volume overload Stopping rule: Reaction to albumin infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issues in the study and plans to address these issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no ethical issues with respect to the trial protocol. Albumin is routinely&#xD;
      recommended for the management of patients with cirrhosis with ascites. In a large&#xD;
      multicentric trial it was shown that high dose of albumin of 40 grams/week improved outcomes&#xD;
      in cirrhotics with uncomplicated ascites. This however lacks clinical application based on&#xD;
      feasibility to provide high doses in a resource constraint country like India. Our data would&#xD;
      therefore provide a targeted approach (escalation/de-escalation) based on response&#xD;
      individualised for each patient and its effect on imrpving overall outcomes. The study drug&#xD;
      would be provided free of cost and the cost of special investigations which are not part of&#xD;
      the standard of care would not be borne by the patients.&#xD;
