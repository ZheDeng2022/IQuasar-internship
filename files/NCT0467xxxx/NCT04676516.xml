      This is a phase II, randomized, open label, multi-center, parallel design, window of&#xD;
      opportunity trial in up to 60 patients with early stage Hormone Receptor (HR) positive breast&#xD;
      cancer evaluating GSK3326595. In a 2:1 randomization, patients will receive GSK3326595:no&#xD;
