    <textblock>
      This trial will be open to all Michigan Medicine Department of Family Medicine faculty,&#xD;
      resident, or staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will consist of asking participants the &quot;3 Good Things&quot; based on positive&#xD;
      psychology theory. Participants will be asked to list three things that went well that day&#xD;
      and to consider their role in these outcomes. Pre and post surveys will be completed to&#xD;
      evaluate this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the trial the study team will also select a limited number of entries from&#xD;
      participants to share some of the &quot;good things&quot; which people listed. These will be edited to&#xD;
      ensure writer anonymity and participants will be informed of this plan in the study&#xD;
      introduction.&#xD;
