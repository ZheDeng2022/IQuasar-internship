      1. The investigators want to test the hypothesis that a total period of 12 months of&#xD;
           stepwise open egg introduction is not inferior when compared to a total period of 20&#xD;
           months gradual open egg introduction of a certain egg product (see steps for the&#xD;
           specific egg products) with regard to full egg tolerance induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Step 1: open baked egg test passed (either at home or in the hospital): this is routine&#xD;
           clinical practice; afterwards daily intake of increasing amounts of heated egg (amounts&#xD;
           to be noted in diary)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Step 2: open provocation test at home with 10 minutes hard-boiled egg, both hen's egg&#xD;
           white and yolk, passed; afterwards weekly intake of either hard-boiled egg white or yolk&#xD;
           or both (amounts and days to be noted in diary)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Step 3: open provocation test at home with omelet, pancake or scrambled egg passed;&#xD;
           afterwards weekly or two-weekly intake of one of these specific preparation forms or of&#xD;
           the previous preparation forms (amounts, days and preparation to be noted in diary)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Step 4: open provocation test at home with 4 minutes fried or poached egg or softly&#xD;
           boiled egg with liquid yolk; afterwards regular intake of one of these preparation forms&#xD;
           or one of the prior steps (amounts, days and preparation to be noted in diary)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Step 5: open provocation test at home with &quot;raw&quot; egg: eg. In chocolate mousse;&#xD;
           mayonnaise or tiramisu; afterwards unlimited intake of all egg containing preparation&#xD;
           forms (for 3 months in both groups to be noted in the diary)&#xD;
&#xD;
           If tolerance to a certain step is not yet present (this is: if any reaction occurred&#xD;
           during the months registered between two steps), the next step will be postponed with&#xD;
           the length of the previous step. The number of failures (any reaction in relation to egg&#xD;
           ingestion), the type of reaction and the additional time period necessary before the&#xD;
           next step can be taken, will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators will also study the time to complete tolerance in the complete cohort&#xD;
           (this is the time to complete step 1 to step 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Furthermore, the investigators want to study the induction of IL-10-producing&#xD;
           ICOS-expressing hen's egg specific Treg cells in vitro paralleling tolerance induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The investigators also want to study whether we can correlate the results of the&#xD;
           in-house developed in vitro BAT with different heated hen's egg ingredients to the&#xD;
           results of the egg provocation test and whether BAT could substitute for egg OFC tests&#xD;
           for the different steps in the future.&#xD;
