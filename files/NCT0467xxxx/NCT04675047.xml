  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide. However, the pain sensitivity of&#xD;
      individuals varies to a large extent, which often results in the mismatch between clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis or treatment and individual's actual needs. There are still no established&#xD;
      objective indicators for comparisons between individuals. This integrated pilot project is&#xD;
      the first large-scale, multi-modal brain decoding study for pain sensitivity. We will explore&#xD;
      the brain network signature of pain sensitivity by analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG)&#xD;
      signals and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI.) Meanwhile, we will integrate the innate,&#xD;
      environmental, and humanity factors with aforementioned brain network signatures to establish&#xD;
      multi- modal objective model of pain sensitivity using machine learning. This research team&#xD;
      is composed of more than 30 physicians, scientists, and IT experts, along with international&#xD;
      collaborators with expertise in the fields of neuroscience, medical imaging, and human&#xD;
      philosophy. The five elite groups constitute this international research team and establish&#xD;
      five multi-disciplinary sub-projects: Sub-project A： Pain sensitivity and associated innate&#xD;
      and environmental factors Sub-project B： Electrophysiological brain signatures of pain&#xD;
      sensitivity Sub-project C： MRI brain signatures of pain sensitivity Sub-project D： Innovative&#xD;
      brain computer interface (BCI) technology in pain sensitivity measurement and prediction&#xD;
      Sub-project E： Pain and Art: neuro-mental mechanisms and potential applications There are&#xD;
      three key features of this integrated project: scientific novelty, technology and humanity.&#xD;
      In terms of scientific novelty, in addition to machine learning and big data applications, we&#xD;
      will focus on the deep brain structure such as brainstem, in which the image acquisition has&#xD;
      been difficult in the past. We will develop an MRI sequence and EEG protocol optimized for&#xD;
      brainstem. In terms of technology, we will develop a wearable EEG cap implanted with&#xD;
      algorithm chip for clinical measurement to decode the pain sensitivity real time. In terms of&#xD;
      humanity, we will combine music and painting appreciation to explore their impact on brain&#xD;
      signatures related to pain sensitivity. Furthermore, we will develop potential applications&#xD;
      of art intervention in pain modulation. We expect this pilot project to achieve the four&#xD;
      following goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish a Taiwan database of pain sensitivity. Meanwhile, to clarify the&#xD;
           interactions between the innate and environmental factors of the individual and the&#xD;
           brain network, and to identify brain signatures related to pain sensitivity. (sub-&#xD;
           projects A, B, C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To confirm the brain signatures for predicting the pain sensitivity using machine&#xD;
           learning. In addition, to develop wearable devices such as EEG cap for large sample&#xD;
           screening by combining the brain-computer interface through the industry-university&#xD;
           cooperation (sub-projects B, C, D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore the plasticity of brain signatures related to pain sensitivity by sensory&#xD;
           modulation such as music, painting appreciation or transcutaneous electrical nerve&#xD;
           stimulation, and to explore the application potential for pain modulation (sub-projects&#xD;
           B, C, D, E)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Based on the cooperation model of this international research team, we will cultivate&#xD;
           young researchers, and promote academic interactions among different team members, and&#xD;
           improve the international visibility and competitiveness of Taiwan (sub-projects A, B,&#xD;
           C, D, E)&#xD;
