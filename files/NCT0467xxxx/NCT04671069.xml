&#xD;
          -  Gilbert's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal anatomy or motility,&#xD;
             hepatic and/or renal function that could interfere with the absorption, metabolism,&#xD;
             and/or excretion of study drug (Cholecystectomy is allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal screening ECG: including machine-read QTcF &gt;450 msec in men and QTcF &gt; 470&#xD;
             msec in women (confirmed by manual over read) or any rhythm other than normal sinus&#xD;
             rhythm which is interpreted by the Investigator to be clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to a similar study drug, thyroid medication, or a history of&#xD;
             important drug or other allergy (except for untreated, asymptomatic seasonal allergies&#xD;
