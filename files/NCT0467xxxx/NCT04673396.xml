      In this study, patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors were enrolled for a&#xD;
      tolerance test and a pharmacokinetic study. The dosage increment principle of 3+3 was&#xD;
      adopted. At the end of the tolerance test, 3 dose groups (low, medium and high) were selected&#xD;
      to conduct pharmacokinetic studies after evaluation by the researchers on the premise of good&#xD;
      safety, and at least 8 patients were included in each group for PK study (at least 8 patients&#xD;
      in each group could be evaluated for PK ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of the experimental drug tolerance and pharmacokinetics study, the safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of single dose administration were compared with that of sodium&#xD;
      norcantharidate for injection in the dose range of clinical use.&#xD;

    <description>The design is based on 3+3 dose escalation: three subjects were enrolled in each dose group, administered once a day for 2 weeks, and were observed for 7 days after withdrawal. If dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was not observed, the dose was incresed to the next dose group. If dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was found in 2 or more patients in a given dose group, the climbing test was terminated and the dose was reduced by 1 dose. If there were only three subjects, three more subjects were observed, so that the MTD dose group had at least six evaluable subjects.If DLT occurs in 1 patient in a given dose group, 3 more subjects should be added to that dose group. If DLT occurs in 1 or more of these 3 subjects, the climb will be stopped and the dose group will be reduced by 1 dose group. If there are only 3 subjects, 3 more subjects will be observed, so that at least 6 patients in the MTD dose group can be evaluated.</description>

    <description>At the same time of tolerance test, blood PK sampling was performed. At the end of the tolerance test in each group, on the premise of good safety, and after evaluation by the researchers, additional cases were selected from the three dose groups (low, medium and high) for pharmacokinetic study, so as to ensure that at least 8 patients could be evaluated for PK in each group.</description>
