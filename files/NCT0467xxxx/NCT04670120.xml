      The new drug pyrifazimine (previous name: TBI-166) developed by the Institute of Materia&#xD;
      Medica of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences which is Beijing Union Pharmaceutical&#xD;
      Second Factory relied on is obtained by retaining the key skeleton of the lead drug&#xD;
      clofazimine which can exert its efficacy and modification by introducing moderate polar&#xD;
      groups structural. While the drug has strong activity against tuberculosis-sensitive bacteria&#xD;
      and drug-resistant bacteria in vivo and in vitro, its pharmacokinetic properties and skin&#xD;
      staining side effects have been significantly improved compared with the lead drugs, so that&#xD;
      the drug can achieve the goal that reducing fat solubility, accelerating metabolism in the&#xD;
      body, reducing skin staining and reducing side effects. In addition, pyrifazimine has a weak&#xD;
      effect on liver drug enzymes, and is suitable for combined use in the clinical treatment of&#xD;
      tuberculosis. The development of the drug is expected to provide a new method for the&#xD;
      clinical treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis, benefit patients, and produce good social&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In November 2016, the new anti-drug-resistant tuberculosis drug pyrifazimine and its tablets&#xD;
      (formerly chemical drug registration classification 1.1) obtained the drug clinical approval&#xD;
      issued by the CFDA (batch number: 2016L10025/2016L09987), and were approved the clinical&#xD;
      stage research that development of drug-resistant tuberculosis adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with relevant requirements of drug registration regulations, technical&#xD;
      guidelines, etc., this project has completed the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      clinical trials of a single dose of pyrifazimine tablets in healthy subjects, i.e. Phase Ia&#xD;
      clinical trials test.&#xD;
