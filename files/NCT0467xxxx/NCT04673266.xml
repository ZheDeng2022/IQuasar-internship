  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the study drug, romiplostim, helps low platelet count&#xD;
      caused by standard chemotherapy treatment for lymphoma. This study will also look at whether&#xD;
      romiplostim can prevent the need for chemotherapy dose delays, chemotherapy dose reductions,&#xD;
      and platelet transfusions. In addition, we will determine how safe it is to give romiplostim&#xD;
      to people with lymphoma who have low platelet count from chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients ≥ 18 years old diagnosed with any type of lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving chemotherapy-based treatment known to cause thrombocytopenia. Eligibility is&#xD;
             limited to regimens with a 21-day cycle. Previous single-agent anti-CD20 antibody or&#xD;
             radiotherapy will not count as a line of treatment. Eligible regimens include those&#xD;
             based on a platinum backbone (e.g. ICE, DHAX, DHAP, GemOx, GDP, ESHAP), those based on&#xD;
             a doxorubicin backbone (e.g. CHOP, CDOP, HyperCVAD, BEACOPP) or on a high-dose&#xD;
             cytarabine backbone (e.g.HiDAC). Of note, treatment programs which involve sequential&#xD;
             administration of two or more regimens (e.g. CHOP-&gt;ICE or CHOP-DHAX) are eligible as&#xD;
             long as the patient is planned for at least two more cycles of the regimen on which&#xD;
             the CIT was initially observed. Regimens with inherent dose-adjustments by blood&#xD;
             counts (e.g. da-EPOCH) are ineligible unless the treating oncologist is not planning&#xD;
             to increase treatment doses on subsequent cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of a severe treatment-related thrombocytopenia during the most recent cycle of&#xD;
             treatment, as defined by one or more of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PLT &lt; 50,000 on day 1 (- 2 days) of the subsequent treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, defined as PLT &lt;25,000 cells/mcl and/or transfusion for&#xD;
                  thrombocytopenia or bleeding. Need for PLT transfusion in order to meet minimal&#xD;
                  PLT criteria for invasive procedures will not count for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is planned for at least two more cycles of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stem cell collection if indicated, planned for end of cycle 2 on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status of ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥50%, see Appendix A - ECOG/Karnofsky&#xD;
             performance status scale).&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL - transfusion support is acceptable for eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 3x the institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST and ALT ≤ 3x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy with undetectable viral load are eligible for this trial, provided there are&#xD;
             no anticipated interactions between antiretroviral treatment and the study drug.&#xD;

             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
             prior to participation in the study and any related procedures being performed.&#xD;
