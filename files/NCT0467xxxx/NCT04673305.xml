      BACKGROUND Neurocognitive symptoms have a high prevalence in cancer patients, resulting in a&#xD;
      significant impact on daily life and tolerance to therapy. It's estimated that about 30% of&#xD;
      cancer patients present a cognitive impairment before treatment, about 75% present this&#xD;
      cognitive impairment during the treatment, and about 35% continue to present cognitive&#xD;
      difficulties in the following months/years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is growing evidence that cognitive symptoms have a biological mechanism linked to the&#xD;
      activation of immunological cytokines that exert important effects on the brain functions.&#xD;
      For example, interferon α is known to increase the levels of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α, and this&#xD;
      increase is associated with memory deficits, executive function and mood alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A neurotoxic action induced by cytokines has been demonstrated both in the early stages of&#xD;
      the tumor and after chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several imaging studies suggest that the cognitive impairment pattern in cancer patients,&#xD;
      during the treatment and in remission, is related to structural and functional brain changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal studies in women with breast cancer treated with chemoterapy have shown a&#xD;
      reduction in the volume of cerebral gray matter, mainly in the bilateral frontal cortex and&#xD;
      hippocampus. In parallel, diffusion tensor imaging studies have shown an alteration of the&#xD;
      integrity of the frontal, parietal and occipital cerebral white matter, demyelination and&#xD;
      axonal degeneration processes. Finally, functional magnetic resonance studies in cancer&#xD;
      patients have shown alterations in the connectivity of the default mode network compared to&#xD;
      control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies carried out to date, show a prevalent impairment of executive functions and working&#xD;
      memory. Cognitive impairment has been studied mainly as a possible adverse effect in women&#xD;
      treated with chemotherapy for breast cancer, while there are few studies in the literature on&#xD;
      patients with haematological malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN The study is targeted to patients ages ≥ 70 years, whith haematological&#xD;
      malignancy, who need to start a treatment within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the eligibility criteria have been assessed, the hematologist proposes the enrollment in&#xD;
      the study. Once the patient's informed consent has been acquired, a neurological examination&#xD;
      is carried out, functional tests required by the protocol are administered. The patient&#xD;
      begins, as per clinical practice, the treatment provided for his/her haematological&#xD;
      malignancy. Test's evaluation is repeated at 6 months and 12 months after the enrollment. In&#xD;
      conjunction with neurological tests, will be performed a venipuncture as per clinical&#xD;
      practice, and a blood sample is taken to measure the cytokines involved in inflammatory&#xD;
      processes. It is expected that a patient can perform up to a maximum of 3 blood samples for&#xD;
      the biological study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS This is a non-pharmacological, prospective, uncontrolled, open-label&#xD;
      single-center interventional pilot study, aimed to describ the progress of cognitive function&#xD;
      under treatment for haematological disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the pilot and exploratory nature of the study and the substantial absence of a&#xD;
      specific literature relating to the elderly onco-haematological patient, it is not believed&#xD;
      that the conditions exist to be able to formally define the size of the sample. The sample&#xD;
      size is arbitrarily fixed at 60 patients. The observation time will be 12 months from&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
