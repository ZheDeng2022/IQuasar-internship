      This is a phase IIb, prospective, multi-country, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel group study to investigate the efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      transformation of NP following single intradiscal injection of STA363 (lactic acid) into one&#xD;
      or two IVDs compared to placebo for the treatment of discogenic low back pain. This study&#xD;

      This is a phase IIb, prospective, multi-country, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel group study to investigate the efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      transformation of NP following single intradiscal injection of STA363 (lactic acid) into one&#xD;
      or two IVDs compared to placebo for the treatment of discogenic low back pain. This study&#xD;
      will be conducted in Russia, Spain and the Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate superiority of STA363 over placebo in reducing low&#xD;
      back pain as measured by the NRS. A total of 168 patients will be screened in the study with&#xD;
      the aim to recruit 126 patients to be randomly allocated to one of the three treatment&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - 42 patients will receive STA363 containing 90 mg (60 mg/mL) lactic acid Group 2 -&#xD;
      42 patients will receive STA363 containing 180 mg (120 mg/mL) lactic acid Group 3 - 42&#xD;
      patients will receive placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational medical product (IMP) will be injected into the center of up to two IVDs.&#xD;
      Patients with two discs appropriate for treatment will be treated at both affected levels by&#xD;
      two separate injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will have 5 visits to study site and 1 telephone call. The patient's total time&#xD;
      in the study will be approximately 61 weeks (~15 months) including an 8-week screening&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will perform a screening visit (Visit 1) maximum 60 days before planned&#xD;
      treatment. Randomization and treatment will be performed at Visit 2 (Day 1) after&#xD;
      confirmation of patient's eligibility for the study. The IMP will be administered, monitored&#xD;
      by fluoroscopy or other available method of real-time x-ray imaging to ensure that an&#xD;
      injection is correctly placed in the IVD nucleus and that no leakage occurs. Immediately&#xD;
      after treatment the patients should remain supine for as long as possible (at least 1 hour).&#xD;
      For safety reasons, patients will be allowed to leave the clinic not earlier than 2 hours&#xD;
      after the last injection. After leaving the clinic, patients will be offered analgesics&#xD;
      and/or other measures according to standard clinical practice. They will also be given advice&#xD;
      on restricted physical activity during the first two weeks after injection. Patients should&#xD;
      not drive or operate machinery for 12 hours following the treatment procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up at 1 month (Visit 3/Day 30±7, visit to study site), 3 months&#xD;
      (Visit 4/Day 90±7, telephone call), 6 months (Visit 5/Day 180±7, visit to study site) and 12&#xD;
      months (Visit 6/Day 360±7, visit to study site) after treatment. Follow-up MRI will be&#xD;
      conducted as part of Visit 5 and Visit 6, to assess the transformation of the NP into&#xD;
      connective tissue and other disc characteristics.&#xD;

             concomitant treatment (e.g. immunosuppressive drugs), which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
