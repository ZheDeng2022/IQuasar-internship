  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ambulation/ &quot;out of bed&quot; movement</measure>
    <time_frame>The patient's postoperative inpatient hospital stay, average 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Distance (meters) achieved &quot;out of bed&quot; (ambulatory or non-ambulatory/wheelchair) during their inpatient stay while interacting with the app will be calculated by hand, based on how many times patient activated specific targets.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Discharge-ready status</measure>
    <time_frame>The patient's postoperative inpatient hospital stay, average 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The number of days to discharge-ready status will be determined by the study physicians. This status will be assessed twice daily at 9AM and 5PM.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient experience</measure>
    <time_frame>The patient's postoperative inpatient hospital stay, average 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>In the patients who receive the AR game, responses to an electronic survey on the patient's experience designed by the MDACC Child Life team will be recorded when patients reach discharge-ready status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Outpatient pain scores</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days after the patient is discharged from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>We will record average pain intensity experience by the patient during the 90-day (±10 Days) post surgery period. This data will be confirmed by direct contact to patient's guardian or as recorded in the electronic medical record during the patient's follow-up clinic visit</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Outpatient quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days after the patient is discharged from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>Age-appropriate Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) surveys will be administered to the patient (self-report) or guardian (proxy) by phone.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, average 4-month time period</time_frame>
    <description>Any adverse events clinically determined to be related to the use of AR (i.e., falls) will be recorded</description>
