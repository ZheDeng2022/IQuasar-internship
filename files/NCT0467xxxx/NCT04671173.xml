      The purpose of this trial is to conduct a pilot study that will aid in the design of an&#xD;
      evaluation of the clinical benefit of MY01, an FDA cleared device, that allows continuous&#xD;
      monitoring of intracompartmental muscle pressure in patients at risk for developing acute&#xD;
      compartment syndrome. MY01 has previously been successfully tested on animal and Human&#xD;
      cadaver Acute Compartment Syndrome models within the RI MUHC through Department of Defense&#xD;
      research Grant (Combat Casualty Care Research Program (CCCRP). This trial is supported by the&#xD;
      same grant, as the next phase of the overall project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center, non-randomized, historically controlled, prospective trial of the&#xD;
      MY01 device. A cohort of 50 participants will be prospectively enrolled with two weeks follow&#xD;
      up to document clinical benefit of the device. Results from this study will be used to inform&#xD;
      the design of a larger study designed to demonstrate the clinical benefit of the MY01 device&#xD;
      in the early diagnosis of ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of each organisation within the trial are detailed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research Institute of McGill University Health Centre (RI MUHC): study coordination and&#xD;
           data analysis (no recruitment activity will take place in the MUHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hennepin Healthcare: participants recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vanderbilt University Medical Centre: participants recruitment&#xD;

      Research Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to conduct a pilot study that will inform the design of a trial&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical benefit of MY01, a FDA cleared device that allows continuous&#xD;
      monitoring of intracompartmental muscle pressure in patients at risk for developing acute&#xD;
      compartment syndrome. The MY01 device is a digitally connected device with a companion mobile&#xD;
      app designed to continuously monitor intracompartmental pressure, outputting the results to&#xD;
      the mobile app, where clinicians can track the pressure in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several goals of this study. Fifty patients with high-energy injuries to the&#xD;
      proximal leg and tibial shaft will be prospectively studied and compared to a cohort of&#xD;
      historical controls. We want to evaluate the feasibility of collecting data related to the&#xD;
      diagnosis of ACS and the measurement of its associated complications. We will also use this&#xD;
      data to attempt to assign a modified Boyers grade to a cohort of prospectively enrolled&#xD;
      patients and historical controls. Clinical validation of the modified Boyers grade will&#xD;
      represent a large step forward in compartment syndrome research, since it will bring an&#xD;
      objective assessment of severity to the diagnosis of acute compartment syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These control patients are to be obtained from several cohorts of patients: 1- Historical&#xD;
      controls from the patient database at the centers in the trial. 2 - Patients treated in the&#xD;
      PACS study previously funded by DOD and run by METRC. 3- NSQIP data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another goal is to assess the reoperation rates, for limb salvage or amputation among&#xD;
      patients that undergo continuous monitoring of ICP using the MY01 monitor relative to a&#xD;
      cohort of historical controls who did not receive continuous monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Research Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the reoperation rate and number of operative procedures for all surgically managed&#xD;
      acute compartment syndrome patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Research Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are numerous outcomes that are related to the severity of ACS when it is diagnosed.&#xD;
      This study will also assess our ability to identify the following secondary outcomes among a&#xD;
      cohort of prospectively enrolled patients relative to a cohort of historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison of grades of ACS to the historic controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increased proportion of lower ACS outcome grades (Grades 1,2 as per grade)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reduction in time to diagnosis of ACS&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Improved short-term visual analog pain scores (VAS) for pain in affected limb&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Reduction in inpatient days&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Reduction in Skin Grafts&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Reduction in Major Myectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Reduction in Anesthesia Time for patients undergoing fasciotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Clinical ease with which the new compartment pressure monitor was inserted into a muscle&#xD;
           compartment, per satisfaction survey.&#xD;
