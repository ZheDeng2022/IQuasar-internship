      Study Design The test material is ISOThrive. It is an approximately 90% pure&#xD;
      maltosyl-isomalto-oligosacchride (MIMO) prebiotic syrup produced by bacterial&#xD;
      fermentation/bio-conversion of sucrose and maltose. It is taken 1g daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have been screened for CIC or IBS-C as determined by the Rome IV criteria&#xD;
      during an interview with the study coordinator and by evaluation of the online questionnaire&#xD;
      responses for PAC-QOL, PAC-SYM, and BSS. The study has been designed to have each subject&#xD;
      serve as their own control so there will be no placebo arm. Each subject will receive&#xD;
      ISOThrive according to the protocol. The goal is to assess 100 subjects after the Screening&#xD;
      Phase. The study will be done remotely. There will be communication but no in person contact&#xD;
      or visits with the study coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two phases have been designed into this study. Phase 1 is the Screening Phase (SP) lasting 7&#xD;
      days. Phase 2 is the Tolerability Phase (TP) lasting 28 days. Subjects will be instructed to&#xD;
      take a daily BSS questionnaire and bowel movement frequency throughout the study. They will&#xD;
      note whether they have had bowel movements each day and describe them accordingly. At three&#xD;
      timepoints, specific scores will be established for comparison and statistical analysis.&#xD;
      These timepoints are: (1) SP7 - baseline without ISOThrive; (2) TP14 - 2 weeks using&#xD;
      ISOThrive; (3) TP28 - 4 weeks using ISOThrive. At each of these timepoints, subjects will&#xD;
      also complete the PAC-QOL and PAC-SYM validated questionnaires. Subjects will report any&#xD;
      usage of laxatives and any changes in their usual medications throughout their study&#xD;
      participation on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment An adequate number of individuals will need to be screened during the Screening&#xD;
      Phase, using the disease specific validated questionnaires to yield approximately 100&#xD;
      qualified subjects to enter and likely complete the Tolerability Phase of the study.&#xD;
      Individuals on medications for CIC or IBS-C may continue their medications during the trial&#xD;
      as long as they are reported and do not deviate from the inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be required to sign an IRB-approved informed e-consent that complies with&#xD;
      the requirements of both 21 CRF Part 50 and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability&#xD;
      Act (HIPAA) before entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study is defined for each subject as the date a signed written informed&#xD;
      consent (or e-consent) is provided through Tolerability Phase Day 28. Total participation in&#xD;
      study may last up to 6 weeks. The study will seek a comparable gender distribution in the&#xD;
      final analysis. Therefore, the ratio of male to female (or female to male) subjects&#xD;
      completing the Tolerability Phase will be capped at 60% of the total (male or female).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Medications and Washout Periods CIC and IBS-C medications: Subjects currently&#xD;
      taking laxatives or other treatments for CIC or IBS-C may continue these throughout the&#xD;
      study. These will be recorded. Any changes in dosing of these will also be recorded.&#xD;
      Commercially available medications or supplements marketed as prebiotics or probiotic cannot&#xD;
      be taken. Supplements such as Metamucil and Citrucel are acceptable in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prebiotic and/or probiotic supplements: Enrolled subjects must stop taking all prebiotic&#xD;
      and/or probiotic supplements 3 weeks prior to entering the Screening Phase of the study.&#xD;
      Subjects must refrain from taking prebiotic or probiotic supplements through Tolerability&#xD;
      Phase Day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep medications: Enrolled subjects taking medications for mild sleep disorders must be on a&#xD;
      stable dose at time of consent and continue at said dose through Tolerability Phase Day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics: Subjects must not have taken a 10 day course of a single antibiotic within the&#xD;
      past 3 months, &gt;10 day course of a single antibiotic during the past 5 months, course of &gt;1&#xD;
      antibiotics within the past 5 months , or at any time during their participation in the&#xD;
      study. If antibiotics are prescribed to the subject during study participation, subject must&#xD;
      be withdrawn from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study product sachets (used and unused) must be returned to Investigator for product&#xD;
      accountability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Study Flow Process No study-related activities will be performed and no subject data&#xD;
      will be collected prior to completion of the informed consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Phase (SP) (7 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
      To enter the SP, subjects must be screened for CIC or IBS-C during an interview with the&#xD;
      study coordinator using the Rome IV criteria and also by the study questionnaires. The SP&#xD;
      will last for 7 days. Subjects who do not qualify at any point during the SP will not be&#xD;
      allowed to move into the Tolerability Phase (TP). The TP will last 28 days, beginning with&#xD;
      first dose of ISOThrive. Subjects will continue their allowed CIC or IBS-C medications&#xD;
      throughout the SP and the TP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following Day 7 of SP, a review of the questionnaire responses will be made. Subjects must&#xD;
      complete at least 5 of 7 daily BSS questionnaires. Combined BSS, bowel movement frequency,&#xD;
      PAC-QOL and PAC-SYM responses will be evaluated for consistency with CIC or IBS-C per the&#xD;
      Rome IV criteria by the PI to be eligible to transition to the Tolerability Phase. (Two or&#xD;
      fewer bowel movements in a week which resulted in a sensation of complete evacuation with one&#xD;
      or more of the following: lumpy or hard stools at least 25% of the time, sensation of&#xD;
      incomplete evacuation at least 25% of the time, sensation of anorectal obstruction or&#xD;
      blockage for at least 25% of the time, manual maneuvering required to defecate for at least&#xD;
      25% of the time, or straining at defecation at least 25% of the time.) The PAC-QOL, PAC-SYM&#xD;
      and BSS and bowel movement frequency scores will serve as a baseline. Investigator will&#xD;
      verify eligibility prior to study staff contacting subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility has been verified by the PI, the study coordinator will inform subject and&#xD;
      confirm that subject wishes to continue in the study. There may be up to 7 calendar days&#xD;
      between SP Day 7 and TP Day 1 depending on length of time to evaluate continuing eligibility&#xD;
      and to ship/receive ISOThrive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability Phase (TP) (28 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will take their current CIC or IBS-C therapy as defined in the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All CIC or IBS-C medications and other medications will be recorded daily via the electronic&#xD;
      survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ISOThrive will be taken daily each morning with or without breakfast (one sachet per day). If&#xD;
      the subject forgets to take the morning dose, he/she may take it during the day or evening.&#xD;
      If the dose is forgotten for 24 hours, the subject may take a double dose the next day. The&#xD;
      product must be taken at least 6 of 7 days each week. Only 2 double doses per week are&#xD;
      allowed (but discouraged).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the primary endpoint, tolerability of ISOThrive will be assessed via changes in the BSS,&#xD;
      bowel movement frequency, PAC-QOL, and PAC-SYM and questionnaires. This will be assessed for&#xD;
      all subjects as well as for the sub-group of subjects that completed all 4 weeks of the TP.&#xD;
      Changes in BSS (frequency and stool quality), PAC-QOL, or PAC-SYM, between baseline and each&#xD;
      of the TP14 and TP28 time points will be the basis of this assessment. Subjects also rated&#xD;
      the change in their constipation on a 7-point scale (very much improved to very much&#xD;
      worsened) at the final follow-up (TP28). Further evaluation will include comparison of&#xD;
      ISOThrive tolerability in CIC vs IBS-C subject sub-groups using these time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety endpoint of the study is to ensure that any adverse events that are reported or&#xD;
      observed during the study are appropriately recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Reimbursement Except for a $25 gift card for completion of all study requirements, no&#xD;
      additional study compensation is being given to the research participant or authorized&#xD;
      representative for data collected from this study. All study participants will be provided&#xD;
      with ISOThrive for the duration of their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events Adverse events (AEs) may occur during the conduct of the study. As no changes&#xD;
      to treatment plans will be made during the Screening Phase, AEs will be captured at the time&#xD;
      of entry into the Tolerability Phase and continue through the last study conduct (TP Day 28)&#xD;
      for each subject. AEs will be recorded in the case report forms and will be judged by the&#xD;
      Investigator as to its relationship and level of relatedness to the study product.&#xD;
      Investigator will identify the date of onset, severity, and duration of the AE. All AEs will&#xD;
      be monitored until they are adequately resolved or explained. If an AE continues after the&#xD;
      evaluation of the study, the Investigator will determine need and/or methods for continued&#xD;
      surveillance of the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator will report adverse events and/or serious adverse events to the reviewing&#xD;
      IRB according to the reporting regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Quality Assurance This study will be conducted in accordance with the International&#xD;
      Council for Harmonization (ICH) E6 R2. The Investigator agrees to maintain adequate&#xD;
      documentation for the subjects participating in this clinical research project. The&#xD;

    <measure>Tolerability of ISOThrive using Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAC-QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PAC-QOL a validated questionnaire which measures subject experience over the prior 2 weeks, includes a total of 28 items in 4 subscales: worries and concerns (11 items), physical discomfort (4 items), psychosocial discomfort (8 items), and satisfaction (5 items). Higher scores of PAC-QOL indicate more negative effects of constipation on the quality of life.&#xD;
This study will assess whether subjects with constipation tolerate ISOThrive by measuring the differences in baseline and post-intervention score using PAC-QOL. The score taken at the end of Week 1 of the Screening Phase will be compared to the scores at the end of Week 2 and Week 4 of the Tolerability Phase. Any difference in scores between Week 2 and Week 4 of the Tolerability Phase will also be compared. Tolerability is defined as the difference between the baseline score and the post-intervention score at Week 4 of the Tolerability Phase. It must be equal to or less than the baseline score.</description>

    <measure>Tolerability of ISOThrive using the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This study will assess whether subjects with constipation tolerate ISOThrive by measuring differences in pre and post-intervention scores using the BSS and bowel movement frequency. Electronic BSS diaries will be recorded daily. The BSS is an indicator of colonic transit time using a seven-point scale. Type 1 and 2 indicate hard stool; type 3, 4 and 5 show looser (ideal) stool; and type 6 and 7 indicate stool that is too loose. Tolerability is primarily defined as an increase in the frequency of bowel movements. Tolerability is secondarily defined as improvement in quality, a larger percentage of scores of 3, 4, and 5. Any difference in scores between weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Tolerability Phase will also be compared. Tolerability is defined as follows: average week 4 stool quality must be equal to or improved (equal to or more scores of 3, 4 and 5) relative to baseline, and average week 4 bowel movement frequency must be equal to or more than baseline frequency.</description>
