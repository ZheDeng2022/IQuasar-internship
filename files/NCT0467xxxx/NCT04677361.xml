  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Marrow infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs™) are a novel method of adoptive cell therapy that&#xD;
      provide an activated, polyclonal population of autologous tumor-specific T cells derived from&#xD;
      the bone marrow. MILs™ in this study will be used to treat small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that&#xD;
      has become resistant to chemotherapy and radiation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is generally treated with surgery or chemotherapy, with or&#xD;
      without radiation therapy, depending on staging. The problem with current available&#xD;
      treatments is that SCLC almost always becomes resistant to chemotherapy and radiation. Marrow&#xD;
      infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs™) are a novel method of adoptive cell therapy that provide an&#xD;
      activated, polyclonal population of autologous tumor-specific T cells derived from bone&#xD;
      marrow. Prior to treatment of MILs™ patients will receive non-myeloablative lymphodepletion&#xD;
      with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to increase the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy.&#xD;
      Bone marrow aspirate (BMA) will be collected from the patient to manufacture the MILs™. Upon&#xD;
      progression and after the bone marrow is collected, a subject may receive bridging treatment&#xD;
      of pembrolizumab until the MILs™ are received, after which treatment of the MILs™ and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab will begin.&#xD;

    <description>Each patient will have their bone marrow collected, MILs produced, and the patient will be dosed with all of the MILs produced for that individual patient. The minimum requirement for treatment is 2 x 108 cells. The MILs™ must be administered via a central catheter which could either be a PICC line, port or central line.&#xD;
Subjects will be treated with MILs™ and pembrolizumab (200 mg Q3W) combination. MILs™ will be administered on Day 0 and pembrolizumab administered on Day 1. Pembrolizumab will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion with a window of -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted.</description>
