      GNE myopathy is a distal myopathy that is thought to be caused by a mutation in the GNE gene&#xD;
      that encodes an enzyme in the biosynthetic process of aceneuramic acid (typical sialic acid).&#xD;
      The investigators will examine the efficacy and safety of aceneuramic acid (SA-ER tablets) 6g&#xD;
      daily for 48 weeks in patients with GNE myopathy in a placebo-controlled, double-blind,&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;

      GNE myopathy is a distal myopathy that is thought to be caused by a mutation in the GNE gene&#xD;
      that encodes an enzyme in the biosynthetic process of aceneuramic acid (typical sialic acid).&#xD;
      It is an extremely rare progressive muscle disease, often occurring in the late teens to 30s,&#xD;
      usually affecting the distal lower leg, especially the extensor muscles such as the tibialis&#xD;
      anterior muscle, first, and weakness in both upper and lower limbs. However, the weakness of&#xD;
      the quadriceps femoris is usually gradual. Although there are large individual differences,&#xD;
      health management and deterioration of QOL will eventually become a problem, and in severe&#xD;
      cases, constant assistance is required in daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double-blind comparative study conducted in Japan provided results suggesting efficacy, but&#xD;
      the efficacy could not be confirmed in a large-scale international clinical trial, so this&#xD;
      study is decided to be conducted. Oral administration of aceneuramic acid tablets 500 mg&#xD;
      (SA-ER tablets) or placebo tablets of the same appearance, 4 tablets at a time, 3 times a day&#xD;
      for 48 weeks will be examined for differences in efficacy. The target was a total of 10&#xD;
      cases, 7 cases in the active drug group, and 3 in the placebo group. The amount of change in&#xD;
      upper extremity composite score (the sum of the average of the right and left HHD scores for&#xD;
      grip, shoulder abductors, elbow flexors and elbow extensors) was used, and the secondary&#xD;
      endpoints were the doctor's comprehensive evaluation and the GNE myopathy functional activity&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
