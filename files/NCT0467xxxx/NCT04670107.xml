  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy has made a major progress in Lung cancer.However, challenges such as primary&#xD;
      and acquired resistance, small fraction of benefit population and lack of predictive and&#xD;
      prognostic biomarkers even exist. The overall objective response rate is lower than 20% in&#xD;
      second line-treatment and the progression-free survival (PFS) is also similar to or poorer&#xD;
      than that of conventional second-line chemotherapy. Anlotinib is a novel, orally&#xD;
      administered, multitarget receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits VEGFR, PDGFR,&#xD;
      FGFR, c-Kit, and other kinases. It functions by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and&#xD;
      proliferative signaling pathways. We would observe and analyze the effectiveness and safety&#xD;
      of anlotinib combined with Immune checkpoint inhibitors for advanced NSCLC after muti-line&#xD;
      therapy to explore the synergistic effect of anti-angiogenic agents and immunotherapy.&#xD;
