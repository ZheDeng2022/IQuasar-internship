  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intervention includes use of transport reimbursement for men who will undergo voluntary&#xD;
      medical male circumcision (VMMC), intensified health education by a VMMC mobilizer and a male&#xD;
      and female VMMC champion; use of a cell phone short messaging service (SMS) and/or telephonic&#xD;
      tracing to remind clients of their VMMC appointment and and provision of transport&#xD;
      reimbursements to men who will undergo VMMC (the RIT intervention). The investigators will&#xD;
      assess the uptake of VMMC, and acceptability and feasibility of the RIT intervention among&#xD;
      uncircumcised men attending a STI clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention was initially designed to include escorting men interested in circumcision&#xD;
      from the STI clinic to a VMMC clinic co-located in the same facility. However, the VMMC&#xD;
      clinic space was repurposed to a COVID-19 isolation unit therefore clinic escorts were&#xD;
      excluded. In Lieu of clinic escorts, participants will be linked to the nearest health&#xD;
      facility of their choice where VMMC services are provided by the VMMC mobilizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of using transport reimbursement,&#xD;
      intensified health education, cell phone tracing and clinic escort in increasing the uptake&#xD;
      of voluntary medical male circumcision at this clinic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a pragmatic, observational study with pre-implementation and&#xD;
      implementation phases. Data will be collected using a concurrent exploratory mixed methods&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the effect of multi-faceted intervention on the uptake of VMMC using&#xD;
      a pragmatic observational study design with pre-implementation and implementation phases. The&#xD;
      intervention includes use of transport reimbursement for men who will undergo VMMC,&#xD;
      Intensified health education by VMMC champions and women and use of a cell phone&#xD;
      SMS/telephonic Tracing to remind clients of their VMMC appointment (the RIT intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be conducted in a sequential and incremental manner called&#xD;
      implementation blocks. After collecting data from the standard of care period, the first&#xD;
      implementation block will be for intensified health education. The next block will combine&#xD;
      intensified health education with SMS/telephonic tracing. The last block will combine&#xD;
      intensified health education with SMS/telephonic tracing and transport reimbursements. This&#xD;
      approach will allow us to compare the effectiveness of different combinations of the&#xD;
      strategies in the intervention without necessarily randomizing participants. The sample size&#xD;
      for each block is 80 uncircumcised men with STIs. The investigators anticipate that each&#xD;
      block will last about 4-8 weeks with one week of no intervention between interventions as a&#xD;
      wash out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be men attending the Bwaila STI clinic in Lilongwe Malawi. The&#xD;
      study will enroll 400 men to increase uptake of circumcision from 28% to 60% (national&#xD;
      target) among uncircumcised men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on uptake of VMMC will be collected through a standardize data collection form in&#xD;
      conjunction with routine data from the STI clinic electronic medical registry. Data on&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility will be collected through surveys, interviews and focus group&#xD;
      discussions. The investigators will conduct about 280 surveys for acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility with men selected randomly through the implementation period (70 men per&#xD;
      intervention block). About 20 in-depth interviews with healthcare workers equally divided by&#xD;
      intervention block will be conducted to assess acceptability and feasibility. Finally, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct four focus group discussions with men through the study period to&#xD;
      assess acceptability and feasibility of the RITE strategy.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of Participants Who Will Undergo Circumcision</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0 to 48</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of participants who will undergo circumcision will be calculated as the number of participants who will undergo circumcision divided by the number of participants offered circumcision. The investigators will collect data on the number of participants offered VMMC and the number of participants who will undergo VMMC for each intervention block. The proportion of participants for each intervention block who will undergo circumcision (uptake) will be compared to the standard of care block.</description>

    <measure>Composite Median Score for Acceptability of the RIT Intervention among Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0 to 48</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability will be measured quantitatively using the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) Likert scale surveys. The AIM Likert scale measures acceptability based on four constructs that assess whether an intervention is appealing, likable, welcome and approvable. Surveys for acceptability will be conducted at baseline and during implementation of each intervention block. An overall composite median score (and interquartile range) for acceptability for each intervention block will be calculated and compared to baseline using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The AIM score range is 6 - 80 from a scale with 1=completely disagree, 2=disagree, 3=Neutral, 4=agree and 5=completely agree. Higher scores indicate agreement with more acceptability items. The investigators will use electronic tablets to administer the surveys.</description>

    <measure>Composite Median Score for Feasibility of the RIT Intervention among Healthcare Workers</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 5 to 48</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be measured quantitatively using the Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM) Likert scale surveys. The FIM measures feasibility based on four constructs that assess whether an intervention is implementable, possible, doable, and easy to use. Feasibility will be assessed among healthcare workers only as implementers of the intervention. Surveys for feasibility will be conducted for each intervention block during the implementation phase only (starting from week 5 excluding the standard of care). An overall composite median score (and interquartile range) for feasibility for each intervention block will be calculated and compared to baseline using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The FIM score range is 5 - 60 with 1=completely disagree, 2=disagree, 3=Neutral, 4=agree and 5=completely agree. Higher Higher scores indicate agreement with more feasibility items. The investigators will use electronic tablets to administer the surveys.</description>

    <description>Qualitative assessments for acceptability will be conducted using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. In-depth interviews will be conducted with healthcare workers and focus group discussions will be conducted with uncircumcised men. Both interviews and focus groups discussions will be conducted at baseline and week 48 to complement quantitative findings. Interview and focus group discussions will be analyzed using thematic analysis and a summary of common themes will be presented. Assessed at Baseline and Week 48.</description>
