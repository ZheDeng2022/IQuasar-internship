      Background: Chronic periodontitis is one of the most common causes of tooth loss and is&#xD;
      rather common in the population. Treating chronic periodontitis remains a challenge for&#xD;
      dental practitioners. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical effects of&#xD;
      sub-gingival application of 0.2% hyaluronic acid gel after root planing in the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: In this split mouth study, 733 periodontal pockets of 28 patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe chronic periodontitis were chosen for investigation. They were divided&#xD;
      into 2 groups: control group and experimental group. The experimental group received&#xD;
      sub-gingival administration of 1 ml of 0.2% hyaluronic acid gel into each pocket immediately&#xD;
      after root planing and then after 1 week, 2 weeks and 3 weeks. Clinical parameters were&#xD;
      assessed at baseline and 6 weeks after root planing. Subgingival plaque was assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and 6 weeks after root planing. Quantitative real-time PCR for Porphyromonas&#xD;
      gingivalis (Pg), Treponema denticola (Td), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) Tannerella forsythia&#xD;
      (Tf) were performed at the same time.&#xD;

      Chronic periodontitis is one of the most common causes of tooth loss and is rather common in&#xD;
      the population. Treating chronic periodontitis remains a challenge for dental practitioners.&#xD;
      There are new applications of materials to promote the healing process and increase the&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment of CP such as antimicrobial and healing support agents which were&#xD;
      used at scaling and root planing (SRP) phase with the desire to improve the effectiveness of&#xD;
      treatment and reduce the frequency of surgical phase, in order to reduce treatment cost for&#xD;
      patients. One of those materials is hyaluronic acid (HA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HA is a polysaccharide with many important roles: maintaining stability, adjusting the&#xD;
      viscosity of biological fluids, homeostasis, adjusting osmotic pressure, supporting&#xD;
      structures ... The wide application of HA in medicine is due to its capability of binding&#xD;
      multiple water molecules, bimproving tissue hydration and preventing mechanical damage,&#xD;
      bacteriostatic, anti-inflamatory, osteoinductive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was the first to be conducted in Vietnam to evaluate the effect of HA on the&#xD;
      response of periodontal tissue in chronic periodontitis and its bactericidal efficiency. The&#xD;
      bacteria we study were Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Treponema denticola (Td), Fusobacterium&#xD;
      nucleatum (Fn) Tannerella forsythia (Tf), which were important species in periodontitis&#xD;
      development. The research results can supplement scientific evidence about the effects of&#xD;
      this compound and clarify the usefulness of HA in clinical chronic periodontitis treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We performed a randomized, controlled clinical trial with split-mouth design. Study procedure&#xD;
      consisted of information collecting, clinical measurements and, data analysis. The study was&#xD;
      conducted in full accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki 2000&#xD;
      and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov No. 312/ĐHYD-HĐĐĐ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from 18 years old with a minimum number of 20 teeth who came for periodontitis&#xD;
      treatment, were recruited at the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Odonto-Stomalogy,&#xD;
      the University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City (FOS-UMPH). We selected patients&#xD;
      with at least 3 teeth in the contralateral quadrants diagnosed with moderate or severe&#xD;
      chronic periodontitis according to AAP (2015): gingival bleeding at examination, ≥5mm&#xD;
      periodontal pocket depth, bone resorption on X-ray film ≥16% or &gt;3mm root length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were allergic to ingredients, being pregnant/lactating, smoking, alcoholic; who&#xD;
      had undergone periodontal therapy in the last 6 months, received antibiotic therapy,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agents, statins, drug induced gingival enlargement (such as phenytoin,&#xD;
      cyclosporin, nifedipine) in the last 3 months were excluded. We also excluded patients with&#xD;
      systemic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment and patients who refused to participate in the study and/or follow-up&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Rajan (2014), to obtain the difference of probing pocket depth (PPD) of 2 groups&#xD;
      (control and HA), we got and were the average PPD and 1.38 and were standard deviation of two&#xD;
      groups, respectively. With α = 0.05 and β = 0.2, we calculated N = 25. 28 subjects were&#xD;
      enrolled to prevent sample loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking of control and HA treatment were applied to patients, the periodontist and outcome&#xD;
      assessing investigators for all clinical and laboratory parameters. Only an independent&#xD;
      investigator who applied HA knew the name of the drug due to the nature of the study. Another&#xD;
      investigator who performed the statistical assignment phase was to all patient information&#xD;
      and to the following analysis and evaluation of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this split mouth study, 733 periodontal pockets of 28 patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
      chronic periodontitis were chosen for investigation. They were divided into 2 groups: control&#xD;
      group and experimental group. The experimental group received sub-gingival administration of&#xD;
      1 ml of 0.2% hyaluronic acid gel into each pocket immediately after root planing and then&#xD;
      after 1 week, 2 weeks and 3 weeks. Clinical parameters were assessed at baseline and 6 weeks&#xD;
      after root planing. Subgingival plaque was assessed at baseline and 6 weeks after root&#xD;
      planing. Quantitative real-time PCR for Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Treponema denticola&#xD;
      (Td), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) Tannerella forsythia (Tf) were performed at the same time.&#xD;
      Wilcoxon sign-rank test and Mann-Whitney test were used for comparison of means.&#xD;
