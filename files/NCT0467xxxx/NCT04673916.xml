  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to compare the therapeutic efficacy of clobetasol&#xD;
      propionate 0.05% oral gel versus an anti-inflammatory mouthwash in an oral solution for the&#xD;
      management of patients suffering from symptomatic OLP. The secondary objective was to analyze&#xD;
      which one of the two treatments induced a greater risk of developing side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty patients were assigned (20 patients per group), through a randomized design, to receive&#xD;
      clobetasol (clobetasol gel 0.05%), or an anti-inflammatory mouthwash (mouthwash which&#xD;
      contains calcium hydroxide, hyaluronic acid, Umbelliferone and Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins)&#xD;
      for 3-months. At baseline (T0) and after 3 months (T1), patients were subjected to clinical&#xD;
      and oral assessments and were evaluated for the symptoms (Numerical Pain Scale, NRS score)&#xD;
      and signs (Thongprasom's score) of OLP. Data were calculated using T-test for the dependent&#xD;
      variable, Wilcoxon test and Mann-Witney u test.&#xD;

    <description>Patients clinically were evaluated using the scale used by Thongprasom et al. as reference. This gives a score that varies from 0 to 5, using a millimetre reference: 0, in the absence of lesions; 1, in the presence of hyperkeratosis streaks; 2, in the presence of an atrophic area less than 1 mm2; 3, in the presence of an atrophic area greater than 1 mm2; 4, in the presence of an erosive area less than 1 mm2; 5, in the presence of an erosive area greater than 1 mm2. In the presence of multiple injuries, the value has been calculated by summing the values of each injury.</description>

    <description>The clobetasol group was treated with clobetasol propionate 0.05%, while the anti-inflammatory group was treated with mouthwash. The drug used consisted of Clobetasol propionate 0.05%, Ethyl alcohol 96° (50%), Hydroxyethylcellulose (4%); Preserved water (just enough to 100%) that was topically applied [11]. This drug was produced as a galenic formulation. Clobetasol propionate twice a day (every 12 hours) to the lesions with a soft bristle brush and were advised not to drink or eat during the hour following application of the medication.</description>

    <description>In patients of the anti-inflammatory group, the mouthwash was used pure and without dilution at a dosage of 20 ml 3 times a day, immediately after normal daily oral hygiene was prescribed. It contains calcium hydroxide, hyaluronic acid, Umbelliferone and Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins. Patients were instructed to rinse for at least 5 minutes over the entire oral mucosa, with particular emphasis on the regions where the lesions are located.</description>
