      In Taiwan, non-cirrhosis CHB patients with mildly elevated ALT are not candidates for&#xD;
      antiviral treatment under Taiwan NIH reimbursement criteria. Disease severity could range&#xD;
      from mildly liver injury to cirrhosis in this group of patients. There is a substantial&#xD;
      population of patients required antiviral treatment, but not fulfill the criteria of&#xD;
      reimbursement treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 2 phase 3 trials of TAF, the treatment criteria of ALT were more than 2x of ULN and&#xD;
      did not included liver biopsy as a pre-treatment assessment. In this study, CHB patient with&#xD;
      ALT level of 1-2x ULN and significant liver injury evaluated by liver biopsy is the target&#xD;
      study population.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Overview Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection could lead to chronic&#xD;
           hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Liver diseases and its&#xD;
           complications remains one of the leading causes of death in Taiwan. Epidemiology study&#xD;
           shows that HBV viral load is positively associated with incidence of cirrhosis and HCC&#xD;
           in the long-term follow-up. Several lines of evidence also revealed that effective&#xD;
           control of HBV could reduce the risk of liver decompensation and HCC. Currently,&#xD;
           treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) includes pegylated interferon (IFN) and&#xD;
           nucleoside or nucleotide analogues (NUC). NUC treatment exhibits the advantages of easy,&#xD;
           safe, wide ranges of indications, and strong viral suppression when compared with IFN.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Clinical experience of NUC treatment The first line of NUC treatment currently are&#xD;
           entecavir (ETV), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF).&#xD;
           All these drugs are effective in viral suppression, maintain normal aminotransferase,&#xD;
           and exhibit long term safety and minimal viral resistance in treatment for HBeAg&#xD;
           positive, HBeAg negative, and cirrhosis patients. Fibrosis improvement and cirrhosis&#xD;
           reversion could be achieved in a significant proportion of patients treated with 5-year&#xD;
           of ETV or TDF. Some safety concern raised. Renal function deterioration and decreased&#xD;
           bone mineral density are present in patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
           infection and treated with TDF containing regimen. In CHB patients, impairment of renal&#xD;
           function occurs in 1-2% of 8-years TDF treatment. There are controversies in&#xD;
           relationship between TDF and bone mineral density. The safety issues of long-term TDF&#xD;
           treatment, except its high efficacy in viral suppression, still remains and needs to&#xD;
           monitor during treatment course. 1.3. Clinical experience of TAF TAF is a new nucleotide&#xD;
           analogue. Two phase III trials, study 108 and 110, were designed to compare the efficacy&#xD;
           and safety of TAF and TDF in HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B&#xD;
           patients. After two years of treatment, similar viral suppression, but more rapid and&#xD;
           higher percentages achieved normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were&#xD;
           observed in TAF group. In addition, renal function measured by estimated glomerular&#xD;
           filtration rate (eGFR) was maintained in TAF group. In contrast, TDF group exhibited&#xD;
           decline of eGFR. Similarly, bone mineral measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry&#xD;
           (DEXA) was maintained TAF group, but decreased in TDF group. In EASL practical guideline&#xD;
           for management of chronic hepatitis C suggests that patients with age more than 60&#xD;
           years, bone diseases, and renal alterations should select TAF over TDF.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4. Current treatment criteria for non-cirrhosis CHB In APASL and AASLD treatment&#xD;
           guideline for CHB, both suggested that non-cirrhosis patients with significant viral&#xD;
           load and ALT &gt;2x upper limit of normal range (ULN) in either HBeAg positive or HBeAg&#xD;
           negative should be treated. The significant viral load is defined as HBV DNA &gt;20000&#xD;
           IU/mL in HBeAg positive and HBV DNA &gt;2000 IU/mL in HBeAg negative. Current reimbursement&#xD;
           criteria of Taiwan NIH also follow these conditions. For those non-cirrhotic patients&#xD;
           with significant HBV viral load and ALT level between 1-2x of ULN, treatment is not&#xD;
           reimbursed under the NIH criteria. However, treatment should be commenced by liver&#xD;
           histology severity which is defined as significant liver inflammation or fibrosis&#xD;
           according to APASL and AASLD guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.5. Rationale of study In Taiwan, non-cirrhosis CHB patients with mildly elevated ALT&#xD;
           are not candidates for antiviral treatment under Taiwan NIH reimbursement criteria.&#xD;
           Disease severity could range from mildly liver injury to cirrhosis in this group of&#xD;
           patients. There is a substantial population of patients required antiviral treatment,&#xD;
           but not fulfill the criteria of reimbursement treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the 2 phase 3 trials of TAF, the treatment criteria of ALT were more than 2x of ULN&#xD;
           and did not included liver biopsy as a pre-treatment assessment. In this study, CHB&#xD;
           patient with ALT level of 1-2x ULN and significant liver injury evaluated by liver&#xD;
           biopsy is the target study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY DESIGN 2.1. Study population This is a phase 4, multicenter, open label study at&#xD;
           12 academic hospitals in Taiwan. Treatment na√Øve CHB patients with mildly elevated ALT&#xD;
           (1-2x of ULN) and significant liver injury evaluated by liver biopsy will be enrolled.&#xD;
           The study will be approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) and will be conducted in&#xD;
           accordance with the principles of Declaration of Helsinki and the international&#xD;
           Conference on Harmonization for Good Clinical Practice. Informed consent will be&#xD;
           provided before enrollment for each patient.&#xD;
