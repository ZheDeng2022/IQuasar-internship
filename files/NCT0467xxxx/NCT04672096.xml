    <textblock>
      The objectives of this non-significant risk (NSR) study are to evaluate the safety of the&#xD;
      short term placement of the Basmati Injectrode for up to 28 days and the efficacy of&#xD;
      conducting electrical current to stimulate subcutaneous nerves on the explant date just prior&#xD;
      to explant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, non-randomized design. Up to&#xD;
      10 study subjects will be provided with the placement of an Injectrode insert. The maximal&#xD;
      placement duration will be 28 days. Subjects selected to participate in the trial are healthy&#xD;
      without any preexisting condition indicated to be treated. Each subject will be followed&#xD;
      during the trial period of approximately 50 days, including the time for screening and&#xD;
      post-explant follow-up. The study will end when the last subject has completed the trial&#xD;
      period and exited. After exit from the clinical study, subjects will continue to be followed&#xD;
      by their physician per standard of care. All device and procedure-related adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs) and unanticipated problems (UPs) will be collected and reported per the study protocol.&#xD;
