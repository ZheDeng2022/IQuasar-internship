  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational cross-sectional study of Ocrelizumab or Ofatumumab administrations&#xD;
      for Relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) in selected sites in the US, the UK and&#xD;
      Australia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with RMS receiving Ocrelizumab or Ofatumumab will be recruited to measure the time&#xD;
      spend for Healthcare Providers (HCP) (neurologist, nurse and hospital pharmacist) on&#xD;
      preparing, administering the medication and following up with the patient.&#xD;
