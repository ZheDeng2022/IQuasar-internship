  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a randomized controlled trial and up to 120 teeth, 50 in each of the 2&#xD;
      groups, will be enrolled from the patients at the National University Centre for Oral Health&#xD;
      Singapore (NUCOHS) Endodontic unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of selective caries removal (SCR)&#xD;
      and pulpotomy in preventing pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis in teeth with deep dental&#xD;
      caries radiographically extending at least 2/3 into the width of dentine, over a review&#xD;
      period of 6 months, 1, 3, and 5 years. The secondary aim of this study is to compare the&#xD;
      costs (tangible i.e. restorative treatment costs, and intangible i.e. number of treatment&#xD;
      visits and time spent at clinic to complete treatment) and tooth survival in the oral cavity,&#xD;
      between teeth treated with SCR and pulpotomy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      1. Randomisation and Blinding Teeth will be randomised to receive either SCR or Pulpotomy&#xD;
           blindly, with 50 teeth in each group. Teeth allocated to Pulpotomy that do not&#xD;
           subsequently have caries extending deep to reach the pulp will be excluded from the&#xD;
           Study. Recruitment will continue until the target sample size in each group is attained&#xD;
           , up to a maximum of 120 teeth (surplus to account for teeth that are not able to&#xD;
           complete the allocated treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigators trained in SCR and Pulpotomy will perform both treatment procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For patients with multiple teeth with deep carious lesions suitable for this study, the&#xD;
           unit of randomisation will be the individual tooth and not the patient. If it is not&#xD;
           possible to perform treatment on all the teeth in the same visit, the operator will&#xD;
           start on the tooth which displays the deepest lesion measured radiographically and&#xD;
           according to clinically exigencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the event of emergency/unscheduled return visits due to pain, the patient's treatment&#xD;
           notes will be made available to the attending dentist and emergency treatment rendered&#xD;
           as appropriate (e.g. root canal treatment). This tooth and its relevant research data&#xD;
           will be included as an event in the survival analysis but the tooth will be discontinued&#xD;
           from the Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Visits and Procedures Dental clinicians at National University Polyclinic (NUP)&#xD;
           Dental Clinics and NUCOHS will follow a case selection template for patient referral.&#xD;
           Timeframe for recruitment is up to 6months after referral to NUCOHS. The patients will&#xD;
           be provided standard of care by their dentists according to the respective Institutional&#xD;
           Practice, which may include Oral Health Education, Oral Health Instruction and/or&#xD;
           scaling and polishing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Consent: Patients will be informed of the Study at their first visit to NUCOHS and given&#xD;
           time to consider participation and ask questions. Written informed consent will be&#xD;
           obtained before proceeding to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening and Enrolment: Clinical and radiographic examination in line with current&#xD;
           clinical practice to save teeth with deep caries will be conducted. When inclusion and&#xD;
           exclusion criteria are fulfilled, the tooth will be enrolled into the study. One patient&#xD;
           may contribute more than one tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomisation: This will be performed after tooth is enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment - SCR or Pulpotomy: After allocation to SCR or Pulpotomy, in both groups,&#xD;
           interventions will be performed in a single visit under local anaesthesia and rubber dam&#xD;
           isolation. Caries will be removed using high speed burs with water coolant starting from&#xD;
           the periphery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the SCR group, selective caries are removed only for secure sealing with a direct&#xD;
           restoration, without removing deep caries next to the pulp.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the Pulpotomy group, complete caries removal and excision of the coronal pulp to the&#xD;
           level of the root canal orifices will be performed. After haemostasis, sealing with&#xD;
           Biodentine® and restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In either group, if the tooth is unable to complete the allocated treatment, this tooth&#xD;
           will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In both groups, direct restoration (e.g. composite resin or amalgam) or crowns will be&#xD;
           provided based on remaining tooth structure, number of remaining functioning units,&#xD;
           location of the tooth and its opposing counterpart.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Review Appointments: Four Review visits will be conducted at the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  6-7 months post treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  12- 13 months post treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  36-37 months post treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  60-61 months post treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline data will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relevant pain history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical examination of the tooth, pulp and surrounding bone and mucosa&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Routine dental radiographic examination for tooth restoration&#xD;
&#xD;
           After treatment is completed, the following treatment data will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time to achieve haemostasis for teeth in the pulpotomy group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time taken for the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Type of restoration placed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cost of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cumulative time spent at the dental clinic to complete treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           At follow-up appointments, the review data will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relevant pain history since the last visit&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical examination of the tooth, pulp and surrounding bone and mucosa&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Routine dental radiographic examination to evaluate supporting bone response to the&#xD;
                preserved pulp&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relevant additional procedures for teeth during review period if needed (e.g.&#xD;
                replacement of restoration)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cumulative treatment fees charged to preserve teeth (since enrolment)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cumulative number of treatment visits (including any additional procedures during&#xD;
                the review period, if any)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical and Analytical Plans Unit of analysis is per tooth level. Descriptive&#xD;
           analysis (mean &amp; standard deviation and frequency and proportion, where appropriate)&#xD;
           will be performed to summarize the baseline characteristics of recruited subjects&#xD;
           between the two treatment groups. To study the primary objective - comparing the tooth&#xD;
           survival without pulp pathosis between the two treatment groups at 6 months, 1 year, 3&#xD;
           years and 5 years, proportional z-test will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generalized estimating equation (GEE) with binomial family distribution and log link function&#xD;
      will be employed to study the change in tooth survival over the study follow-up period.&#xD;
      Potential confounders and clinical predictors will be adjusted in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance level for all statistical test is set at p-value&lt;0.05. SPSS Statistical Package&#xD;
      (IBM SPSS Statistics) will be used for all statistical analysis.&#xD;
