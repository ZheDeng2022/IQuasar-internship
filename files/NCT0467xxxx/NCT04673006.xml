  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The practice of intubation and extubation is not without risks to the anesthesiologists.&#xD;
      Especially, the face of health care worker is the body part most commonly contaminated by&#xD;
      splashes and sprays of body fluids. The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of&#xD;
      unrecognized exposure to the anesthesiologists' face during endotracheal intubation and&#xD;
      extubation. We will perform face shield swab before and after the endotracheal intubation and&#xD;
      extubation. All swabs will be cultured for 48 hours and the number of colony forming units&#xD;
      before and after the procedures (intubation/extubation) will be compared.&#xD;
