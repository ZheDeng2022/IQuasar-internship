  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectif is to determine the efficacy of a maintenance treatment combining&#xD;
      Talazoparib and Avelumab after platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first line treatment of urothelial carcinoma is a platinum-based chemotherapy. This&#xD;
      treatment is efficient with a response rate &gt; 50 % but the progression-free survival is short&#xD;
      (7.7 months) and the chemotherapy is too toxic to be used in a prolonged time. Traditionally,&#xD;
      maintenance chemotherapy refers to the utilization of regimens with less toxicity after the&#xD;
      initial upfront treatment. This concept has already been efficient with PARP inhibitors in&#xD;
      ovarian carcinoma and more recently with durvalumab in lung carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of somatic mutations in homologous recombination genes in UC as well as their&#xD;
      association with platinum sensitivity suggests Talazoparib to be a target for a maintenance&#xD;
      treatment of urothelial carcinoma. Moreover, there is a strong rational with both&#xD;
      pre-clinical and clinical data to associate Avelumab and Talazoparib. This appears all the&#xD;
      more relevant that Avelumab has already demonstrated its efficacy in urothelial carcinoma&#xD;
      (after platinum-based chemotherapy failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the sponsorpropose a phase 2 study to assess the antitumor activity of the&#xD;
      combination of Avelumab plus Talazoparib in metastatic urothelial carcinoma in maintenance&#xD;
      therapy after platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the doubts about the best molecular predictive factors of Talazoparib and&#xD;
      Avelumab, the sponsor willingly propose a non-selective study, without molecular screening.&#xD;
      Tumors will be selected according to the platinum sensitivity which has the advantage to&#xD;
      exclude poor prognosis tumors and will allow increasing the HRD tumor population.&#xD;
