  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reverse Nordic curl is a body-weight exercise which mainly works the quadriceps and hip&#xD;
      flexors. It has a large eccentric component, meaning the muscles are working whilst&#xD;
      lengthening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the reverse Nordic curl exercise on&#xD;
      Quadriceps femoris muscles injuries among soccer players.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It hypothesized that reverse Nordic curl exercise has a beneficial effect in terms of&#xD;
      Quadriceps femoris muscles injury prevention.&#xD;

      Description of intervention(s) / exposure The intervention group will be instructed to&#xD;
      include the reverse Nordic curl exercise into their warm up 15 to 20 mins before training&#xD;
      session (3 times per week) during one season (6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group sessions will be administered by an exercise physiologist and/ or athletic trainer and/&#xD;
      or soccer coaches and/ or strength and conditioning specialists and/ or physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session attendance checklists will be used to assess or monitor adherence to the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reverse Nordic curl is a body-weight exercise which mainly works the quadriceps and hip&#xD;
      flexors. It has a large eccentric component, meaning the muscles are working whilst&#xD;
      lengthening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a very simple movement to do, but maintaining strict positioning is vital to get the&#xD;
      full benefits. Here's how to do it:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grab a mat on a soft floor. Kneel down, and sit on top of the feet. If trying this exercise&#xD;
      for the first time, place the knees and feet close together, approximately hip-width apart.&#xD;
      For more advanced, the feet and knees slightly wider, just outside the hips, to be able to&#xD;
      lay back farther without hitting the legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sit up in a tall kneeling position, push the hips forward, and lock the rib cage down.&#xD;
      Looking to create a straight line down the front of the body, especially at the hips. This is&#xD;
      to create a stretch at the hip flexor muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower the shoulders towards the floor by bending at the knee, maintaining the &quot;plank&quot;&#xD;
      position previously created. If hip extension is maintained, and the core adequately braced,&#xD;
      there should be no strain on the low back, and an intense stretch felt down the front of the&#xD;
      legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continue to lean back as far as it is possible to control, then squeeze the quads to return&#xD;
      to the starting position (this may not be very far to begin with). It is crucial to NOT let&#xD;
      the hips drop backwards at any point during the movement. If they do, the stretch on the hip&#xD;
      flexors will be released, defeating the point of the exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once reaching the floor and back is possible for multiple sets of 10+ repetitions, can begin&#xD;
      loading the movement by holding a light plate, kettlebell or dumbbell.&#xD;
