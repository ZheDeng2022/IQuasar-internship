      This study aims to examine whether the PSCS2 is effective in reducing chemotherapy-induced&#xD;
      alopecia in woman with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Female&#xD;
      adults who are newly diagnosed with stage 1-3 breast cancer and expected to receive&#xD;
      Adriamycin or/and Taxane will participate in the study. The study design is a open label,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. The patients will be randomly assigned to intervention or&#xD;
      control groups. Intervention patients will have applied scalp cooling during 4 or 6 cycles of&#xD;
      their chemotherapy. Primary endpoint is the effectiveness of the PSCS2 for reducing permanent&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced alopecia. Secondary endpoints include chemotherapy-induced alopecia,&#xD;
      distress due to chemotherapy induced alopecia, quality of life, and patient-reported alopecia&#xD;
      related side effect.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant chemotherapy decreases the risk of recurrence. However, it has distressing side&#xD;
      effects, including alopecia. Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) is a common and distressing&#xD;
      side effect of many chemotherapy drugs. In previous study, more than half of the breast&#xD;
      cancer patients experienced higher distress due to CIA during cancer treatment, and this&#xD;
      distress was strongly associated with negative body image, overall health status, and&#xD;
      psychosocial well-being. Recently scalp cooling has been known to be one of the effective&#xD;
      options for hair loss prevention. However there was little information regarding the effect&#xD;
      on prevention of permanent CIA(PCIA). This study aims to examine the impact of scalp cooling&#xD;
      on prevention of PCIA as well as CIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female adults who are newly diagnosed with stage 1-3 breast cancer and aged less than 70&#xD;
      years will be screened for plan of undergoing Adriamycin or/and Taxane regimen as neoadjuvant&#xD;
      or adjuvant chemotherapy. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to intervention or&#xD;
      control groups (2:1 ratio). Patients in intervention group will have applied scalp cooling&#xD;
      during 4 or 6 cycles of their chemotherapy whereas participants in control group will be&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to examine whether Paxman scalp cooling system is effective in&#xD;
      reducing PCIA in women with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. In&#xD;
      addition, impact of Paxman scalp cooling on prevention of CIA, alopecia-related distress,&#xD;
      quality of life and patient-reported alopecia related side effect will be also explored.&#xD;

    <description>Permanent chemotherapy-induced alopecia is defined as hair density or thickness less than two standard deviations (SDs) compared to the baseline mean (before chemotherapy) at 6 months (±2 months) after completion of chemotherapy.

    <description>The investigational device which will be used in this study is the Paxman Scalp Cooling System 2. This device is manufactured by: Paxman Coolers Limited. This is a free-standing, electrically-powered, mobile refrigeration unit which circulates a refrigerated liquid coolant, at a pre-set temperature and flow rate, through a cooling cap which is attached to, and covers, the top of the patient's head. The Paxman Scalp Cooling System is intended to be used for scalp cooling of patients who are receiving chemotherapy for the treatment of solid tumors, in order to reduce the risk of chemotherapy-induced alopecia.</description>
