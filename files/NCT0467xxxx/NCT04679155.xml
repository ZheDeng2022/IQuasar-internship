  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To our knowledge, as of this day there are only four studies which examined the effects of&#xD;
      eTRE with a duration of 12 weeks. There are no studies that examined this phenomenon beyond&#xD;
      12 weeks, one study that lasted five weeks and four studies that lasted 4 weeks or less, some&#xD;
      even days. The four studies that lasted 12 weeks in duration all have opportunities to&#xD;
      improve upon, which will be discussed here. The first study performed by Gabel et al.,&#xD;
      focused primarily on measuring body weight, not body composition in older adults. The eating&#xD;
      window also began later in the morning at 1000h and finished at 1800h. There also was no&#xD;
      restriction on participants consuming caffeine during the fasting window. The second study&#xD;
      conducted by Gasmi et al., was focused on strictly older male participants that were active&#xD;
      and healthy, again, without measuring body composition. The third study conducted by&#xD;
      Wilkinson et al., did not measure body composition and the eating window lasted 10 hours&#xD;
      instead of 8. The fourth study performed by Chow et al., examined eTRE with adults aged&#xD;
      45+/-12 years old and did not mention any exclusion criteria based upon physical activity&#xD;
      levels or restrictions on caffeine/artificial sweetener intake during the fasting window.&#xD;
      Furthermore, none of the studies mentioned above examined eTRE against lTRE directly. We&#xD;
      believe that the proposed study will address the concerns mentioned previously and further&#xD;
      knowledge associated with eTRE.&#xD;

      Purpose The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of early and late time&#xD;
      restricted eating on body composition in overweight and obese young adults. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that early time restricted eating will provide a more desirable effect (lower&#xD;
      fat mass) on body composition for the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample The sample will include 30 overweight/obese young adults, male and female, ranging in&#xD;
      age from 18-30 that volunteer to participate in the study. This sample size is justified&#xD;
      assuming a standard deviation of 1.5 based on previous studies and using a power of 80% with&#xD;
      the statistical significance of 0.05 the resulting n would be 2(1.5)^2*(0.84+1.96)^2/5=7&#xD;
      (Kadam, P., &amp; Bhalerao, S. (2010). Sample size calculation. International journal of Ayurveda&#xD;
      research, 1(1), 55). To account for dropouts/non-interest in participation, 10 participants&#xD;
      will be recruited for each group. All individuals must give written informed consent in order&#xD;
      to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria include self-reported: diabetes, smoking,&#xD;
      CVD, pregnancy, weight loss medication, physical activity level greater than low/sedentary&#xD;
      (7500 steps daily), unstable weight (&gt;4kg loss/gain) for 3 months prior to study&#xD;
      commencement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be explicitly stated throughout the recruitment&#xD;
      process. Potential participants will be recruited through mass email recruitment via Western&#xD;
      email services, presenting one-slide information sessions at the beginning of lectures and&#xD;
      posting flyers around campus. Participants will then be in direct contact with Reed Zehr to&#xD;
      set up a meeting to gain information of the study. After the information meeting the&#xD;
      individuals will be given up to 3 days to determine if they want to participate and give&#xD;
      their informed consent. See attached form in the consent section of the ethics application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement: All participants will be required to have their Body Composition measured using&#xD;
      non-invasive densitometry (BodPod). The procedure poses no risk to the participant and takes&#xD;
      approximately 5 minutes to complete. This procedure will take place initially one week prior&#xD;
      to study commencement and then every 4 weeks after study commencement until the 12 weeks of&#xD;
      the study duration are complete. This results in a total of 4 measurements. Upper body&#xD;
      strength measurements will be recorded one week prior to commencement of the study and once&#xD;
      again after study completion using a maximal bench press test. Lower body strength&#xD;
      measurements will be recorded one week prior to commencement of the study and once again&#xD;
      after study completion using a maximal leg press test. Completion of a health-related quality&#xD;
      of life questionnaire one week prior to commencement of the study and once again after study&#xD;
      completion is also required.&#xD;
