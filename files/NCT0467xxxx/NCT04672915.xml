  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mother to Child transmission is the main route of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission in&#xD;
      China, attributing to over 50% HBV infection. Familial aggregation in HBV infection is well&#xD;
      recognized with underlying stipulations like mother-to-child transmission（MTCT）, susceptible&#xD;
      genes, close contact and other factors. Not surprisingly, a large proportion of hepatitis B&#xD;
      virus infected population in China have a family history of hepatitis B virus infection. In&#xD;
      clinical practice those family members usually undergo merely hepatitis B virus serology&#xD;
      tests without HBV DNA test, which ruled out false HBsAg (-) or Occult HBV Infection (OBI)&#xD;
      from Screening and linkage to care (SLTC). Unfortunately, the missed-out OBI in CHB family&#xD;
      members was of a greater prevalence compared to those from general population (8.0% vs. 2.6%)&#xD;
      . Moreover, OBI has been well recognized as strong risk factor in hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      （HCC） development with significant HBV DNA integration into host genome . In light of the&#xD;
      latest 2019 China CHB guidelines, treatment criteria covered subjects with family history of&#xD;
      CHB related cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). Therefore, subjects of HBsAg (+) with&#xD;
      normal alanine aminotransferase（ALT） or OBI are eligible for further consideration of HBV&#xD;
      anti-viral treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposed will explore the prevalence of OBI in subjects with family history of HBV&#xD;
      related cirrhosis or HCC. The screened HBsAg (+) with normal alanine aminotransferase(ALT)&#xD;
      and OBI subjects would be linked to anti-viral therapies.&#xD;

      Serum samples were tested for liver enzymes and liver synthesis function including ALT,&#xD;
      aspartate aminotransferase（AST）, and albumin, etc. using a Hitachi 7600 automatic analyzer&#xD;
      and reagent system (Hitachi, Tokyo, japan). HBsAg quantification was performed using&#xD;
      automated electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) manufactured by Roche. HBsAb, HBeAg,&#xD;
      HBeAb and HBcAb were measured semi-quantitatively using Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA)&#xD;
      manufactured by Abbott Diagnostics (USA). Serum HBV DNA levels were measured using the COBAS&#xD;
      TaqMan HBV Monitor Test, with a lower limit of detection of 20 IU/mL (100 copies/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The false negative result excluding OBI due to Real time PCR (lower limit of 20 IU/ml)&#xD;
      technically may exist. The study group plan to carry out nested PCR (specifically target the&#xD;
      HBV Pre-S, S, Pre-C/Core, and X open reading frames) on subjects with HBsAg (-) HBV DNA (-)&#xD;
      and HBcAb(+) to double check the potential false negative result in HBV DNA from Real time&#xD;
      PCR. Quantitation of intrahepatic HBV cccDNA by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).&#xD;
