  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chinese American immigrant families are a fast-growing immigrant group with unmet early&#xD;
      childhood mental health needs. The team proposes to design, build, and implement OurChild, an&#xD;
      integrated mHealth/EHR solution to increase access to early childhood mental health knowledge&#xD;
      and mental health services and resources for Chinese American children ages 2-6 years old and&#xD;
      their parents in the Sunset Park Brooklyn.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The team's proposal unites their longstanding partnership with the Chinese American community&#xD;
      in Sunset Park and the safety-net clinics serving it with the study team's 1) clinical and&#xD;
      scientific expertise in health disparities, participatory research and early childhood mental&#xD;
      health and 2) the digital health/health IT expertise of the WonderLab, a digital incubator in&#xD;
      the NYU Langone Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. The goal is to reduce health&#xD;
      disparities by explicitly designing a digital solution that facilitates connection and&#xD;
      bidirectional exchange of information across the cultural, contextual, language, and setting&#xD;
      differences that are key barriers to early childhood mental health knowledge and access to&#xD;
      care for this immigrant population. The first aim is to iteratively design, build, and test&#xD;
      OurChild. To do this, the team will 1) collaborate with our family, clinical, and community&#xD;
      stakeholders to conduct an early childhood mental health context/needs analysis and&#xD;
      participatory design and discovery activities; 2) use these insights to adapt and user-test&#xD;
      iterative prototypes; 3) evaluate the usability and acceptability of a beta version of&#xD;
      OurChild in a mixed-methods pilot with 20 Chinese American parents and their 2- to 6-year-old&#xD;
      children who receive care at the Sunset Park 7th Avenue Family Health Center; and 5) optimize&#xD;
      the design, features, and performance to create OurChild 1.0. The second aim it to evaluate&#xD;
      the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, and Implementation of OurChild 1.0 with a 6-month&#xD;
      longitudinal implementation cohort study with 200 parent/child dyads. A mixed-methods&#xD;
      approach using metadata collected with the OurChild app, parent-reported data from the app,&#xD;
      EHR data, and post-implementation focus groups with providers to determine whether use of&#xD;
      OurChild increases referrals of young children for a mental health consultation or evaluation&#xD;
      (Primary Aim) will be used. The secondary aims include examining whether use of OurChild 1)&#xD;
      increases parent self-efficacy; 2) parent-provider engagement; and 3) linkage with community&#xD;
      early childhood resources. Both OurChild and digital methodology will be designed to be&#xD;
      scaled to other Chinese populations and efficiently adapted for other health disparity&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
