    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral L-carnitine supplementation during&#xD;
      controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in a&#xD;
      double-blind randomized clinical trial. The eligible patients with PCOS diagnosis (on the&#xD;
      basis of Rotterdam criteria) who referred to Royan Research Institute for IVF / ICSI&#xD;
      treatment cycles will be evaluated.&#xD;

      The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      Royan institute. Prior to the onset of ovarian stimulation, patients will be allocated&#xD;
      randomly into two groups according to block randomization method. The methodologist will give&#xD;
      the doctor a code according to the randomization list, which corresponds to the code on the&#xD;
      drug's box, and the drug box will be delivered to the patient. The COS procedure in all the&#xD;
      study participate will be same by using a flexible regimen of GnRH antagonist with E2&#xD;
      priming. In the experimental group, the women received 3 tablet of L-carnitine daily&#xD;
      (L-carnitine® tablet 1000 mg, Karen Pharmaceutical Company, Iran) from day 2 of the previous&#xD;
      menstrual cycle until pregnancy test day. The patients in control group will receive 3&#xD;
      placebo tablets for 8 weeks. All the placebo tablets were produced by Karen company (Tehran,&#xD;
      Iran), which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration of Iran. The appearance of the&#xD;
      placebo was indistinguishable in color, shape, size, and smell from L-carnitine tablets.&#xD;
      Ovarian stimulation will start with a maximum dose of 150 units of rFSH (Gonal -F: Serono&#xD;
      Laboratories Ltd, Geneva, Switzerlan), from the second or third day of the spontaneous or&#xD;
      discontinued progesterone menstrual cycle and the monitoring transvaginal ultrasound was&#xD;
      performed and then if the follicle is observed, start with 13 injections of GnRH antagonist&#xD;
      (Cetrotide®, 0.25 mg cetrorelix acetate, Serono, Inc) and will be continued until the oocyte&#xD;
      triggering day. From the seventh day of the cycle, the dose of rFSH will be determined&#xD;
      according to the rate of ovarian response by vaginal ultrasonography two days in advance. If&#xD;
      you see at least two follicles 18 mm in size or more, the final stimulation of oocyte&#xD;
      maturation will be done and 34- 36 hour after that the ovum pickup will be conducted.&#xD;
      Subsequently ICSI or IVF will be done with standard procedure. The outcome evaluators were&#xD;
      also blinded to the random allocation process and type of treatment.The primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes were compared between the two groups using appropriate statistical tests.&#xD;
