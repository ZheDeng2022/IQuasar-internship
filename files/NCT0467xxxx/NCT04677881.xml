  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary fiber is well known to have health promoting effects, including reduced blood glucose&#xD;
      and cholesterol levels. Bread is the most important source of dietary fiber in the Norwegian&#xD;
      diet. Production of bread has changed from the traditionally use of sourdough, to yeast&#xD;
      (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as the dominating leavening agent in modern industrial production.&#xD;
      Sourdough naturally contains bacteria, and through the fermentation process these bacteria&#xD;
      release several components that are not found in modern bread using yeast. It has been shown&#xD;
      that sourdough may have positive health effects, including on blood glucose regulation. The&#xD;
      aim of the project is to investigate if intake of sourdough may give positive health effects&#xD;
      compared to beard with yeast.&#xD;

      The investigators aim to include approximately 20 participants in this randomized controlled&#xD;
      double-blind cross-over study lasting for 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be given bread baked with yeast for a 2 weeks run-in period. The&#xD;
      participants will then be randomly assigned to either 1 week intervention with bread baked&#xD;
      with yeast or sourdough, before a 1 week wash-out period with yeast bread. During the last 1&#xD;
      week intervention period the participants starting with bread baked with yeast will be given&#xD;
      sourdough and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires (GSRS-IBS, BSC, FFQ), blood samples, and feces samples will be collected&#xD;
      before and after the intervention periods.&#xD;
