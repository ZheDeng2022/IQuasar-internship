      The iCorMicA study is a multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group, end-point trial and registry. The investigators seek to determine whether&#xD;
      stratified medical therapy guided by an adjunctive interventional diagnostic procedure (IDP)&#xD;
      during the invasive management of patients with known or suspected angina but no obstructive&#xD;
      coronary artery disease improves symptoms, wellbeing, cardiovascular risk and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) includes coronary artery disease (or 'coronary heart disease&#xD;
      'CHD') and ischaemic with no obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA). Coronary angiography is&#xD;
      standard care for the evaluation of symptomatic patients and known or suspected coronary&#xD;
      artery disease. A considerable proportion e.g. &gt;1 in 3, of patients undergoing invasive&#xD;
      coronary angiography for known or suspected angina do not have obstructive epicardial&#xD;
      coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CorMicA pilot study involved prospective enrolment of patients referred for clinically&#xD;
      indicated coronary angiography during a 12-month period (2016-2017) in the West of Scotland).&#xD;
      391 patients were enrolled, 185 (47%) had no obstructive coronary disease and 151 were&#xD;
      randomised in a clinical trial of stratified medicine based on invasive tests of coronary&#xD;
      vascular function. A high proportion (~4 in 5) of these patients had a diagnosis of INOCA due&#xD;
      to a disorder of coronary vasomotion including microvascular- and/or vasospastic angina. The&#xD;
      trial provided preliminary evidence that stratified medicine, as an adjunct to standard&#xD;
      angiography-guided management, has potential to improve symptoms and quality of life. The&#xD;
      mechanisms involved changes in diagnosis, treatment and lifestyle measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CorMicA investigators were the first group to introduce stratified medicine for the&#xD;
      management of ischaemic heart disease. Limitations of the CorMicA study included the setting&#xD;
      (mainly single centre), partial blinding, short-term follow-up (primary outcome at 6 months)&#xD;
      and the sample size. Acetylcholine reactivity testing was used to assess the susceptibility&#xD;
      to coronary spasm (microvascular and/or macrovascular). Although acetylcholine is a naturally&#xD;
      occurring substance, current formulations are not licensed for parenteral administration.&#xD;
      Further, clinicians should have training and experience before implementing acetylcholine&#xD;
      coronary reactivity testing. These considerations present a barrier to adoption in daily&#xD;
      practice, which becomes all the more relevant given INOCA is generally under-recognised. A&#xD;
      diagnostic coronary guidewire is already widely used in standard care and, unlike reactivity&#xD;
      testing using acetylcholine, a guidewire has transferable potential to support stratified&#xD;
      medicine during routine practice. This is especially the case for ad-hoc follow-on testing&#xD;
      when obstructive coronary artery disease is excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vasoactive responses to acetylcholine reflect endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell&#xD;
      effects, which may overlap with the vasoactive responses to adenosine (non-endothelial&#xD;
      dependent). Calcium channel blocker therapy is indicated for the functional endotypes&#xD;
      associated with impaired vasodilatation and/or vasoconstriction. This raises the possibility&#xD;
      that acetylcholine testing may not be routinely required as an adjunctive test to coronary&#xD;
      angiography and instead could be reserved for selected cases, or in specialist centres.&#xD;
      Instead, the diagnostic guidewire approach may be sufficient as a routine, first line test&#xD;
      for the evaluation of INOCA during daily practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anatomical imaging using coronary angiography is the standard of care and clinicians may&#xD;
      determine any diagnosis based on all of the available information and their clinical&#xD;
      judgement. This approach avoids the need for additional tests. With this approach, the&#xD;
      patient's symptoms in response to empirical therapy can be assessed during follow-up and the&#xD;
      treatment can be revised as clinically appropriate. In daily practice, adoption of adjunctive&#xD;
      tests of coronary function is very low and, in the absence of large, multicentre trials,&#xD;
      coronary angiography with or without adjunctive tests of coronary vascular function may be&#xD;
      considered reasonable, reflecting equipoise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iCorMicA is a multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group, end-point (patient reported outcome measures (PROMS), health outcomes, health&#xD;
      economics) trial and registry. The investigators aim to determine whether stratified medical&#xD;
      therapy, guided by a guidewire-based interventional diagnostic procedure (IDP) at the time of&#xD;
      invasive coronary angiography (i.e. functional angiography), improves outcomes in patients&#xD;
      with known or suspected angina but no obstructive coronary artery disease. Symptoms of angina&#xD;
      or angina-equivalent are determined according to the Rose and/or Seattle Angina&#xD;
      questionnaires. The IDP utilises principles of thermodilution to measure coronary vascular&#xD;
      function (IMR, CFR, RRR), which aid clinicians in establishing a diagnosis of microvascular&#xD;
      angina, vasospastic angina, mixed (both), or none, as per Coronary Vasomotion Disorders&#xD;
      International Study Group (COVADIS) criteria. The feasibility, safety, efficacy and effect on&#xD;
      healthcare resource utilisation of stratified medicine will be tested in multiple hospitals&#xD;
      in different countries in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with no obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease (coronary stenosis &lt;50%&#xD;
      and/or FFR &gt;0.80) are eligible for randomisation (1:1) to either the intervention&#xD;
      (IDP-guided, results disclosed) or blinded control (IDP undertaken but results not disclosed,&#xD;
      standard of care) group. Medical therapy will be informed according to the clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      (endotype). Patients in the intervention group with abnormal coronary vascular function may&#xD;
      undergo repeated evaluations to assess the response to intracoronary therapy e.g. calcium&#xD;
      channel blocker, enabling a personalised treatment plan. Patients who are ineligible for&#xD;
      randomisation (e.g. obstructive coronary artery disease) may be entered into a prospective&#xD;
      clinical registry, with individuals from each site invited to undergo similar follow-up&#xD;
      assessments as the randomised participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial participants will be blinded to treatment group. The clinicians responsible for&#xD;
      on-going care will also be blinded. Following invasive management, patients and clinicians&#xD;
      will be advised of the diagnosis (endotype) but not the randomised group. The endotype will&#xD;
      be informed by the IDP in the intervention group but not in the control group (sham&#xD;
      procedure). Medical therapy and lifestyle measures are linked to the endotype and informed by&#xD;
      contemporary practice guidelines. Therefore, optimal guideline-directed medical care&#xD;
      according to the endotype is intended to be the same, regardless of the group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is 1500 randomised participants. The minimum follow-up duration is 12 months&#xD;
      from the last participant recruitment. Follow-up will continued in the longer term including,&#xD;
      where feasible, electronic case record linkage. The primary outcome measure is the Summary&#xD;
      Score of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include other&#xD;
      Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMS) to describe other aspects of health and wellbeing.&#xD;
      These include EQ-5D-5L, Illness perception (Brief IPQ), Treatment satisfaction (TSQM), Duke&#xD;
      Activity Status Index (DASI), the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF)&#xD;
      short-form and a pain questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional objectives include the wider evaluation of the safety and diagnostic utility of&#xD;
      the IDP in a multicentre, multinational setting, and the effects of stratified medicine on&#xD;
      the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events by randomised group. The registry will&#xD;
      represent a parallel control group. Scientific analyses of circulating biomarkers will be&#xD;
      performed to better understand the pathophysiology of INOCA.&#xD;
