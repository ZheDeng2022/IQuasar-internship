    <textblock>
      In Japan, nationwide prophylactic HPV vaccination was implemented in 2010; a bivalent vaccine&#xD;
      was given from 2010 to 2012, and a quadrivalent vaccine from 2012. However, the program&#xD;
      essentially ceased in June 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Our first objective is to examine the prevalence of 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and&#xD;
           58 targeted by the nonavalent HPV vaccine in young Japanese women, and identify changes&#xD;
           in the prevalence of these HPV types from 2011- 2012 (as reported in JHERS-2016;&#xD;
           Sasagawa T, J Med Virol, 2016) to the present time (2020-2021). Especially, the&#xD;
           investigators will focus on the prevalence of HPV16 and 18 in women aged 21-26 years and&#xD;
           compare these data to those of the previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators will assess the prevalence of HPV16 and 18 in women aged 16-18 years&#xD;
           and compare these data to those of the HPV vaccine era (2010-2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The investigators will explore the prevalence of other high-risk HPV types (35, 39, 51,&#xD;
           56, 59, and 68), 11 probable high-risk types (26, 30,34, 53, 66, 67, 69, 70, 73, 82, and&#xD;
           85), and SILs in Japanese young women, since these types might be causative HPV types&#xD;
           for cervical cancer in the future after world-wide HPV vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, it is unclear whether HPV vaccination has reduced the prevalence of HPV16 and 18&#xD;
      in Japan. Our previous study (JHERS-2016; performed during 2011-2012; Sasagawa T, J Med&#xD;
      Virol, 2016), the only population-based study on HPV prevalence at the commencement of&#xD;
      prophylactic HPV vaccination in Japan, included prevalence data for HPV types 6, 11, 16, and&#xD;
      18 and the associated cervical abnormalities. The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      prevalence of HPV16 and 18 and the associated diseases (SILs) decreased significantly in&#xD;
      women aged 21-26 years in the present, vaccinated group compared to that in similar aged&#xD;
      women in 2010-2012 who were unvaccinated. In contrast, the prevalence of HPV and associated&#xD;
      diseases may not differ in women aged 27-39 years between the two eras; such subjects may&#xD;
      thus serve as a negative control group. Also, HPV prevalence may be higher in present women&#xD;
      aged 16-18 years than in women in that age range during the vaccine era, as the former group&#xD;
      have not been vaccinated against HPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence rates of the other unique high-risk types, namely HPV35, 39, 51, 56, 59, and&#xD;
      68, and probable high-risk types, HPV26, 20, 34, 53, 66, 67, 67, 70, 73, 82, and 85, are&#xD;
      unlikely to have been affected by HPV vaccination. However, it is important to monitor the&#xD;
      prevalences of these types and the associated SILs, because the types numbered above may&#xD;
      become more significant as currently common HPV types are eliminated in the near future.&#xD;

      Recently, HPV prevalence has decreased dramatically in the USA (Markowitz LE, Pediatrics,&#xD;
      2019). Surprisingly, the nonavalent vaccine optimally decreased the prevalence of the most&#xD;
      common, high-risk HPV types and also reduced the incidence of premalignant cervical lesions&#xD;
      (Mariani L, Int J Gynaecol Obstet, 2017). The data thus suggest that both the bivalent and&#xD;
      quadrivalent HPV vaccines eliminate HPV16- and 18-associated cervical cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regrettably, in Japan, use of the bivalent and quadrivalent prophylactic HPV vaccines almost&#xD;
      ceased, by government decree, in June 2013 (Hanley JBS, Lancet, 2015). However, about 70% of&#xD;
      girls aged 13-18 years were immunized with these vaccines during 2010-2012. A small decrease&#xD;
      in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) has been observed in 20-year-old&#xD;
      Japanese women who underwent HPV vaccination (Yagi A, Vaccine, 2019).The investigators&#xD;
      recently found nationwide (unpublished) data suggesting that the incidence of condyloma has&#xD;
      decreased in Japanese women aged in their early twenties, but has apparently increased in&#xD;
      males. The decrease in women may be attributable to quadrivalent HPV vaccination, which&#xD;
      protects against HPV6 and 11 infections. Further work is necessary, as statistical analysis&#xD;
      is lacking, and the proportion of quadrivalent vaccinations among all vaccinations is unknown&#xD;
      in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators earlier reported a high prevalence of HPV infection and associated cervical&#xD;
      abnormalities in 6,628 women aged 16-50 years. The work was performed from October 2011 to&#xD;
      March 2012 and was reported in JHERS-2016 (Sasagawa T, J Med Virol, 2016). The investigators&#xD;
      recorded demographic information including age, marital status, any history of or current&#xD;
      sexually transmitted disease (STD), any cervical abnormalities, and any other gynecological&#xD;
      problems. HPV genotyping (31 types) and the Pap test were performed for all subjects. This is&#xD;
      the only study that has investigated HPV prevalence and cervical SILs in the general&#xD;
      population. The information collected included sexual details and any history of HPV&#xD;
      vaccination. Routine gynecological examination, the Pap test (employing liquid-based cytology&#xD;
      [LBC]), and HPV genotyping of LBC samples were performed. These data allow us to compare the&#xD;
      status of women in the vaccine and (present) no-vaccine era.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible to essentially eliminate cervical cancer by implementation of nanovalent HPV&#xD;
      vaccination and careful cancer screening (HPV testing). However, some specialists suggest&#xD;
      that reductions in certain HPV types might induce increases in other HPV types that are not&#xD;
      targeted by vaccination and not tested during cancer screening. Not only the existing 13&#xD;
      high-risk HPV types but also other HPV types considered to probably or possibly associated&#xD;
      with high risk are found in some cervical cancer tissues (Halec G, J Pathology 2014). The&#xD;
      investigators also found such HPV types in high-grade SILs, as reported in JHERS-2016&#xD;
      (Sasagawa T, J Med Virol, 2016) and a recent publication (Sakamoto J, Papillomavirus Res,&#xD;
      2019). Therefore, in the present project, the investigators will document the prevalence of&#xD;
      all oncogenic HPV types, including the 13 recognized high-risk types and the probable&#xD;
      high-risk types (HPV26, 30, 34, 53, 66, 67, 69, 70, 73, 82, and 85).&#xD;
