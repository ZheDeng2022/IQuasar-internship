      DECRESCENDO is a multicentre, open-label, dual-phase single-arm phase II de-escalation study&#xD;
      evaluating neoadjuvant treatment with 12 administrations of weekly IV paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 (or&#xD;
      IV docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles) combined with subcutaneous (SC) fixed dose&#xD;
      combination (FDC) of pertuzumab and trastuzumab (loading dose of 1200 mg pertuzumab and 600&#xD;
      mg trastuzumab, followed by 600 mg pertuzumab and 600 mg trastuzumab) every 3 weeks for 4&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery will be performed according to local guidelines in all subjects after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, subjects who achieve a pCR (defined as pT0/Tis pN0) will receive adjuvant&#xD;
      pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC for additional 14 cycles. Subjects with residual invasive&#xD;
      disease will receive salvage adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, 3.6 mg/kg, IV every 3&#xD;
      weeks) for 14 cycles. In subjects whose residual invasive disease is classified per RCB score&#xD;
      as ≥2, 3 to 4 cycles of anthracycline-based chemotherapy may be administered, at the&#xD;
      investigator's discretion, before the 14 cycles of T-DM1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If histopathological analysis finds that the surgical specimen from a subject with residual&#xD;
      disease is ER-positive and/or PR-positive, adjuvant endocrine therapy may be administered&#xD;
      concomitantly with study treatment, at the investigator's discretion and according to local&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant radiotherapy will be mandatory after breast-conserving surgery, whereas it will be&#xD;
      performed according to local guidelines after mastectomy, and it will be administered&#xD;
      concomitantly with pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC in subjects who achieve a pCR, and&#xD;

      DECRESCENDO is a multicentre, open-label, dual-phase single-arm phase II de-escalation study&#xD;
      evaluating neoadjuvant treatment with 12 administrations of weekly intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 (or IV docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles) combined with&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) fixed dose combination (FDC) of pertuzumab and trastuzumab (loading dose of&#xD;
      1200 mg pertuzumab and 600 mg trastuzumab, followed by 600 mg pertuzumab and 600 mg&#xD;
      trastuzumab) every 3 weeks for 4 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery will be performed according to local guidelines in all subjects after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, subjects who achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR, defined as pT0/Tis&#xD;
      pN0) will receive adjuvant pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC for additional 14 cycles.&#xD;
      Subjects with residual invasive disease will receive salvage adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine&#xD;
      (T-DM1, 3.6 mg/kg, IV every 3 weeks) for 14 cycles. In subjects whose residual invasive&#xD;
      disease is classified per Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) score as ≥2, 3 to 4 cycles of&#xD;
      anthracycline-based chemotherapy may be administered, at the investigator's discretion,&#xD;
      before the 14 cycles of T-DM1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If histopathological analysis finds that the surgical specimen from a subject with residual&#xD;
      disease is ER-positive and/or PR-positive, adjuvant endocrine therapy may be administered&#xD;
      concomitantly with study treatment, at the investigator's discretion and according to local&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant radiotherapy will be mandatory after breast-conserving surgery, whereas it will be&#xD;
      performed according to local guidelines after mastectomy, and it will be administered&#xD;
      concomitantly with pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC in subjects who achieve a pCR, and&#xD;
      concomitantly with T-DM1 in subjects with residual invasive disease (after&#xD;
      anthracycline-based chemotherapy in subjects assigned to receive this treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' tumour intrinsic subtype will be determined based on analysis of the PAM50 gene&#xD;
      signature. The PAM50 gene signature, which measures the expression of 50 genes to classify&#xD;
      tumours into 1 of 4 intrinsic subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like),&#xD;
      will be assessed in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples obtained at baseline.&#xD;
      While a tumour biopsy sample must be available prior to enrolment, the PAM50 results will be&#xD;
      generated centrally post enrolment and subsequently used to assess the primary endpoint of&#xD;
      the study, which is the 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate in the subpopulation of&#xD;
      subjects with HER2-enriched tumours who achieve a pCR after the neoadjuvant phase of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The flexible care sub-study is an open-label, randomised phase II study to be conducted in&#xD;
      selected sites from some of the countries that participate in DECRESCENDO. After completion&#xD;
      of neoadjuvant treatment and surgery in the main study, 121 of the subjects who achieved a&#xD;
      pCR and thus are assigned to continue treatment with pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC will&#xD;
      be randomised at a 1:1 ratio to receive 3 cycles of pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC every 3&#xD;
      weeks in the hospital, followed by 3 cycles in another setting outside the hospital, or to&#xD;
      the same treatment starting with 3 cycles outside the hospital followed by 3 cycles in the&#xD;
      hospital (treatment cross-over period). After the first 6 cycles of adjuvant treatment,&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to choose between continuing treatment (for the remaining 8 cycles,&#xD;
      for a total of 14 cycles) within or outside the hospital, according to their preference&#xD;
      (treatment continuation period). Subjects can request to change from outside the hospital to&#xD;
      in the hospital administration (and vice-versa) at any moment during the treatment&#xD;
      continuation period, but not in the treatment cross-over period.&#xD;

                  possible, two FFPE tumour blocks should be available (preferred).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a block cannot be provided, 25 unstained FFPE slides of 4 µm thickness from&#xD;
                  the pre-treatment tumour biopsy must be provided as an alternative. These slides&#xD;
                  must be freshly cut prior the shipment to the sponsor.&#xD;
