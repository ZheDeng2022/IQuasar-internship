  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot phase I study to evaluate the safety and efficacy on elemene injectable&#xD;
      emulsion in treating patients with glioblastoma. Elemene, isolated from the Chinese medicinal&#xD;
      herb Curcuma wenyujin, was shown to exhibit antitumor activity in human and murine tumor&#xD;
      cells in vitro and in vivo.Elemene injectable emulsion against malignant tumors was low.&#xD;
      Therefore, the effect of Elemene injectable emulsion being used in clinical settings needs to&#xD;
      be confirmed by further RCTs.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elemene, isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Curcuma wenyujin, was shown to exhibit&#xD;
           antitumor activity in human and murine tumor cells in vitro and in vivo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study shows that the methodological quality of RCTs of Elemene injectable emulsion&#xD;
           against malignant tumors was low. Therefore, the effect of Elemene injectable emulsion&#xD;
           being used in clinical settings needs to be confirmed by further RCTs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of Elemene injectable emulsion to treat Refractory Glioblastoma&#xD;
           with TMZ&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of Elemene injectable emulsion to treat Refractory Glioblastoma&#xD;
           with TMZ&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trail is a randomized controlled trial.In control group,patients will receive&#xD;
      TMZ-chemotherapy.In experimental group,patients will receive elemene injectable emulsion and&#xD;
      TMZ-chemotherapy at the same time.&#xD;
