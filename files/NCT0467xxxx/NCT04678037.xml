  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify modifiable behavioral strategies based&#xD;
      on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) that will&#xD;
      improve hydroxyurea (HU) adherence among adolescents and young adults with sickle cell&#xD;
      disease (SCD). In this proposed study, we intend to test the functionality of a PROs-toolbox&#xD;
      feature, which will be integrated into our existing smartphone application platform&#xD;
      (SCD-app), over a 24-week period in a cohort of SCD patients and their caregivers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adherence to hydroxyurea is a multi-factorial dynamic process, and, to date, predictors for&#xD;
      changes in adherence levels over time remain unclear. Changes in HRQOL data could serve as&#xD;
      surrogate markers for changes in hydroxyurea adherence over time, and could suggest when&#xD;
      patients might or might not need or benefit from an intervention based on worse or better&#xD;
      HRQOL scores, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of this study is that the assessment of patients' HRQOL at home using a&#xD;
      SCD smartphone application platform (app) is feasible and acceptable, and that less frequent&#xD;
      assessments of HRQOL at home will have an overall higher completion rate when compared to&#xD;
      more frequent ones. We plan to assess HRQOL using the NIH-developed patient reported outcomes&#xD;
      measurement information system (PROMIS®) with computerized adaptive testing (CAT) approach.&#xD;
      PROMIS®-CAT approach is a reliable and valid PROs assessment platform that has been used in&#xD;
      limited studies in SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the assessment of patients HRQOL at&#xD;
           home using smartphones with PROMIS®-CAT measures integrated into a SCD-app.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the effect of the frequency of required HRQOL assessments on participants'&#xD;
           completion rate over 24-week period with HRQOL evaluated every 2 weeks (Group 1) versus&#xD;
           every 4 weeks (Group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore participants' experience and preferences with the process and the frequency&#xD;
           of HRQOL assessment at home using their smartphones with PROMIS®-CAT measures integrated&#xD;
           into a SCD-app.&#xD;

    <description>Having an overall completion rate of ≥ 50% for all study participants (Group A and B). This will be reported as a dichotomous outcome, either yes or no. The percentage (%) completion rate will be calculated as the number of PROs assessments completed divided by the number of PROs assessments expected over the study period.</description>
