  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The orally administered second-generation bis-aryl urea tyrosine kinase inhibitor quizartinib&#xD;
      is very specific for FLT3, has a high capacity for sustained FLT3-inhibition and an&#xD;
      acceptable toxicity profile. Furthermore, single agent quizartinib doubled the response rate&#xD;
      as compared to standard of care in a randomized study in r/r-AML. Combination therapy of&#xD;
      quizartinib with intensive standard induction chemotherapy has been shown to be safe and&#xD;
      moreover, single agent quizartinib maintenance therapy is feasible even after allogeneic HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of quizartinib in combination with intensive induction and post-remission&#xD;
      therapy including allogeneic HCT and single agent quizartinib as maintenance therapy is&#xD;
      evaluated by this protocol. This approach is compared in a randomized manner to the current&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, upfront randomized phase III trial of patients with FLT3-ITD positive&#xD;
      AML comparing quizartinib in combination with SOC chemotherapy versus treatment according to&#xD;
      physician's choice (PhC). Efficacy is assessed by comparing EFS between the quizartinib and&#xD;
      the PhC arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective To improve modified event-free survival (mEFS) with Quizartinib added to&#xD;
      induction and consolidation therapy followed by single agent maintenance therapy compared to&#xD;
      physician's choice (PhC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives To improve overall survival (OS) with Quizartinib added to conventional&#xD;
      therapy compared to physician's choice; To improve remission (including CR/CRi/CRh) rate with&#xD;
      Quizartinib added to conventional therapy compared to physician's choice To reduce measurable&#xD;
      residual disease (MRD) with Quizartinib added to conventional therapy compared to physician's&#xD;
      choice after induction (MRDind), consolidation (MRDcons), before allogeneic hematopoietic&#xD;
      cell transplantation (MRDpre-HCT ) and maintenance (MRDmaintenance) therapy Assessment of&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes (PRO) after induction, consolidation and maintenance therapy and&#xD;
      after two years Evaluation of safety based on duration of neutropenia and leukopenia,&#xD;
      incidence of infection, duration of initial hospitalization and number of transfusions (e.g.&#xD;
      packed red blood cells and platelets) Cost-effectiveness analysis of the two different&#xD;
      treatment schedules from health care payer´s perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Budget impact analysis of introducing effective treatment schedule(s) in everyday clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
