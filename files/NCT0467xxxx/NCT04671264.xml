  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy of vibrating capsule (VC) in promoting defecation by mechanical&#xD;
      stimulation of the gastrointestinal walls have been elucidated in animal studies and pilot&#xD;
      clinical studies. Our study aimed to explore the clinical application of a newly developed&#xD;
      smartphone-controlled multi-mode VC in the treatment of functional constipation (FC) on&#xD;
      multicentres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred to gastroenterology outpatient of Changhai Hospital with FC and met the&#xD;
      eligible criteria for more than 6 months and with spontaneous complete bowel movement (SCBM)&#xD;
      less than 3 times per week within recent 3 weeks were eligible for this study. The study was&#xD;
      discussed with patients who satisfied the enrolment criteria and provided written informed&#xD;
      consents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a multicentred, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the&#xD;
      safety and the effecacy of a newly developed gastrointestinal vibrating capsule (VC) in&#xD;
      treating patients with functional constipation (FC). The whole process included two weeks&#xD;
      run-in period, six weeks double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period, and a follow-up&#xD;
      period until the discharge of all swallowed capsules. During treatment period, patients were&#xD;
      required to swallow one capsule every three to four days and a total of twelve capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, a face to face follow-up was required for at least 6 times, once every two&#xD;
      weeks through the whole study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in period (Visit 1) Face to face consultation in gastroenterology outpatient clinic and&#xD;
      sign of written informed consents; Barium enema or colonoscopy (no re-examination is needed&#xD;
      if the patient has undergone barium enema or total colonoscopy within a year); Distribution&#xD;
      of bisacodyl tablets and diary cards; Perform the following examinations: vital signs,&#xD;
      physical examination and laboratory examination; Eligibility evaluation based on the&#xD;
      entry/discharge criteria; Record of past medical history, concomitant diseases and&#xD;
      medication; Collection of the baseline characteristics of the enrolled patients including&#xD;
      age, sex, duration of constipation, mean SCBMs, spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs), BMs,&#xD;
      frequency of bisacodyl tablets taken and Bristol Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period Visit 2： Randomization; Patients were asked to fill in PAC-SYM, PAC-QOL and&#xD;
      Comprehensive Evaluation Questionnaire; Record of vital signs and physical examination;&#xD;
      Distribution of bisacodyl tablets, capsule retrieving bags and VCs; Instruct patients how to&#xD;
      use the control board and start the vibration of VCs; Recycle of bisacodine tablets;&#xD;
      Distribution and collection of diary cards; Record of adverse events, concomitant diseases&#xD;
      and medication. Visit 3, Visit 4： Patients were asked to fill in PAC-SYM, PAC-QOL and&#xD;
      Comprehensive Evaluation Questionnaire; Record of vital signs and physical examination;&#xD;
      Recheck fecal routine and occult blood examination; Distribution of bisacodyl tablets,&#xD;
      capsule retrieving bags and VCs; Recycle of bisacodyl tablets and VCs; Distribution and&#xD;
      collection of diary cards; Record of adverse events, concomitant diseases and medication.&#xD;
      Visit 5： Patients were asked to fill in PAC-SYM, PAC-QOL and Comprehensive Evaluation&#xD;
      Questionnaire; Record of vital signs and physical examination; ECG; Blood routine/blood&#xD;
      biochemistry/urine routine; Fecal routine and occult blood; Recycle of bisacodyl tablets and&#xD;
      VCs; Distribution and collection of diary cards; Distribution of capsule retrieving bags;&#xD;
      Record of adverse events, concomitant diseases and medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up period (Visit6):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the discharge of all capsules; Recycle of capsules; Collection of diary cards;&#xD;
      During the follow-up period, once the capsule was discharged the follow-up would be ended. If&#xD;
      the capsules were still in the body, the patients must continue the follow-up until the&#xD;
      capsules were all discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with SBM increased more than 1 time&#xD;
      during treatment period. Secondary endpoints including mean SCBM , SBM , bowel movement (BM)&#xD;
      and their improvements , Bristol Score, capsule evacuation time and satisfaction level.&#xD;
      Patients were continuously monitored for adverse events (AE) at baseline and at each visit.&#xD;
      Satisfaction level were evaluated based on Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life&#xD;
      questionnaire (PAC-QOL) and Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptom (PAC-SYM) at each&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;

The number divided by the treatment days and multiplied by 7 were the mean SCBMs per week in treatment period.

    <description>Vibrating capsule (VC) was proposed and applied for the patent by professor Liao Zhuan from Changhai Hospital, developed and manufactured by the Ankon Medical Technology Co., Ltd. The system consisted of a vibrating capsule and an external configuration device (ECD). It's 26.7 mm in length, 11.8 mm in diameter and 4.5 + 0.5 g in weight.&#xD;
Each VC has its own semiconductor chip with serial number in order to be recognized and controlled by ECD. VC can be stopped by ECD or mobile-phone application. There was a bidirectional radio frequency communication signal between VC and ECD. In addition, an application (APP) named VCP can be connected to ECD through smart phone to select mode and debug specific parameters for VC. The capsule can be activated by ECD, and then the vibration mode can be controlled by a configurator or an smartphone application.</description>

    <description>follow-up was required for at least 6 times, once every two weeks through the whole study.&#xD;
For patients who had no colonoscopy examination within a year, colonoscopy was a must to exclude organic diseases.&#xD;
These included blood routine, blood biochemistry, urine routine, fecal routine, fecal occult blood, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), blood pregnancy test and ECG examination. Patients should finish all the examination in the run-in period and at the end of treatment period.&#xD;
Dairy cards were designed mainly for the record of the daily defecation of patients and filled out by the enrolled patients, and the content included date, whether the patients swallow capsules (time), whether the patients discharge capsules (time), defecation, defecation time, degree of defecation exertion(0~4), BSF scale, complete or incomplete defecation, whether the patient had the sense of anal obstruction, whether manual assistance was applied, and whether first-aid medicine was used (bisacodyl).</description>
