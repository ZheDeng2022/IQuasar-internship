  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CSP-2002 study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the InnAVasc arteriovenous&#xD;
      graft (AVG) when implanted in and used for hemodialysis in participants suffering from&#xD;
      end-stage renal failure (ESRD). The InnAVasc AVG is implanted and used similar to other&#xD;
      standard-of-care dialysis grafts currently on the market. However, the InnAVasc AVG has been&#xD;
      uniquely designed to potentially allow for immediate needle access (same day as implant&#xD;
      surgery as opposed to 2-4 weeks of waiting), to potentially reduce excessive bleeding from&#xD;
      the graft after dialysis, and it may provide protection from improper or missed needle&#xD;
      cannulation attempts.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The InnAVasc AVG is intended for use in ESRD hemodialysis patients who require HD and whose&#xD;
      next most appropriate access is an AVG, also including those who may require an immediate&#xD;
      cannulation AVG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with ESRD who require hemodialysis and are suitable for an AVG for hemodialysis&#xD;
      access will be eligible for inclusion in the study. Subjects will be implanted with an&#xD;
      InnAVasc AVG in the forearm or upper arm using standard vascular surgical techniques. The&#xD;
      graft will be placed in a &quot;straight&quot; (soft &quot;C&quot;) configuration in the upper arm, or looped&#xD;
      configuration in the forearm (forearm loop) or upper arm (axillary loop). Placing the graft&#xD;
      across the elbow will be prohibited. Subjects must be able to be on antiplatelet therapy per&#xD;
      the discretion of their physician (i.e., aspirin, clopidogrel, etc.).&#xD;
