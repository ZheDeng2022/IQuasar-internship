  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pre-post-test randomized controlled (parallel group) experimental design study aimed to&#xD;
      determine the effect of education based on health belief model and health literacy level of&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes on disease management. Study was carried out in Isparta Davraz&#xD;
      Family Health Centre between June 17, 2019 and March 02, 2020. Sample consisted of 120&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes, selected by simple randomization method, including 60 patients&#xD;
      for the intervention group and 60 patients for the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in intervention and control were also sub-grouped according to their health literacy&#xD;
      level. The intervention group was given training based on the health belief model with groups&#xD;
      of 10-12-13 people every week for 6 weeks in the Family Health Center, followed by telephone&#xD;
      counseling in the following 6 weeks and follow-up for 12 weeks. Patients in the control group&#xD;
      were assessed at the first interview and the last interview, received routine health care,&#xD;
      and no intervention was performed during the research. &quot;Patient Data Form&quot;, &quot;Health Literacy&#xD;
      Scale Among Diabetes Patients&quot;, &quot;Health Belief Model Scale in Diabetes Patients&quot; and &quot;Type 2&#xD;
      Diabetes Self-Efficacy Scale&quot; used for data collection. Data were collected both on the first&#xD;
      day of the study and in the 24th week.&#xD;
