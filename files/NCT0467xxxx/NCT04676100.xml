  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ICRR is a health services registry to establish the quality of CR delivery, and the&#xD;
      effectiveness in terms of patient outcomes, in low-resource settings. The purposes of the&#xD;
      registry are care optimization, evidentiary support for CR advocacy / policy, and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All programs in low-resource settings will be welcome to participate at no cost. Programs&#xD;
      will follow procedures approved by their local ethics board for collection of program and&#xD;
      patient-reported variables. Assessments occur pre-cardiac rehabilitation (CR), post-CR and&#xD;
      annually thereafter.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The user sub-committee has a formal site on-boarding process. Participating sites will be&#xD;
      encouraged to enter data on all patients meeting inclusion / exclusion criteria to reduce&#xD;
      bias. Prospective / concurrent data collection will be encouraged, to support quality&#xD;
      improvement activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The company Dendrite will host the registry and ensure data security. Privacy protections&#xD;
      will be in place, and no identifying information such as names will be entered into the&#xD;
      registry. Data entered from sites into the registry is secured through encryption added to&#xD;
      secure HTTP, done using Transport Layer Security. Stored data is also encrypted using&#xD;
      InterSystems Cache database software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an ICRR program survey assessing structural CR indicators. The registry variable&#xD;
      list for patient-level data was developed based on recommendations of the Core Outcome&#xD;
      Set-STAndards for Development (COS-STAD), through a delphi process. The final variable list&#xD;
      and data dictionary can be found here: https://globalcardiacrehab.com/ICRR-Governance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 10 program-reported variables and 16 patient-reported variables (some variables are&#xD;
      assessed at multiple time points), assessed pre-program, post-program (dependent upon&#xD;
      duration of each program) and each year from initial assessment (until patients expire or are&#xD;
      unable to complete the assessments, which is ascertained by the program, or patient&#xD;
      opt-out/withdrawal). Sites can arrange electronic data capture for the program-reported&#xD;
      variables to contribute data to the registry, rather than manual electronic entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics (i.e. means and standard deviations for continuous variables and&#xD;
      frequencies with percentages for categorical variables) will be used to describe the quality&#xD;
      of care (outcomes below). For testing change in patient outcomes pre to post-program, paired&#xD;
      t-tests will also be used for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univariate and multivariate approaches will be used to identify factors associated with&#xD;
      outcomes, including the use of guideline-indicated therapies. Associations between patient&#xD;
      characteristics and outcomes tested via logistic regression will be reported with odds ratios&#xD;
      and 95% confidence intervals. Associations will be considered statistically significant when&#xD;
      2-sided Î± is &lt;0.05. Appropriate statistical corrections for repeated measures will be&#xD;
      performed. To limit the influence of confounding, multivariate adjustment will be used,&#xD;
      including propensity weighting, or other techniques. Risk adjustment (e.g., socioeconomic&#xD;
      status, indication, comorbidities, age) will be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry has a data quality dashboard which displays by site completeness of data entry&#xD;
      at each assessment point, to help reduce bias. The registry has in-built minimum and maximum&#xD;
      values for continuous variables to reduce data entry errors. The data dictionary clearly&#xD;
      defines each variable, and new sites are trained prior to start. The registry is being&#xD;
      usability tested prior to launch, and piloted in Qatar. The research sub-committee will&#xD;
      oversee a data quality process; Data audits may be supported by a registry database analyst /&#xD;
      professional statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient perspectives were considered in the development of the variable list and outcomes. A&#xD;
      registry page for patients is in development&#xD;
      (https://globalcardiacrehab.com/ICRR-for-Patients). Patients have a voice on ICRR's user&#xD;
      sub-committee. Patients providing data pre and post-program may receive a lay summary of&#xD;
      their progress. Lay summaries of annual registry reports may be shared with interested&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <description>A CR program is defined as one that offers initial assessment, structured exercise (can be supervised or unsupervised) and at least one other strategy to control risk factors. The registry pertains to phase II CR.&#xD;
Quality of care and patient outcomes are benchmarked with other countries anonymously, through 2 registry dashboards (real-time). The dashboards will also show change over time in 6-month increments; Sites will be encouraged to continue to provide data on new patients until all indicators show quality as possible.&#xD;
Sites will be supported in quality improvement by the ICRR user sub-committee. High-performing programs will be recognized on ICRR's website and ICCPR's social media accounts. This mechanism may be used in future to support program accreditation.</description>

    <ipd_description>The ICCR will explore potential public posting of anonymous registry data in a repository in future, to augment utility of the data through availability to the scientific community.&#xD;
Specific sites may also apply for ethics approval for administrative data linkage (e.g., clinical databases, imaging or lab data, government databases or surveys), which could enable cost-effectiveness analysis for example. Contributing sites may also apply for ethics approval to survey patients over and above registry assessments.&#xD;
Any secondary use of the data for research purposes will go through separate ethical review. Requests will be vetted by the ICRR research sub-committee. No data will be released that could identify patients. This may include sharing of aggregate data on common variables with other CR registries. This research may be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scholarly conferences.</ipd_description>
