  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ineffective hemostasis or a paradoxical prothrombotic state of Acute-on-chronic liver disease&#xD;
      (ACLF) has been well established. Thrombelastography measures the dynamics of thrombin&#xD;
      production and provides a global assessment of coagulation incorporating the cumulative&#xD;
      effect of the interactions at various levels between plasma components and cellular component&#xD;
      of coagulation. Through the previous studies(NCT03281278 and NCT04119973), we found that ACLF&#xD;
      patients with high ADP inhibition rate had high 28-day mortality.This study aims to validate&#xD;
      that high ADP inhibition rate only occurs in patients with liver failure and is related to&#xD;
      the severity of the disease.&#xD;
