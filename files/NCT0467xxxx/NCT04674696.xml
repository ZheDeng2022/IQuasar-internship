  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Short-course radiotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy has shown a better response&#xD;
      rate when compared to chemoradiotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, recent studies have shown better tolerance with total neoadjuvant treatment,&#xD;
      with induction or consolidation chemotherapy. Induction chemotherapy could reduce the size of&#xD;
      the tumor, treat micrometastases early and allow treatment to start immediately (avoiding&#xD;
      potential delays in waiting for radiotherapy). While consolidation chemotherapy allows longer&#xD;
      waiting times for surgery, with higher response rates.&#xD;

      Methods: This trial aim to evaluate induction treatment with CAPOX, followed by short-course&#xD;
      radiotherapy consolidation chemotherapy with CAPOX. After 5-7 weeks, patients will be&#xD;
      evaluate by MRI. Patients with incomplete clinical response will be referred to immediate&#xD;
      surgery and patients with complete clinical response will be managed with &quot;watch and wait&quot;&#xD;
      approach. Patients with progression disease during the treatment phase will be withdrawn from&#xD;
      the study and will receive their treatment according to the investigator's judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated according to Simon's optimal two-stage design. Accordingly, 21&#xD;
      patients must be included in each group during the first stage and 24 during the second&#xD;
      stage. Treatment regimen will be considered effective if 9 or more patients show good&#xD;
      response (final analysis), reaching 80% power with an alpha of 0.10 level of significance.&#xD;
