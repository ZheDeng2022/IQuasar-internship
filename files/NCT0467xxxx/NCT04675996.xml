  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2 part, multi-center, open-label, First-in-Human clinical study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of INT-1B3 in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigational medicinal product INT-1B3 is a lipid nanoparticle formulated microRNA&#xD;
      (miR-193a-3p) mimic destined for therapeutic intervention in oncology. Preclinical work&#xD;
      showed that INT-1B3 has a multi-target mechanism of action with an anti-proliferative,&#xD;
      anti-metastatic, anti-migration, cell cycle disruption, induction of apoptosis effect and&#xD;
      modulation on the tumor microenvironment leading to significant induction of T cell-mediated&#xD;
      immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the study (Phase I) is a dose-escalation phase to determine the maximal&#xD;
      tolerated dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose, as well as the safety profile of INT-1B3 in&#xD;
      patients with advanced malignancies.The subsequent expansion phase of the study (Phase Ib)&#xD;
      will further explore safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic responses, and antitumor&#xD;
      activity of INT-1B3 in patients with selected cancer types treated at the recommended phase 2&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
