    <textblock>
      This research study is exploring the effects of dietary intervention in PSC. Study&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to either the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) or a&#xD;
      vegan/low-sulfur diet for 8 weeks; the entire study will last approximately 14 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will work with BWH Registered Dieticians and receive dietary educational&#xD;
      materials, recipes, and a food procurement stipend to support the new diet. Subjects will&#xD;
      attend 7 video visits and have regular lab tests performed, requiring blood and stool&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The chronic, autoimmune liver disease Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) is a progressive&#xD;
      cholestatic, hepatobiliary disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the bile&#xD;
      duct. As the disease progresses, it may result in debilitating bile duct cirrhosis,&#xD;
      malignancy, and liver failure. Although the list of drugs studied for the treatment of PSC is&#xD;
      extensive, the main, and commonly only, treatment option remains liver transplantation.&#xD;
      Dietary manipulation is an approach of high interest to patients. Presumably, diet may have&#xD;
      some influence on the intestinal microbiome and have a modifying impact on the diseases but&#xD;
      this has not been well established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a study period of approximately 14 weeks to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      the SCD and vegan/low-sulfur diet on the intestinal microbiome and bile acid composition in&#xD;
      stool and serum. Patients will visit their study site or participate in a video visit 7 times&#xD;
      over the course of the study. At the screening visit (Week 0), eligibility will be assessed,&#xD;
      lab tests will be performed, and subjects will be randomized to dietary instruction on one of&#xD;
      the two diets with educational materials, recipes, and food procurement stipend provided.&#xD;
      Consent will be signed at or before the screening visit either in-person or remotely.&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to collect a stool sample and complete a Food Frequency Questionnaire&#xD;
      (FFQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment phase of 8 weeks will begin at the baseline visit (Week 2). At each of the four&#xD;
      time points during the treatment phase (Week 4, 6, 8, 10), participants will record in&#xD;
      real-time what they eat by a smartphone app for 3-days, one of which includes a weekend. To&#xD;
      enhance compliance to the intervention protocol, the dedicated study coordinator along with&#xD;
      the Registered Dietitian will review the food diary data in real-time and discuss any&#xD;
      challenges to comply with the meal intervention. After the 8-week treatment period is&#xD;
      complete, patients will be encouraged to continue with their diet, self-directed, for 4 weeks&#xD;
      following the end of the treatment phase (Week 10). Subjects will be asked to return for one&#xD;
      final visit at Week 14 to complete a 3-day food diary and have labs drawn.&#xD;

    <description>This is a specific diet that is both vegan and low in protein. The vegan diet eliminates all animal products, (including meats, eggs, dairy products) and animal by-products such as honey.</description>

    <description>The Specific Carbohydrate Diet emphasizes consumption of specific carbohydrates that require minimal digestion. Therefore, it eliminates most carbohydrates, including grains, starches, dairy and sugars.&#xD;
The idea behind this diet is that it reshapes the microbiome of the intestines. The diet restricts the intake of certain carbohydrates that may increase the growth of &quot;bad&quot; bacteria possibly contributing to inflammation. By restricting the amount of these carbohydrates in the microbiome, the diet aims to reduce their activity in the gut and reduce inflammation.</description>
