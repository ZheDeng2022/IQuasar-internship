  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Digital System&#xD;
      (DS) in improving asthma control compared to the Standard of Care (SoC) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to describe the asthma management actions by investigational&#xD;
      center health care providers (iHCPs) for all participants in both groups, to evaluate&#xD;
      short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) usage and the number of SABA-free days in the DS group, to&#xD;
      evaluate adherence patterns to maintenance treatment (FS eMDPI) in the DS group, to assess&#xD;
      behavioral correlates of responsiveness to digital health technology among patients for all&#xD;
      participants in both groups, to evaluate work productivity and activity impairment in asthma&#xD;
      patients in both groups, to assess the usability and acceptability of the DS by patients in&#xD;
      the DS group and the investigational center personnel, and to evaluate the safety of FS eMDPI&#xD;
      and Albuterol eMDPI.&#xD;

    <description>This is a composite endpoint for well-controlled asthma or clinically important improvement in asthma.&#xD;
Well-controlled asthma is defined as either an ACT score greater than or equal to 20 at the end of the 24-week treatment period. Clinically important improvement is defined as an increase of at least 3 units on the ACT score from baseline to the end of the 24-week treatment period.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has a documented diagnosis of asthma established at the&#xD;
             investigational center at the time of informed consent or the investigator confirms a&#xD;
             diagnosis of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is currently on treatment with a moderate- to high-dose inhaled&#xD;
             corticosteroid (ICS) with long-acting beta agonist (LABA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has an Asthma Control Test score of less than 19 at the screening or&#xD;
             baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is willing to discontinue all other maintenance ICS with LABA&#xD;
             medications and rescue medications and replace them with the study-provided&#xD;
             fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FS) multidose dry powder inhaler with integrated&#xD;
             electronic module (eMDPI) and Albuterol eMDPI, respectively, for the duration of the&#xD;
             trial, if randomized to the Digital System group. All other asthma maintenance&#xD;
             medications, except for ICS with LABA, may be continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Additional criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is currently being treated prior to enrollment with a digital inhaler&#xD;
             system, including the Digihaler system or an external &quot;bolt on&quot; digital system&#xD;
             designed to monitor inhaler usage, such as the Propeller Health or Adherium systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has any clinically significant uncontrolled medical condition (treated&#xD;
             or untreated) other than asthma, which in the view of the investigator would preclude&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant was hospitalized for severe asthma in the last 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, could jeopardize or would compromise the patient's ability to&#xD;
             participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
