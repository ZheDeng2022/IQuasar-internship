  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study aiming to investigate the ability of a novel Optical Coherence&#xD;
      Tomography (OCT) probe in assessing the different layers of the gastrointestinal tract and&#xD;
      the depth of invasion of early neoplasia, utilising surgically and endoscopically resected&#xD;
      specimens&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic treatment of early neoplasia in the gastrointestinal tract has been established as&#xD;
      the standard therapy in the past decade. Various endoscopic resection techniques have been&#xD;
      developed, such as endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection&#xD;
      (ESD), to ensure complete removal of such lesions and avoid recurrence. Successful endoscopic&#xD;
      resection of early gastrointestinal (GI) neoplasia relies on accurate pre-procedural&#xD;
      prediction of the margin and depth of invasion of the corresponding lesions. Generally, GI&#xD;
      neoplasia (even carcinoma) confined to the mucosa layer could be safely removed&#xD;
      endoscopically with margin negative resection and minimal chance of lymph node involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image-enhanced endoscopy or endoscopic ultrasonography has been used as the modality of&#xD;
      pre-resection assessment on the depth of invasion. Chromoendoscopy and digital enhancement&#xD;
      such as magnifying Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) focus on characterization of the surface&#xD;
      morphology and the vascular structures and predict the depth of invasion instead of direct&#xD;
      depth measurement. Endoscopic ultrasonography allows good visualization of the different&#xD;
      layers of GI tract, but the ability to differentiate early mucosal (T1a) or submucosal&#xD;
      invasive (T1b) cancer remains limited owing to its low resolution (&gt;100um). A small&#xD;
      proportion of patients subjected for endoscopic resection had invasive cancer not curable by&#xD;
      endoscopic means and require additional surgery afterwards. There is thus a potential role&#xD;
      for further refinement of imaging technique to allow better prediction of tumor depth in&#xD;
      early GI neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a novel high spatial-resolution, cross-sectional&#xD;
      imaging technique that allows visualization of biological tissue at higher resolution&#xD;
      (~10um). It has been used routinely in the field of ophthalmology for retinal assessment.&#xD;
      Earlier studies have also confirmed the potential application in the gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
      with a probe-based design to be placed within an endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering from the Chinese University of Hong&#xD;
      Kong have recently designed a novel OCT probe that could be placed within the working channel&#xD;
      of an endoscope. In-vitro experiment with porcine intestinal model demonstrated its ability&#xD;
      to provide high-resolution images with visualization of different layers of the GI tract. The&#xD;
      investigators therefore design this pilot study to assess the application of the OCT probe in&#xD;
      human resected tissue specimen to assess the ability in determining different layers of GI&#xD;
      tract and depth of invasion of GI tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current pilot study is designed aiming to assess the ability of the novel OCT probe in&#xD;
      visualization of the layers of the human GI tract and depth of invasion of GI neoplasia in&#xD;
      resected surgical and endoscopic specimens. There would be two parts of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To visualize normal gastrointestinal tract in a resected surgical specimen of&#xD;
           esophageal, stomach, small bowel and colonic tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the depth of invasion of the neoplastic tissue in surgical specimens as well&#xD;
           as endoscopic (ESD) specimens&#xD;
