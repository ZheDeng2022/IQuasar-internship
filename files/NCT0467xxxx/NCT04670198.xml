  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescence is a period of intense physiological, psychological and social change. It can be&#xD;
      a challenging period for young people with Type 1 diabetes and is associated with worsening&#xD;
      blood sugar control and care disengagement. The investigators have co-designed with young&#xD;
      people a psychologically modelled educational programme - Youth Empowerment Skills (YES),&#xD;
      which aims to facilitate a positive adaption to living with diabetes while improving&#xD;
      knowledge and self-management behaviours. Integrated programme components include social and&#xD;
      peer-based learning, immersive simulations, and an outreach youth worker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of the YES programme (acceptance,&#xD;
      implementability, recruitment and completion), and estimate its efficacy in relation to&#xD;
      metabolic and psychosocial outcomes. The investigators will recruit young people with Type 1&#xD;
      diabetes and conduct a feasibility randomised controlled trial (waiting-list design) with&#xD;
      integrated process evaluation. Sixty young people will be randomised to either YES&#xD;
      intervention or waiting-list control and evaluate outcomes at 6-months; at this point the&#xD;
      waiting list participants will be offered the YES intervention with further follow-up at 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has been designed as a feasibility study with an integrated process evaluation&#xD;
      following MRC guidance (Craig et al., 2008; Moore et al., 2015). The process evaluation data&#xD;
      collection has been modelled on the COM_B and the Behaviour Change Wheel framework (BCW)&#xD;
      frameworks (Michie et al., 2014; Barker et al., 2016) addressing: policy context;&#xD;
      intervention functions; target behaviours; and outcomes. As part of the process evaluation&#xD;
      the investigators will also use Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to&#xD;
      study how the programme can be optimally embedded within routine diabetes care, and to&#xD;
      optimise the design of a subsequent trial (Murray et al., 2010). The investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a feasibility randomised controlled trial (waiting-list design) with integrated&#xD;
      process evaluation designed following the Medical Research Council's (MRC) Complex&#xD;
      Intervention Evaluation Framework (Craig et al., 2008). Sixty young people will be randomised&#xD;
      to either YES intervention or waiting-list control and evaluate outcomes at 6-months; at this&#xD;
      point the waiting list participants will be offered the YES intervention with further&#xD;
      follow-up at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of patients achieving the progression criteria and the target reduction in&#xD;
      glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to follow-up (6 and 12 months) will be estimated&#xD;
      in both intervention and waiting list control groups. The investigators will also estimate&#xD;
      the standard deviation (SD) of the mean difference between the intervention and waiting list&#xD;
      control groups in HbA1c at 6 and 12 months. These statistics will help to inform the sample&#xD;
      size calculation of a larger trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process evaluation will consider the setting, implementation, and mechanisms of action of&#xD;
      the programme to support interpretation of the outcomes. The process evaluation uses a&#xD;
      standardised taxonomy for understanding implementation (Julious, 2005; Proctor et al., 2011),&#xD;
      and will assess: the reach, fidelity and receipt of the programme; acceptability,&#xD;
      appropriateness and feasibility; unintended consequences; potential sustainability; and&#xD;
      implementation costs and strategies. In addition, potential mechanisms of action will be&#xD;
      elicited, including changes in behaviours, and how they relate to programme delivery and&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a mixed-method approach with validated implementation outcome&#xD;
      surveys (Powell et al., 2015) and one-to-one interviews with young people, their relatives&#xD;
      and healthcare professionals. The data collection tools and analytic models have been&#xD;
      designed with reference to the BCW (Michie et al., 2014) and to provide the data for CFIR&#xD;
      analysis, considering the barriers and facilitators to the intervention. To ensure relevance&#xD;
      and feasibility, the data collection procedures will be refined with the study patient and&#xD;
      public involvement groups. Data collection will be conducted at multiple time points to&#xD;
      provide opportunities for data triangulation and subsequent theory generation.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study has been designed as a waiting-list randomised controlled trial (RCT). Young people will be randomised to either the phase 1 YES group or the waiting-list control group. The phase 1 YES group will then attend the programme, both groups will be followed-up initially for 6 months, at which point the waiting-list control participants will attend the YES programme in phase 2. Both groups will then be followed-up for a further 6 months.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Youth Empowerment Skills (YES) programme is a novel psychoeducational intervention with simulation-based experiential learning tailored to the needs of young people. It is based on a social-cognitive learning model, and comprises attendance at 3 all-day YES sessions in non-healthcare settings (groups of 10); and then post-programme networking through social media and follow-up events facilitated by the youth worker. Sessions are led by a peer-educator and a health professional</description>
