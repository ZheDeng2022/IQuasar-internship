    <textblock>
      Acute cardiac syndromes (ACS) can often result in debilitating and persistent psychological&#xD;
      symptoms. A key question involves whether optimal treatment of ACS-induced posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder (PTSD) reduces PTSD symptoms and thereby may offset the risk of recurrent or&#xD;
      worsening cardiovascular disease. ACS-induced PTSD 1) is prevalent, 2) features symptoms&#xD;
      unique to internal ongoing somatic threat, with fears and worries that can be distinguished&#xD;
      from PTSD resulting from external causes, 3) is persistent, 4) is associated with negative&#xD;
      physical and emotional consequences, and 5) has not been the subject of randomized-controlled&#xD;
      treatment trials (RCT). There is preliminary evidence suggesting that patients with&#xD;
      cardiac-disease induced PTSD might particularly profit from EMDR. Nevertheless, this&#xD;
      possibility has not been tested in ACS-induced PTSD. Currently, patients with ACS-induced&#xD;
      PTSD are not routinely offered trauma-focused therapies, with a lack of scientific evidence&#xD;
      likely being one major reason for this omission. If our proposed RCT shows that EMDR can be&#xD;
      an effective treatment for patients with ACS-induced PTSD, EMDR could be routinely&#xD;
      implemented as first-line treatment. The RCT outcomes might inform larger trials to test&#xD;
      whether poor prognosis in terms of major adverse cardiovascular events can be improved&#xD;
      through EMDR in patients with ACS-induced PTSD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of research on the efficacy of psychotherapy and especially EMDR in&#xD;
      ACS-induced PTSD. In the light of ACS-induced PTSD having different symptoms than traditional&#xD;
      PTSD, this lack of research is highly problematic. Specifically, the unique symptom profile&#xD;
      in ACS-induced PTSD related to the enduring somatic threat model was not addressed in any of&#xD;
      the studies targeting PTSD in cardiac patients. In this regard, EMDR might be most promising:&#xD;
      The EMDR protocol includes the assessment of body sensations associated with the target&#xD;
      event, which is followed by reprocessing. The bilateral eye movements during reprocessing&#xD;
      seem to have de-arousing effects and may thereby interrupt the positive feedback loop between&#xD;
      cardiovascular sensations and anxiety-induced arousal as explained by the enduring somatic&#xD;
      threat model. Hence, EMDR might be more suitable in cardiac PTSD patients compared to&#xD;
      treatment protocols that motivates patients to keep focusing on the traumatic event such as&#xD;
      Prolonged Exposure, where higher emotional involvement seems to be related to a better&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the here proposed study aims at testing EMDR therapy in ACS-induced PTSD in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.The here proposed study aims at testing EMDR therapy in&#xD;
      ACS-induced PTSD in a randomized controlled trial. More specifically, the efficacy of the&#xD;
      standardized trauma-focused procedure in terms of a reduced PTSD symptom level will be tested&#xD;
      against a passive waitlist control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group consists of 30 patients diagnosed with PTSD induced by ACS. Eight&#xD;
      individual EMDR sessions lasting for 1 hours will be provided over 8 weeks by licensed EMDR&#xD;
      therapists from the German-speaking part of Switzerland. Each EMDR session follows a&#xD;
      standardized 8-phase protocol. As Shapiro posits that it is necessary to adapt the standard&#xD;
      procedures to the unique needs and characteristics of the patient and to apply different EMDR&#xD;
      protocols for different pathologies, the therapy for ACS patients was adapted from the&#xD;
      standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waiting control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group consists of 30 patients diagnosed with PTSD induced by ACS. No&#xD;
      intervention or any other procedure will be conducted during the study period of 36 weeks.&#xD;
      Afterwards these subjects will be offered an EMDR therapy as provided in the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to study inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge, survivors of an acute cardiac event will be informed about the study by a&#xD;
      letter. The Screening will be conducted by phone and/or e-mail. Eligible participants will be&#xD;
      screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Screening for a probable PTSD diagnosis will&#xD;
      be conducted using Part III of the PCL-5 for DSM-5. Subjects who meet a total sum score of 28&#xD;
      or more, will be invited for Baseline a.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline a: Definitive inclusion, baseline measurements, randomization Assessment 1 consists&#xD;
      of two appointments taking place at the University Hospital Zurich. During the first&#xD;
      appointment, the CAPS-5 and the M.I.N.I will be administered in order to ascertain a PTSD and&#xD;
      other psychiatric diagnoses. By means of the CAPS-5, it will be determined whether the&#xD;
      participants have PTSD (inclusion criterion and baseline assessment of primary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the assessment of the traumatic event during the interview can cause distress (although&#xD;
      only minimal and transient), which affects biomarkers, the assessment of cardiovascular&#xD;
      biomarkers and stress sensitization by means of the loud-tone procedure will be carried out&#xD;
      at a separate appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second appointment (Baseline b) will be scheduled within 7 days after the first&#xD;
      appointment to assess the baseline of all secondary endpoints: 1) saliva and blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected to obtain, stress hormones, and cardiovascular biomarkers, including blood&#xD;
      pressure; 2) the loud-tone procedure will be administered; 3) patient's medication will be&#xD;
      documented. Moreover, the following information will be obtained from the potential&#xD;
      participants or from hospital charts: Demographic factors, established cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors and life style behavior, objective indices of myocardial damage and severity,&#xD;
      variables related to patient referral to the coronary care unit, recurrent cardiac symptoms,&#xD;
      recurrent hospitalizations, cardiac rehabilitation, doctor visits, pharmacological treatment,&#xD;
      adherence to medication, medical comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychometric data will be collected by means of questionnaires. These questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed during the second appointment or from home via eCRF (Red Cap).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into either the intervention group (EMDR treatment) or the&#xD;
      wait-list control group. Assessors who ascertain the primary outcome variable, i.e. CAPS&#xD;
      scores, will be blind to the subject's treatment condition. Randomization will be conducted&#xD;
      by a person outside of the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, the intervention (EMDR therapy) will be carried.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Treatment and 6-months Follow-up (a/b):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention (week 12), procedures of assessment 2 related to primary and secondary&#xD;
      endpoints (i.e., CAPS, psychophysiological reactivity, psychometry, blood and saliva&#xD;
      sampling) will be repeated. In order to test whether the effects of EMDR-treatment are&#xD;
      long-lasting, measurements will be repeated at 6-months follow-up. Assessors who ascertain&#xD;
      the primary outcome variable, i.e. CAPS scores, will be blind to the subject's treatment&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
