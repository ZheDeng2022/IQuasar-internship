  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of Melodic Based Communication Therapy&#xD;
      (M.B.C.T.) for increasing oral expressive skills in nonverbal children with autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorders. MBCT has previously been shown to facilitate an improvement in expressive&#xD;
      vocabulary, verbal imitative abilities, number of vocalizations, and social language&#xD;
      development in nonverbal children with autism ages 5-7. However, earlier studies were small&#xD;
      and did not examine the effects of M.B.C.T. on a younger and older population. This study&#xD;
      will examine its effectiveness across a broader sample group. Additionally, this study will&#xD;
      examine further predictors of success including but not limited to chronological age,&#xD;
      developmental age, the frequency of repetitive/stereotypic behaviors, receptive language&#xD;
      score, and social language score.&#xD;

      The study will be a repeated measures design as assessments will be taken at baseline and on&#xD;
      a weekly basis (baseline, weeks 1-4). All participants in the study will receive Melodic&#xD;
      Based Communication Therapy (M.B.C.T.). General procedures involved in (M.B.C.T.) are as&#xD;
      follows: 25 common first words are selected as the targets (e.g., apple, ball, car, dog, cat,&#xD;
      eat, go, etc.). Pictures and objects will be used as stimulus items. The top 3-5 incentives&#xD;
      as identified by parent survey will be given according to the therapies specific&#xD;
      reinforcement schedule. All treatment and evaluation sessions will be videotaped for&#xD;
      future/further analysis and verification purposes. For the purposes of the study design, the&#xD;
      same 25 words will be used for all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Subjects will be male and female children diagnosed with autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Subjects will be between 3 years 0 months and 10 years 11 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. In total, subject participation will last approximately 4 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Frequency of repetitive or stereotypic movements will be analyzed in the first week of treatment (stimming behavior). This will be evaluated as follows: onset/offset and duration of the behaviors to determine frequency. This will be evaluated by an independent observer through video analysis.</description>

For the purposes of the study design, the same 25 words will be used for all participants.&#xD;
Participants will first listen to the target word set to a melodic tone and rhythm on a compact disc (CD). Clinicians will present the stimulus item (e.g., apple) prior to beginning the steps. Therapy will then progress from clapping and singing the melody to answering sung questions and finally to answering spoken questions with the target word</description>
