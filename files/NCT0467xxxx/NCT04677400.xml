  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The link between sport, physical exercise, and body image depends on the reasons underlying&#xD;
      an individual's desire to engage in sport and physical exercise. Individuals characterized by&#xD;
      reasons for exercise related to physical appearance are likely to focus on factors such as&#xD;
      the number of calories burned, reductions in body weight, or visible changes in physical&#xD;
      appearance during the practice; in accordance, appearance-related reasons for exercise are&#xD;
      associated with body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. In contrast, reasons to exercise&#xD;
      unrelated to physical appearance (such as health and enjoyment) are associated with body&#xD;
      satisfaction. Thus, only certain reasons for exercise are associated with positive body image&#xD;
      outcomes. Recently, literature studies affirmed that experimental designs could manipulate&#xD;
      the emphasis placed on function (as opposed to physical appearance) during sport practice and&#xD;
      physical exercise to promote positive body image. Based on this evidence, the first objective&#xD;
      of the study will be testing the effectiveness of a psychological online intervention (More&#xD;
      than Body Appearance [MBA] intervention) targeting body image in improving body image in&#xD;
      individuals practicing physical activity.&#xD;
