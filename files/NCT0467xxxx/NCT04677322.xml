  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arterial hypertension is an independent vascular risk factor and a frequent reason for&#xD;
      consultation in Primary Care. It generates high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      (stroke, heart disease, kidney failure and other diseases). Moreover, given that it is a&#xD;
      modifiable factor and that there are intervention and control measures that would lead to a&#xD;
      significant reduction in cardiovascular incidence and morbimortality, it can be stated that&#xD;
      ETS is a major public health problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approach to this risk factor can be pharmacological and non-pharmacological. The&#xD;
      non-pharmacological approach is based on lifestyle modification. Among the measures aimed at&#xD;
      modifying lifestyles is the restriction of daily intake of sodium in the diet. Such&#xD;
      restriction enhances the hypotensive effect of pharmacological treatment so that its&#xD;
      application and intensification would delay the start of pharmacological therapy, as well as&#xD;
      avoid the need to increase the dose of antihypertensive drugs or the number of drugs to be&#xD;
      used for the control of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In relation to salt intake in the Spanish population, the average is above the figures of&#xD;
      less than 5 grams per day recommended by the WHO. Sodium intake can be estimated by&#xD;
      determining the 24-hour urine sodium concentration. In addition, there is a positive&#xD;
      correlation between systolic and diastolic blood pressure figures and the excretion of sodium&#xD;
      in urine.&#xD;

      In the present work, with a prospective cohort observational study design, it intends to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness of the use of an educational program based on the follow up of a&#xD;
      hyposodium diet and assessed through the routine use of urine sodium monitoring of the&#xD;
      hypertensive patient in the primary care setting, in order to optimize treatment, as well as&#xD;
      to review the clinical control in this group of patients. On the other hand, it is intended&#xD;
      to establish guidelines in the form of practical guidelines to provide with a standardized&#xD;
      clinical approach for primary care centers.&#xD;
