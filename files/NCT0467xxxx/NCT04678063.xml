  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, cross-over study designed to determine the concentration&#xD;
      of airborne cat allergen inducing bronchial response in asthmatic subjects allergic to cat,&#xD;
      during allergen exposures in the Alyatec environmental exposure chamber (EEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was also designed to validate the specificity of the asthmatic reaction induced by&#xD;
      exposure to airborne cat allergen in Alyatec EEC.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the concentration of cat allergen (in ng/m3 of Der p1) necessary to induce a bronchial response in at least 60% of asthmatic subjects allergic to cat.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 hours: 4 hours of exposure in EEC then 6 hours post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>The bronchial response is evaluated by measuring FEV1 value.&#xD;
Early asthmatic response (EAR) occurs when a 20 percent drop in FEV1 is detected during the exposure compared to the pre-exposure FEV1.&#xD;
Late bronchial response (LAR) occurs when a 15 percent drop in FEV1 or 20 percent drop in peak flow is detected 1 to 6h after the EAR.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the safety of allergenic exposure in EEC</measure>
    <time_frame>28 hours: 4 hours of exposure in EEC then 24 hours post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Safety is assessed with an asthma symptom self-report questionnaire performed during the 4h exposure and for 24h after the end of the exposure.&#xD;
The score was obtained from the sum of all four individual symptom scores (chest tightness, cough, wheezing and dyspnea) with a total possible score ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 16 (maximum symptom intensity).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the allergen concentration in the EEC</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours exposure in EEC</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of allergen concentration is performed with several sensors positioned in the chamber.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the specificity of the bronchial response</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours exposure in EEC</time_frame>
    <description>The specificity of the bronchial response is assessed with the exposure to cat allergen in the EEC of asthmatic allergic subjects non sensitized to cat.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the effect of the exposure on rhinitis symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>28 hours: 4 hours of exposure in EEC then 24 hours post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of the exposure on the rhinitis response is assessed with Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS).&#xD;
The TNSS was obtained from the sum of all four individual symptom scores, with a total possible score ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 12 (maximum symptom intensity).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the effect of the exposure on conjunctivitis symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>28 hours: 4 hours of exposure in EEC then 24 hours post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of the exposure on the conjunctivitis response is assessed with Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS).&#xD;
The TOSS was obtained from the sum of all four individual symptom scores, with a total possible score ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 12 (maximum symptom intensity).</description>
