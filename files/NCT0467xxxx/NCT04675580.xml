  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this intervention is to increase caregivers' use of interactive play and&#xD;
      communication strategies to improve the child's early sentence development using telemedicine&#xD;
      and video-based feedback.&#xD;

      Record was updated 11/2/2021 to include more detailed information about outcome measure time&#xD;
      points. Specifically, secondary outcome measures will be collected more frequently over the&#xD;
      course of the study (i.e., at baseline [before starting intervention], immediate follow-up&#xD;
      [week 12], and long-term follow-up [3 months after intervention] assessments). No changes&#xD;
      were made to outcome measures or how they are operationalized.&#xD;

    <description>Child's scores on the Brief Observation of Social Communication Change (BOSCC) at baseline, intervention midpoint, and post-evaluation. BOSCC scores are not linear. Each item is rated on a 6-point scale from 0 (abnormality is not present) to 5 (abnormality is present and significantly impairs functioning).</description>

    <measure>Change in scores on the Observation of Spontaneous Expressive Language (OSEL) - baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (before starting intervention); Week 12; Follow-up assessment (3 months after end of intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Child's scores on the Observation of Spontaneous Expressive Language at baseline, post-evaluation, and long-term follow-up evaluation (3 months after ending intervention). Scores on the OSEL are not linear. Scores range from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating more impairment.</description>
