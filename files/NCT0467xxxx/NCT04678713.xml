  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fat and carbohydrate are the two main energy stores available as fuel during exercise. It is&#xD;
      well known that the exercise intensity and feeding status are the major factors determining&#xD;
      the type of fuel used during exercise. During prolonged exercise at low to moderate exercise&#xD;
      fat is the primary fuel being used and to improve performance studies has tried to understand&#xD;
      strategies to maximize muscle glycogen storage and elevate fat oxidation during exercise.&#xD;
      With this strategy they aim for preserving the limited muscle glycogen stores and thus&#xD;
      improving endurance performance. In relation to this the maximal fat oxidation (MFO: The&#xD;
      highest rate of fat oxidation across all exercise intensities) has been studied as increasing&#xD;
      the fat oxidation could decrease the depletion of the glycogen stores. Further it has&#xD;
      recently been shown that MFO is related to performance in endurance trained. However the MFO&#xD;
      has been found to vary markedly between trained individuals matched on their activity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been suggested that the diet and subsequent substrate availability during exercise&#xD;
      contributes independently to the variation in MFO. However, the measurements have never been&#xD;
      evaluated in a trained group with similar aerobic capacity and training status. Therefore,&#xD;
      the aim of the study is to investigate the effect of a short term fat rich or carbohydrate&#xD;
      rich diet on MFO in well trained men with a high vs. a low MFO. The hypothesis is that 3 days&#xD;
      of a fat-rich diet will increase MFO while 3 days of a Carbohydrate rich diet will decrease&#xD;
      MFO in both individuals with a high MFO (HiMFO) and a low MFO (LoMFO). Furthermore, it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that HiMFO will have a significantly higher MFO after both diets compared to&#xD;
      LoMFO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle and physiological factors have been investigated to determine the variation of the&#xD;
      MFO capacity. However, these factors can only explain 50% of the interindividual variability&#xD;
      in MFO. Despite the critical role of fat oxidation during exercise, few studies have explored&#xD;
      the differences in skeletal muscle characteristics between HiMFO and LoMFO. The second aim of&#xD;
      the study is thereby to investigate if muscle characteristics can explain the variability in&#xD;
      MFO within well-trained males. The hypothesis is that HiMFO will have more favorable muscle&#xD;
      characteristics for fat oxidation compared to LoMFO including a higher oxidative capacity,&#xD;
      intramuscular triacylglycerol concentration and a higher expression of key enzymes in lipid&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A group of young, healthy and moderate to well-trained males will be recruited for the study.&#xD;
      The participants will be separated into 2 groups by stratified randomization consuming either&#xD;
      a 3 day Fat rich diet (HiFAT) or a carbohydrate rich diet (HiCHO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When all participants have completed the study, the results will be analysed by separating&#xD;
      the two groups into two subgroups based on the median of the MFO&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes 4 visits to out laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the participants have read, accepted and signed the plain language statement they will&#xD;
      be invited for a screening session in our laboratory which is the first visit. If the&#xD;
      participant meet the inclusion and not the exclusion criteria, they will be included in the&#xD;
      study and a time schedule for the next three visits will be planned. In the end of the&#xD;
      screening the participant will be instructed to full fill a 4-day diet dairy to analyse the&#xD;
      participants habitual diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the second visit the participant will meet in the laboratory after an overnight fast and&#xD;
      has been asked to avoid alcohol and strenuous exercise 48 hours prior to the test day. The&#xD;
      second test starts with a visit to the toilet before a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)&#xD;
      scan and a bioelectrical impedance scan (BIA) is performed to measure the body composition of&#xD;
      the participant. After 5 min. of rest, the blood pressure is measured followed by a&#xD;
      measurement of the hip and waist circumference. After measuring the blood pressure and body&#xD;
      composition the participant will perform a incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer.&#xD;
      The expired air is measured by indirect calorimetry and is used to calculate the maximal fat&#xD;
      oxidation and maximal aerobic capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the second visit, the participant will arrive to laboratory in the morning after an&#xD;
      overnight fast having been asked to avoid alcohol and strenuous exercise 48 hours prior to&#xD;
      the test day. At the third visit a resting blood samples, fat and muscle biopsies are&#xD;
      collected. After 30 min. of rest the same incremental exercise test will be performed as at&#xD;
      visit 2 to measure the maximal fat oxidation and maximal aerobic capacity. The test is&#xD;
      performed twice to minimize the variation and to ensure the circumstances with the biopsies&#xD;
      are identical before and after the diet intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the third visit, the participant will receive a high fat or isoenergetic high&#xD;
      carbohydrate diet to follow for the next three days. The participant will further receive an&#xD;
      activity watch to track his activity level during the diet intervention and he will be&#xD;
      instructed to exercise for one hour at 65 % of his maximal heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth and last visit to the laboratory is the day after finishing the three days diet&#xD;
      intervention. The participant arrive to laboratory in the morning after an overnight fast&#xD;
      having been asked to avoid alcohol and strenuous exercise 48 hours prior to the test day. The&#xD;
      test day initiates with a visit to the toilet to empty the bladder and a DXA and BIA are&#xD;
      performed followed by a measurement of the blood pressure and the hip and waist&#xD;
      circumference. The participant is led to the laboratory where he has to rest for 5-10 min.&#xD;
      before collecting a resting blood sample and a fat and muscle biopsy. The participant has to&#xD;
      rest for further 30 min. before performing the incremental exercise test to measure the&#xD;
      maximal fat oxidation and maximal aerobic capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples: The blood samples will be collected from the vein cubiti medialis in the&#xD;
      forearm. The blood samples will be analyzed using a standard lab biochemical assays to assess&#xD;
      metabolic risk factors and plasma metabolites and hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fat biopsy: The fat biopsies will be collected from the abdominal subcutane adipose tissue&#xD;
      3-5 cm. lateral from the navel. The samples will be collected by the Bergstrom biopsy&#xD;
      technique using a Bergstrom biopsy needle. The fat biopsy will be analysed using microscopy&#xD;
      and High Resolution Mitochondria Respirometry to assess the mitochondria capacity, the&#xD;
      inflammation of the macrophage and the size of the adipose cells. Furthermore, the expression&#xD;
      of proteins and enzymes important for the glucose and fat metabolism will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle biopsy: The muscle biopsies will be collected from musculus vastus lateralis by the&#xD;
      doctor of our department using the Bergstrom biopsy technique. The muscle biopsy will be&#xD;
      analysed by immunofluorescence microscopy and the Western blot technique to assess muscle&#xD;
      characteristics (e.g muscle fibre type, capillary density and fibre type specific IMTG&#xD;
      content) and the expression of key proteins involved in FFA uptake, intramuscular lipolysis&#xD;
      and fat oxidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected outcomes This study will help us to understand the underlying muscular mechanism&#xD;
      explaining why substrate use is different amongst a group of similar well-trained athletes.&#xD;
      The study will further illuminate if individuals with a high maximal fat oxidation react&#xD;
      differently to a high fat or carbohydrate diet compared to individuals with a low maximal fat&#xD;
      oxidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This information will be highly relevant for coaches, federations, nutritionists and&#xD;
      endurance trained athletes looking to optimize nutritional and training methods to enhance&#xD;
      metabolic responses and ultimately improve exercise performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Pearsons correlation analyse was performed including all relevant physiological variables&#xD;
      regarding the primary outcome, Maximal fat oxidation to analyse the physiological differences&#xD;
      between the group with a high MFO and low MFO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore a two way ANOVA with repeated measurements will be performed to analyse any&#xD;
      effect of the diet on MFO and to analyse if there is any differences on the effect of diet&#xD;
      between individuals with a high compared to low MFO. Any significant effects from the ANOVA&#xD;
      test will be analysed with a post hoc test to evaluate the interaction between HiMFO and&#xD;
      LoMFO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significant level is p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project was approved by the Science Ethical commitee of the greater region of Copenhagen&#xD;
      (H-20019103) the 3rd of July 2020. The protocol of the study adhered to the principles of the&#xD;
      Helsinki declaration.&#xD;
