  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and death worldwide. Falling is defined as&#xD;
      a person accidentally lying on a floor or another low level with or without injury. In&#xD;
      patients with stroke occur motor, sensory, functional and cognitive disorders which are&#xD;
      increased the rate of falls after stroke. Physiological and psychological complications that&#xD;
      occur as a result of a fall are exhausting for both the patient and the therapist. Because&#xD;
      while the patients regress physiologically even more, the 'fear of falling again', which&#xD;
      occurs with falling, reduces the patient's participation in rehabilitation.When looking at&#xD;
      the risk factors determined for falls in stroke patients, reduced mobility and impaired&#xD;
      balance functions are in the first place and that is evidenced with most of falls occur&#xD;
      during walking and transfers the most frequent.The main reason of affected mobility is the&#xD;
      weakness in the deep trunk muscles and insufficient stability, except for the loss of&#xD;
      strength in the affected lower extremity. In the literature, it is stated that having strong&#xD;
      core muscles can contribute to the efficient use of the lower extremity. According to the&#xD;
      previous studies, applied stabilization exercises in addition to traditional rehabilitation&#xD;
      improve the balance and mobility functions of patients with subacute stroke. However, there&#xD;
      is not enough information about the benefits of these exercises in patients with chronic&#xD;
      stroke. Most falls occur at home specially in the bedroom and bathroom in patients with&#xD;
      stroke. This indicates that environmental factors should be taken into consideration in the&#xD;
      rehabilitation program besides physical factors, that is, a &quot;multifactorial falls prevention&#xD;
      program&quot; should be implemented. Based on these information, the aim of our study is to&#xD;
      investigate the benefits of core stabilization exercises which is included in a&#xD;
      multifactorial training on falling number, fear of falling, lower extremity function and&#xD;
      balance in patients with chronic stroke who have a history of falling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The volunteers to be included in our study will be selected from chronic stroke patients who&#xD;
      are receiving physical therapy at Bursa İlker Çelikcan Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Hospital and have a history of falling. The study will consist of two separate groups,&#xD;
      intervention and control. Patients who suitable the inclusion criteria will be randomized&#xD;
      according to the order of initiation of the physical therapy program in the hospital and&#xD;
      divided into groups. Both groups will participate in a traditional physiotherapy program&#xD;
      specific to the individual and will also receive verbal and written information on fall&#xD;
      prevention.In the traditional physiotherapy program, there are physical therapy and&#xD;
      rehabilitation practices that are routinely applied in stroke rehabilitation and that&#xD;
      patients will receive at the specified hospital. In the content of these applications;&#xD;
      patient-specific upper and lower extremity stretching, relaxation and strengthening&#xD;
      exercises; application of functional electrical stimulation (FES) to upper and lower&#xD;
      extremity muscles; balance, coordination and gait training are included.In addition to these,&#xD;
      patients in the intervention group will perform core stabilization exercises under the&#xD;
      supervision of a physiotherapist. The exercises will be applied 5 times a week for 6 weeks.&#xD;
      First of all, activation of the &quot;transversus abdominis&quot; muscle, which forms the basis of core&#xD;
      stabilization, will be taught to patients. &quot;Chattanooga Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback&#xD;
      Device&quot; will be used in order to teach this activation and to observe whether the patient is&#xD;
      doing it correctly during exercises. The exercises will be made more difficult by adding&#xD;
      extremity movements to this activation. Evaluations will be made twice, at the beginning (0.&#xD;
      week) and end of the treatment (13. week).In order to evaluate the effect of the treatment on&#xD;
      the fall, the number of falls that occurred within 3 months after the end of the treatment&#xD;
      will be questioned by phone.&#xD;

    <description>In our study, core stabilization exercises to be applied in the intervention group are arranged according to the patients with stroke and will be at three different difficulty levels. Exercises will be done on the back (hooked) and sitting positions where the risk of falling is low. First of all, activation of the &quot;transversus abdominis&quot; muscle, which is the basis of core stabilization, will be taught to patients. With this activation at the first level, the healthy side, at the second level the affected side, and at the third level, reciprocal upper and lower extremity movements will be requested. In addition to these, there will be exercises to bridge and curl up in supine position, and weight transfer in sitting position. In order to increase the difficulty level of the exercises, first of all, the number of exercises will be increased and then it will be asked to move on to the next level.</description>
