  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults (â‰¥ 55 years) who do not eat enough nutritious food are at risk of malnutrition.&#xD;
      Malnutrition can lead to frailty, hospitalization, poor quality of life, and death. SCREEN&#xD;
      (Seniors in the Community Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition) is the leading nutrition&#xD;
      risk screening tool for cognitively well older adults living in the community. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to determine if SCREEN can be used to find nutrition risk among older adults&#xD;
      diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or dementia (i.e., MCI-D) living in the community&#xD;
      and persons living in retirement homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREEN and other nutrition and health measures will be completed in 600 older adults (300&#xD;
      living in retirement homes with or without MCI-D, and 300 living with MCI-D in the&#xD;
      community). SCREEN will be completed twice to determine reliability, and persons with MCI-D&#xD;
      will have their results compared to those of a caregiver who completes it on their behalf. A&#xD;
      dietitian's assessment and rating of nutrition risk will be used as the gold-standard to&#xD;
      determine validity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About a third of cognitively well, community-living older Canadians are at nutrition risk,&#xD;
      which has been shown to lead to hospitalizations, poor quality of life, and death. Since&#xD;
      SCREEN was created 20 years ago, there has been considerable growth in the number of&#xD;
      community-living older adults diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or dementia (i.e.,&#xD;
      MCI-D) and/or living in retirement homes. These two groups are nutritionally vulnerable.&#xD;
      Nutrition risk is specifically associated with the progression of cognitive impairment and&#xD;
      frailty, as well as caregiver burden. Yet, these groups are under-served with respect to&#xD;
      nutrition care; dietitian services are not available in retirement homes and limited in many&#xD;
      primary or memory care clinics. Nutrition screening and subsequent management of identified&#xD;
      nutrition problems by accessing diverse community services (e.g., meal programs) in Canadian&#xD;
      older adults is recommended because it can promote independence and delay frailty. However,&#xD;
      preventative management for those with MCI-D or living in retirement homes is limited by lack&#xD;
      of systematic nutrition screening with a valid and reliable tool that is feasible for these&#xD;
      vulnerable seniors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREEN is the leading nutrition risk tool for community-living seniors and is the logical&#xD;
      choice for use in those with MCI-D and/or living in retirement residences. However, it has&#xD;
      not been validated in these groups. It cannot be assumed that the existing validation in&#xD;
      cognitively well older adults living in their own homes can translate to these two vulnerable&#xD;
      groups. As well, one question on grocery shopping needs to be changed to accommodate persons&#xD;
      living in retirement homes. This study is also timely with the recent update of Canada's Food&#xD;
      Guide and recommendations to increase protein intake to mitigate frailty. Two questions on&#xD;
      SCREEN need to be modified to adapt the new language on protein foods used in the new Food&#xD;
      Guide. This study will undertake the validation and reliability testing of SCREEN,&#xD;
      considering these minor revisions, in 600 older adults (community-dwelling older adults with&#xD;
      MCI-D and those living in retirement homes with or without MCI-D). Validation of SCREEN for&#xD;
      these populations will ensure that a single tool can be used in all older adults living in&#xD;
      community and retirement settings. Specifically, understanding at what point a person with&#xD;
      MCI-D is no longer a reliable informant for completing SCREEN will help with identification&#xD;
      when a caregiver should complete the questionnaire. This is why the Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
      Assessment is used, as it provides discrete scores differentiating mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      from dementia. The results of this study will have significant impact on practice by&#xD;
      allowing, for the first time, confidence in the identification of nutrition risk in these&#xD;
      under-served groups in Canada. There is an urgent need for this research. Early&#xD;
      identification of nutrition risk and its subsequent management has the potential to advance&#xD;
      our health care system by promoting the prevention of frailty and its consequences. This&#xD;
      study will have a meaningful impact in the 'real world' setting of primary and community care&#xD;
      for older adults in Canada and worldwide, by providing a feasible, validated and useful&#xD;
      nutrition risk tool.&#xD;
