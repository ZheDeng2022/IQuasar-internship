  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is the most common histology of non-Hodgkin's malignant&#xD;
      lymphomas (31% of lymphomas), with an incidence of between 15 and 20 new cases per year per&#xD;
      100,000 inhabitants in France. The median age is 65 and a third of patients are over 75 years&#xD;
      old. 60% of patients are cured after a standard regimen of chemotherapy with RCHOP; 40% of&#xD;
      patients will, however, relapse. No other regimen has shown improvement in overall survival,&#xD;
      but poor prognosis factors have been identified. Beyond these factors, other prognostic&#xD;
      factors can impact overall and progression-free survival: sarcopenia, nutritional status&#xD;
      disorders Sarcopenia is defined by the reduction of muscle mass and strength. It was first&#xD;
      described in the elderly and classified as geriatric syndrome such as dementia, falls or&#xD;
      frailty. It varies from 5 to 13% between 60 and 70 years and between 11 and 50% beyond 80&#xD;
      years and is classified as primitive, that is to say related to age It can however be&#xD;
      secondary to neoplasia. This event has been described in patients with hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies during chemotherapy and can reach 55% of patients in the elderly. It is&#xD;
      proportional to the intensity of the treatments. It emerges as an independent prognostic&#xD;
      factor which is detrimental to survival in these patients. Physical exercise combined with&#xD;
      nutritional support could reduce it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The positive impact of adapted physical activity has been shown in numerous publications on&#xD;
      reducing the incidence and risk of relapse for certain cancers (breast, colon prostate). It&#xD;
      is less obvious in hematology in view of studies published on adapted physical activity .&#xD;
      Adapted physical activity seems to provide a survival benefit in diffuse large cell B&#xD;
      lymphoma however the number remains too low in this histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia is an often-underestimated event and is associated with older age, co-morbidities,&#xD;
      increased infectious complications, and early mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correcting sarcopenia through appropriate physical activity could reduce its negative&#xD;
      prognostic impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to increase the event-free survival of patients in the RCHOP and&#xD;
      adapted physical activity arm by 15% compared to the standard arm.&#xD;
