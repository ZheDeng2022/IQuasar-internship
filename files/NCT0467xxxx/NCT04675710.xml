    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of pembrolizumab, dabrafenib, and trametinib before&#xD;
      surgery in treating patients with BRAF V600E-mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer. BRAF V600E is&#xD;
      a specific mutation (change) in the BRAF gene, which makes a protein that is involved in&#xD;
      sending signals in cells and in cell growth. It may increase the growth and spread of tumor&#xD;
      cells. Dabrafenib and trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Pembrolizumab, dabrafenib, and trametinib may&#xD;
      help to control BRAF V600E-mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer when given before surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Demonstrate the efficacy of upfront treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      combination dabrafenib and trametinib by comparing the complete gross surgical resection rate&#xD;
      (R0 or R1 surgical resection) to historical control of 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Demonstrate the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib&#xD;
      by comparing the overall survival (OS) to historical OS rate of 9.6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the efficacy (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]) of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      dabrafenib, trametinib, and pembrolizumab combination (Part 1) and progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) for all patients throughout their treatment course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Demonstrate the extent to which neoadjuvant dabrafenib, trametinib, and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      changes surgical morbidity/complexity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Establish surgical safety for neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in combination with BRAF &amp; MEK&#xD;
      inhibitors, dabrafenib and trametinib; as well as safety for concurrent administration of&#xD;
      postoperative adjuvant pembrolizumab with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Evaluate changes in patient reported outcomes: quality of life assessed by validated&#xD;
      questionnaires at initial diagnosis, through the course of therapy, and during the adjuvant&#xD;
      targeted therapy phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Determine whether features of the tumor genomic landscape and tumor immune&#xD;
      microenvironment are associated with response to dabrafenib/trametinib/pembrolizumab (DTP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine if changes of cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) correlate with response to&#xD;
      treatment on DTP and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the safety of dabrafenib/trametinib/pembrolizumab plus IMRT in a subset of 5&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 1 (NEOADJUVANT PHASE): Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and&#xD;
      trametinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Starting in week 4, patients also receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days&#xD;
      for 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may&#xD;
      receive 2 additional cycles of DTP at the discretion of the treating physicians. Patients&#xD;
      whose disease is deemed resectable undergo surgery. Patients who are not surgically&#xD;
      resectable after 5 cycles of DTP move to Part 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 2 (ADJUVANT PHASE): 2-4 weeks after surgery and at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physicians, patients may continue to receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks&#xD;
      and concurrently undergo IMRT with or without cisplatin or carboplatin for 6 weeks. 5&#xD;
      patients also receive dabrafenib PO BID and trametinib PO QD concurrently for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 3: Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID, trametinib PO QD on days 1-21, and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 17 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months during years&#xD;
      1-2, every 6 months during years 3-4, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
