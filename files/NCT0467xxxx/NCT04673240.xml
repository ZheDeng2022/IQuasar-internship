  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity has been defined as a disorder of the sensorimotor system characterized by a&#xD;
      velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (muscle tone) with exaggerated tendon&#xD;
      jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment goal of spasticity is Medical treatment generally combines physiotherapy with&#xD;
      medications, depending on spasticity distribution. Systemic treatments such as oral or&#xD;
      intrathecal baclofen are generally considered in case of generalized spasticity, whereas&#xD;
      local treatments are considered in case of focal spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local treatments such as Botulinum Toxin type A, phenol, and alcohol present several&#xD;
      advantages, allowing to treat of selected muscles without the risk of sedation. As stated&#xD;
      above, they are indicated for focal spasticity but might be helpful even in the presence of&#xD;
      generalized spasticity with identified focal goals (Bethoux et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, Botulinum Toxin type A (BoNT-A) is considered the gold standard treatment for&#xD;
      focal spasticity, showing a level A evidence for spasticity reduction in upper- and&#xD;
      lower-limb spasticity (Simpson et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, current evidence is mainly focused on post-stroke spasticity (Franceschini et al.,&#xD;
      2014), whereas it is still limited in spasticity as a consequence of other aetiologies, such&#xD;
      as spinal cord injury (SCI), traumatic brain injury (TBI), or multiple sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, spasticity is a major concern for the rehabilitation of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this observational study is the evaluation of the clinical efficacy of BoNT-A in&#xD;
      spasticity reduction in patients affected by neurological conditions different from&#xD;
      post-stroke spasticity, such as SCI, TBI, and MS.&#xD;
