  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project was a Randomized control trial conducted to check the effects of Cervical&#xD;
      Stabilization Exercises on Respiratory Strength in Chronic Neck Pain Patients with Forward&#xD;
      Head Posture, duration of study was of 6 months, convenient sampling was done, subject&#xD;
      following eligibility criteria from Jinnah Hospital Lahore, were randomly allocated in two&#xD;
      groups via lottery method, baseline assessment was done, Group A participants were given&#xD;
      baseline treatment protocol for 4 weeks which included 3 sessions per week. Heating Pad&#xD;
      applied for 15 min and TENS (Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation) for 10 min. After&#xD;
      that Cervical isometric exercises performed in sitting (10sec hold, 10 to 15 reps). Group B&#xD;
      was experimental group and participants were given baseline treatment in addition to Cervical&#xD;
      Stabilization exercises for 4 weeks which included 3 sessions per week. The baseline&#xD;
      measurement was taken on day one for Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRPS) and Neck Disability&#xD;
      Index (NDI). Forward head posture assessed by measuring Cranio Vertebral Angle (CVA).&#xD;
      Respiratory muscle strengths measured by Spirometer and SBC (single breath count). All the&#xD;
      measurements repeated at the end of fourth week. Data was analyzed by using SPSS version 20.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Extensive usage of electronic gadgets in today's life leads to the musculoskeletal problems&#xD;
      among which neck pain is the most common problem reported to physicians, orthopedics and&#xD;
      physical therapists. Even before reporting to clinics there is long history of using over the&#xD;
      counter pain killers. Pain avoidance behaviors let the cervical spine stiff so much that a&#xD;
      clinician help is sought. There is huge literature regarding the management of chronic neck&#xD;
      pain and yet after the decades of research there are gaps in treatment options. In modern age&#xD;
      of health care, it is common goal of every healthcare to make patient self-sufficient as&#xD;
      early as possible. The self-care models have tremendous advantages. The current study has&#xD;
      compared the effects of cervical stabilization exercises and isometric exercises. The current&#xD;
      study was novel in a way that there is limited literature about treating Chronic Neck Pain&#xD;
      Patients with effects of physiotherapy on respiratory strength in improving forward head&#xD;
      posture. All the methods were employed to see if they improve ranges along with accompanying&#xD;
      pain and disability.&#xD;

    <description>The NPRS is the segmented numeric version of visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of pain. The common format is a horizontal bar or line. Similar to VAS, the NPRS is anchored by terms describing pain severity extremes.</description>

    <measure>Spirometer</measure>
    <time_frame>4th Week</time_frame>
    <description>A spirometer is an apparatus for measuring the volume of air inspired and expired by the lungs. A spirometer measures ventilation, the movement of air into and out of the lungs. The spirogram will identify two different types of abnormal ventilation patterns, obstructive and restrictive</description>

    <measure>Single Breath Count( SBC)</measure>
    <time_frame>4th Week</time_frame>
    <description>To perform, ask patient to count out loud after maximal inspiration. Ability to reach 50 indicates normal respiratory function. Single breath count of less than 15 typically correlates with low forced vital capacity (FVC) and respiratory muscle weakness</description>
