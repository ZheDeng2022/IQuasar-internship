  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has evolved to represent the most common cause of&#xD;
      chronic liver disease globally. Today, NAFLD is a leading indication for liver&#xD;
      transplantation and a major etiology for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the United States.&#xD;
      NAFLD is characterized by the excess accumulation of lipids within the liver and ranges from&#xD;
      isolated steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is characterized by the&#xD;
      presence of hepatic necroinflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of various chronic liver&#xD;
      diseases, and for determining the severity of liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis stage.&#xD;
      However, this procedure is invasive, prone to complications such as bleeding and is&#xD;
      associated with sampling variability and limited representation of the whole liver. Other&#xD;
      limitations include, the difficulty to monitor liver injury progression over time and&#xD;
      underestimation of disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite intensive research, currently available non-invasive blood tests are not sufficiently&#xD;
      sensitive or specific and are therefore of limited use. Blood biomarkers might provide&#xD;
      significant advances in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression and regression in&#xD;
      clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, liquid biopsy has emerged as a potential, less invasive, alternative to liver&#xD;
      biopsy. In fact, it addresses several unmet clinical needs, including sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, the determination of prognoses, and the prediction of therapeutic responses.&#xD;

      This is a multicentric prospective observational study to validate blood non-invasive&#xD;
      biomarkers for NASH and fibrosis stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 subjects will be enrolled; 100 subjects with biopsy-proven NASH and 50 subjects with&#xD;
      normal liver will be used as controls.&#xD;
