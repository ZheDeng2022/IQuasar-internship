    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the endovenous&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation closure system produced by Suzhou Hengrui Hongyuan Medical Technology&#xD;
      Co., Ltd. for the treatment of varicose veins.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled study, 176 patients who were&#xD;
      diagnosed with varicose veins and met the inclusion criteria without any exclusion criteria&#xD;
      were randomly divided into the experimental group (Hongyuan Endovenous Radiofrequency&#xD;
      Ablation Closure System)and control group (Medtronic's ClosureFast™ Radiofrequency Ablation&#xD;
      System) at 1:1. The effectiveness of the product was evaluated by the vascular closure rate&#xD;
      at 6 months after the operation, and the safety of the product was evaluated by the incidence&#xD;
      of adverse events and serious adverse events within 6 months after the operation.&#xD;

Definition of complete closure: Complete closure refers to ultrasound follow-up at 6 months after surgery that shows no blood flow in varicose veins.</description>

    <measure>CEAP</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CEAP is an elaborate scoring system for varicose veins and other disorders from venous insufficiency. It has been developed to determine the severity of the condition for diagnosis and treatment point of view. CEAP stands for:&#xD;

    <description>For endovenous radiofrequency closure catheter: evaluation on the degree of device flexibility, crossability, accuracy, usability (subjective evaluation scale: excellent, good and poor) For endovenous radiofrequency closure generator: evaluation on applicability,accuracy of identifying catheter version, stability in the procedure(subjective evaluation: yes or no)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>VCSS</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline in venous clinical severity score (VCSS) (0-30, higher scores mean a worse outcome) in outpatient services. the VCSS was derived by the American Venous Forum from the CEAP classification and provides means by which clinical outcomes in venous disease can be monitored in time.Compared to the CEAP, VCSS is said to be more responsive to changes in disease severity, thus making it great for progressive rankings. It proved good inter and intra observer reproducibility and is often cited in quality of life assessments</description>
