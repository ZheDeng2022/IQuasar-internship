      This is a phase 3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of HBI-8000 or Placebo combined&#xD;
      with nivolumab on patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and eligible patients who&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of HBI-8000&#xD;
      or Placebo combined with nivolumab. Randomization of eligible patients who are not&#xD;
      adolescents or patients with new, progressive brain metastasis will be stratified by PD-L1&#xD;
      expression (positive, ≥5% expression level versus negative, &lt;5% expression level) and LDH&#xD;
      (normal versus elevated). Adolescents and patients with new, progressive brain metastasis&#xD;
      will be randomized in a separate stratum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Eligible patients will be randomized within the appropriate stratum at a 1:1 ratio to the&#xD;
      Test arm or the Control arm. Study treatment will be initiated within 3 days of&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A treatment cycle consists of 28 days. Patients will be treated with one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test arm: HBI-8000 30 mg oral BIW + nivolumab 480 mg IV Q4W Control arm: Placebo oral BIW +&#xD;
      nivolumab 480 mg IV Q4W The Study Treatment of HBI-8000 or Placebo is administered at 30 mg&#xD;
      orally twice a week (BIW), approximately 30 minutes after the first standard meal of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Treatment (HBI-8000 or Placebo) will be administered twice a week on the following&#xD;
      days of every 28-day cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CxW1: Days 1, 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CxW2: Days 8, 11&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CxW3: Days 15, 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CxW4: Days 22, 25 Study treatment must commence within 3 days after randomization and&#xD;
           continue up to 2 years or until disease progression (confirmed), unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
           or patient withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to Study Treatment, nivolumab is administered at 480 mg IV Q4W as an intravenous&#xD;
      infusion over 30 minutes in accordance with the manufacturer regional product information&#xD;
      insert and the institution's prescribing practice. For adolescents weighing &lt; 40 kg,&#xD;
      nivolumab will be dosed at 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle. Note: Adults with new, progressive&#xD;
      brain metastasis, or adolescents with or without new progressive brain metastasis will be&#xD;
      randomized as a separate cohort to ensure balanced randomization to the two arms.&#xD;
