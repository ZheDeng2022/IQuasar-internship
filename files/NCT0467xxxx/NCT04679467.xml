  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      20 participants with PKU will build-up their dietary intake of PKU sphere over 2-16 weeks,&#xD;
      depending on their level of metabolic control whilst doing so. Participants will complete a&#xD;
      gastrointestinal specific and PKU specific questionnaire at the Baseline clinic visit and&#xD;
      record the amount of PKU sphere taken each day. Dried blood spots are taken twice per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once built up to a clinically appropriate intake of PKU sphere, or after 16 weeks,&#xD;
      participants enter a 4-week Evaluation Period. The amount of PKU sphere taken per day&#xD;
      continues to be recorded by participants. Gastrointestinal tolerance over the preceding seven&#xD;
      days is recorded at the end of each week. Evaluations of PKU sphere's palatability are made&#xD;
      at the end of weeks two and four of the Evaluation Period. Dried blood spots are taken once&#xD;
      per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant attends an End of Study Visit at the clinic and the investigator decides&#xD;
      whether they should continue taking PKU sphere.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      20 participants with phenylketonuria (PKU) will introduce PKU sphere into their diet. PKU&#xD;
      sphere is a food for special medical purposes (as defined by Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 on&#xD;
      food for specific groups), used for the dietary management of phenylketonuria from 3 years of&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study begins with a Baseline clinic visit. Informed consent is taken by the investigator&#xD;
      before the participant completes a PKU specific quality of life questionnaire, and a GI&#xD;
      specific questionnaire. The participant takes a dried blood spot in order for the&#xD;
      investigator to check their technique is correct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Build-up and Stabilisation Period. This will last between 2 and 16 weeks, depending on how&#xD;
      long the participant takes to reach their maximum recommended intake of PKU sphere.&#xD;
      Participants will take a dried blood spot twice per week in order for their health care&#xD;
      professional to monitor their phenylalanine and tyrosine levels. After three consecutive&#xD;
      dried blood spot results within the target range, the participant's HCP can advise to swap&#xD;
      one portion of amino acid-based protein substitute for PKU sphere. This method of building up&#xD;
      the amount of PKU sphere to be taken is informed directly by Vitaflo's 'Practical Guide to&#xD;
      PKU sphere'. The amount of PKU sphere taken each day is recorded by the participant in their&#xD;
      study diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the maximum recommended amount of PKU sphere is being taken by the participant, or after&#xD;
      16 weeks, the participant moves into the four-week Evaluation Period. Participants then take&#xD;
      a dried blood spot once per week, but continue to record their intake of PKU sphere each day.&#xD;
      At the end of each Evaluation Period week, participants record any gastrointestinal symptoms&#xD;
      experienced over the preceding seven days. At the end of Evaluation Period weeks two and&#xD;
      four, participants will also record their thoughts on PKU sphere's palatability. This&#xD;
      includes a Likert scale rating of the product's appearance, taste, aftertaste, smell,&#xD;
      texture, packaging and ease of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the Evaluation Period, participants return to the clinic for the End of Study&#xD;
      visit. The PKU and GI specific questionnaires completed at Baseline are repeated and the&#xD;
      Investigator discusses the suitability of the participant to continue to take PKU sphere as&#xD;
      part of their regular therapeutic diet. Following the visit, the Investigator rates the&#xD;
      utility of the Practical Guide to PKU sphere. A Follow-up Phone Call will relay the results&#xD;
      of any outstanding dried blood spot results to participants following their End of Study&#xD;
      Visit.&#xD;
