  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All current forms of therapy for tumor patients are essentially based on clinical, genomic or&#xD;
      histopathological criteria for the choice of therapy. However, the change in the tissue&#xD;
      during therapy is of particular importance for patients, both with regard to the development&#xD;
      of resistance and the side effect profile. This applies in particular to immunotherapies and&#xD;
      their use in advanced tumor diseases. Preliminary work on the fully human tumor explant model&#xD;
      has shown that the use of human donor tissue in the context of a special bioreactor makes it&#xD;
      possible to improve the possibilities of predicting and better understanding the mechanism of&#xD;
      action of a therapeutic agent. Since there is a considerable need for personalized and thus&#xD;
      improved therapy management in the field of oncology, the aim of this study is on the one&#xD;
      hand to improve the decisive tissue parameters for the cultivation of human donated material&#xD;
      and on the other hand to understand the basic reaction patterns of the tissue to therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Personalized therapy is still one of the great goals of oncology. In view of the success of&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor therapies in selected solid tumors, the question remains why other tumor&#xD;
      diseases do not respond in the same way to the therapy. However, this is not only limited to&#xD;
      immunotherapies. In principle, the understanding of the dynamic changes in a patient's tissue&#xD;
      has so far been very limited, both for predicting a therapy success and with regard to the&#xD;
      mechanistic understanding of how a therapy works. Model systems for diseases are often animal&#xD;
      models that reproduce the complexity of a multi-organ system, but show significant&#xD;
      differences to humans at the tissue level and therefore have only little informative value.&#xD;
      Cell culture experiments, on the other hand, have only little informative value with regard&#xD;
      to the overall behavior of a tissue or even an organ or the disease situation. &quot;Naturalistic&quot;&#xD;
      co-culture in the Petri dish (such as with organoid systems) does not allow any sensible&#xD;
      transferable insights, even if complex cell compositions of fibroblasts, endothelium or&#xD;
      immune cells are used. In contrast, there is another problem for in vivo tumor models: either&#xD;
      there is a lack of flexibility with regard to the structural context or the species-specific&#xD;
      system properties do not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the situation in humans.&#xD;
      This is a massive limitation, especially for translational studies. The Tumor Explant Model&#xD;
      System developed by us allows the structural integrity of the tissue context to be maintained&#xD;
      in the context of obtaining a biopsy or removing a resection. The tissue sample obtained in&#xD;
      this way is kept in equilibrium via a bioreactor and can thus be used for tests or is&#xD;
      preserved in its context of the tissue. It is also possible in the sense of a personalized&#xD;
      diagnosis and therapy to take into account the individual bandwidth of the composition of the&#xD;
      tumor microenvironment. This approach has already been validated in a prospective study and&#xD;
      the transferability of the results from the explant models to humans has been proven. In this&#xD;
      situation, the systematic construction of explant models for other tumor entities and the use&#xD;
      of these models for therapy development and for better understanding of pathoregulation in&#xD;
      tissues. In addition to the tissue samples donated by the study participants, blood cells can&#xD;
      also be used for testing the tissue.hand to understand the basic reaction patterns of the&#xD;
      tissue to therapies.&#xD;
