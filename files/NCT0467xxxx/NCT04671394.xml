  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel-group, randomized controlled clinical trial aimed to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      and microbiological effects of the adjunctive topical use of diode laser and green&#xD;
      indocyanine in the full-mouth ultrasonic debridement of patients affected by periodontitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the supporting tissues of the teeth&#xD;
      and is primarily caused by the subgingival inflammation induced by the bacterial oral&#xD;
      biofilm. Several risk factors may condition its development and progression and, if&#xD;
      untreated, periodontitis may lead to tooth loss and severe functional and aesthetic&#xD;
      impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A central role in the non-surgical treatment of periodontitis is played by the manual and&#xD;
      ultrasonic debridement of supra and subgingival bacterial deposits. The benefit of a fully&#xD;
      ultrasonic approach lies in the knowledge that removing radicular structure is not a&#xD;
      prerequisite for periodontal healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, non-surgical therapy has limitations due to limited access to some sites (furcation&#xD;
      areas, concavities, grooves, distal sites of molars, and deep pockets), which may impair&#xD;
      periodontal healing due to the persistence of pathogens and subsequent recolonization. In&#xD;
      this context, the use of diode laser in combination with photoactivated solutions has been&#xD;
      proposed as an adjunct treatment to conventional periodontal therapy to enhance the&#xD;
      antibacterial effect and improve clinical effects, especially in areas of difficult access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of theme relevance and the existence of conflicting results in the literature, the&#xD;
      aim of the present parallel-group, randomized controlled clinical trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical and microbiological effects of the adjunctive topical use of diode laser and&#xD;
      indocyanine green (DLIG) in the full-mouth ultrasonic debridement (FMUD) of patients affected&#xD;
      by periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 patients will be treated by FMUD and, after 7 days, randomly allocated half to the test&#xD;
      and a half to the control group. In the test group, patients will receive an adjunctive&#xD;
      treatment in periodontal sites with an initial pocket depth &gt; 4mm consisting of the use of a&#xD;
      diode laser device (Fox ARC, Sweden &amp; Martina, Due Carrare, Italy) after pocket irrigation by&#xD;
      a solution of indocyanine green (Emundo®, Sweden&amp;Martina, Due Carrare, Padova, Italy),&#xD;
      whereas the patients in the control group will receive sham treatment (ST). The same&#xD;
      treatment will be repeated three weeks after in both the test and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment and microbiological analysis of subgingival plaque will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline and after 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
