      The purpose of the study is to investigate the acute effect of martial art exercise and&#xD;
      aerobic exercise on cognitive performance in college age students. Cognitive performance is a&#xD;
      term that encompasses our cognitive processes such as working memory, and executive&#xD;
      functioning (decision making); research has found that externally paced (EP) exercise&#xD;
      improves cognitive performance and executive functioning (EF). EP activities require decision&#xD;
      making skills and higher-level executive functioning. Previous research studies have shown&#xD;
      that acute as well as long term aerobic exercise improves cognitive performance Internally&#xD;
      paced (IP) exercise requires less attention on task, which may result in less significant&#xD;
      improvements in cognitive performance and executive function. However, there is limited&#xD;
      research examining the effect that martial art exercise has on these higher-level cognitive&#xD;
      functions.Theoretically, the martial art class will improve provide greater stimulation to&#xD;
      the higher levels of the brain, causing a greater improvement in the executive function&#xD;
      scores when compared to walking. This leads to the question, are externally paced aerobic&#xD;
      activities more effective than an acute bout of aerobic exercise in improving executive&#xD;
      function in college-aged adults? The investigators hypothesized that martial art training&#xD;
      will have a greater impact on executive functioning than aerobic exercise in college-aged&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the acute effect of a beginner martial art class&#xD;
      and aerobic exercise on cognitive performance in college age students. Cognitive performance&#xD;
      is a term that encompasses our cognitive processes such as working memory, and executive&#xD;
      functioning (response inhibition); research has found that externally paced (EP) exercise&#xD;
      improves cognitive performance and executive functioning (EF). EP activities require decision&#xD;
      making skills and higher-level executive functioning. Internally paced (IP) exercise requires&#xD;
      less attention on task, which may result in less significant improvements in cognitive&#xD;
      performance and executive function. Previous research studies have shown that acute as well&#xD;
      as long term aerobic exercise improves cognitive performance. However, there is limited&#xD;
      research examining the effect that a martial art class, an external paced exercise, has on&#xD;
      these higher-level cognitive functions in college -aged subjects. A study performed by Douris&#xD;
      et. al provides a more accurate measure of EP exercise and cognition. Martial arts were used&#xD;
      as the complex EP activity. EF in the martial arts group showed greater improvement than the&#xD;
      aerobic exercise condition. This was attributed to the complexities of the movement patterns&#xD;
      and the associated cortical demands. This study aligns with our current belief that EP&#xD;
      activities will have a greater effect than IP activities. The research on the comparison of&#xD;
      martial art exercise (externally paced exercise) versus aerobic exercise (internally paced&#xD;
      exercise) on executive function is limited to the previous study by the principal&#xD;
      investigator utilizing experienced middle-aged martial artists and we presently intend to&#xD;
      investigate college aged adults as compared to the previously investigated middle -aged..The&#xD;
      current study looks to determine how complex exercise would impact executive functioning.&#xD;
      Martial art training requires reactionary movements, quick thinking and decision making, all&#xD;
      of which are components of EF. Walking is a relatively simple task that does not require much&#xD;
      conscious or cortical control. The investigators plan to have the participants participate in&#xD;
      a beginning martial art class and a one hour walk.. Theoretically, the martial art class will&#xD;
      improve provide greater stimulation to the higher levels of the brain, causing a greater&#xD;
      improvement in the executive function scores when compared to walking. This leads to the&#xD;
      question, are externally paced aerobic activities more effective than an acute bout of&#xD;
      aerobic exercise in improving executive function in college-aged adults? The proposed&#xD;
      research design will be utilizing a randomized cross over repeated measures design. The&#xD;
      independent variables are the two one-hour conditions and the dependent variables are the&#xD;
      change in Stroop test scores, and stress Visual Analog Scale (VAS) results. In order to test&#xD;
      the hypothesis, the investigators will perform a dependent t-test for each dependent&#xD;
      variable. An alpha level of p&lt;0.05 will be used for all statistical comparisons. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that an externally paced activity such as martial art exercise will have a&#xD;
      greater effect on enhancing executive functioning and will improve stress levels in college&#xD;
      aged young adults when compared to an internally paced activity such as walking.&#xD;

Subjects will take part in two separate conditions: 1) One hour of a beginning martial art class (EP), and 2) One hour walk at 4.0 mph pace (IP).The independent variables are the two conditions and the dependent variables are processing speed, attention, executive function (Stroop Color and Word tests), and a stress visual analog scale</intervention_model_description>

    <description>For the Stroop tests: the subject will be asked to read words of colors, state the colors of various letters to test processing speed. Subjects will also state the color of the font of a word when the actual word describes a conflicting color. This tests response inhibition, which is a subdivision of executive function. Tower of London which entails a subject is shown the correct organization and is given a specific number of moves to accomplish the task which tests for the problem solving domain of executive function</description>
