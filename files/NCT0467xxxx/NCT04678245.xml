  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rates of adolescent vaping are increasing rapidly. Current high school student use of&#xD;
      electronic vaping products (EVPs) rose from 1.5% in 2011 to 20.8% in 2018 - an increase from&#xD;
      220,000 to 3.05 million adolescent users. Effective, school-based interventions are urgently&#xD;
      needed to protect adolescents from initiating or continuing use of electronic vaping products&#xD;
      (EVPs). This study leverages a state-supported prevention initiative to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a promising intervention that trains 8th-9th grade student peer leaders to&#xD;
      deliver school-wide vaping prevention campaigns with ongoing adult mentoring. If study&#xD;
      hypotheses are supported, the study will provide the first evidence of a school-based&#xD;
      preventive intervention that reduces adolescent vaping behaviors, as well as insight into how&#xD;
      peer communications can be harnessed to prevent vaping.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Above the Influence of Vaping (ATI-V) trains peer nominated 8th-9th grade Peer Leader, and&#xD;
      adult advisors. Peer Leaders learn skills and implement school-wide prevention campaigns&#xD;
      informed by communication science.New York State has provided funds to support schools to&#xD;
      implement ATI-V but no funds for efficacy research. With support from New York State and a&#xD;
      strong team of investigators, our project has two aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Efficacy. The primary aim of this study is to determine ATI-V impact in preventing&#xD;
      vaping use (past 30 days any vaping, nicotine vaping, and regular use). Using an RCT design,&#xD;
      20 schools will be assigned to (a) immediate ATI-V, or (b) wait-list for ATI-V training after&#xD;
      24 months. Approximately 3,800 8th graders will be enrolled and followed for assessments in&#xD;
      fall 8th grade, spring 8th grade, spring 9th grade, and mid-year 10th grade. We will test for&#xD;
      which students ATI-V is most effective and in what school contexts (school climate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Mechanism. The second aim of this study to test the hypothesized mechanisms of ATI-V&#xD;
      impact. To accomplish this aim we will conduct statistical analyses of a mediation model to&#xD;
      determine (a) whether ATI-V improves students' perceptions that vaping is unacceptable to&#xD;
      their peers (anti-vaping norms), connections to supportive adults to address EVP concerns,&#xD;
      and social influence of non-vaping students; and (b) whether the impact of ATI-V on reduced&#xD;
      vaping behavior is mediated by these improvements.&#xD;

    <description>Peer-nominated 8th grade and 9th grade Peer Leaders (PL) will be trained in a half day ATI-V training. Adult Advisors (AA) will attend a half day ATI-V AA training and the PL training. The training day builds leadership skills in the PLs, develops skills for rising above pressure to vape including identification of personal reasons to rise, identification of healthy support people, teaching accurate use statistics, and sharing stories of prior success in rising above negative pressures. The ATI-V team of PLs and AAs then will run four interactive messaging campaigns to reach the rest of the student body. These four campaigns are (1) Introduction to ATI-V and My Reasons to Rise (2) Gain and Loss (3) Who's Got My Back (4) The Facts. Each campaign features a portion in which PLs model healthy norms and behaviors, and a second portion in which all the rest of the students engage in an interactive component to build and demonstrate the target skill.</description>
