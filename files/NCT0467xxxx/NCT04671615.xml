  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study aims to describe patient demographics, clinical&#xD;
      characteristics, clinical outcomes and treatment patterns of adult breast cancer patients who&#xD;
      have initiated palbociclib combination treatment as per the national basket of health&#xD;
      services in January 2018 until August 2020 for all lines of therapy. This is a population&#xD;
      based retrospective database study that will include patients with metastatic, HR+/ HER2-&#xD;
      breast cancer and who initiated first or subsequent lines of treatment with palbociclib. Data&#xD;
      will be available from Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS) database in Israel for patients who&#xD;
      received approval for treatment with palbociclib since 01 January 2018 until 31 August 2020.&#xD;
