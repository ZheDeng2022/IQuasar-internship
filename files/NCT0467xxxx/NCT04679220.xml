      Summary The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of preheating resin composite (RC)&#xD;
      on clinical performance of class I restorations in a period of 3-years using a split-mouth&#xD;
      double-blinded randomized design.&#xD;

      The description of the experimental design followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting&#xD;
      Trials (CONSORT) statement. The present study was a double-blinded (patients and examiner)&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial anticipating the split mouth design. Thirty-five adult patients&#xD;
      seeking dental treatment in Operative Department clinic at Faculty of Dentistry, University&#xD;
      of Mansoura were enrolled in the current study with a total of 70 Class I restorations. No&#xD;
      advertisement was made for participant recruitment, forming a sample of convenience. Each&#xD;
      patient much sign a consent form before participating in the current study. The study was&#xD;
      conducted from October 2017 to June 2020 as a part of Doctoral dissertation. Mansoura&#xD;
      University institution's ethics committee approved the form and protocol before conducting&#xD;
      the study. The sample size was calculated based on the clinical success rate (100% retention&#xD;
      rate at 3 years) of posterior class I restorations restored with nanofilled composite&#xD;
      observed in a previous study.28 According to several parameters including a significance&#xD;
      level of 5%, the power of the test was calculated to be 80%, and equivalent limit of 15%.&#xD;
      Upon these data, a sample size of 30 subjects was appropriate. Allowing for a 20% drop-out,&#xD;
      sample size was set totalizing 35 subjects.&#xD;
