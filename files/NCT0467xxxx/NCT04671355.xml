&#xD;
               2. WOCBP with non-fertile male partners (contraception is not required in this&#xD;

             investigator's judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities indicating a significant or unstable&#xD;
             concomitant disease which may impact the efficacy or the safety of the study drug&#xD;
             according to investigator's judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Unstable concurrent disease: e.g. fever, uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, uncontrolled&#xD;
             diabetes mellitus or other endocrine disease; significant hepatic impairment;&#xD;
             significant renal impairment; uncontrolled gastrointestinal disease (e.g. active&#xD;
             peptic ulcer); uncontrolled neurological disease; uncontrolled haematological disease;&#xD;
             uncontrolled autoimmune disorders, or other which may impact the efficacy or the&#xD;
             safety of the study drug according to investigator's judgment.&#xD;

         13. History of alcohol abuse and/or substance/drug abuse within 12 months prior to&#xD;
             screening visit.&#xD;

         14. Participation in another clinical trial where investigational drug was received less&#xD;
             than 30 days or 5 half-lives whichever is longer prior to screening visit&#xD;
