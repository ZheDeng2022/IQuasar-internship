      The effect of the Copenhagen Adduction Exercise on groin injuries rate among soccer players&#xD;
      The Copenhagen adduction exercise is a body-weight exercise which mainly works the groin and&#xD;
      hip Adductors. It has a large eccentric component, meaning the muscles are working whilst&#xD;
      lengthening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the Copenhagen adduction exercise&#xD;
      on groin injuries among soccer players.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It hypothesized that Copenhagen adduction exercise has a beneficial effect in terms of groin&#xD;
      injury prevention.&#xD;

      Study type Interventional Description of intervention(s) / exposure The intervention group&#xD;
      will be instructed to include the Copenhagen adduction exercise into their warm up before&#xD;
      training session (3 times per week) during one season (6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group sessions will be administered by an exercise physiologist and/ or athletic trainer and/&#xD;
      or soccer coaches and/ or strength and conditioning specialists and/ or physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session attendance checklists will be used to assess or monitor adherence to the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Copenhagen adduction exercise is a body-weight exercise which mainly works the groin and&#xD;
      hip adductor. It has a large eccentric component, meaning the muscles are working whilst&#xD;
      lengthening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Copenhagen Adduction exercise is a simple isolated eccentric partner exercise and doesn't&#xD;
      require special equipment and can be performed as a warm up activity on the pitch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Copenhagen Adduction exercise requires a partner who will hold the player's upper leg in&#xD;
      an extended position nearly at the hip level of the partner, with one hand supporting the&#xD;
      knee and the other upholding the ankle. Meanwhile, the player will lie on one side and&#xD;
      support the body with the forearm on the ground and the top arm being placed along the body.&#xD;
      Then, the player will elevate the trunk from the floor and raise the lower leg in a straight&#xD;
      line. The player will repeat this for 3 seconds until the feet touch each other. This will be&#xD;
      followed by slightly lowering the body just to the ground for 3 seconds until it touches the&#xD;
      level of the foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It must be performed on both limbs. It is crucial to note that the most accurate performance&#xD;
      of the exercise must avoid trunk bending. In terms of the training form, the frequency is&#xD;
      three-two sessions per week while the repetition varies according to the different levels of&#xD;
      the players ranging from 3-12 times in one-two sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention Comparator / control treatment The control group will practice their usual warm&#xD;
      up. Usual warm up is defined as any basic exercises performed before a performance or&#xD;
      practice to prepare the muscles for vigorous actions.&#xD;

    <description>Injury is defined according to a consensus statement on injury definitions and data collection procedures in soccer studies; an injury will be recorded if it caused the player to be unable to completely participate in the following match or training session.Injury rates will be summarised as number of injuries per 1000 player-hours for both matches and training. Exposure time in hours will be calculated for each team over a 6-month period.&#xD;
Data will be collected from Sports Injury Tracker injury reporting form. Coaches in both the experimental and control groups will be reporting injuries during training and matches by filling in forms once per week and submitting the information using the Sports Injury Tracker injury reporting form (Sports Medicine Australia).&#xD;
