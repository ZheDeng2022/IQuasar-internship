  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies is complex and a simple approach cannot describe the&#xD;
      whole picture. Different etiologies are reported in pediatric age and heart failure onset can&#xD;
      lead to poor prognosis in term of need of heart transplantation and ventricular assist device&#xD;
      implantation. Based on hypothesis that heart failure development is related to heart&#xD;
      inability to meet metabolic demands of the body, our study will focus to evaluate cardiac&#xD;
      metabolism as one of the most critical factors and the accompanying changes of metabolic and&#xD;
      echocardiographic profiles at different stages of heart failure. The heart is a unique organ&#xD;
      working continuously as a pump supplying blood to the body. To meet this requirement, the&#xD;
      myocardium utilizes fatty acids to generate 70-90% of the adenosine triphospate, with the&#xD;
      rest being produced by oxidation of glucose, lactate, ketone bodies, aminoacids. Utilization&#xD;
      of fatty acids is reduced in the failing heart and there is a metabolic shift to generation&#xD;
      of adenosine triphospate from glucose. In patients with advanced cardiomyopathies, the heart&#xD;
      is unable to utilize either metabolite and thus &quot;runs out of fuel&quot;. It is reported that the&#xD;
      adenosine triphospate level is approximately 30% lower in failing human hearts compared with&#xD;
      non-failing hearts. In addition to this premise about the metabolic profile of the failing&#xD;
      heart, recent advances in the field of metabolomics have indicated that several metabolites&#xD;
      and/or metabolic pathways have a role in heart failure. Metabolism of lipids, glycolysis,&#xD;
      fructolysis, aminoacids, and ketone oxidation have been found to be altered in non-ischemic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy in adult population. Also in adult heart failure patients some metabolic&#xD;
      profiles resulted pronounced perturbated. Taking advantage of the high throughput,&#xD;
      metabolomics is a platform for identifying metabolic signatures in children at each stages of&#xD;
      heart failure (from pre clinical heart failure to end stage forms). We also will determine&#xD;
      whether metabolomic analysis provides sensitive evaluation of heart failure in terms of&#xD;
      remodelling at different stages and in disease regression after therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
      Study desing is conceived in two parts. The first part is retrospective and we will analyze&#xD;
      all echocardiograms in all children affected by cardiomyopathies. The second part is a cross&#xD;
      sectional study in which will evaluate untargeted metabolomics in children at any stage of&#xD;
      heart failure (A,B, C, D) and in control group. We will evaluate the clinical applicability&#xD;
      and significance of plasma metabolomic analysis in the diagnosis and prognosis of heart&#xD;
      failure in pediatric ages.&#xD;
