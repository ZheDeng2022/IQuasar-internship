  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Direct oral anticoagulants (Rivaroxaban, Apixaban and Dabigatran) are an alternative to&#xD;
      anti-vitamin K drugs and low molecular weight heparins in many cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new class of anticoagulants represents a particular and very promising advance: they are&#xD;
      administered orally, their mechanism of action is rapid and direct on coagulation and their&#xD;
      predictable pharmacological action allows for administration at fixed doses. In contrast to&#xD;
      anti-vitamin K, there is no need for routine biological monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, their therapeutic range is narrow and there is no routine biological monitoring.&#xD;
      Rigorous compliance is therefore necessary. In addition, there are no official validated&#xD;
      recommendations either for the measurement of anticoagulant activity in certain emergency&#xD;
      situations, or for the management of severe bleeding (except recently for Pradaxa®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their correct use requires the training and involvement of health professionals as well as&#xD;
      information and support for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical interviews are one of the main ways in which pharmacists can ensure this&#xD;
      security through personalized and optimal patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of these interviews is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reinforce the pharmacist's advisory, educational and preventive roles with patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To enhance the pharmacist's expertise in the area of medication;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the patient's knowledge of his or her treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the patient's knowledge of his or her treatment; To seek the patient's&#xD;
           therapeutic adherence and help him or her to take ownership of his or her treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate, in the long term, the patient's appropriation of his or her treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, they enable involvement with patients while providing a link between healthcare&#xD;
      professionals, which is essential for optimal patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, numerous studies have been conducted on pharmaceutical interviews in the&#xD;
      United Kingdom and the Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, few studies have been conducted in France to evaluate the clinical impact&#xD;
      of pharmaceutical interviewing in medical services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare patients' knowledge of direct oral anticoagulants between&#xD;
      2 cardiology departments offering or not a pharmaceutical interview.&#xD;
