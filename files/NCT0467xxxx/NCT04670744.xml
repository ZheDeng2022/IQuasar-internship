  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The availability of electronic documentation systems in patient care means that large amounts&#xD;
      of clinical routine data are available from which conclusions can be drawn for improving&#xD;
      patient care. Compared to conventional research approaches, a data science-oriented approach&#xD;
      offers the possibility of identifying patterns in routine data (&quot;pattern recognition&quot;) that&#xD;
      are relevant for patient-centered outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous projects and sub-projects can be evaluated from this data set.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patterns that are relevant for patient-centered outcomes can be combinations of different&#xD;
      parameters (e.g. vital signs, laboratory values, previous illnesses), which in themselves do&#xD;
      not necessarily have a pathogenic effect, but in a specific combination may have a high&#xD;
      relevance for the patient-centered outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project pursues as research goal the anesthesiological and intensive care risk&#xD;
      reduction. To this end, the existing data sets of routine care are to be used to identify&#xD;
      outcome-relevant patterns in order to derive recommendations for improving treatment in line&#xD;
      with the patient's wishes. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Quality Indicators (QIs)&#xD;
      in combination with the data of routine clinical care will be used as a basis. The approach&#xD;
      outlined is closely linked to the development of quality-based treatment structures. In order&#xD;
      to be able to offer medical treatment at a high level, associated processes must be known and&#xD;
      operationalized, i.e. measurable. QIs (quality indicators) are an established instrument for&#xD;
      measuring individual dimensions of treatment quality, and our clinic is a leading participant&#xD;
      in this process at both national and international level (see Spies et al. Guidelines for&#xD;
      Delirium, Analgesia and Sedation). The mapping of quality-based treatment structures as SOPs&#xD;
      (Standard Operating Procedures) is also essential in this context (see Spies et al. SOPs in&#xD;
      Anesthesiology and Pain Therapy, Thieme Verlag). By applying data science-based methods, this&#xD;
      study pursues the overall goal of supporting the transfer of evidence-based findings in the&#xD;
      form of QIs and SOPs into patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous projects and sub-projects can be evaluated from this data set.&#xD;

        At the department for anesthesiology with a focus on operative intensive care medicine,&#xD;
        approximately 60,000 anaesthesias are performed annually. The data sets of documentation&#xD;
        systems used in this context date back approximately to the year 2006 and are to be&#xD;
        considered for the development of data science-based models depending on selected QI or&#xD;
        SOPs.&#xD;
