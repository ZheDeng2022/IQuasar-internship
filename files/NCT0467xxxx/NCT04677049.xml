  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution Phase I-II study to evaluate the tolerability and Maximum&#xD;
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) (Phase I) and efficacy (Phase II) of adding Niacin CRT™ to standard&#xD;
      first line treatment (concurrent Radiation Therapy (RT) and Temozolomide (TMZ) following by&#xD;
      monthly TMZ - AKA Stupp protocol) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma isocitrate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (IDH) wild type.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the Phase I stage Niacin CRT™ dose will be escalated every 4 weeks until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD dose will be prescribed to patients during the&#xD;
      Phase II stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Phase I study a sample of blood at baseline, at each level dose of Niacin CRT™,&#xD;
      and every two months during the maintenance phase while on Niacin CRTTM will be sent to a lab&#xD;
      to evaluate the peripheral activity of Niacin CRT™ in innate immune system cells. These&#xD;
      samples will be taken at the time of routine standard of care lab work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on prior clinical trials evaluating niacin extended release formulation for the&#xD;
      management of dyslipidaemias there is vast experience on dose escalation of niacin. One of&#xD;
      the main side effects is flushing that is ameliorated by escalating doses in intervals no&#xD;
      shorter than 4 weeks and usually decreases with time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this schema, there is no increase in dose coinciding with TMZ while administered in&#xD;
      a 5/28 days schedule (given daily for 5 days of each 28-day cycle). This will not only&#xD;
      improve tolerance but also will allow us to differentiate potential adverse events from&#xD;
      chemotherapy from the ones from Niacin CRT™.&#xD;

    <description>Niacin controlled release technology (CRT):&#xD;
Niacin CRT™ is to be started 7 days before concurrent Radiation Therapy (RT)- Temozolomide (TMZ) treatment.&#xD;
Chemo/Radiation Therapy:&#xD;
For all patients, regardless of the phase of the study, concurrent RT and TMZ for 6 weeks followed by 6-12 cycles of monthly TMZ will be given.&#xD;
Concurrent Temozolomide:&#xD;
TMZ will be administered from the first to the last day of RT at 75 mg/m2 orally (PO) for a maximum of 49 days.&#xD;
Monthly Temozolomide:&#xD;
Cycles of chemotherapy Day 1 to Day 5 every 28 days will start 28 days (+/- 2 days) after the end of RT-TMZ. First cycle of TMZ is administered at 150 mg/m2 Day 1-Day 5 by mouth (PO) and increased to 200 mg/m2 Day 1-Day 5 PO from cycle 2 onwards if well tolerated. While 6 cycles are standard of care, the Neuro-Oncologist may continue up to 12 cycles if clinically appropriate.</description>
