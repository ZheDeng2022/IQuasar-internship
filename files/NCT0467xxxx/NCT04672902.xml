  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mirizzi syndrome is an infrequent complication of long-standing cholelithiasis. Extrinsic&#xD;
      compression of the common hepatic duct is usually caused by an impacted stone in Hartmann's&#xD;
      pouch or cystic duct resulting in the development of cholecystobiliary fistula. This syndrome&#xD;
      is classified based on the presence and severity of cholecystobiliary fistula. Mirizzi&#xD;
      syndrome is challenging to diagnose preoperatively and may require complex biliary surgical&#xD;
      procedures for resolution. Endoscopic treatment is a safe alternative with a high success&#xD;
      rate. Single-operator cholangioscopy combined with lithotripsy has been shown to have a&#xD;
      90-100% success rate in the treatment of biliary stones. Herein, A single center experience&#xD;
      treating Mirizzi syndrome with single-operator cholangioscopy guided electrohydraulic&#xD;
      lithotripsy is presented. Difficult management of Mirizzi syndrome has led to research of new&#xD;
      treatment options to minimize the risk of high rate complications. Single-operator&#xD;
      cholangioscopy in combination with laser lithotripsy is an adequate and safe alternative for&#xD;
      the treatment of this condition.&#xD;
