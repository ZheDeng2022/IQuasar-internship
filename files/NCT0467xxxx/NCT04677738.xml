  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight has become a critical issue in North America and the market value of weight loss&#xD;
      products is expected to rise as the population becomes more health-conscious and aware of the&#xD;
      risks associated with excess body weight. This randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial&#xD;
      investigates the effect of Bifidobacterium breve supplementation with exercise intervention&#xD;
      on fat loss.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In early adulthood, excess body weight is a risk factor associated with several health&#xD;
      complications later on in life and probiotics have been used for decades for maintaining&#xD;
      intestinal health, and in recent years probiotics have been proposed for weight management.&#xD;
      This randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial investigates the effect of&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium breve supplementation with exercise intervention on fat loss.&#xD;
