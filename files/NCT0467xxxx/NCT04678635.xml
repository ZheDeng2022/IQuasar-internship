  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic autoimmune myopathies are rheumatic diseases that affect the striatum skeletal&#xD;
      muscles. The transcranial direct current stimulation technique has been frequent, for&#xD;
      example, in patients with ischemic stroke or for the optimization of muscular performance in&#xD;
      athletes. However, to date, there are no studies evaluating this technique in patients with&#xD;
      systemic autoimmune myopathies. Therefore, the main objective of the present prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      the application of chronic transcranial direct current stimulation sessions - associated with&#xD;
      aerobic exercises - in the patients with systemic autoimmune myopathies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Systemic autoimmune myopathies are rheumatic diseases that affect the striatum skeletal&#xD;
      muscles. Depending on the clinical, pathophysiological and laboratory characteristics, they&#xD;
      may be subdivided into polymyositis, dermatomyositis, antissintetase syndrome,&#xD;
      immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, and among others. Recently, the literature has been&#xD;
      presenting better pharmacological treatment options to control these diseases. Despite these&#xD;
      advances, this group of diseases still continues to be associated with high morbidity and&#xD;
      functional disability, mainly due to the proximal muscular weakness of the scapular and&#xD;
      pelvic girdles that may prevent the total recovery of these patients. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      association of the transcranial current stimulation technique with motor recovery has been&#xD;
      frequent, for example, in patients with ischemic stroke or for the optimization of muscular&#xD;
      performance in athletes. However, to date, there are no studies evaluating this technique in&#xD;
      patients with systemic autoimmune myopathies. Therefore, the main objective of the present&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the application of chronic transcranial current stimulation session - associated&#xD;
      with aerobic exercises - in patients with systemic autoimmune myopathies.&#xD;

    <description>Transcranial direct current stimulation session: the energy of the anode (transcranial current stimulation) will have as its source a battery-powered DC generator and will be exerted by two electrodes measuring 5x7cm and attached to the head. The electrodes will be located of the primary motor cortex. The electrode with positive charge (anode) will be positioned at contralateral to the dominant limb and the negative charged electrode will be positioned in the supraorbital region ipsilateral to the dominant limb. The active current of direct transcranial stimulation will be applied with the intensity of electric current of 2mA and density of 0.057 mA/cm2 with duration of 20 minutes. The stimulation will happen simultaneously to aerobic exercises for 20 minutes. Total number of stimulation associated with aerobic exercise sessions: 16</description>
