  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed prospectively to investigate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      PD-1 monoclonal antibody combined with cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). Tislelizumab, an anti-programmed&#xD;
      death protein-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody, was engineered to minimize binding to FcγR on&#xD;
      macrophages to abrogate antibody-dependent phagocytosis, a mechanism of T-cell clearance and&#xD;
      potential resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. The safety, tolerability, and efficacy of&#xD;
      tislelizumab in patients with PD-L1 positive urothelial carcinoma who progressed&#xD;
      during/following platinum-containing therapy was proved in a phase 2 trial (CTR20170071).&#xD;
      This trial focuses on the efficacy of Tislelizumab in combination with cisplatin-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy to induce pathological down-staging of locally advanced UTUC in neoadjuvant&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant therapy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been proved to improve prognosis of&#xD;
      muscle invasive UTUC patients in several studies. This study is designed to investigate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant PD-1 monoclonal antibody combined with cisplatin-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma&#xD;
      (UTUC).&#xD;
