  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study includes a Dose Escalation Part to identify the recommended combination dose (RCD)&#xD;
      and a Dose Expansion Part to further evaluate efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation: To assess the safety and tolerability of patritumab deruxtecan (U3-1402) and&#xD;
      osimertinib in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) with an EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation with tumor progression after&#xD;
      treatment with osimertinib, and to determine the recommended combination dose (RCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second-Line Dose Expansion Arm 1 and Arm 1b: To assess the preliminary antitumor activity of&#xD;
      patritumab deruxtecan and osimertinib in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC&#xD;
      with an EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation with tumor progression after treatment with&#xD;
      osimertinib. Note: One or both of the study arms may open with one or two distinct dosing&#xD;
      schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second-Line Dose Expansion Arm 2: To assess the preliminary antitumor activity of patritumab&#xD;
      deruxtecan monotherapy in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR&#xD;
      exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation with tumor progression after treatment with osimertinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First-Line Dose Expansion: To assess the safety and tolerability of patritumab deruxtecan and&#xD;
      osimertinib in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR exon 19&#xD;
      deletion or L858R mutation without prior systemic treatment for locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic disease.&#xD;

      Dose Escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population includes subjects with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR exon 19&#xD;
      deletion or L858R mutation with tumor progression after treatment with osimertinib. The&#xD;
      starting combination dose regimen is patritumab deruxtecan 3.2 mg/kg IV every 21 days (Q3W)&#xD;
      and osimertinib 80 mg orally (PO) once daily. At least 3 to 6 subjects will be enrolled in&#xD;
      each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Expansion: Two subject populations will be evaluated in the Dose Expansion Part:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second-Line: Subjects with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR exon 19&#xD;
           deletion or L858R mutation with tumor progression after treatment with osimertinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First-Line: Subjects with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR exon 19&#xD;
           deletion or L858R mutation, and without prior systemic therapy for advanced or&#xD;
           metastatic disease. Note: The first line expansion will only be initiated if the RCD&#xD;
           includes osimertinib 80 mg PO once daily.&#xD;
