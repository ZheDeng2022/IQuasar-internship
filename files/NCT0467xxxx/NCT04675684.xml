      This study investigates whether a complex intervention can aid recovery and prevent relapse&#xD;

      a psychiatric outpatient clinic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background: During the last seven years, our research group has collected considerable&#xD;
      experience with conducting and contributing studies aiming to prevent relapse of depression&#xD;
      and readmissions using a complex intervention with electronic self-monitoring in combination&#xD;
      with feedback from health investigators. In our first study (&quot;SAFE-I: Electronic&#xD;
      self-monitoring with clinical feedback in depression, a feasibility study&quot;), we used a&#xD;
      self-monitoring system to investigate the connection between sleep and depression after&#xD;
      discharge from a psychiatric inpatient ward to the Intensive Affective Outpatient Clinic&#xD;
      (IAOC) in combination with weekly feedback from investigators by telephone. Patients&#xD;
      evaluated the electronic system with a high usability score, and there was a high data entry&#xD;
      rate. Patients gradually delayed their sleep after discharge from the psychiatric inpatient&#xD;
      ward, and this delay of sleep was found to be related to a worsening of depression.&#xD;
      Subsequently, we designed a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) (&quot;SAFE II: Can electronic&#xD;
      self-monitoring with closed loop feedback focusing on regulation of the sleep-wake cycle&#xD;
      reduce relapse of depression after discharge from a psychiatric ward&quot;) that included patients&#xD;
      before discharge from a psychiatric inpatient ward and in the early faces of their stay at&#xD;
      IAOC, and followed them for four weeks. Patients were randomized to one group using&#xD;
      electronic self-monitoring with feedback from health investigators focusing on self-reported&#xD;
      data, and another group that in addition to the electronic self-monitoring was guided to&#xD;
      attain signals to the circadian clock to stabilize the, sleep-wake cycle (diet, daylight&#xD;
      exposure, sleep, and behavioral motivation towards social function and physical activity). In&#xD;
      all, 103 patients were included in the trial (last patient visit 22-12-2020). From the&#xD;
      qualitative data in this study, we found that patients expressed a feeling of support and&#xD;
      safety by participating in the study. They especially felt that the electronic&#xD;
      self-monitoring with continuous feedback from investigators provided them with an important&#xD;
      reflection on their activity and mental health. The depression severity decreased&#xD;
      significantly in both groups, comparable to what was found in the SAFE-I study. Readmission&#xD;
      rates were low in both groups (7.8 %). However, the study lacked an independent evaluation of&#xD;
      the implementation of the health interventions, i.e. process evaluation. Users were not&#xD;
      involved in the study's design. The SAFE-studies found that feedback from investigators is&#xD;
      deemed critical for a positive outcome, a finding supported by reviews of studies using&#xD;
      electronic self-monitoring in combination with feedback from investigators for patients with&#xD;
      depression. This proposed trial comprise further development based on experiences from these&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Recovery-by-eHealth investigates whether a complex intervention can aid recovery&#xD;
      and prevent relapse in depression and readmissions in patients who have previously been&#xD;
      treated for depression at a psychiatric outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A randomized controlled trial. Participants will be 1:1 randomized into either an&#xD;
      recovery-group or a control-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants allocated to the recovery-group will make daily self-monitoring&#xD;
      about their physical, mental and social health in an app for one week in total each month. At&#xD;
      the end of these weekly periods a health investigator will phone the patients to provide&#xD;
      feedback. Additional calls are allowed when needed. Patients allocated to the control-group&#xD;
      will follow their usual treatment at their general practitioner and/or private practice&#xD;
      psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be an intersectoral collaboration between 1) Mental Health Centre Copenhagen&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet, Intensive Affective Outpatient Clinic 2) Centre for Research and Education in&#xD;
      General Practice, University of Copenhagen 2) Centre for Social Medicine at Frederiksberg&#xD;
      Hospital, 3) Competence Centre for Rehabilitation and Recovery, Mental Health Centre&#xD;
      Ballerup, and 5) Private Practicing Psychiatrists.&#xD;
