  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the clinical effects of treatment of knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      using adipose tissue mesenchymal stromal cells obtained by an enzymatic method with the&#xD;
      outcomes of the therapy with the mechanically fragmented adipose tissue. Identification and&#xD;
      functional analysis of the regenerative capacity of MSCs derived from the adipose tissue&#xD;
      depending on three variables (body weight, sex and age) will help to develop a targeted&#xD;
      therapy for different groups of patients and will determine the effectiveness of both methods&#xD;
      of treatment. An attempt was made to identify the groups of patients with the greatest&#xD;
      regeneration potential of the adipose tissue, and thus indicate those with the most probable&#xD;
      improvement of the joint condition.&#xD;

      Based on the calculation of the sample size using power analysis of the test, investigators&#xD;
      plan to include 100 adults with primary knee osteoarthritis in this study. The patients will&#xD;
      undergo lipoaspiration under sterile conditions of the operating theatre, the collected&#xD;
      lipoaspirates will be further processed - enzymatically with the use of collagenase or&#xD;
      mechanically using the Lipogems system. After collection, lipoaspirates will be immediately&#xD;
      transferred to the laboratory of the Department of Regenerative Medicine with a tissue and&#xD;
      cells bank in Warsaw, and the preparations will be administered to the patients' knee joints&#xD;
      in the operating room under ultrasound control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Lipogems system is defined as a minimal tissue manipulation system. In contrast, the&#xD;
      administration of preparations produced using an enzymatic method requires advanced actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipoaspiration will be performed using blind cannulas and vacuum syringes introduced through&#xD;
      the abdominal wall with a three-millimetre incision on the skin after previous injection to&#xD;
      the adipose tissue with modified Klein's solution (500 ml of saline solution, 1 ml of&#xD;
      adrenaline, 40 ml of 2% lignocaine), which makes the collection easier. 10 ml of the&#xD;
      collected adipose tissue will be used to examine the samples after previous gradient drainage&#xD;
      from Klein's solution. Immediately after collection, the samples will be sent to the&#xD;
      laboratory for analysis (cell count testing, culture, phenotype identification, analysis by&#xD;
      flow cytometry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be monitored in the hospital outpatient clinic for one year after the&#xD;
      procedure; the control visits will take place: after 2 and 6 weeks, then after 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      and after a year. A physical examination and the assessment using the KOOS questionnaire will&#xD;
      be performed. Before the procedure and after one year, an X-ray and MRI with T-2 Mapping will&#xD;
      be carried out in order to evaluate the condition of the cartilage.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1,3,6 and 12 months after procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS is self-administered and assesses five outcomes: pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and recreation function, and knee-related quality of life.The KOOS's five patient-relevant dimensions are scored separately: Pain (nine items); Symptoms (seven items); ADL Function (17 items); Sport and Recreation Function (five items); Quality of Life (four items). A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No problems) to 4 (Extreme problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included.&#xD;
Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopaedic scales and generic measures. Scores between 0 and 100 represent the percentage of total possible score achieved.</description>
