  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RSC-101 is a Phase 1a/1b clinical trial of RSC-1255 in adult study participants with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumor malignancies who are intolerant of existing therapies known to provide clinical&#xD;
      benefit, have disease that has progressed after standard therapy, or have previously failed&#xD;
      other therapies. The study has two phases. The purpose of Phase 1a (Dose Escalation) is to&#xD;
      confirm the appropriate treatment dose and Phase 1b (Dose Expansion) is to characterize the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of RSC-1255.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RSC-1255 is an orally bioavailable, small-molecule direct pan-mutant and wild-type RAS&#xD;
      inhibitor. RSC-101 is a Phase 1a/1b, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, Dose&#xD;
      Escalation and Dose Expansion study in participants with advanced solid tumor malignancies.&#xD;
      Study enrollment is approximately 134 participants. All participants receive oral RSC-1255,&#xD;
      twice daily as monotherapy. Following Phase 1a (Dose Escalation) to identify the Maximum&#xD;
      Tolerated Dose and Recommended Dose for use in Phase 1b, additional participants are enrolled&#xD;
      in the Phase 1b (Dose Expansion) to further characterize the safety, pharmacology, and the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of RSC-1255.&#xD;
