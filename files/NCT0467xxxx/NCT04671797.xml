  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the acute impact of eating an &quot;early&quot; versus &quot;late&quot; dinner. &quot;Early&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;late&quot; will be customized to individuals based on the individuals' own circadian rhythms.&#xD;
      Healthy adults will have the adults' circadian rhythm assessed by measuring the adults' dim&#xD;
      light melatonin onset (DLMO). Based on the timing of DLMO, participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      eating dinner before DLMO or after DLMO. The investigators will also compare the effects of&#xD;
      delaying sleep relative to dinner time. Participants will eat meals in the laboratory and&#xD;
      have serial plasma samples collected to examine profiles of free fatty acids, glucose,&#xD;
      insulin, triglycerides, and oxidation of dietary fat.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a worldwide health problem. Recent studies suggest that the timing of meals may be&#xD;
      critically important for weight control and cardiovascular health. Consuming calories later&#xD;
      in the day is associated with greater risks of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Interventional diet studies also show more effective weight loss with&#xD;
      early, rather than later eating. The investigators conducted a randomized crossover study&#xD;
      comparing the metabolic effect of a &quot;routine&quot; dinner (RD,18:00) with that of an isocaloric&#xD;
      &quot;late&quot; dinner (LD, 22:00) in 20 healthy volunteers. The investigators recently published&#xD;
      results of this study, which the investigators now refer to as &quot;Dinner Time 1&quot;. Relative to&#xD;
      RD, LD increased post-dinner glucose peak by ~18% and lowered palmitate oxidation by ~10%.&#xD;
      However, it is still unclear whether LD-induced impaired metabolic dysfunction is caused by&#xD;
      eating at the &quot;wrong&quot; time relative to the body's central circadian clock, or it is caused by&#xD;
      eating too close to bedtime, when sleep reduces metabolic demands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this question, the investigators are now enlarging the scope of the present study,&#xD;
      which the investigators now refer to as &quot;Dinner Time 2&quot;. In Dinner Time 2, the investigators&#xD;
      will examine the impacts of early dinner, late dinner, and the impact of delaying sleep after&#xD;
      late dinner. The investigators will compare (1) the impact of early dinner time with later&#xD;
      dinner time relative to DLMO with a routine sleep time; and (2) the impact of routine bedtime&#xD;
      with late bedtime with a fixed late dinner time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will examine the nocturnal and next-morning metabolic profile in a 3-arm&#xD;
      randomized crossover study of healthy volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Early Dinner (dinner at DLMO-3, sleep at DLMO+2) Arm 2: Late Dinner (dinner at DLMO+1,&#xD;
      sleep at DLMO+2) Arm 3: Late Dinner/Late Sleep (dinner at DLMO+1, sleep at DLMO+6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use serial blood sampling to assess the metabolic response to meals,&#xD;
      and use an ingested stable isotope [(2H31)palmitate] tracer to calculate the oxidation of&#xD;
      dietary lipid eaten at the different times.&#xD;
