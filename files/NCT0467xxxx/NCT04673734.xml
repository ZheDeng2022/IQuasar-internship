      This study is to assess the variation in the measurements of myelin sensitive MRI techniques&#xD;
      in both white and grey matter in the brain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnetization Transfer Imaging (MTI) permits the assessment of the integrity of&#xD;
      macromolecules in brain tissue, such as myelin and cellular/axonal membrane components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-echo Susceptibility-Based imaging (SBI) provides quantitative susceptibility maps and&#xD;
      T2* maps that - when combined - permit the disentanglement of myelin from iron and various&#xD;
      phases of myelin degradation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myelin Water Imaging (MWI) quantifies the water trapped between myelin layers by separating&#xD;
      the multiple water components in T2 relaxometry data. In fact, the presence of myelin on&#xD;
      water pools bound to it provokes a loss in magnetic resonance (MR)-signal coherence, which is&#xD;
      more rapid than the one characterizing the water pools located within the axons or in the&#xD;
      cytoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A method based on a spiral acquisition that achieves a myelin-specific signal in clinically&#xD;
      compatible scan times is currently applied: T1 relaxometry (quantitative T1, qT1) - which&#xD;
      measures the time that a perturbed nuclear spin distribution needs to get back to equilibrium&#xD;
      in the longitudinal plane- is sensitive to a number of components of the brain tissue such as&#xD;
      myelin, axonal diameter and the overall architectural organization of the brain tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, multi-shell diffusion allows the application of mathematical models of diffusion&#xD;
      compartments, which in part are influenced by myelin integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to assess the stability of these techniques in scan-rescan&#xD;
      experiment on 20 healthy subjects.&#xD;

    <description>Acquisition of 3 myelin sensitive MRI scans as follows: 1. Two MRI during 1 day; the second after 30 min interval and a repositioning.&#xD;
2. One MRI within one week after the first one.&#xD;
The total scan time will be ~ 1 hour. T1 maps will be calculated after magnetization-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echoes (MP2RAGE6) acquisition based on a product sequence. Magnetization Transfer (MT) sat maps will be calculated. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) maps will be reconstructed using an in-house implementation of the structural feature based collaborative reconstruction algorithm (SFCR). For the reconstruction of multi-shell diffusion data, AMICO10 Accelerated Microstructure Imaging via Convex Optimization (AMICO) from diffusion MRI data will be used. Myelin Water Fraction maps will be fitted voxel-wise using a Non-Negative Least Squares fitting.</description>
