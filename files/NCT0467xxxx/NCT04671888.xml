  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present feasibility study aims at assessing whether the EMG of respiratory muscles can&#xD;
      serve as an objective marker of dyspnea in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims also at evaluating the changes in physiological parameters (i.e., EMG,&#xD;
      respiration rate, heart rate, temperature, and SpO2) occurring when simulating daily&#xD;
      activities before, during and after acute exacerbations. All this information can be useful&#xD;
      to detect the exacerbations earlier or to provide better treatment during the exacerbations.&#xD;
