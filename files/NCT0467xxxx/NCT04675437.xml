  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research project is to examine the impact of aerobic exercise on markers of&#xD;
      frailty in patients (of 65 years or older) suffering from heart failure (HF) or after&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or mini aortic valve replacement procedures&#xD;
      (mini-AVR).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is defined as a progressive age-related decline in physiological systems that results&#xD;
      in decreased reserves of intrinsic capacity, which confers extreme vulnerability to&#xD;
      stressors. Based on previous research, there are indications that frailty is highly prevalent&#xD;
      in HF, CABG and mini-AVR patients. As a consequence, these patients (both men and women of 65&#xD;
      years or older) will be included in this research project. The 12-week aerobic exercise&#xD;
      program (3 sessions per week) will consist of ergometer, treadmill and arm-ergometer&#xD;
      exercises. The intensity will be based on the maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) of&#xD;
      the patient and will correspond with a heart rate between the first and second ventilatory&#xD;
      threshold (with a gradual progression over time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary, correlations will be examined between markers of the CPET and frailty markers.&#xD;
