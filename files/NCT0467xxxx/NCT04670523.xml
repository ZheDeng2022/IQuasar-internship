  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safe conditions for early chest tube removal have been progressively questioned and&#xD;
      redefined around reliable digital air flow criteria and extension of liquid threshold&#xD;
      accepted. Nevertheless, in current practice, the chest tube remains in restricting early&#xD;
      mobilization and optimal compliance with ERAS programme, during the first crucial 24 h after&#xD;
      surgery. Thus, to go further, the investigators decide to assess in this study the safety of&#xD;
      POD 0 chest tube removal after minor thoracic operations in patients in health condition&#xD;
      tolerating operation and anesthesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chest tube management is a key element of postoperative care after thoracic surgeries for&#xD;
      different indications. During the last decade, minimally invasive surgery and enhanced&#xD;
      recovery after surgery (ERAS) programmes have radically changed the equation of recovery,&#xD;
      contributing to reduce postoperative morbidity and enhance quality of life, but the chest&#xD;
      tube remains its Achilles heel, still providing postoperative pain and impairing pulmonary&#xD;
      function. In this view, early chest tube removal has been widely promoted not only for its&#xD;
      economic benefits on length of stay but also for improving quality of life and potentially&#xD;
      reducing postoperative complications. In parallel, the change from traditional chest drainage&#xD;
      devices to electronic devices has also enabled a more accurate air leak measurement with&#xD;
      reduction of interobserver variability, decreased chest drainage duration and shortened LOS.&#xD;
      The safe conditions for early chest tube removal have been progressively questioned and&#xD;
      redefined around reliable digital air flow criteria and extension of liquid threshold&#xD;
      accepted. Nevertheless, in current practice, the chest tube remains in restricting early&#xD;
      mobilization and optimal compliance with ERAS programme, during the first crucial 24 h after&#xD;
      surgery. Thus, to go further, the investigators decide to assess in this study the safety of&#xD;

      tolerating operation and anesthesia.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Prospective randomization of patients after minor thoracic operations into two different groups. The patients of the study group are getting their chest tube removed according to our current airleak protocol (Flow &lt;20 mL/ min on digital suction device) but already in the operating room after wound closure. If airleak is persisting than chest tube removal will be performed according to the traditional protocol not earlier than on postoperative day 1. In the control group, the chest tube gets removed according to the investigators' traditional standard protocol not earlier than on postoperative day.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Chest tube removal is a standard bedside intervention after lung resections. Its time point is normally defined according a traditional standard airleak threshold. Traditionally, in our department this threshold will be respected not earlier than 1 day after the operation. The patients of the study group are getting their chest tube removed according to our current airleak protocol (Flow &lt;20 mL/ min on digital suction device) but already in the operating room after wound closure (POD 0). If airleak is persisting than chest tube removal will be performed according to the traditional protocol not earlier than on postoperative day 1 (POD 1).</description>
