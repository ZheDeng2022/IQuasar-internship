  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 5% of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) patients may have or develop contraindications to use&#xD;
      oral anticoagulation (OAC). Randomized controlled trial (RCT) data suggest that Left Atrial&#xD;
      Appendage Occlusion (LAAO) may provide a non-inferior alternative for cardioembolic stroke&#xD;
      protection in patients tolerant to OAC. However, RCT data for LAAO is lacking in patients&#xD;
      with contra-indications to OAC using antiplatelet (APT) or no therapy as usual care. The&#xD;
      hypothesis underlying this trial is to demonstrate that LAAO is superior to usual care for&#xD;
      the prevention of stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke risk for non-valvular AF is estimated with the CHA2DS2-VASc score. When patients have&#xD;
      no risk factors, no anticoagulation is recommended with a Class III, loe B. With 1 risk&#xD;
      factor in men and 2 in women, anticoagulation should be considered (class IIA, loe-B). When&#xD;
      the CHA2DS2-VASc score is 2 or greater in men (3 or greater in women) anticoagulation is&#xD;
      recommended in all with a Class I, loe-A, preferably with a NOAC (class I, loe-A). Platelet&#xD;
      inhibitor monotherapy is prohibited with a Class III, loe-A. Patients that have or develop a&#xD;
      long-term contra-indication for oral anticoagulation have no class I guideline accepted&#xD;
      alternative. Instead it is recommended to modify conditions or interrupt anticoagulants&#xD;
      (Class IIB, loe-B). Resumption of oral anticoagulants should be guided by a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      team that weighs the risks and benefits of such a course of action (class IIA, loe-C). In&#xD;
      patients after an intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), it is recommended to initiate or resume&#xD;
      anticoagulation after 2-4 weeks (class IIA, loeC) choosing an agent with low intracranial&#xD;
      bleeding risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is insufficient data to support the choice of anticoagulant and no evidence at all for&#xD;
      avoiding stroke prevention altogether, which has led to wide variations in restarting oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation often after several months of abstinence. Over 60% does not even resume&#xD;
      therapy after anticoagulation-associated ICH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the LAA is the dominant source for cardioembolic stroke, mechanical percutaneous&#xD;
      endocardial occlusion procedures have been developed. The WATCHMAN and AMULET (both FDA- and&#xD;
      CE approval) are the most used but others are emerging. Basically, a cardiac catheterization&#xD;
      is performed from the Femoral Vein, passing a 14F catheter through the Inferior Caval Vein&#xD;
      and the interatrial septum to the left atrium. The delivery system is then positioned in the&#xD;
      LAA ostium, and the device is deployed blocking the entrance and eliminating the LAA from the&#xD;
      circulation. The implant procedure is usually guided by trans-esophageal echo imaging to&#xD;
      assess device size and determine optimal position before it can be released. Adequate closure&#xD;
      is achieved in 99% of patients nowadays, with a low and manageable procedural risk of 2.5%.&#xD;
      To avoid device-related thrombus during reendothelialization patients are treated with dual&#xD;
      antithrombotic agents, aspirin and clopidogrel in the first 3 months, which is narrowed down&#xD;
      to aspirin until 1 year after which time it may be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5-year follow up of PROTECT-AF and PREVAIL showed that LAAO was non-inferior to vitamin K&#xD;
      antagonist (VKA) for the primary endpoint of stroke/ TIA/systemic embolism/death (HR 0.82,&#xD;
      p-value 0.3), while VKA-patients had significantly more major bleeding events after the&#xD;
      implant (HR 0.48, p=0.0003). WATCHMAN LAAO is CE and FDA approved and worldwide almost&#xD;
      100.000 WATCHMAN implantations have now been performed. Currently no RCT outcome data are&#xD;
      available comparing WATCHMAN LAAO to any type of NOAC. For AMULET and other LAAO devices&#xD;
      there are no published RCT compared to either VKA or NOAC. The EWOLUTION all-comers registry&#xD;
      data in over 1000 AF pts (73% unable to use (N)OAC, CHA2DS2-VASc 4.7) WATCHMAN LAAO showed&#xD;
      stroke and bleeding rates 80% and 46% lower than expected compared to historical data. In 2&#xD;
      similar AMPLATZER-AMULET LAAO registries of &gt;1000 AF patients, stroke and bleeding rates were&#xD;
      50-60% lower. Both in the 2020 ESC and the 2019 AHA/ACC guidelines, LAAO has received a Class&#xD;
      IIb, loe-B recommendation for stroke prevention in patients with AF that have non-reversible&#xD;
      contra-indications for long-term anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COMPARE-LAAO trial studies the effectiveness and safety of LAAO as an alternative means&#xD;
      for stroke prevention, to establish whether outcomes in The Netherlands are comparable to&#xD;
      literature. In the setting of a randomized controlled trial, LAA will be compared to usual&#xD;
      care of anti-platelet therapy or nothing based on individual physician's assessment.&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness will be studied by comparing the additional cost of the procedure to cost&#xD;
      of usual care, and the differences in cost between both arms for complications due to stroke&#xD;
      and other embolism.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Documented non-valvular AF (paroxysmal or non-paroxysmal) and&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or more and&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Unsuitable for long-term use of oral anticoagulation as determined by the referring&#xD;
             physician team as well as the multidisciplinary team in the study hospital and&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Suitable for dual APT for at least 3 months and single APT from 3 until at most 12&#xD;
             months and&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At least 18 years of age, and willing and able to provide informed consent and adhere&#xD;
             to study rules and regulations and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        The decision of suitability for LAAO should be made by a multidisciplinary team consisting&#xD;
        of at least an echocardiographist, an implanting cardiologist, and a cardiac surgeon. The&#xD;
        decision of unsuitability for oral anticoagulation by the referring and implanting centers&#xD;
        will be clearly and extensively documented in the study charts. This should include the&#xD;
        support of physicians other than the referring and implanting cardiologist. These&#xD;
        physicians should be specialists in the field where the contra-indication arises such as&#xD;
        neurology, gastro-enterology, internal medicine, urology, or other specialties. In many&#xD;
        cases the contra-indication may be due to (repeated) major bleeding.Bleeding will be&#xD;
        classified according to the BARC criteria as major with a score of 3 or more. The risk of&#xD;
        recurrent bleeding should be established by a multidisciplinary team, as well as the&#xD;
        decision that the risk of bleeding recurrence outweighs the benefit of restarting oral&#xD;
        anticoagulation, which will be documented in the charts. Alternative reasons not to use&#xD;
        anticoagulation should be major and irreversible. These may be highly variable and may&#xD;
        include but are not limited to occupational or life-style hazards, drug side-effects,&#xD;
        ineffectiveness, intolerance, renal or liver failure, falling hazards, vascular problems,&#xD;
        cerebral amyloid deposition, and coagulation disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any invasive cardiac procedure within 30 days prior to randomization and 90 days after&#xD;
             LAAO that would interfere with the study follow-up and medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Unsuitable LAA anatomy for closure or thrombus in the LAA at the time of procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Contraindications or unfavourable conditions to perform cardiac catheterization or TEE&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Atrial septal malformations, atrial septal defect or a high-risk patient foramen ovale&#xD;
             that may cause thrombo-embolic events&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Atrial septal defect repair or closure device or a patent foramen ovale repair or any&#xD;
             other anatomical condition as this may preclude an LAAO procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. LVEF&lt;31% and/or heart failure NYHA 3-4&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Mitral valve regurgitation grade 3 or more&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Mitral stenosis as this makes AF by definition valvular in nature&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Aortic valve stenosis (AVA&lt;1.0 cm2 or Pmax&gt;50 mmHg) or regurgitation grade 3 or more&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Planned cardiac surgery for any reason within 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Stroke within the 3 months prior to inclusion, if not yet clinically stable, and/or&#xD;
             without adequate diagnostic or prognostic evaluation, and/or in need of other&#xD;
             interventions NL75209.100.20 COMPARE-LAAO Study protocol version 1.4 September 2020&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Planned CEA for significant carotid artery disease&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Major bleeding (BARC criteria&gt;type 2) within 1 month prior to inclusion or longer if&#xD;
             it has not been resolved yet&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Compelling medical reason to use VKA or NOAC (e.g. mechanical heart valve, pulmonary&#xD;
             embolism, ventricular aneurysm)&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Major contraindications for using aspirin or clopidogrel&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. (planned) pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Participation in any other clinical trial that interferes with the current study&#xD;
