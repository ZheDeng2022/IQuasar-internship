  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify if healthy cookies high in linoleic acid can change&#xD;
      sleep quality and sleep architecture, blood fatty acid composition and be consumed with high&#xD;
      compliance after eight weeks of consumption. The hypothesis is that consumption of healthy&#xD;
      cookies for 8 weeks will improve sleep quality, increase linoleic acid in the blood and be&#xD;
      consumed with greater than 80% compliance.&#xD;

      Overall, linoleic acid has many health benefits including altering body composition and&#xD;
      energy metabolism, but is not clear if linoleic acid consumption can influence sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to test the central hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective of&#xD;
      this research by pursuing the following specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1) To determine the effect of healthy cookies made with linoleic acid-rich oil on&#xD;
      measures of sleep quality and sleep architecture in overweight adults&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2) To determine the effect on plasma fatty acid composition and markers of circadian&#xD;
      rhythm in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after four and eight weeks of consuming&#xD;
      one healthy cookie per day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3) To measure the effect of healthy cookies made with LA-oil on change of lipidomic&#xD;
      profiles of plasma and PBMC after four and eight weeks of consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4) To determine the feasibility of adherence to consuming 1 healthy cookie per day in&#xD;
      place of snack for eight weeks&#xD;
