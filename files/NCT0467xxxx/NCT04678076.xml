  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single dose, open-label, randomised, two period, two-way cross-over, two stage&#xD;
      bioequivalenve study with the aim to investigate the bioequivalence between a new formulation&#xD;
      of ketoprofen 25 mg versus OKI 80 mg granules for oral solution (half sachet), after single&#xD;
      dose administration in two consecutive periods to healthy voluteers under fed conditions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present bioequivalence phase I study has been designed to compare the bioavailability and&#xD;
      the concentration-time profile of the new immediate release oral gel formulation of&#xD;
      ketoprofen 25 mg with a marketed reference of ketoprofen lysine salt (KLS) as granules for&#xD;
      oral solution (80 mg bipartite sachet, half sachet containing 40 mg of KLS, corresponding to&#xD;
      25 mg as ketoprofen), when administered in fed conditions to healthy male and female&#xD;
      subjects. The study has been designed under fed conditions since the leaflet of the&#xD;
      reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-stage design has been selected for the present study considering the margin of&#xD;
      uncertainty existing over the sample size estimate in order to accomplish the primary study&#xD;
      objectives in terms of ketoprofen rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC0-t) of absorption of the two&#xD;
      formulations.&#xD;
