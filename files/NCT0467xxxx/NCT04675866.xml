      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of Camrelizumab combined&#xD;
      with paclitaxel (albumin binding type) and S-1 for first-line treatment of advanced gastric&#xD;
      cancer, and to further explore the curative effect of PD - L1 expression in tumor tissue, EBV&#xD;
      virus content, microsatellite instability (MSI), DNA mismatch repair (MMR), tumor mutation&#xD;
      load (TMB), lymphocyte subgroup and cytokines.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is a common malignant tumor of digestive tract.The incidence of gastric cancer&#xD;
      in China accounts for about half of the world's total, the incidence rate ranks second, and&#xD;
      the mortality rate ranks second.Moreover, the proportion of early gastric cancer in China is&#xD;
      very low, only about 20%. Most of them are in advanced stage at the time of discovery. The&#xD;
      overall 5-year survival rate is less than 15%, which seriously threatens the health and life&#xD;
      of Chinese people.For nearly 90% of HER2 negative patients with advanced gastric and&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (g / GEJ), the current first-line treatment option&#xD;
      is chemotherapy, and the efficacy of available drugs is very limited.The ORR of the&#xD;
      first-line chemotherapy is about 40%, and the OS is about 10 months. New therapeutic drugs&#xD;
      are urgently needed to improve the efficacy of advanced G/GEJ.The purpose of this study was&#xD;
      to investigate the safety and efficacy of Camrelizumab combined with paclitaxel (albumin&#xD;
      binding type) and S-1 for first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer.&#xD;
