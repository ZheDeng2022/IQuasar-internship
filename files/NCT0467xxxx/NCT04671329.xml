  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, if a radiologist finds a suspicious lesion seen only on a diagnostic Contrast&#xD;
      Enhanced Digital Mammography (CEDM) exam requiring biopsy the biopsy procedure would likely&#xD;
      be performed with MRI guidance because there are currently limited solutions to biopsy with&#xD;
      CEDM guidance. Affirm Contrast Biopsy will provide an additional solution to biopsy/localize&#xD;
      lesions found by using a CEDM imaging modality.&#xD;

    <description>Contrast Enhanced Digital Mammography (CEDM) is an extension of the existing indication for diagnostic mammography with the Selenia Dimensions system and 3Dimensions system. Biopsy targeting can be done on captured contrast enhanced images (scout and stereo pair). The CEDM application shall enable contrast enhanced breast imaging using a dual energy technique. This imaging technique can be used as an adjunct following mammography and/or ultrasound exams to localize a known or suspected lesion. Affirm Contrast Biopsy is intended for patients recommended for biopsy who have had a suspicious finding on previous contrast enhanced imaging or have lesions that may be occult under other modalities.</description>
