  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute viral bronchiolitis is the leading cause of pediatric intensive care admission.&#xD;
      The first-line recommended ventilation support is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP),&#xD;
      which reduces the work of breathing (WOB) and improves gas exchange. Although Non invasive&#xD;
      Positive Pressure Ventilation (NiPPV) is increasingly used in case of CPAP failure to avoid&#xD;
      intubation, no study has yet evaluated if this support could effectively reduce the effort of&#xD;
      breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that NiPPV could reduce WOB more effectively than CPAP alone, and might&#xD;
      lead to reduce intubation in the most severe bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare WOB between CPAP and NiPPV, thanks to esophageal&#xD;
      pressure measurement, in infants hospitalized for severe acute bronchiolitis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Severe acute viral bronchiolitis is the leading cause of pediatric intensive care admission.&#xD;
      The first-line recommended ventilation support is non invasive ventilation (NIV) with&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which has been proved to reduce the work of&#xD;
      breathing (WOB) and improve gas exchange. Non invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NiPPV)&#xD;
      is increasingly used in case of CPAP failure to avoid intubation. Nevertheless, no study has&#xD;
      ever evaluated its effectiveness on the discharge of respiratory muscles in severe&#xD;
      bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of esophageal and gastric pressures with an esogastric catheter allows an&#xD;
      estimation of WOB thanks to the calculation of the esophageal pressure-time product (PTPes),&#xD;
      and a calculation of the transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) as the difference between gastric&#xD;
      and esophageal pressures. This minimally invasive technique can be used at the bedside to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of ventilation support and is now increasingly used in Intensive Care&#xD;
      Units to assist ventilation-targeted strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that NiPPV could reduce WOB more effectively than CPAP alone, and might&#xD;
      lead to reduce intubation in the most severe bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to compare PTPes/min between CPAP and NiPPV in infants&#xD;
      hospitalized for severe acute bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are i) to compare other parameters of WOB, gas exchanges and breathing&#xD;
      pattern in both ventilator supports ii) to compare the rate of patient-ventilator&#xD;
      asynchronies in 2 different setting of NiPPV (&quot;clinical&quot; and &quot;physiological&quot;) iii) to assess&#xD;
      if NiPPV is associated with reduced intubation rate, time under sedation and ventilation, and&#xD;
      length of hospitalization as compared to CPAP.&#xD;

For each period, the first serie of measurements will be carried out without modifying the settings of the support ( &quot;clinical&quot; setting), and the second one using esogastric pressures by adjusting the settings of the ventilation support in order to obtain an optimal normalization or reduction of the amplitude of the Pes and Pdi deltas (&quot;physiological&quot; setting). 5 minutes of spontaneous breathing with/without oxygen between period 1 and 2 (depending on the patient's conditions). All measurements will be performed for 5 minutes after a 15 minutes quiet breathing. After measurements, the optimal respiratory support will be continued.</description>
