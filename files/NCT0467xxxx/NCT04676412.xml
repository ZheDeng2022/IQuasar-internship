  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475)&#xD;
      combined with lenvatinib (MK-7902/E7080) compared to pembrolizumab alone (with placebo for&#xD;
      lenvatinib) in treatment-naïve adults with no prior systemic therapy for their metastatic&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)&#xD;
      Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) greater than or equal to 1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study hypotheses are that: 1) the combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib is&#xD;
      superior to pembrolizumab alone as assessed by Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1); and 2) the combination of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and lenvatinib is superior to pembrolizumab alone as assessed by Overall&#xD;
      Survival (OS).&#xD;

      The main study will have a duration of approximately 5 years and the extension period will&#xD;
      have a duration of approximately 1 year. The base study and the China extension to&#xD;
      MK-7902-007 (NCT03829332) will enroll a total of approximately 120 Chinese participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With Amendment 6 (effective date: 15-Sep-2021), active participants, investigator, and&#xD;
      sponsor personnel or delegate(s) involved in the treatment administration or clinical&#xD;
      evaluation of the participants will be unblinded. Participants will discontinue lenvatinib&#xD;
      and placebo, and participants who remain on treatment will receive open-label pembrolizumab&#xD;
      only.&#xD;
