  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BT200 is a PEGylated aptamer that binds to the A1 domain of human von Willebrand factor&#xD;
      (VWF). At low doses, BT200 blocks the clearance of VWF antigen (VWF Ag) from the circulation&#xD;
      and causes an increase in concentrations of both VWF Ag and Factor VIII (FVIII), but has&#xD;
      negligible effect on the activity of either. At higher doses, BT200 blocks clearance of VWF&#xD;
      and also inhibits its activity, but still does not inhibit FVIII activity. Therefore, low&#xD;
      dose BT200 could potentially be used to correct deficiency of VWF and/or FVIII in patients&#xD;
      with hereditary bleeding disorders. This study is designed as a &quot;basket design&quot; pilot study&#xD;
      to determine the relevant dose and pharmacological activity of BT200 in such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this open basket study up to 25 patients with the following congenital blood-clotting&#xD;
      disorders are to be included: Patients with hemophilia A, heterozygous carriers of hemophilia&#xD;
      A with subnormal FVIII levels; patients with von Willebrand syndrome (VWD) type 1, &quot;Vicenza&#xD;
      type&quot;, and with VWD type 2b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive BT200 subcutaneously on day 0, day 4 and day 7 in the first week&#xD;
      and then once a week for a total of five weeks - initially in a dose of 3 mg, then in week 3&#xD;
      individually after response in a dose of 3 to 9 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, blood samples are taken once a week for a further three weeks (wash-out phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be enrolled in an additional pharmacokinetics sub-study. For this purpose,&#xD;
      approximately three blood samples are taken to estimate the half-life of substituted FVIII&#xD;
      under the influence of BT200.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to obtain clinical proof of mechanism for BT200 in one&#xD;
      or more hereditary bleeding disorders.&#xD;
