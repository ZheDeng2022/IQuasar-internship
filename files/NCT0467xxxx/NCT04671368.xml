    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, self-controlled, diagnostic accuracy comparative study&#xD;
      of Artificial Intelligence Diagnostic System for Surgical Neuropathology. The investigators&#xD;
      will compare the diagnostic efficiency of Artificial Intelligence with that of practicing&#xD;
      pathologists, and suppose that the diagnostic efficiency of artificial intelligence in&#xD;
      prospective clinical data is no less than that of pathologists.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 141 patients will be recruited. After being enrolled, the patients will accept&#xD;
      surgery and specimens for pathological analysis will be taken according to the routine&#xD;
      treatment process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The histopathologic slides will then be digitized by a whole-slide scanner. The images will&#xD;
      be reviewed by gold standard committee for evaluation of ground truth. And then be separately&#xD;
      diagnosed by Artificial Intelligence Diagnostic System and practicing pathologists. So the&#xD;
      investigators can compare the diagnostic efficiency of Artificial Intelligence with that of&#xD;
      pathologists, thus understand the gap between artificial intelligence and actual clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

    <description>Firstly, the two expert pathologist(&gt;=10 years of experience) will review the H＆E stained slide of each patient on their own (with additional informations such as: Immunohistochemistry et al.) and then report the classification of the tumor on a 10-type scale.If they report the same opinion, that opinion will perform as the ground truth; while if their opinion clash with each other, the expert pathologist(&gt;=15 years of experience) will get involved and the agreement of three experts will perform as the ground truth</description>

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
