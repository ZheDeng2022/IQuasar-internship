  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dose-related safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacological effects (PD) of CORT125329 after single and&#xD;
      multiple ascending oral doses of CORT125329 lipid capsule formulations in healthy&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-part, single-center study of single and multiple ascending doses of CORT125329 in&#xD;
      healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled assessment of single ascending&#xD;
      doses (SAD) of CORT125329 lipid capsule formulations. Participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      sequentially into 1 of up to 8 cohorts, each containing 8 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will be double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled assessments of multiple oral&#xD;
      ascending doses (MAD) of CORT125329 lipid capsule formulations. Participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      sequentially into 1 of up to 4 cohorts, each containing 8 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional Part 3 will be an open-label, 2-way fixed sequence cross-over study and will serve&#xD;
      as proof of PD (glucocorticoid receptor modulation) for CORT125329 lipid capsule&#xD;
      formulations. Participants will be enrolled in a single cohort of 10 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, routine safety tests will be performed. In selected parts of the study,&#xD;
      assessments of PK (CORT125329), changes in serum cortisol and plasma adrenocorticotrophic&#xD;
      hormone (ACTH), and changes in hematological and bone biomarkers will be measured.&#xD;
