  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative changes in the hip joint, which are indications for operative treatment, are&#xD;
      observed in more than 30% over the age of 50. In most cases, the development of a&#xD;
      degenerative process in the hip joint is accompanied by changes in the sacroiliac joint. To&#xD;
      improve the quality of life, relieve pain, improve the clinical outcomes of rehabilitation&#xD;
      after total hip arthroplasty (THA), an integrated approach to treatment is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a technique for intraoperative manual correction of the&#xD;
      ileosacral displacement of the sacroiliac joint during THA. This clinical study compares the&#xD;
      use of this technique during THA and THA by standard method.&#xD;

    <description>The Harris Hip Score (HSS). The HHS is a measure of disfunction so the higher the score, the better the outcome for the individual. Results can be recorded and calculated online. The maximum score possible is 100. Results can be interpreted with the following: &lt;70 = poor result; 70-80 = fair, 80-90 = good, and 90-100 = excellent.</description>
