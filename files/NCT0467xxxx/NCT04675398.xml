  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center phase I clinical study aiming to improve gait functions in patients&#xD;
      with Parkinson's disease (PD) by using adaptive neurostimulation to the pallidum. The&#xD;
      investigators will use a bidirectional deep brain stimulation device with sensing and&#xD;
      stimulation capabilities to 1) decode the physiological signatures of gait and gait&#xD;
      adaptation by recording neural activities from the motor cortical areas and the globus&#xD;
      pallidus during natural walking and a gait adaptation task, and 2) develop an adaptive deep&#xD;
      brain stimulation (DBS) paradigm to selectively stimulate the pallidum during different&#xD;
      phases of the gait cycle and measure improvements in gait parameters. This is the first&#xD;
      exploration of network dynamics of gait in PD using chronically implanted cortical and&#xD;
      subcortical electrodes. In addition to providing insights into a fundamental process, the&#xD;
      proposed therapy will deliver personalized neurostimulation based on individual physiological&#xD;
      biomarkers to enhance locomotor skills in patients with PD. Ten patients with idiopathic&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease undergoing evaluation for DBS implantation will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      single treatment arm study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will allow the investigators to evaluate the efficacy of an adaptive stimulation&#xD;
      paradigm in deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat motor-related behaviours and motor skill&#xD;
      learning in Parkinson's disease (PD). Parkinson's disease patients will be implanted&#xD;
      unilaterally or bilaterally with a totally internalized bidirectional neural interface,&#xD;
      Medtronic Summit RC+S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While current DBS therapy improves motor symptoms of PD, it does not address problems with&#xD;
      acquiring additional motor skills (i.e. adapting gait patterns to avoid falls)) in PD,&#xD;
      therefore, limiting benefits of physical rehabilitation programs aimed at improving mobility.&#xD;
      Motor skill learning is critical in acquiring any new behaviors related to motor function.&#xD;
      The overall objective is to identify personalized electrophysiological signatures of motor&#xD;
      skill learning in PD patients and use adaptive control algorithms to enhance these&#xD;
      signatures. The study will discover new ways to rehabilitate the disease brain circuits using&#xD;
      adaptive neuromodulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a small, double-blinded trial, ten patients with idiopathic PD and motor fluctuations will&#xD;
      be implanted with unilateral or bilateral RC+S devices, each connected to a standard&#xD;
      quadripolar DBS lead implanted in the basal ganglia, along with a 4-contact paddle type&#xD;
      electrode placed subdurally over the motor cortex. The investigators will compare the overall&#xD;
      efficacy of closed-loop and open-loop paradigms in terms of behavioral performance&#xD;
      improvements in validated motor skill learning tasks and measurements from wearable devices.&#xD;
      During this chronic adaptive DBS phase, adaptive DBS and open-loop stimulation settings will&#xD;
      be randomized for 30-day periods and motor skill and gait related measurements will be&#xD;
      obtained from a combination of computerized motor tasks and wearable devices that track&#xD;
      movement kinematics. Patients will participate in daily, if possible, motor learning and gait&#xD;
      tasks at home with triggered stimulation settings and recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to successfully develop a prototype adaptive DBS algorithm based on&#xD;
      cortical and / or basal ganglia LFPs (local field potentials). The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that an adaptive paradigm will provide improvements in motor skilled learning compared to the&#xD;
      conventional, open-loop paradigm, in which stimulation parameters remain constant until&#xD;
      changed by the patient or clinician using an external programmer.&#xD;
