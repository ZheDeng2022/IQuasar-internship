  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of evidence on the impact of switching from a combined preserved&#xD;
      anti-glaucoma regimen to a preservative-free (PF) one, while employing sufficiently robust&#xD;
      OSD metrics. The investigators have therefore carried out a single center, prospective,&#xD;
      crossover investigation to compare the 6-month effect of switching well controlled open-angle&#xD;
      glaucoma patients with at least moderate glaucoma therapy-related ocular surface disease from&#xD;
      preserved to triple preservative-free therapy with and without cyclosporine 0.1% dosed in the&#xD;
      evening.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Halting and reversing glaucoma therapy-related ocular surface disease (GTR-OSD) will improve&#xD;
      the success of long-term medical therapy, impacting millions of patients worldwide. Chronic&#xD;
      medical therapy for glaucoma may be immensely benefitted by limiting disabling GTR-OSD, which&#xD;
      would aid in the prevention of blindness. In 2015 a novel cationic formulation of&#xD;
      cyclosporine A 0.1% was approved with once in the evening dosing in Europe. It is an&#xD;
      effective, targeted immunomodulatory compound reducing inflammatory mediators and providing&#xD;
      healing of the ocular epithelium. There remains however a paucity of published controlled&#xD;
      evidence for GTR-OSD patients treated with this formulation. In addition, there is a lack of&#xD;
      evidence on the impact of switching from a combined preserved anti-glaucoma regimen, to a&#xD;
      preservative-free one, while employing sufficiently robust OSD metrics. The investigators&#xD;
      have therefore carried out a single center prospective, crossover investigation to compare&#xD;
      the 6-month effect of switching well controlled open-angle glaucoma patients with at least&#xD;
      moderate GTR-OSD, from preserved to triple PF therapy with and without PF cyclosporine 0.1%&#xD;
      dosed in the evening.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Masked, prospective, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of glaucoma patients with moderate to severe GTR-OSD on preserved latanoprost and dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination therapy for well-controlled open-angle glaucoma was conducted. Patients were randomized to receive preservative-free tafluprost and dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination with either topical placebo or cyclosporine 0.1% for 6 months and will then be crossed over to the opposite therapy. Oxford score of staining will be the primary outcome; osmolarity, matrix-metalloproteinase-9 testing (MMP-9), meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), adverse events and diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) comprise the secondary outcomes.</intervention_model_description>
