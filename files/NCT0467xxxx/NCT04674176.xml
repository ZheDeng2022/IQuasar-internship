  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The epidemic of overweight and obese patients presents a major challenge in chronic disease&#xD;
      prevention and overall health across the world. Since the beginning of this century, it is&#xD;
      considered the third most important hazard attributable to burden of disease with&#xD;
      approximately 350 million obese people (BMI ≥30.0) and over 1 billion overweight people (BMI&#xD;
      ≥ 25) in the world. Mechanistic studies have indicated that the microbiota influences energy&#xD;
      utilization from the diet and influences host genes that regulate energy expenditure and&#xD;
      storage. Thus, it is proposed that alterations in gut microbiota may play a significant role&#xD;
      in weight loss potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to expand on this idea by evaluating whether the incorporation of Rifaximin&#xD;
      in an intermittent fasting (IF) diet plays a significant role in weight loss. Rifaximin is a&#xD;
      nonsystemic antibiotic that works primarily in the gut to inhibit bacterial growth. It&#xD;
      portrays unique eubiotic properties that induces a positive modulation of gut microbiota,&#xD;
      favoring the growth of bacteria beneficial to the host without altering overall composition.&#xD;
      Thus we propose an agent such as rifaximin would be essential in developing a positively&#xD;
      altered gut microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on studies evaluating Rifaximin's role in positive gut modification, we propose that&#xD;
      this can play a critical role in weight loss. Rifaximin may be associated with weight loss as&#xD;
      it exerts effects that increases the concentration of bacteria more prominent in lean&#xD;
      individuals. The choice of incorporating an intermittent fasting (IF) diet, stems from its&#xD;
      success in prior studies. By incorporating periods of voluntary abstinence from food and&#xD;
      drink, an IF diet has shown short term weight loss among overweight and obese people. We&#xD;
      propose that an IF diet with an antibiotic, like Rifaximin, will create more positive&#xD;
      alteration in gut microbiota that creates a greater potential for weight loss overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of subjects with BMI's ranging from 30-35 will be randomly selected and assigned to&#xD;
      an experimental and control group. Each subject will be given clear instructions on how to&#xD;
      follow a 14:10 intermittent fasting diet, in which they will fast for 14 hours and be able to&#xD;
      eat for 10 hours a day. Patients in the experiment group will additionally receive a&#xD;
      short-term low dosage of Rifaximin at the start of their diet. Patients will be evaluated&#xD;
      with weekly weigh-ins and basic blood work performed at the start and at the completion of&#xD;
      the study. The current hypothesis does not incorporate microbiome evaluation due to cost of&#xD;
      the kits and limited funding available for the study.&#xD;

      The epidemic of overweight and obese patients presents a major challenge in chronic disease&#xD;
      prevention and overall health across the world. Since the beginning of this century, it is&#xD;
      considered the third most important hazard attributable to burden of disease with&#xD;
      approximately 350 million obese people (BMI ≥30.0) and over 1 billion overweight people (BMI&#xD;
      ≥ 25) in the world (Mehrabani, 2018). Although there is a myriad of reasons for obesity,&#xD;
      numerous studies have proposed that the intestinal microbiome plays an intrinsic role in&#xD;
      overall health and obesity risk. Mechanistic studies have indicated that the microbiota&#xD;
      influences energy utilization from the diet and influences host genes that regulate energy&#xD;
      expenditure and storage (Davis, 2016). Thus, it is proposed that alterations in gut&#xD;
      microbiota may play a significant role in weight loss potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to expand on this idea by evaluating whether the incorporation of Rifaximin&#xD;
      in an intermittent fasting (IF) diet plays a significant role in weight loss. Rifaximin is a&#xD;
      nonsystemic antibiotic that works primarily in the gut to inhibit bacterial growth. It&#xD;
      portrays unique eubiotic properties that induces a positive modulation of gut microbiota,&#xD;
      favoring the growth of bacteria beneficial to the host without altering overall composition&#xD;
      (Ponziani et al.,2017). In addition to its bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects, rifaximin&#xD;
      downregulates the inflammatory response triggered by the gut microbes through inhibition of&#xD;
      nuclear factor (NF)-kB via the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and reduces the expression of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1B and tumor necrosis factor alpha. These characteristics are&#xD;
      unique to rifaximin in comparison to other antibiotics, prebiotics and probiotics (such as&#xD;
      yogurt). These effects of rifaximin play a crucial role in gut modulation by altering&#xD;
      bacterial virulence through inhibition of adhesion, internalization and translocation to&#xD;
      modify bacterial metabolism (Ponziani et al.,2017). Probiotic agents such as yogurt function&#xD;
      to increase bacterial groups (such as Bacteriodes Lactobacilli and Bifdobacteria) and there&#xD;
      is no proven effect on gut modulation specifically. Thus we propose an agent such as&#xD;
      rifaximin would be essential in developing a positively altered gut microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One meta-analysis investigating the associated symptoms of Rifaxamin when treating hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy found weight loss to be one its side effects. (Eltawil et al.,2012). It is&#xD;
      currently unknown whether the potential weight loss is a beneficial result of the drug or&#xD;
      secondary to its side effects. However, based on studies evaluating Rifaximin's role in&#xD;
      positive gut modification, we propose that this can play a critical role in weight loss. The&#xD;
      human body is a host to vast number of microbes intrinsically linked with overall health,&#xD;
      including obesity risk. Studies investigating the relationship between obesity and microbiota&#xD;
      found that a low fecal bacterial diversity is associated with more marked overall adiposity,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, and impaired glucose homeostasis with higher low-grade inflammation.&#xD;
      Additionally, the intestines are dominated by two divisions of bacteria: Bacteriodes and&#xD;
      Firmictus. Within the study, obese individuals had more Firmicutes bacteria and nearly 90%&#xD;
      less Bacteriodes than the lean individuals (Davis, 2016). This supports the reason in which&#xD;
      Rifaximin may be associated with weight loss as it exerts effects that increases the&#xD;
      concentration of Bifidobacteria and Bacteriodes species (Ponziani et al.,2017). By altering&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines, Rifaximin also plays a crucial role in improving glucose homeostasis&#xD;
      and gut inflammation. Finally, one study investigating weight loss capabilities of rifaximin&#xD;
      found that patients had lost a mean of 4.5 lbs in the rifaximin group compared to the control&#xD;
      loss of 0.7lbs over a 4 month follow up (Vizuete, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of incorporating an intermittent fasting (IF) diet, stems from its success in&#xD;
      prior studies. By incorporating periods of voluntary abstinence from food and drink, an IF&#xD;
      diet has shown short term weight loss among overweight and obese people (Ganesan et al,2018).&#xD;
      Currently, there are no specific studies evaluating the effects rifaximin has in an IF diet.&#xD;
      However, a meta-analysis investigating fasting diets found an alteration of gut microbiota&#xD;
      that induced a white adipose tissue to brown adipose tissue transition - which is a&#xD;
      beneficial reaction (Li et al, 2020). Additionally, one study investigating microbiome&#xD;
      changes specific to a fasting diet found that there was a significantly increased abundance&#xD;
      of Bacteriodes fragilis and Akkermansia muciniphila species (Ozkul et al, 2019). As there are&#xD;
      already studies investigating the impact of rifaximin and fasting diet effects individually&#xD;
      on weight loss, we propose that an IF diet with an antibiotic, like Rifaximin, will create&#xD;
      more positive alteration in gut microbiota that creates a greater potential for weight loss&#xD;
      overall. Although rifaximin does have some associated side effects, it is important to note&#xD;
      that among numerous studies using Rifaximin, patients who had experienced nausea/anorexia&#xD;
      claimed it was mild and did not withdraw from the studies (Ying et al., 2020 and Furnari&#xD;
      2019). Overall, this study aims to objectively determine if the use of Rifaximin with an&#xD;
      intermittent fasting diet will improve overall weight loss results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of subjects with BMI's ranging from 30-35 will be randomly selected and assigned to&#xD;
      an experimental and control group. Each subject will be given clear instructions on how to&#xD;
      follow a 14:10 intermittent fasting diet, in which they will fast for 14 hours and be able to&#xD;
      eat for 10 hours a day. Patients in the experiment group will additionally receive a&#xD;
      short-term low dosage of Rifaximin at the start of their diet. Patients will be evaluated&#xD;
      with weekly weigh-ins and basic blood work performed at the start and at the completion of&#xD;
      the study. It is important to note, that although we have proposed a change in gut microflora&#xD;
      the study will focus on evaluating weight loss results and will later be followed up with&#xD;
      another study that evaluates changes in gut microflora through microbiome testing kits. The&#xD;
      current hypothesis does not incorporate microbiome evaluation due to cost of the kits and&#xD;
      limited funding available for the study.&#xD;
