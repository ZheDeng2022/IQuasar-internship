      Background: Hemorrhoidal disease is extremely frequent in the adult population and, as a&#xD;
      benign pathology, the treatment should be guided by the patient's symptoms. Treatment of&#xD;
      hemorrhoidal disease includes a conservative approach, office-based treatments and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of the treatment of&#xD;
      hemorrhoidal disease with non-surgical office-based method polidocanol foam sclerotherapy&#xD;
      (SP) and the surgical technique doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation with recto-anal&#xD;
      repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Prospective, unicentric study including patients with symptomatic hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      disease grade II and III refractory to conservative therapy, submitted either to SP (n=24) or&#xD;
      to HAL-RAR procedure (n=21), during a recruitment period of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were evaluated for efficacy (Sodergren's scale of symptoms and severity of bleeding)&#xD;
      and safety (complications and implication in personal and professional life), up to one month&#xD;
      after treatment. In follow-up period (6 months) participants were evaluated for hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      disease recurrence.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumental office-based procedures are usually indicated for internal hemorrhoidal disease&#xD;
      grade I and II which are refractory to conservative medical treatments and in selected cases&#xD;
      of grade III hemorrhoidal disease. Despite being invasive, these techniques are more&#xD;
      conservative than surgical treatments and are also effective. The primary goals are to&#xD;
      decrease the amount of redundant tissue, reduce vascularity, and affix the hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      cushions to minimize prolapse. Office-based procedures include rubber band ligation (RBL),&#xD;
      sclerotherapy (liquid and foam agents), infrared photocoagulation, cryotherapy,&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemorrhoidal sclerosis is a procedure indicated to treat grade I and II hemorrhoidal disease.&#xD;
      It has also been used in the treatment of internal grade III hemorrhoidal disease, but there&#xD;
      are limited data on its efficacy. Performed through an anoscope and according to Blanchard&#xD;
      technique, internal hemorrhoids are located and injected with a sclerosant material into the&#xD;
      submucosa at the base of the hemorrhoid, above the anterolateral line. The sclerosant&#xD;
      subsequently causes an inflammatory response and fibrosis that interrupts the vascular blood&#xD;
      supply. A variety of sclerosants have been used including ethanolamine, quinine, hypertonic&#xD;
      saline, aluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA), and 5% phenol in oil. Recently, a&#xD;
      new sclerosing agent, polidocanol, started to be employed in the treatment of hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      disease. It is a nonionic detergent and consists of a hydrophilic polyethylene oxide chain&#xD;
      combined with hydrophobic aliphatic dodecyl alcohol. When injected into varicose veins,&#xD;
      polidocanol damages the endothelium of blood vessels, allowing platelets to aggregate.&#xD;
      Eventually, a dense network of platelets, cellular debris, and fibrin occludes the vessel,&#xD;
      which is subsequently replaced with connective fibrous tissue. In addition to the treatment&#xD;
      of hemorrhoidal disease, polidocanol is used for sclerotherapy of varicose veins of the lower&#xD;
      extremities and for the treatment of esophageal varices. The advantages of this sclerosing&#xD;
      agent include a highly satisfactory efficiency, a low necrotic potential, and a good general&#xD;
      tolerance. At the same time, it has a local anesthetic effect which permits almost painless&#xD;
      sclerotherapy. Nevertheless, its use is contraindicated in patients with acute thromboembolic&#xD;
      diseases and in those with allergy to the drug. Polidocanol can be used in its liquid or foam&#xD;
      form. It has been proved the foam formulation allows for greater efficacy, since it requires&#xD;
      lower doses of sclerosant agent. This is because the sclerotic effect is maximized by&#xD;
      increasing the contact surface area with varices walls. This foam is previously prepared&#xD;
      according to the Tessari's method, in which two 10 mL syringes are connected by a 3-way&#xD;
      stopcock. The syringes contain air and a sclerosing agent (3% polydocanol), with a ratio of&#xD;
      4:1, respectively, and twenty passages from one syringe to the other are made in order to&#xD;
      obtain a sclerosing foam. Several studies reported the efficacy of the use of sclerotherapy&#xD;
      with liquid polidocanol in hemorrhoidal disease. Specifically for the treatment of grade I&#xD;
      hemorrhoids, there is one study showing the superiority of polidocanol foam compared to its&#xD;
      liquid formulation. However, there's a lack of research about its use in hemorrhoidal disease&#xD;
      other than grade I. The most common complications of sclerotherapy include minor discomfort&#xD;
      or bleeding. Although it is a very safe treatment option, some serious side effects,&#xD;
      including erectile dysfunction and urinary retention, have been reported. The proper&#xD;
      injection technique of sclerosant is essential to avoid complications such as mucosal&#xD;
      ulceration or necrosis, prostatic abscess and retroperitoneal sepsis. Sclerotherapy is a&#xD;
      valid alternative when conservative therapy has failed. Moreover, this procedure can also be&#xD;
      used for the treatment of patients whose hemorrhage is the main symptom, for patients on&#xD;
      antithrombotic medication, as well as cirrhotic and immunocompromised patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment is reserved for refractory cases to nonsurgical approaches, grade IV or&#xD;
      mixed hemorrhoidal disease (internal and external components), symptomatic hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      disease with concomitant anorectal pathology and lastly if it's the patient's choice.&#xD;
      Although surgical approach is apparently more effective than instrumental treatment, it is&#xD;
      also associated with substantial postsurgical morbidity, particularly postoperative pain and&#xD;
      limitation in day-life activities. Several surgical methods have been described including&#xD;
      open and closed hemorrhoidectomy, doppler guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL) and&#xD;
      hemorrhoidectomy stapler. The choice of each method should consider the grade of hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      disease and the predominant symptoms of the patient, together with the experience of the&#xD;
      center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAL technique involves the use of Doppler ultrasound and a specialized anoscope. The&#xD;
      principles include the use of a Doppler probe to identify the six main feeding arteries&#xD;
      within the anal canal and their ligation with absorbable suture above the dentate line,&#xD;
      therefore associated with less pain. Finally, plication of redundant hemorrhoidal mucosa is&#xD;
      performed (if there is hemorrhoidal or muco-hemorrhoidal prolapse), known as&#xD;
      recto-anal-repair (RAR), mucopexy or hemorrhoidopexy. The aim of this recent surgical&#xD;
      procedure is to treat patients' symptoms without tissue destruction. Early results of HAL&#xD;
      were promising, with lower pain scores than hemorrhoidectomy, and relief of bleeding and&#xD;
      tissue prolapse in over 90% of patients. Since then, several randomized clinical trials have&#xD;
      been performed with mixed results. Currently, HAL remains a viable approach to multicolumn&#xD;
      internal hemorrhoids. However, the short-term benefits regarding postoperative pain have&#xD;
      recently not been as remarkable as in the earlier studies. Also, there has been a progressive&#xD;
      increase in long term recurrence rates, especially for grade III and IV hemorrhoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have been conducted with the purpose of comparing the efficacy of nonsurgical&#xD;
      office-based treatments with surgical ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicentric, open-label, randomized controlled trial, compared RBL and HAL, revealing&#xD;
      higher efficacy of the surgical procedure. If, however, RBL is considered a course of&#xD;
      treatment involving repeat banding, the procedures are equally effective. Besides, HAL was&#xD;
      proved to be more painful than RBL. Another study comparing infrared photocoagulation with&#xD;
      HAL showed that both procedures are minimally invasive and associated with minimal&#xD;
      discomfort, but HAL is more effective than infrared photocoagulation in controlling symptoms&#xD;
      of hemorrhoids. There has been no comparative studies between polidocanol foam sclerotherapy&#xD;
      and hemorrhoidal artery ligation, to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to evaluate and compare the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the treatment of hemorrhoidal disease with polidocanol foam sclerotherapy and&#xD;
      HAL-RAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, unicentric study (Centro Hospitalar Universitário do Porto) which is aimed to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy and safety of the treatment techniques in patients with hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      disease grade II and III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred were randomly allocated to one of the two treatments considered in this&#xD;
      study (SP and HAL-RAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants should have had prior endoscopic study, at least sigmoidoscopy, or total&#xD;
      colonoscopy if they were older than 50 years or younger, with a family history of colorectal&#xD;
      cancer, colon adenomas, or suspected inflammatory bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients who agreed to informed consent were included, after a clear explanation of the&#xD;
      type of study and the intervention that was going to be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In screening visits, demographic and anthropometric data (such as age, sex, weight and&#xD;
      height, education and employment status) were collected, as well as grade of hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      disease. Baseline questionnaires were used to assess Sodergren's scale of symptoms and the&#xD;
      severity of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent and an information brochure, explaining the study and adequate dietary and&#xD;
      behavioral care, were provided. Additionally, all participants were given a direct contact&#xD;
      for any doubts and notification of complications, in which case additional observation should&#xD;
      be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When office-based treatment was performed, an intervention period was considered, in which&#xD;
      patients were observed at 3-week intervals (the required number of sessions, maximum of 3,&#xD;
      depended on the clinical response - if 3 weeks after the previous treatment, the participant&#xD;
      scored zero points in the Sodergren scale and had a hemorrhage grade ≤1, he was not a&#xD;
      candidate for additional instrumental therapy.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment was performed only once. One month after this intervention period,&#xD;
      Sodergren's scale of symptoms and severity of bleeding were reevaluated. In addition,&#xD;
      complications registry, and implication in personal and professional life, measured in number&#xD;
      of work-loss days, if applied, were also assessed. Patients was followed-up every 3 months&#xD;
      for total of 6 months for evaluation of hemorrhoidal disease symptoms recurrence.&#xD;
