  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) consists of supervised exercise training in conjunction with&#xD;
      other secondary prevention interventions. However, CR is not widely used because of distance,&#xD;
      financial resources, work and other time constraints, gender, age, social support, illness&#xD;
      perceptions, and psychiatric problems. Baduanjin is a type of movement-based mind-body&#xD;
      intervention. It is a form of traditional practice designed to promote physical and&#xD;
      psychological health, manage symptoms, and relieve stress during illness. Patients with heart&#xD;
      disease have frequently used it. The impacts of a Baduanjin exercise-based cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation program for patients recovering from CAD under coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
      (CABG) or valve replacement on Meridian Energy Analysis Device (MEAD100, Med- Pex&#xD;
      Enterprises, Taichung, Taiwan) and heart rate variability (HRV) has yet to be assessed. This&#xD;
      trial evaluates whether the Baduanjin exercise would provide effective meridian energy and&#xD;
      HRV in patients following CABG.&#xD;

    <description>The electrical conductance of the acupuncture points of human subject can be measured by a computerized testing instrument with a very low electrical current.Ryodoraku theory has been shown to be a supplementary diagnostic method for selective diseases and a useful parameter for evaluating therapeutic effects of acupuncture. The electrical conductance of an acupoint was measured using a Meridian Energy Analysis Device (MEAD100, Med- Pex Enterprises, Taichung, Taiwan) operating at DC 12V and 0 to 200A. The method and procedure of the MEAD is based on the Ryodoraku theory and is similar to equipment used in previous studies.</description>

    <description>Baduanjin exercise is moderate in intensity and short in duration (a set of Baduanjin takes about 12 minutes). Baduanjin consists of the sitting and standing practicing form. The sitting Baduanjin exercise conforms to the aspects of low-intensity and long-term aerobic activity, which is suitable for the rehabilitation training of patients who are in stable condition during hospitalization. The standing Baduanjin is more suitable for patients with sequential rehabilitation after discharge and can be adjusted based on the patient's condition</description>
