      : An intrahospital CA data recording protocol has been designed following the Utstein model.&#xD;
      Database is hosted according to European legislation regarding patient data protection. It is&#xD;
      drafted in English and Spanish. Invitation to participate has been sent to Spanish, European&#xD;
      and Latinamerican hospitals. Variables included, asses hospital characteristics, the&#xD;
      resuscitation team, patient's demographics and background, CPR, post-resuscitation care,&#xD;
      mortality, survival and long-term evolution. Survival at hospital discharge will be evaluated&#xD;
      as a primary outcome and survival with good neurological status as a secondary outcome,&#xD;
      analyzing the different factors involved in them&#xD;

      Study design: this study is a multicenter, international, prospective observational registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: patients will be enrolled by participating investigators from European and&#xD;
      Latinamerican countries. All sites are susceptible of treating pediatric cardiac arrest&#xD;
      patients. Participating hospitals differ in levels of care but are all able to submit their&#xD;
      data to the study's database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient elegibility: Inclusion criteria: all children aged 1 month to 18 years who suffer a&#xD;
      CA in hospital. For the study, CA is defined as the absence of vital signs requiring at least&#xD;
      one minute of chest compressions. Subsequent episodes of CA may be included for the same&#xD;
      individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Patients being treated with extracorporeal circulatory support (ECMO or&#xD;
      ventricular assistance) at the time of CA. Patients who suffer a cardiac arrest and require&#xD;
      ECMO for ROSC, after performing conventional CPR, will not be excluded. Duration of the data&#xD;
      collection period 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Study candidates will be identified by a study physician, who will explain the&#xD;
      study to parents or guardians. Written informed consent will be obtained from parents or&#xD;
      guardians prior to inclusion in the study. A CONSORT (Consolidated Standard of Reporting&#xD;
      Trials) flow diagram is shown in Figure 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: data will be collected, verified, and uploaded to a protected electronic&#xD;
      web-based database (Xolomon) by their designated site coordinators/investigators under the&#xD;
      oversight of their IRB. Database has been designed following the Utstein model (19). Database&#xD;
      is hosted according to European legislation regarding patient data protection. It is drafted&#xD;
      in English and Spanish.&#xD;
