  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed investigation is an experimental trial among 80 adults with obesity and&#xD;
      internalized weight bias to determine preliminary effects of a smartphone-delivered brief&#xD;
      self-compassion mindfulness intervention on internalized weight bias, compared to wait list&#xD;
      control. All participants will receive a 4-week mindfulness-based intervention via&#xD;
      smartphone. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: (1) the&#xD;
      intervention group, a self-compassion mindfulness practice tailored for weight and body&#xD;
      concerns, or (2) a wait list control group, who will receive access to the intervention&#xD;
      content following completion of end-of-treatment assessments. All intervention content will&#xD;
      be delivered via text message.&#xD;

      The proposed investigation is an experimental trial among 80 adults with obesity and&#xD;
      internalized weight bias to determine preliminary effects of a smartphone-delivered brief&#xD;
      self-compassion mindfulness intervention on internalized weight bias, compared to wait list&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive a 4-week mindfulness-based intervention via smartphone.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: (1) the intervention&#xD;
      group, a self-compassion mindfulness practice tailored for weight and body concerns, or (2) a&#xD;
      wait list control group, who will receive access to the intervention content following&#xD;
      completion of end-of-treatment assessments. All intervention content will be delivered via&#xD;
      text message using Duke REDCap with Twilio integration. The intervention group will also&#xD;
      complete psychoeducation on internalized weight bias and self-compassion. We will measure a&#xD;
      number of potential moderating and mediating constructs, such as depression, trauma history,&#xD;
      etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Components:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guided Mindfulness Practice: Participants in the intervention group will receive&#xD;
      compassion-based guided meditation audio recordings made publicly available by Kristin Neff&#xD;
      at www.selfcompassion.org and Tara Brach at www.tarabrach.com. Many of these audio files were&#xD;
      used in a previous investigation of self-compassion and body image (Albertson et al., 2015)&#xD;
      and were selected due to their unique ability to target compassion and body concerns&#xD;
      simultaneously. Daily mindfulness practice will require about 4-20 minutes per day to&#xD;
      complete (days 2-28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychoeducation: Participants in the intervention group will receive psychoeducation&#xD;
      delivered via study website over days 1-6 (see Table 2). They will receive a new lesson via&#xD;
      text message on each of these days, each covering a different topic related to the&#xD;
      intervention. The purpose of the psychoeducation phase is to orient users to their upcoming&#xD;
      experience, provide education about internalized weight bias, the chronic stress system, the&#xD;
      utility of self-compassion practice to regulate physiological and psychological targets, and&#xD;
      guidance on establishing, maintaining, and generalizing a mindfulness practice. Engagement in&#xD;
      psychoeducation materials will take approximately 20-30 minutes per day (days 1-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily prompts: Participants will receive a text message every morning indicating their task&#xD;
      for that day. Tasks include: review psychoeducation provided, or practice mindfulness today.&#xD;
      Prompts will be brief and will require a minute or two to read. Assigned activity varies by&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly prompts: Participants will receive a text message at the end of every week (Days 7,&#xD;
      14, 21, and 28) with a link to a brief adherence survey. This will measure how many days they&#xD;
      practiced that week. The brief adherence survey will take approximately 5 minutes to&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
