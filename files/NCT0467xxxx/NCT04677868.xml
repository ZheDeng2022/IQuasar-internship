  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to identify the efficacy and safety of methotrexate (MTX) combined&#xD;
      corticosteroid treatment for acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) after allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allo-HSCT is an effective treatment of malignant hematopoietic diseases. However, aGVHD&#xD;
      remains a major complication after allo-HSCT and the destruction of recipient tissues by&#xD;
      alloantigen-activated T cells is a key event in the development of aGVHD. Corticosteroid is&#xD;
      the standard first-line therapy for aGVHD due to their roles in suppressing T cell responses.&#xD;
      However, the response rate of corticosteroid was approximate 50%, and the clinical outcomes&#xD;
      of patients with corticosteroid refractory GVHD were poor. Thus far, no combination therapy&#xD;
      had been prove to be superior to corticosteroid alone as initial therapy for aGVHD. The study&#xD;
      hypothesis: MTX combined corticosteroid treatment could help to further ameliorate the&#xD;
      activity of T cells and control aGVHD.&#xD;
