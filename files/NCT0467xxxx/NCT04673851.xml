      A clinical trial investigating the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a moderated&#xD;
      online social media platform with therapeutic content, Horyzons, as a part of care received&#xD;
      at first-episode psychosis (FEP) clinics across North Carolina. Clients between the ages of&#xD;
      18 and 35 who are enrolled at one of the 4 FEP clinics in North Carolina will be considered&#xD;
      for enrollment in the trial. Participants will have access to the platform for 3 months. All&#xD;
      interventions and assessments will be completed virtually/remotely due to the global&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Our primary objective is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      implementing Horyzons as a part of care received at first-episode psychosis clinics across&#xD;
      North Carolina. Our primary aim is to understand how to implement a novel treatment approach&#xD;
      as part of routine clinical practice with guidance, assistance, and feedback from service&#xD;
      providers (e.g., clinicians, peer support specialists) embedded within the clinic. Our second&#xD;
      aim is to assess the extent to which clients engage with the platform (i.e., site usage&#xD;
      information) and their thoughts and opinions of Horyzons (i.e., feedback and suggestions).&#xD;
      Our third aim is to assess change in psychological measures across the three month study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 individuals with first episode psychosis (FEP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 clinicians and/or peer support specialists from the FEP clinics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): FEP participants will be recruited over a 16-week period at their&#xD;
      respective first episode clinic. Site usage information as well as feedback about their&#xD;
      experience will be collected from participants through the Horyzons platform. Site usage&#xD;
      information (e.g., number of posts/comments made on the site, the number and types of&#xD;
      'Journeys' or 'Tracks' (therapeutic content) completed by participants, etc.) will be&#xD;
      collected automatically through the Horyzons platform. This trial will last three months.&#xD;
      Before being given access to Horyzons, a research assistant, peer support specialist, or&#xD;
      clinician will provide instructions and guidance for using the site (i.e., Horyzons&#xD;
      induction). Feedback will be collected from participants at the end of the three-month&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Service providers (i.e., clinicians and/or peer support specialists) will be asked to provide&#xD;
      feedback about their perceptions of their clients' responses to engaging in Horyzons for the&#xD;
      3-month period. Clinicians and peer support specialists will also be asked about their&#xD;
      experience integrating the psychosocial intervention in the clinic. Items will include&#xD;
      challenges to clinic-wide implementation as well as their feedback to overcome/reduce the&#xD;
      impact of these barriers if Horyzons were to be provided as part of routine clinical care in&#xD;
      the future. Clinicians and peer support specialists will be interviewed in 1-2 focus groups&#xD;
      (depending on schedule and availability) for which these individuals will be compensated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As Horyzons involves therapeutic content and is designed to improve psychological outcomes&#xD;
      such as loneliness and social support, this service is considered part of the clinical care&#xD;
      provided to individuals by their respective FEP clinic. As such, participants will not be&#xD;
      compensated for their involvement in the platform. Site usage information will be collected&#xD;
      automatically through the Horyzons site. However, clients will be compensated for providing&#xD;
      feedback about their experience with Horyzons as well as for completing the assessment&#xD;
      portion of the study onboarding process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, Horyzons will be monitored daily (two hours per weekday and one hour per weekend&#xD;
      day) by trained peer support specialists, master's level clinicians, and/or graduate students&#xD;
      in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at UNC. The principal investigator, David&#xD;
      Penn, will lead weekly supervision calls to ensure appropriate care and support of clients&#xD;
      involved in this project, to discuss case conceptualization and suggestions for engaging&#xD;
      clients in the platform, as well as to monitor any potential safety concerns. All&#xD;
      clinically-relevant information will be shared with the first episode clinicians involved in&#xD;
      participants' mental health care.&#xD;
