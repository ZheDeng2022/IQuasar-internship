    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to prevent postpartum smoking relapse by breastfeeding&#xD;
      promotion. The intervention group (N=30) will receive multicomponent breastfeeding&#xD;
      intervention from late pregnancy to 6 months postpartum, while the attention placebo control&#xD;
      group (N=30) will receive general infant care counseling and support. The key outcome is the&#xD;
      rate of postpartum smoking relapse.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose the first randomized controlled trial to reduce postpartum smoking&#xD;
      relapse by breastfeeding promotion from late pregnancy to 6 months postpartum. The&#xD;
      investigators will enroll 60 pregnant women who successfully quit smoking within 3 months&#xD;
      before or during this pregnancy (&lt;28 weeks). All participants will receive breastfeeding&#xD;
      education during late pregnancy. Right after delivery, participants who are still smoking&#xD;
      abstinent will be randomized into either the breastfeeding intervention group (N=30) or the&#xD;
      attention placebo control group (N=30). The intervention group will receive multicomponent&#xD;
      interventions consisting of postnatal lactation counseling, family/peer/employer support,&#xD;
      contingent financial incentives, and early limited formula milk via syringe (optional for&#xD;
      at-risk infants). The control group will receive counseling and support focusing on general&#xD;
      infant care with attention and compensation similar to the intervention group. The primary&#xD;
      outcomes are rates of postpartum smoking relapse verified by urine cotinine test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 is to examine the efficacy of breastfeeding promotion intervention on&#xD;
      postpartum smoking relapse. Specific Aim 2 is to collect preliminary data regarding potential&#xD;
      mediating mechanisms: increases in lactation hormones (plasma oxytocin and prolactin),&#xD;
      reductions in stress and negative affect, and enhancing mother-infant bonding and maternal&#xD;
      motivation to protect the infant from secondhand smoke exposure. This innovative and feasible&#xD;
      pilot study can yield promising preliminary data to strongly support our future application&#xD;
      of a NIH R01 grant proposal that has the potential to reduce smoking-related harms to both&#xD;
      the mother and the infant, and maximize the protective effects of breastfeeding on infant&#xD;
      health and development.&#xD;

    <description>Postpartum mothers will report their current feeding method, frequency, and duration of breastfeeding and/or formula use. Breastfeeding status will be visually verified by a female research staff, looking for one of the following indicators of successful breastfeeding in the infant - audible swallowing, a regular suck/swallow/breath pattern, or visible milk in the infant's mouth after they are not latched anymore.</description>
