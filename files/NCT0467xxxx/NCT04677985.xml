  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Both health professionals and consumers use menthol-based topical analgesics&#xD;
      extensively for the temporary relief of pain from musculoskeletal ailments or injury.&#xD;
      However, there are no reports of differences in the pain pressure threshold (PPT) or the&#xD;
      relative effectiveness of topical analgesics to reduce pain in the upper and lower body&#xD;
      muscles and tendons. Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate whether&#xD;
      differences existed in PPT and relative pain attenuation associated with a menthol based&#xD;
      topical analgesic over a variety of upper and lower body muscles and tendons. Design:&#xD;
      Randomized allocation, controlled, intervention study. Method: Sixteen participants (10&#xD;
      females and 6 males), who were tested on their dominant or non-dominant side. The order of&#xD;
      specific muscle / tendon testing was also randomized, which included upper body (middle&#xD;
      deltoid, biceps brachii, and lateral epicondylar tendon) and lower body locations&#xD;
      (quadriceps, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, lumbo-sacral erector spinae muscles, and patellar and&#xD;
      Achilles tendons). PPT was monitored before and 15-minutes following the application of a&#xD;
      menthol based topical analgesic.&#xD;

      Experimental Design Using random allocation (slip of paper chosen from a box by one of the&#xD;
      researchers), participants were either tested on their dominant or non-dominant side. Limb&#xD;
      dominance was determined by the participants' self-report of the preferred hand used for&#xD;
      writing/throwing (upper extremity) and for kicking a ball (lower extremity). Further,&#xD;
      randomization was used to determine which muscle groups would be tested first: upper body&#xD;
      versus lower body, and the order of muscle testing. The tested upper body limb muscles&#xD;
      consisted of the middle deltoid, and biceps brachii. The lower body muscle groups consisted&#xD;
      of the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius. In order to compare sensitivity differences&#xD;
      between muscles and tendons, the patellar tendon, and Achilles tendon were also tested. In&#xD;
      addition, as tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis/epicondylosis) is a common injury [40], the&#xD;
      lateral epicondylar tendon was also evaluated. The lower back was tested using the&#xD;
      lumbo-sacral erector spinae muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-testing consisted of obtaining PPT (without topical analgesic application) using a&#xD;
      handheld algometer (Lafayette Manual Muscle Test System™, Model 01163, Lafayette Instrument&#xD;
      Company, Indiana, USA), from each muscle or tendon. The algometer was a hand-held muscle&#xD;
      tester with a range of 0-300 pounds (136.1 kilograms) that consisted of a padded disc with a&#xD;
      surface area of 1.7 cm2 attached to a microprocessor-control unit that measures peak force&#xD;
      (pounds or kilograms). The unit has a digital readout for peak-applied pressure and provides&#xD;
      a built-in calibration routine that verifies a valid calibration. The pain threshold was&#xD;
      defined as the minimum pressure that induced pain [15]. Participants were instructed to&#xD;
      provide a verbal report as soon as the quality of sensation changed from pressure to pain&#xD;
      [15,16] at which point the algometer was removed. This study chose to measure the PPT via a&#xD;
      pressure algometer as it has been shown to be a clinically and experimentally reliable method&#xD;
      to assess pain [16,23,35]. The middle of the muscle belly for the biceps brachii, middle&#xD;
      deltoid, hamstrings (biceps femoris), quadriceps (rectus femoris), and gastrocnemius was&#xD;
      used. The measurement sites for the patella tendon and lateral epicondylar tendon were 1 cm&#xD;
      distal from the bony origin. For the Achilles tendon, the measurement was taken at one third&#xD;
      of the distance of the tendon length distal to its insertion. There were three readings from&#xD;
      each testing position with a 5-second rest period between each reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The intervention involved the application of 4% menthol-based Biofreeze®&#xD;
      (Performance Health, Akron, Ohio) to the muscles and tendons immediately following the&#xD;
      pre-testing. Based on prior recommendations [22,45,32] varying volumes of the topical&#xD;
      analgesic were applied in reference to the surface area of the muscle. The previously cited&#xD;
      investigators recommended 1ml per 200 cm2 of muscle surface area. No significant force (light&#xD;
      stroking actions to apply the analgesic) was used for the application of the menthol-based&#xD;
      topical analgesic.&#xD;
