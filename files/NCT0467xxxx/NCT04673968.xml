  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most often reported complications of patients with resectable esophageal malignancies are&#xD;
      pulmonary (25~57%), which may cause increased intensive care unit utilization, prolonged&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, increased mortality and medical expense. Also, neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy has a deleterious effect on patients' cardiopulmonary capacity, strength and&#xD;
      muscle mass. Prehabilitation includes preoperative exercise training and nutrition&#xD;
      management. The reporting outcome regarding whether it improves surgical outcomes is&#xD;
      inconsistent. One of the reasons is that pulmonary complication tends to occur in patients&#xD;
      with low cardiopulmonary fitness, but all studies included patients with all level of&#xD;
      fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the chemotherapy interferes with cell division to inhibit tumor growth but is also&#xD;
      harmful to mitochondria functionality. For example, Cisplatin and Paclitaxel, commonly used&#xD;
      in esophageal cancer, alter mitochondria function, caused by disruption of respiratory chain&#xD;
      function and increased production of reactive oxygen species. However, it remains unclear&#xD;
      their negative effects on the oxidative phosphorylation capacity of mitochondria (OXPHOS).&#xD;
      Furthermore, whether prehabilitation reverses this negative effect is scarcely explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be inquired to participate and randomized into prehabilitation or control&#xD;
      group. The latter will undergo conventional therapy only, while the former will receive&#xD;
      additional prehabilitation program. The prehabilitation program encompasses supervised and&#xD;
      home-based aerobic, resistance training (large and inspiratory muscle) and nutrition&#xD;
      management. The supervised exercise training will be performed right before or after the&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Outcome variables are fitness-related testing [the 1st year], quality of life&#xD;
      and surgical outcomes [the 2nd year] and mitochondria functionality (OXPHOS, membrane&#xD;
      potential, matrix oxidant burden) [the 3rd year]. Evaluation is performed 3 times at&#xD;
      baseline, before surgery and 4 weeks after surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has significantly improved patient outcomes. The majority of&#xD;
      patients with resectable esophageal malignancies are considered for neoadjuvant treatment.&#xD;
      However, esophagectomy and chemotherapy have disadvantages. Morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      associated with esophagus resection remain high. The most often reported complications are&#xD;
      pulmonary (25~57%), which may cause increased intensive care unit utilization, prolonged&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, increased mortality and medical expense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has a deleterious effect on patients' cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      capacity, strength and muscle mass. Prehabilitation includes preoperative exercise training&#xD;
      and nutrition management. The reporting outcome regarding whether it improves surgical&#xD;
      outcomes is inconsistent. One of the reasons is that pulmonary complication tends to occur in&#xD;
      patients with low cardiopulmonary fitness, but all studies included patients with all level&#xD;
      of fitness. In the current investigation, only those with low cardiopulmonary fitness will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the chemotherapy interferes with cell division to inhibit tumor growth but is also&#xD;
      harmful to mitochondria functionality. For example, Cisplatin and Paclitaxel, commonly used&#xD;
      in esophageal cancer, alter mitochondria function, caused by disruption of respiratory chain&#xD;
      function and increased production of reactive oxygen species. However, it remains unclear&#xD;
      their negative effects on the oxidative phosphorylation capacity of mitochondria (OXPHOS).&#xD;
      Furthermore, whether prehabilitation reverses this negative effect is scarcely explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a three-year prospective randomized trial. Patients who suffer from locally-advanced&#xD;
      esophageal cancer and will receive neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and operation in Chang Gung&#xD;
      Memorial Hospital at Linkou will be inquired to participate. A total of 160 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited expectedly and randomized into prehabilitation or control group. The latter will&#xD;
      undergo conventional therapy only, while the former will receive additional prehabilitation&#xD;
      program. The prehabilitation program encompasses supervised and home-based aerobic,&#xD;
      resistance training (large and inspiratory muscle) and nutrition management. The supervised&#xD;
      exercise training will be performed right before or after the radiotherapy. Outcome variables&#xD;
      are fitness-related testing (cardiopulmonary exercise testing, 6-minute walk distance,&#xD;
      handgrip, and body composition, maximal inspiratory pressure and muscle oxidative capacity)&#xD;
      [the 1st year], quality of life and surgical outcomes (length of stay in the hospital and&#xD;
      intensive care unit, surgical complication, perioperative pulmonary complications and medical&#xD;
      expense) [the 2nd year] and mitochondria functionality (OXPHOS, membrane potential, matrix&#xD;
      oxidant burden) [the 3rd year]. Evaluation is performed 3 times at baseline, before surgery&#xD;
      and 4 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that prehabilitation increases functional reserve to improve&#xD;
      surgical outcomes [2nd year] in a subpopulation of patients with esophageal cancer who&#xD;
      receive neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy plus having low cardiopulmonary fitness. It also&#xD;
      reverses fitness decline during neoadjuvant chemotherapy [1st year], partly through&#xD;
      amelioration of mitochondria functionality [3rd year]. The goal of the investigation is to&#xD;
      provide an applicable prehabilitation model and establish its efficacy at clinical, tissue&#xD;
      and cellular levels.&#xD;
