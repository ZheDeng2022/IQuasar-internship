  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the potential role of soft tissue thickness in maintaining gingival margin stability,&#xD;
      the existing literature has mainly focused on investigating the effect of different surgical&#xD;
      techniques on recession coverage percentage, without taking into account the changes in&#xD;
      tissue thickness and biotype in the surgical area. Hence, this study aims to compare&#xD;
      threedimensional scans of gingival recessions treated either with CAF+CTG or with CAF+PDCM by&#xD;
      the use of a dedicated superimposition software at different healing timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is to assess the change in mm3 and the distribution pattern of soft&#xD;
      tissue thickening in the surgical area between autologous and heterologous grafts at 1, 3,&#xD;
      and 6 months post-surgery. The secondary outcomes are: the complete root coverage at 6 months&#xD;
      post surgery and Patients' Reported Outcomes (PROMS) measured with oral impact on daily&#xD;
      performances (OIDP questionnaire) and on the evaluation of patients' perception about&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Intraoral 3D scan Study randomization and treatment allocation: A specifically designed&#xD;
           locked computer software program will be used to randomly assign patients to one of two&#xD;
           study groups: the control group of 6 patients treated with CAF+CTG and the test group of&#xD;
           6 patients treated with CAF+PDCM (Fibrogide). The allocation result will be kept in a&#xD;
           locked computer file that will not not accessible to examiners and practitioners. The&#xD;
           operator will be informed about the patient's allocation on the day of the intervention.&#xD;
           Surgical procedures: The control group will be treated with a bilaminar technique where&#xD;
           a coronally advanced flap with vertical incisions (CAF) according to the technique&#xD;
           described by Langer in 1885 is associated to an autologous connective tissue graft. The&#xD;
           graft will be harvested from the palate in the area apical to the gingival margin of the&#xD;
           second molar with an epithelial-connective harvesting technique to obtain a connective&#xD;
           graft of 1 mm in thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the graft will be shaped in order to match height and width of the recipient&#xD;
      site on the recession according to the technique proposed by Zucchelli in 2003. The test&#xD;
      group will receive the same flap design with the same technique, then the porcine derived&#xD;
      xenogeneic graft will be shaped in order to match height and width of the recipient site on&#xD;
      the recession. In particular, the matrix will be reduced in thickness as suggested by the&#xD;
      manufacturer to obtain a standardized thickness of 3 mm. Patients will be instructed to avoid&#xD;
      any mechanical trauma or tooth brushing in the surgical sites for 3 weeks. They will be&#xD;
      instructed to take painkiller medications if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine 1% gel applications will be prescribed three times per day for 2 weeks. Sutures&#xD;
      will be removed after 14 days. Three weeks after surgery, patients will be instructed to&#xD;
      resume gently mechanical tooth cleaning with an extra-soft toothbrush. 3D imaging: Digital&#xD;
      impressions obtained with an intraoral scanner (Carestream CS 3600, Carestream Dental,&#xD;
      Atlanta GA, USA) will be employed to evaluate soft tissue volumetric changes before treatment&#xD;
      (T0), at 1 month (T1) and at 3 months (T2) and 6 months (T3) after surgery. The 6 months&#xD;
      follow-up visit was chosen as the endpoint of this study in consideration of the complete&#xD;
      resorption time of the PDCM as described by the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital 3D images will be converted info STL files. STL is a file format created to describe&#xD;
      only the surface geometry of a three-dimensional object without any representation of color,&#xD;
      texture or other common CAD model attributes. A dedicated software (MeshLab, ISTI-CNR, Rome,&#xD;
      Italy) with a professional digital environment that allows the operator to import, open and&#xD;
      manage STL files will then be employed to analyze the three STL files obtained at different&#xD;
      timepoints (T0, T1, T2, T3) by a blind operator. More specifically, the software will&#xD;
      accurately superimpose the scans by using a minimum of 4 reference points identified by a&#xD;
      collimation process. Then the area of interest (an area of 10 x 10 mm, apical to the CEJ)&#xD;
      will be isolated and the difference in volume (mm3) will be calculated by the software. In&#xD;
      addition, the software will also return an analysis of the thickening distribution pattern in&#xD;
      the area of interest. It is important to emphasise that this protocol for 3D image analysis&#xD;
      has been already validated and succesfully tested in ten pilot cases. (FIG 1,2,3,4) PROMs:&#xD;
      The OIDP is a well validated and frequently used PROM in studies of oral health. It is a&#xD;
      composite measure of the impacts of oral health on the quality of life of people (eating,&#xD;
      speaking, cleaning teeth, going out, relaxing, smiling, major work or role, emotional&#xD;
      stability, social contact). The overall OIDP score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores&#xD;
      indicating worse quality of life. Furthermore, when an oral impact is reported, the patient&#xD;
      is further asked which oral condition was responsible for that impact. In the 7, 14 and 30&#xD;
      days follow-up visits, we will also evaluate patient perception about therapy. More&#xD;
      specifically, the extent of discomfort and/or pain experienced will be evaluated using a&#xD;
      100-mm horizontal visual analog scale (VAS). The anchors for each end of the scales will be&#xD;
      designated as none and extreme. Patients will be also instructed to quantify the analgesic&#xD;
      medication taken. In addition, the extent of discomfort, root hypersensitivity, oedema,&#xD;
      hematoma, high fever, and interference in daily activities during the first posttherapy week&#xD;
      will be evaluated in the same way. Root coverage assessment: The complete root coverage&#xD;
      measured as the residual distance from the gingival margin to the CEJ will be recorded with a&#xD;
      UNC-15 periodontal probe by a calibrated blind examiner at the 6 months follow-up&#xD;
      appointment. Sample size calculation: Since this can be considered as a pilot study (no other&#xD;
      studies in the literature have used this 3D approach to evaluate changes in tissue&#xD;
      thickness), the sample size calculation was based on previous studies' results in this field&#xD;
      and on the investigators' experience. We speculated that 10 patients per group would allow to&#xD;
      collect enough data to power future trials (if needed). A 20% drop-out rate was also&#xD;
      considered, thus leading to a total of twelve patients (6 per group) to be enrolled for the&#xD;
      study. Outcomes and Statistics: The primary outcome of the study is to analyze and measure&#xD;
      the soft tissue thickness modifications in the area of the graft with the three-dimensional&#xD;
      superimposition technique. The measurement will be performed in cubic millimeters and the&#xD;
      distribution will be analyzed with a colorimetric graphic map. The modifications will be&#xD;
      compared between groups and between timepoints with an inter/intra group analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes consider linear measurements and PROMs. In addiction, the&#xD;
      superimposition software will be used to assess the thickness increase at six months. More&#xD;
      specifically, two-dimensional linear measurements will be performed perpendicular to the&#xD;
      alveolar crest along the vertical axis of the tooth from the center of the gingival and will&#xD;
      be repeated each mm for 10 mm in apical direction (Gonzales-martin 2014). The modifications&#xD;
      will be compared between groups and between timepoints with an inter/intra group analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' Reported Outcomes (PROMS) will be measured with oral impact on daily performances&#xD;
      (OIDP questionnaire) and on the evaluation of patients' perception about therapy. Clinical&#xD;
      measurements will be performed by a blind calibrated operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-Test and Factorial Effect Anova Test will be performed in order to statistically analyze&#xD;
      the results in the test and control groups at different timepoints.&#xD;
