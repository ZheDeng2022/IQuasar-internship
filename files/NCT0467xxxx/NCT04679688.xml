    <textblock>
      Evaluation of follicle diameters on human chorionic gonadotrophin(hCG) day and oocyte pick up&#xD;
      (OPU) day of follicles developing after gonadotropin treatment, the relationship between&#xD;
      follicle diameter and maturation in oocytes obtained after OPU and its effect on pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes will be investigated. In order to make it easier to measure and enumerate the&#xD;
      follicle diameters with the help of vaginal ultrasound, patients under 35 years of age with&#xD;
      at most five follicles in any ovary and at least four follicles in both ovaries will be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our study, patients with 5 and 10 follicles exceeding 11 mm will be included in order to&#xD;
      define the follicles whose hCG day is measured more clearly on the day of OPU in patients&#xD;
      with whom we performed controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilisation(IVF).&#xD;
      The localizations and diameters of these follicles in both ovaries will be drawn and the hCG&#xD;
      day will be numbered and their measurements will be indicated. On the day of opu, the marked&#xD;
      and numbered follicles will be measured, noted and aspirated one by one, the collected eggs&#xD;
      will be followed in individually numbered culture dish and it will be evaluated whether they&#xD;
      are mature or not prepared for microinjection. And mature oocytes will be followed in&#xD;
      numbered culture dishes after microinjection. The relationship between hCG and OPU day&#xD;
      follicle diameter will be evaluated by following the follicle diameter and follicle diameters&#xD;
      on the day of egg collection, the relationship between the mature egg, the rate of reaching&#xD;
      the blastocyst stage, the clinical pregnancy and live birth rates&#xD;
&#xD;
      Especially the relationship between mature egg and follicle diameter and the resulting&#xD;
      clinical results may guide clinicians in practice.&#xD;

    <description>Those who apply for IVF treatment and have an antral follicle number of 4-10 will be included in the treatment. The reason for including patients with this number of antral follicles in the study is to determine the follicle locations and to determine each growing follicle separately on the day of hCG and egg collection.</description>
