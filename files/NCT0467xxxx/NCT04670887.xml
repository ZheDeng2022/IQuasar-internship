  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of renal cysts is rising due to increased abdominal imaging. Renal complicated&#xD;
      cysts have been traditionally classified according to the Bosniak classification, which&#xD;
      distinguishes cystic masses by specific features of walls and septa. The categories I and II&#xD;
      are benign and class IIF most probably benign but needs a short radiological follow-up.&#xD;
      Categories III and IV have been traditionally operated due to the increased risk of renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma. However, recently published studies show that approximately 50% of the&#xD;
      operated Bosniak III cystic masses are benign, which means that half of the cases are&#xD;
      overtreated by surgery. It has also been shown that surgical pathology of stable Bosniak IIF&#xD;
      cysts is malignant in less than 1%, while the cysts, which are upgraded to higher Bosniak&#xD;
      classes will show malignant surgical pathology in 85%. So far, there is lack of prospective&#xD;
      data on active surveillance in Bosniak III cystic masses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare active surveillance and surgery in patients with Bosniak&#xD;
      III renal cystic masses. Patients will be randomized in active surveillance or immediate&#xD;
      surgical excision of a cystic mass. In the active surveillance group, patients are followed&#xD;
      according to the study protocol for 10 years and treated with delayed surgery if the cystic&#xD;
      mass upgrades into Bosniak IV/solid, becomes symptomatic or grows over a preclassified&#xD;
      threshold. The primary objective is to compare surgical pathology between patients treated&#xD;
      with immediate surgery versus delayed surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to recent retrospective data, active surveillance of Bosniak III cystic masses is&#xD;
      reasonable and oncologically safe. Therefore a prospective randomized controlled trial is&#xD;
      needed to get high level evidence to support a change in the treatment strategy. The study&#xD;
      may significantly reduce unnecessary operations performed in patients with Bosniak III cystic&#xD;
      masses.&#xD;
