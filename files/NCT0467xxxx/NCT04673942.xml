  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first clinical trial of AdAPT-001 for the treatment of cancer. AdAPT-001 is an&#xD;
      oncolytic virus that is injected directly into the tumor. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      find out the highest dose of AdAPT-001 that is safe and tolerable. This is the first step in&#xD;
      studying whether it can be used to treat others with cancer in the future.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation protocol to determine, first and foremost, the safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and feasibility of intratumoral administration of AdAPT-001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 2 parts. Different groups of patients will participate in each part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 1: Dose Escalation Safety Run-In&#xD;
&#xD;
      During part 1, all participants will be treated with AdAPT-001 as a single injection, one&#xD;
      time. Participants will be assigned to different dose levels to find the highest dose of&#xD;
      AdAPT-001 that is safe and tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 2: Dose Expansion Single-Agent&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in PART 2 will receive injections of AdAPT-001 on Days 1 and 15 of 28-day&#xD;
      cycles. The dose of AdAPT-001 used in Part 2 will be decided by the results from Part 1.&#xD;

             AdAPT-001 dose prior to receiving COVID-19 vaccination (end of 28 Day Follow Up visit&#xD;
             in Part 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Chemotherapy or immunotherapy within 14 days of study treatment. Hormonal therapy&#xD;
             (including tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, and gonadotropin releasing hormone&#xD;
             agonists) is allowed. Concurrent treatment with bisphosphonate and RANK ligand&#xD;
