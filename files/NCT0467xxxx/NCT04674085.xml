    <textblock>
      This retrospective cohort study included 35 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who received&#xD;
      tofacitinib therapy in rheumatology outpatient clinic between June 2015 and December 2019.&#xD;
      Patients who received tofacitinib due to unresponsiveness to ≥2 conventional synthetic&#xD;
      disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and/or ≥1 biological disease-modifying&#xD;
      anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) were retrospectively evaluated. Demographic characteristics of&#xD;
      the patients, the disease activity score-28 for rheumatoid arthritis with erythrocyte&#xD;
      sedimentation rate (DAS 28-4 (ESR)), change in DAS-28, health assessment questionnaire score,&#xD;
      visual analogue scale score, and laboratory parameters such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate&#xD;
      (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) level, hemogram, lipid parameters, and uric acid were&#xD;
      recorded. The data at six months of treatment were compared with baseline data. The effects&#xD;
      related to the treatment as well as the undesired consequences were evaluated.&#xD;
