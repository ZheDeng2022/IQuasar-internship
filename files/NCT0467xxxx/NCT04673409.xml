  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocarditis is an important clinical problem which can can occur as a result of viral&#xD;
      infections and autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Cardiac MRI is an important non-invasive means&#xD;
      of making a diagnosis. However, current MRI techniques have significant limitations. Firstly,&#xD;
      in order to create high-quality pictures, patients are required to hold their breath several&#xD;
      times for multiple lengths of time. They often struggle with this due to underlying&#xD;
      heart/lung problems. This can adversely affect the overall quality and image interpretation.&#xD;
      Secondly, current techniques create 2D images that are potentially underestimating the&#xD;
      presence and severity of any tissue inflammation/ injury. This may result in inappropriate&#xD;
      treatment, particularly for patients with underlying autoimmune systemic disease who require&#xD;
      immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis by MRI rests on detecting tissue injury through T2 and T1-weighted sequences which&#xD;
      detect tissue inflammation and tissue injury. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of novel 3D free-breathing sequences for T2-weighted and fibrosis/ LGE&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with suspected isolated myocarditis (viral/idiopathic) or myocarditis as part of an&#xD;
      autoimmune systemic disease will be recruited to ensure that the novel techniques are tested&#xD;
      in a broad spectrum of patients with inflammatory heart muscle disease.&#xD;

    <description>The CMR diagnosis of myocarditis will be made according to the revised (2018) Lake Louise criteria which mandate an increase in T2 (signal intensity in arbitrary units or absolute values in ms) and a T1-based marker (either absolute T1 in ms or LGE). T2-times and LGE from the novel 3D sequences will be combined as per revised Lake Louise criteria recommendations to make a diagnosis and compared with the conventional clinical sequences. A clinical diagnosis of cardiovascular inflammation will be made by an expert consensus adjudication panel initially based on evaluation of the patient's history and examination findings; ECG; the results of laboratory testing; and ancillary imaging findings. To avoid incorporation bias, the initial assessment will be blinded to tissue characterisation findings, and the classification will be compared between new and old methods using ROC analysis and the DeLong test.</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The accuracy (bias) and precision (95% limits of agreement) of the novel 3D quantitative T2-mapping sequence will be assessed with the conventional 2D-values as a reference comparator using the methods of Bland and Altman. This will be used to derive the bias in measured T2 times in ms and the corresponding 95% limits of agreement (in ms).</description>
