  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication, and the incidence rate is about 25% in&#xD;
      non cardiac surgery. Previous studies have reported that the total incidence of neurological&#xD;
      pod ranged from 10% to 22%. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is an a-2 adrenergic agonist for sedation.&#xD;
      This kind of drug has little effect on respiratory function, is easy to wake up and has&#xD;
      analgesic effect. It is a commonly used perioperative adjuvant drug. However, for&#xD;
      neurosurgical patients with brain tumors, the role of DEX in POD is not clear. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study was to investigate the effect of DEX on POD in neurosurgical brain tumor surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Postoperative delirium is assessed by the combination of the Richmond Anxiety Scale (RASS) and the Confusion assessment method for intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) or the 3-minute diagnostic interview for CAM (3D-CAM) as applicable.&#xD;
Delirium consists of four main characteristics: acute onset of a change in mental status or a fluctuating level of consciousness, inattention, disorganized thinking and an altered level of consciousness. The patient was diagnosed as delirious if both the first and second features were present, and either the third or fourth was present.&#xD;
In the ICU, the delirium assessment was performed in two steps. The arousal level was first assessed by RASS. If the patient was not responsive to verbal stimuli (i.e. RASS score ≤-4), the remaining delirium assessment was aborted, and the patient was recorded as comatose. When the RASS score was greater than or equal to 3, delirium was evaluated using the CAM-ICU. Patients in general ward were evaluated by 3D-CAM.</description>
