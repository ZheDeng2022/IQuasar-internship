  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research project is to quantify the uncertainty of current state-of-the art&#xD;
      anatomical phantoms and computational models for predicting neurostimulation induced by&#xD;
      time-varying magnetic fields (so-called gradient fields) within the context of magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. For this purpose stimulation thresholds will be measured in&#xD;
      a volunteer study. The measurements will provide valuable data for the development and&#xD;
      validation of future models.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study does not investigate any health related interventions, neither a therapy nor&#xD;
      medical device. The study aims to provoke peripheral nerve stimulation from time varying&#xD;
      magnetic (so-called &quot;gradient&quot;) fields in volunteers in order to measure gradient threshold&#xD;
      levels in different configurations (different gradient coil units, different positions and&#xD;
      postures). The experiments will provide new data regarding the interaction of gradient fields&#xD;
      and function of the peripheral nervous system. These measurements are of general interest to&#xD;
      quantify associated modeling uncertainties and validate current or future computational&#xD;
      modeling techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiments will use an MR scanner to generate the gradient fields used to induce&#xD;
      stimulation. In normal mode the maximum gradient field allowed by the manufacturer may lead&#xD;
      to peripheral nerve stimulation in approximately 50% of subjects. However, depending on the&#xD;
      position and posture it may induce PNS in even fewer than 50% of subjects. Therefore, for the&#xD;
      purpose of measuring stimulation thresholds it is necessary to operate the gradient units in&#xD;
      experimental mode (with respect to the gradient field) as described in IEC 60601-2-33, i.e.&#xD;
      the gradient limits set by the manufacturer will be disabled. As described in the standard,&#xD;
      the gradient field will be increased slowly from non-stimulating levels until the volunteer&#xD;
      perceives first stimulation sensations, at which point the gradient field will be stopped.&#xD;
      This protocol does not lead to an increased risk of cardiac muscle stimulation compared to&#xD;
      the normal mode, but only an increased likelihood of PNS with non-painful sensations in the&#xD;
      skin, e.g. tingling, twitching or poking. PNS is not considered a health concern. The&#xD;
      radio-frequency (RF) field will remain switched off, i.e. there is no risk of heating (the&#xD;
      scanner will not acquire images in this mode).&#xD;
