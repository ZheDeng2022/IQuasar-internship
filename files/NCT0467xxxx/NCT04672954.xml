      The main objectives of this trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of BI 474121 on cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels in&#xD;
           cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the exposure of BI 474121 in CSF relative to plasma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the exposure effect relationship in CSF with different oral doses of BI&#xD;
           474121&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a&#xD;
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure&#xD;
             (BP), pulse rate (PR)), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 18 to 65 years (inclusive)&#xD;

             hernia repair)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of&#xD;
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders&#xD;
