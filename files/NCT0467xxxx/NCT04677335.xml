    <textblock>
      This randomized study evaluates the effectiveness of a nutraceutical combining billion colony&#xD;
      forming units (cfu) of three L. plantarum strains (CECT7527, CECT7528 and CECT7529) and 10 mg&#xD;
      of monacolin K in reducing blood cholesterol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, and retention of&#xD;
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and similar cholesterol-rich lipoproteins&#xD;
      containing apolipoprotein B (ApoB) within the arterial wall is a key initiating event in&#xD;
      CVDs. Statins are the mainstay of pharmacological cholesterol-reduction therapy. However, a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients report some degree of statin intolerance, which typically&#xD;
      fade away when the statin is switched, discontinued or the dosage reduced. A growing&#xD;
      attention has been devoted to the correction of increased LDL-C levels through the use of&#xD;
      dietary supplements, either because some patients have milder forms of hypercholesterolemia&#xD;
      or as an alternative to statins in patients who may have experienced or are worried of side&#xD;
      effects. Nutraceutical combinations are increasingly used in clinical practice. In this pilot&#xD;
      randomized study, we sought to evaluate of the effect on LDL-C and other blood lipid&#xD;
      parameters of a nutraceutical combining Red Yeast Rice extract (also known by its scientific&#xD;
      name Monascus purpureus) containing 10 mg of monacolin K, plus 1 billion colony forming units&#xD;
      (cfu) of the AB-LIFE probiotic formula. The later is composed of three L. plantarum strains,&#xD;
      namely CECT7527 (also known as KABP011™), CECT7528 (also known as KABP012™) and CECT7529&#xD;
      (also known as KABP013™).&#xD;
