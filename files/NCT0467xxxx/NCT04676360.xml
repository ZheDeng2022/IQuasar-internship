  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study is looking to see how safe and effective belantamab mafodotin is in&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory plasmablastic lymphoma or ALK+ large B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This research study involves the study drug belantamab mafodotin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Belantamab mafodotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), which is the combination of an&#xD;
           antibody (a protein that binds to cells) and a drug. It works by using the antibody&#xD;
           portion to enter into the lymphoma cells, and then releasing the drug portion to kill&#xD;
           the lymphoma cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter phase 2 study of belantamab mafodotin on participants with&#xD;
      plasmablastic lymphoma and ALK+ large B-cell lymphoma.The research study procedures include&#xD;
      screening for eligibility, and study treatment, including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This research study involves the study drug belantamab mafodotin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may receive the study treatment until progression or intolerance, and will&#xD;
           be followed up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that about 25 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved belantamab mafodotin as a&#xD;
      treatment for any disease. This study drug is investigational, and it is not known whether&#xD;
      participants will benefit from taking belantamab mafodotin.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Post-hysterectomy, post-bilateral oophorectomy, or post-tubal ligation.&#xD;
                  Documented hysterectomy or oophorectomy must be confirmed with medical records of&#xD;
                  the actual procedure or confirmed by an ultrasound. Tubal ligation must be&#xD;
                  confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test, and agree to repeat highly sensitive serum pregnancy testing within 72 hours&#xD;
             before the first dose of study intervention (if screening pregnancy test was not&#xD;
             within 72 hours of dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after&#xD;
             completion of administration. Men must also agree not to donate sperm during this&#xD;
             period. Men may agree to remain abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their&#xD;
             preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) OR agree&#xD;
             to use a male condom, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy and female&#xD;
             partner to use an additional highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate&#xD;
             of &lt;1% per year when having sexual intercourse with a WOCBP (including pregnant&#xD;
             females).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment&#xD;
             does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial at the discretion of the overall&#xD;
             PI.&#xD;

             liver disease (including Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones) or&#xD;

             therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; Grade 1) with the exception of alopecia. At&#xD;
             the discretion of the overall PI, participants with residual toxicities &gt; Grade 1 may&#xD;
             be considered eligible if in the opinion of the overall PI the residual toxicity is&#xD;
             not likely to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational&#xD;
             regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Class III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association&#xD;

             mafodotin can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
             to treatment of the mother with belantamab mafodotin, breastfeeding should be&#xD;

             HBV PCR negativity will be eligible for the study. Participant must not have positive&#xD;
             hepatitis C antibody test result or positive hepatitis C RNA test result at screening&#xD;
             or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment. Note: Participants with&#xD;
             positive Hepatitis C antibody due to prior resolved disease can be enrolled, only if a&#xD;
             confirmatory negative Hepatitis C RNA test is obtained. Note: Hepatitis RNA testing is&#xD;
             optional and participants with negative Hepatitis C antibody test are not required to&#xD;
             also undergo Hepatitis C RNA testing.&#xD;
&#xD;

             CD4 count of 200 cells per microliter or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must not have invasive malignancies other than disease under study, unless&#xD;
             the second malignancy has been medically stable for at least 2 years and, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the principal investigators, will not affect the evaluation of the effects&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant must not have had plasmapheresis within 7 days prior to first dose of&#xD;
             study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
