  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is clinically used as the gold standard for detection of colon cancer (CRC) and&#xD;
      removal of adenomatous polyps. Despite the success of colonoscopy in reducing cancer-related&#xD;
      deaths, there exists a disappointing level of adenomas missed at colonoscopy. &quot;Back-to-back&quot;&#xD;
      colonoscopies have indicated significant miss rates of 27% for small adenomas (&lt; 5 mm) and 6%&#xD;
      for adenomas of more than 10 mm in diameter. Studies performing both CT colonography and&#xD;
      colonoscopy estimate that the colonoscopy miss rate for polyps over 10 mm in size may be as&#xD;
      high as 12%. The clinical importance of missed lesions should be emphasized because these&#xD;
      lesions may ultimately progress to CRC. Limitations in human visual perception and other&#xD;
      human biases such as fatigue, distraction, level of alertness during examination increases&#xD;
      recognition errors and way of mitigating them may be the key to improve polyp detection and&#xD;
      further reduction in mortality from CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning (DL), and computer vision have&#xD;
      permitted to develop several AI platforms which have already proved their efficacy in&#xD;
      increasing adenoma detection during colonoscopy9,10. As a matter of fact, the improvement in&#xD;
      detection due to AI systems is only related to the increased capacity of detecting lesions&#xD;
      within the visual field, that is dependent on the amount of mucosa exposed by the endoscopist&#xD;
      during the scope withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing the mucosa exposure would theoretically be a complementary strategy to further&#xD;
      improve polyps detection. A number of distal attachments have been tested to increase the&#xD;
      mucosal exposure by flattening mucosal folds, including a transparent cap, cuff or rings. The&#xD;
      additional diagnostic yield obtained by the second generation of cuff (Endocuff Vision;&#xD;
      Olympus America, Center Valley, Pa, USA) was recently investigated by a meta-analysis of&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials, showing a significant improvement in adenoma detection rate,&#xD;
      and adenomas per colonoscopy, with a reduction in the mean withdrawal time without any&#xD;
      increase in adverse events compared with standard high-definition colonoscopy without any&#xD;
      distal attachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, technologies providing either mucosal image enhancement (Artificial&#xD;
      Intelligence assisted colonoscopy) or mucosal exposure device (Endocuff Vision assisted&#xD;
      colonoscopy) significantly improved adenoma detection rate (ADR). However, the diagnostic&#xD;
      yield obtained by combining the different strategies is still unknown.&#xD;
