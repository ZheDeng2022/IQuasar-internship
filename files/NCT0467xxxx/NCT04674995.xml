  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, observational cohort study carried out in two operative Units of the&#xD;
      University Hospital of Modena (Italy): the Diagnostic and Interventional Bronchoscopy Unit&#xD;
      (Unit A) and the Otolaryngology Unit (Unit B). The two units have different protocols&#xD;
      routinely applied to treat tracheal benign stenosis. In Unit A, endoscopic treatment is&#xD;
      performed through mechanical dilatation via rigid bronchoscopy and further stent placing&#xD;
      while in Unit B the endoscopic treatment is performed through balloon dilatation via direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy. The primary purpose was to compare the efficacy of the two technique on&#xD;
      tracheal stenosis treatment over time. Patients were defined as &quot;cured&quot; if during the 2 years&#xD;
      after 12 months since the last intervention they did not present any of the following:&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms, need for a re-intervention or stenosis instability.&#xD;
