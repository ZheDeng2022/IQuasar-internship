  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to the effect of opioid (morphine) intradermal application on&#xD;
      histaminergic and non-histaminergic itch. In particular, we would like to demonstrate that&#xD;
      also peripheral administration of morphine may affect mast cell release of histamine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioids (i.e. substances extracted from opium poppies, e.g. morphine) are used for treatment&#xD;
      of both acute and chronic pain conditions as well as in surgical procedures. Opioids render&#xD;
      effective pain relief, however, they may cause bothersome itch as a side effect. With this&#xD;
      series of experiments, we wish to clarify how an injection with morphine in the skin layer&#xD;
      called dermis (located right below the upper skin) will affect itch.&#xD;

    <description>We will ask the subjects to rate the sensation of itch on a 100 mm VAS scale ranging from 0 to 100 where 0 indicates &quot;no itch&quot; and 100 indicates &quot;worst itch imaginable&quot;.</description>

    <description>During the 1st session, each of the middle forearms of the subject will be divided into two squared areas (4x4 cm) located 3 cm apart. Two areas will be treated with an intradermal injection of morphine (0.05 ml, 0.1 mg/ml), while two areas will be treated with injections of isotonic saline (0.05 ml, 0.9%) as vehicle. Fifteen minutes after the injections, the measurement of FLPI and wheal size will be conducted in one morphine and one saline treated area.&#xD;
This measurement will be followed by application of histamine and cowhage in the four areas (two pre-treated with morphine and two pre-treated with vehicle)</description>
