  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients enrolled in the Austrian LifeVest Registry will be retrospectively screened for&#xD;
      successfully completed ambulatory or stationary rehabilitation program. Baseline&#xD;
      characteristics, complete rehab data, outcomes and follow up data, as well as wearable&#xD;
      cardioverter defibrillator(WCD)-derived data will be collected from these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, performance data from the start of the exercise training (ET) will be compared&#xD;
      to the end of ET; including type of training, exertion, time and duration will be collected.&#xD;
      In addition, WCD recorded data such as automatically and manually recorded ECGs, compliance,&#xD;
      and TRENDS data will be collected.&#xD;
