  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is for a pragmatic randomised controlled clinical trial (RCT) with a manual&#xD;
      spinal mobilisation (MSM) intervention for patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA),&#xD;
      embedded in a Trials within Cohort (TwiCs) design. This trial might appear as a standardised&#xD;
      RCT but there is a secondary element - an observational cohort the trial is embedded in.&#xD;
      Trial A is the first (of possibly several) embedded pragmatic RCTs involving physiotherapy&#xD;
      interventions that may identify therapies that will help improve outcomes for patients with&#xD;
      axSpA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are seeking to improve outcomes for these patients by comparing different&#xD;
      physiotherapy interventions in subsequent trials with standard of care (SoC) physiotherapy.&#xD;
      Trial A will compare routine care vs routine care plus MSM physiotherapy attempting to answer&#xD;
      the primary research question if MSM on patients with axSpA improves spinal mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to recruit patients and obtain outcomes for Trial A (n=70), the investigators will&#xD;
      first recruit up to 300 axSpA patients receiving care at the Royal National Hospital for&#xD;
      Rheumatic Diseases (RNHRD) in Bath into a cohort and observe their standard of care outcomes.&#xD;
      This will allow to answer the cohort's research question of &quot;How does SoC physiotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with axSpA reflect in data collected routinely on outcomes of the disease?&quot; Patients&#xD;
      will be asked to consent to provide routine observational data on their wellbeing, be&#xD;
      approached to take part in future trials of interventions which aim to improve outcomes for&#xD;
      patients with axSpA, and not be approached unless they are offered the physiotherapy trial&#xD;
      intervention. This highly pragmatic method of providing information and seeking consent&#xD;
      replicates the informed consent procedures in routine care clinical settings. This study is&#xD;
      aimed to last three years, with individual trials of 40-70 participants, ranging between&#xD;
      three to six months duration of therapy intervention in addition to routine care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single pragmatic randomised controlled clinical trial (RCT) (Trial A) which is embedded in&#xD;
      a series of pragmatic trials within the Trials within Cohort (TwiCs) design of the PaxSpA&#xD;
      study. This trial will compare manual spinal mobilisation (MSM) intervention for patients&#xD;
      with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) to routine care alone.This trial might appear as a&#xD;
      standardised RCT but there is a secondary element - an observational cohort the trial is&#xD;
      embedded in. Trial A is the first (of possibly several) embedded pragmatic RCTs involving&#xD;
      physiotherapy interventions that may identify therapies that will help improve outcomes for&#xD;
      patients with axSpA. The cohort might seem as an unnecessary add-on to what could be&#xD;
      conducted as a standalone standardised RCT, but it has a few important advantages. By having&#xD;
      a cohort the investigators can observe routine care physiotherapy outcomes for a large cohort&#xD;
      giving data from a large number of patients. That data can be used to compare to across a&#xD;
      range of interventions, as each embedded trial will use the same outcome measures and&#xD;
      therefore results are comparable across trials to give a broader view of the care of this&#xD;
      chronic progressive condition - axial Spondyloarthritis. The other advantage for having for&#xD;
      having the cohort is to be able to have a control group receiving standard of care without&#xD;
      having disappointment bias for not being in the intervention arm, as physiotherapy&#xD;
      interventions can be very difficult to blind participants. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      establish an observational cohort of 300 patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)&#xD;
      currently treated at the RUH NHS Trust in Bath and observe their outcomes over the duration&#xD;
      of the study, as a cornerstone for our &quot;Trials within cohort&quot; (TwiCs) study PaxSpA. Cohort&#xD;
      patients will be asked to consent to (i) provide observational data on their wellbeing&#xD;
      (standard routine axSpA PROM), (ii) be approached to take part in future trials of&#xD;
      interventions which aim to improve outcomes for patients axSpA, and (iii) not be approached&#xD;
      unless they are offered an experimental (i.e. non routine) intervention. Post randomisation,&#xD;
      only those randomly selected to an experimental (non-routine) intervention will informed&#xD;
      about the experimental interventions and asked for their 'clinical' consent to receive these&#xD;
      intervention (i.e. Trial A: manual mobilisation). This method is known as the Trials within&#xD;
      Cohorts (TwiCs) method and is currently being used in over 70 studies worldwide, including&#xD;
      many in the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada. This method of providing information and seeking&#xD;
      consent replicates the informed consent procedures in routine care and has several benefits.&#xD;
      Firstly, it avoids unnecessary expectation and disappointment regarding the experimental&#xD;
      interventions. Secondly, clinicians do not have to spend time explaining interventions to&#xD;
      patients who will not be offered the intervention post randomisation. Thirdly, it enables&#xD;
      fast and efficient recruitment to both trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will then conduct the first of possibly several embedded pragmatic&#xD;
      randomised controlled trials of adjunctive physiotherapy for patients with axSpA: Trial A&#xD;
      will compare routine care vs routine care plus manual spinal mobilisation physiotherapy. The&#xD;
      hypothesis for trial A assumes manual spinal mobilisation will improve function, decrease&#xD;
      pain and decrease disease activity, but primarily increase spinal mobility, as shown in&#xD;
      previous trials to be the case when specific parts of the spine received manual mobilisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design and methodology has been chosen because of its highly pragmatic character in&#xD;
      a clinical setting of a chronic condition. Physiotherapy in axSpA consists of a variety of&#xD;
      treatment options to research and outcomes for each intervention can be compared to the&#xD;
      routinely taken outcome measures across the cohort to identify and compare&#xD;
      benefits/challenges of different interventions. The TwiCs design has been shown to be&#xD;
      particularly suitable for chronic conditions, where different treatments are provided to&#xD;
      inform clinical practice, and therefore the investigators identified this design to be best&#xD;
      suited to meet the aims and objectives our study (also see second paragraph above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The justification for including control arms to a trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control arm is important for comparison of outcomes and to increase the validity of our&#xD;
      study. The control arm will receive standard of care as usual (as will the intervention&#xD;
      group), without the additional intervention, therefore the difference in results between the&#xD;
      groups will indicate the effect of the trial intervention, enabling to inform clinical&#xD;
      practice. Additionally, it is very challenging to blind participants and researcher to&#xD;
      physiotherapy interventions, so randomisation with a control group gives our study a sound&#xD;
      methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be achieved my random computer allocation in a staged (phased)&#xD;
      randomisation process. Initially all cohort participants will get screened for eligibility&#xD;
      for trial A and if successful, included into the eligible trial cohort. For trial A the&#xD;
      investigators aim to recruit 12 participants per stage/batch into the manual mobilisation&#xD;
      trial for six batches (up to 70 participants). For each batch, six participants will get&#xD;
      randomly selected from the eligible trial cohort to be offered to receive the intervention.&#xD;
      The remaining six participants that were not selected will function as controls. On average&#xD;
      the investigators will aim to recruit a new batch every two weeks to start the initially more&#xD;
      frequent intervention (from biweekly to monthly over six months) in stages. Therefore, all&#xD;
      participants should have been randomised and started the trial within the first 3-4 months of&#xD;
      the start of the trial. This phased randomisation/ recruitment to the trial is a due to&#xD;
      limited resources and time restraints.&#xD;
