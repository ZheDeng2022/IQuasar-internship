  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Sponsor is developing the test medicine, AZD6094 (Savolitinib) for the potential&#xD;
      treatment of cancer. Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of the body grow&#xD;
      and reproduce uncontrollably, causing a growth called a tumour. The test medicine works to&#xD;
      inhibit a pathway within the body which promotes tumours to grow and spread. The study&#xD;
      involves radiolabelling (labelling the molecule with radioactive 14C) which is used to locate&#xD;
      the molecule within the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the absolute bioavailability of the test medicine (amount of the oral&#xD;
      test medicine that enters the blood stream relative to the dose given into the vein), along&#xD;
      with the mass balance (how much radioactivity can be recovered from the urine and faeces) and&#xD;
      the rates and routes of elimination of [14C]savolitinib. It will also look to identify the&#xD;
      breakdown products (metabolites) of the test medicine. The safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      test medicine will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of two parts, involving a minimum of eight healthy male volunteers. In&#xD;
      Part one, following a high fat breakfast, volunteers will receive a single oral dose of the&#xD;
      test medicine, followed by an intravenous infusion (solution into the vein) of radiolabelled&#xD;
      test medicine. Volunteers will remain resident in the clinical unit until 72 hours post-oral&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will then be a washout period of at least 14 days, after which the volunteers will&#xD;
      return to the clinical unit for Part two. Volunteers will receive a single oral dose of&#xD;
      radiolabelled test medicine as an oral solution. Blood, urine and faecal samples will be&#xD;
      collected from volunteers whilst they are resident in the clinical unit for up to 168 hours&#xD;
      postdose (Day 8). Volunteers will return for a follow-up visit at least 14 days after their&#xD;
      last dose for safety assessments.&#xD;
