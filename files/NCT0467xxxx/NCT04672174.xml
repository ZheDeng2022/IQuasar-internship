  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hearing loss and cognitive impairment both appear in elderly patients. The goal was to use a&#xD;
      modified screening method added to already established cognitive tests to obtain a&#xD;
      standardized test for detection of cognitive impairment in patients with hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to collect data with neuropsychological tests using questionnaires&#xD;
      and to determine cognitive impairment in patients with hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data will be evaluated using SPSS 23. The corrected item-total correlation and&#xD;
      item difficulty of the item DemTectEar will be assessed by item analysis / Cronbachs' Alpha.&#xD;
      For further evaluation and comparisons two-sided t-tests with a level of significance 0.05 or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney-U-tests will be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment and dementia are a growing health-care problem in our society. The&#xD;
      prevalence of dementia is still estimated to grow drastically and reach over a 100 million&#xD;
      world-wide by the year 2050. To address this problem there are numerous neuropsychological&#xD;
      screening methods, for example the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) or the DemTect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another age-dependent problem is the increasing hearing impairment. Furthermore, studies have&#xD;
      shown that hearing loss is associated with cognitive decline and may accelerate the process.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there is no specific cognitive screening method for patients with a sensory&#xD;
      hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to obtain a specifically modified version of the general DemTect called&#xD;
      DemTectEar for patients with pre-existing hearing loss. Such a screening method would lead to&#xD;
      earlier detection, earlier therapy and thereby to deceleration of cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient charts are screened to identify possible participants. They are contacted to&#xD;
      participate in the study during regular clinical follow-up consultations or are contacted by&#xD;
      phone or mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will explain to each participant the nature of the study, its purpose, the&#xD;
      procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits and any&#xD;
      discomfort it may entail. Each participant will be informed that the participation in the&#xD;
      study is voluntary and that he or she may withdraw from the study at any time and that&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent will not affect his or her subsequent medical assistance and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be informed that his or her medical records may be examined by&#xD;
      authorised individuals other than their treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants for the study will be provided a participant information sheet and a consent&#xD;
      form describing the study and providing sufficient information for participant to make an&#xD;
      informed decision about their participation in the study. Enough time, a few days or more if&#xD;
      required, will be given to the participant to decide whether to participate or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formal consent of a participant, using the approved consent form, will be obtained before&#xD;
      the participant is submitted to any study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consent form will be signed and dated by the investigator or his designee at the same&#xD;
      time as the participant sign. A copy of the signed informed consent will be given to the&#xD;
      study participant. The consent form will be retained as part of the study records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall duration of the study is planned to be 12 months starting with the recruitment&#xD;
      period on September 2019. The study duration for each patient is planned to be approximately&#xD;
      60 min, in which each patient will be undergoing a series of neuropsychological tests and&#xD;
      questionnaires such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DemTectEar Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) F-A-S Becks Depressions-Inventar (BOI-V)&#xD;
      Bayer-Activities of Daily Living Scale-Skala (B-ADL Skala) Trail Making Test (TMT)&#xD;
      Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test - Copy and Recall (ROCFT) Mini-q Test&#xD;
      Nürnberger-Alters-Inventar Test (NAI-Labyrinth) Subtest 4 of the Leistungsprüfsystem für 50+&#xD;
      (LPS50+) Subtest 6 of the Leistungsprüfsystem für 50+ Verbaler Lern- und Merkfähigkeitstest&#xD;
      (VLMT) Geriatrische Depressionsskala (GDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan and sample size calculation The collected data will be evaluated&#xD;
      using SPSS 23. The corrected item-total correlation and item difficulty of the item&#xD;
      DemTectEar will be assessed by item analysis / Cronbachs' Alpha. For further evaluation and&#xD;
      comparisons two-sided t-tests with a level of significance 0.05 or Mann-Whitney-U-tests will&#xD;
      be performed. The primary endpoint consists of a cut-off score between age-appropriate&#xD;
      cognitive capability and cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 200 control subjects, 50 patients with a hearing loss and 50 patients with visual&#xD;
      impairment will be included for analysis. The majority of these patients is recruited in&#xD;
      Köln, and only 20 patients with hearing impairment are investigated in Zürich.&#xD;
