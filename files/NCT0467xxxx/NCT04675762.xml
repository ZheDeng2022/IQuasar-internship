  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proof-of concept clinical trials have indicated that the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor&#xD;
      modulator fingolimod may be efficacious in attenuating brain inflammation and improving&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in patients with AIS as a single therapy beyond 4.5 hours of disease onset,&#xD;
      or in combination with alteplase within 4.5 hours of disease onset. So in this study the&#xD;
      investigators try to determine whether the addition of fingolimod, administered within 24&#xD;
      hours after the onset of symptoms in patients receiving alteplase bridging with mechanical&#xD;
      thrombectomy, improves radiologic and clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design clinical trial, in&#xD;
      multiple stroke centers of China. The total sample size will be 118. Patients being treated&#xD;
      with standard alteplase bridging and mechanical thrombectomy will be randomly assigned in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio to receive fingolimod or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged between 18 and 85 with anterior circulation AIS who are eligible for alteplase&#xD;
      and mechanical thrombectomy commenced within 24 hours of stroke onset or awakening with&#xD;
      stroke (if within 24 hours from the midpoint of sleep) will be enrolled if they present with&#xD;
      an infarct core volume ≤ 100 mL and penumbra ≥ 15 mL with at least 20% mismatch (as evaluated&#xD;
      by CTP) and intracranial occlusion in proximal cerebral arteries. Exclusion criteria are (1)&#xD;
      pre-existing neurologic disability (a score greater than 2 on the mRS); (2) contraindication&#xD;
      of fingolimod.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As standard care, all patients will receive standard dose intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg per&#xD;
      kilogram, the first 10% administered as an initial bolus and the remainder over a 1-hour&#xD;
      period, with a maximum dose of 90 mg) and mechanical thrombectomy delivered at the site of&#xD;
      intracranial vessel occlusion. Patients randomized to fingolimod group or placebo group will&#xD;
      receive fingolimod (Gilenya, Novartis) at a dosage of 0.5 mg or placebo once daily, for three&#xD;
      consecutive days, with the first dose being given at the time in which patients are enrolled&#xD;
      which is about one hour prior to mechanical thrombectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The kinetics of lymphocyte subset alteration will be monitored in whole-blood samples from&#xD;
      all fingolimod- treated patients at the baseline, which will precede the first dose, day 1&#xD;
      and day 7. Mononuclear cells will be isolated from the whole-blood specimens and stained with&#xD;
      antibodies to CD4-FITC, CD8-PE, CD19-PerCP, CD56-PE (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ,&#xD;
      USA). Data will be acquired using a FACS Caliber (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems,&#xD;
      San Jose, CA, USA) and analyzed with Flow Jo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the ratio of mRS 0-2 (%) at 90 day. Secondary outcomes are the&#xD;
      salvaged ischemic tissue index (%) from baseline to 7 day, the growth in infarct volume (mL)&#xD;
      from 24 hour to 7 day, the penumbral salvage volume (mL) from baseline to 1 day, the&#xD;
      frequency of parenchymal hemorrhage (PH) (%) at day 1, the change on the NIHSS score from&#xD;
      baseline to 1 day, the change on the NIHSS score from baseline to 7 day, mRS 0-1 (%) at 90&#xD;
      day, and mRS at 90 day.&#xD;
