  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (mNSCLC) and its treatments, patients suffer&#xD;
      from numerous symptoms such as dyspnea, muscle atrophy, pain, fatigue, loss of appetite,&#xD;
      altered physical condition and lung function, which may further impair the patient's overall&#xD;
      condition. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that physical exercise could improve response&#xD;
      to treatment at the clinical level due to its known effects on the immune system. Moreover,&#xD;
      preclinical studies have shown that exercise performed during chemotherapy administration&#xD;
      could result in physiological benefits such as improved intra-tumoral infusion and drug&#xD;
      delivery. The ERICA study aims to assess the feasibility of an acute physical exercise&#xD;
      immediately before immunotherapy and chemotherapy administration in patients with mNSCLC.&#xD;

    <description>The PA level will be measured by the Godin Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (GLTAPQ). The GLTAPQ is a 4-item self-administered questionnaire with the first three questions designed to obtain information on the number of times an individual engages in light, moderate and intense &quot;leisure-time PA&quot; periods of at least 15 minutes during a typical week. The scoring of the GSLTPAQ is the &quot;LSI&quot; (Leisure Score Index) is obtained using the following formula: (light PA frequency × 3) + (moderate PA frequency × 5) + (vigorous PA frequency × 9). People with a moderate to high LSI ≥ 24 are classified as active, while people reporting a moderate to high LSI ≤ 23 are classified as insufficiently active (estimated energy expenditure &lt; 14 Kcal/kg/week).</description>

    <description>Quality of life will be measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality Of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30). Quality of life specific to lung cancer will be assessed by the 13-item module: The Quality Of Life Questionnaire - Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ-LC13). The QLQ-LC13 self-questionnaire is an additional measure of the symptoms and side effects experienced by lung cancer patients who receive non-surgical treatment.</description>

    <description>Fatigue will be assessed by the EORTC-QLQ module measuring cancer-related fatigue (EORTC QLQ-FA12). This self-questionnaire includes 12 items that assess physical, cognitive and emotional fatigue related to cancer. Participants will respond on a Likert scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;a lot&quot;. All scores will be transformed into a scale from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a higher degree of fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Investigate the sleep quality change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The perceived quality of sleep is assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) which measures the severity of insomnia. The questionnaire consists of 7 items rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;none&quot;) to 4 (&quot;very severe&quot;). This self-questionnaire makes it possible to evaluate the severity of the patient's sleep difficulties (initial, maintenance, morning insomnia), the degree of sleep dissatisfaction, the level of interference with daily functioning, the degree of appearance of sleep difficulties and the level of anxiety related to insomnia. The total score of the items varies between 0 and 28. A high score indicates greater sleep difficulties.</description>

By adding up the points of the 11 binary questions (&quot;Yes&quot;/&quot;No&quot;) of the self-questionnaire we obtain the so-called EPICES score. This quantitative score varies from 0 &quot;no precariousness&quot; to 100 &quot;highest precariousness&quot;.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive physical activity recommendations at inclusion.&#xD;
At each treatment cure, patients will receive pre-exercise nutritional recommendations and an acute physical exercise prior to immunotherapy and chemotherapy. The acute physical exercise will last 35 minutes and will be intermittent and individualized based on the results obtained by the patient during an endurance test on a ergocyle performed prior to treatment.&#xD;
3 blood sampling times (2 EDTAsx10 mL) will be specially added to the study and will take place before exercise (1), after exercise (2) and 12 hours after the start of treatment (3).&#xD;
A nutritional assessment will be carried out during the first and last treatment cure.&#xD;
They will also benefit a home walking program. These patients will have to wear an activity tracker tracker during all intervention (3 months).&#xD;
They will have a phone follow-up every 10 days (± 3 days) after each treatment cure for the study duration.</description>
