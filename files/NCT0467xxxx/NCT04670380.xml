  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Operative vaginal delivery is the main risk factor for pelvic floor trauma occurrence and&#xD;
      especially for obstetric anal sphincter injuries. These complications are strongly and&#xD;
      negatively impact women's health: fecal incontinence, perineal pain, sexual dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk appears higher in case of operative vaginal delivery assisted by forceps compared to&#xD;
      a vacuum delivery. This considered it is likely that optimizing the performance of the&#xD;
      operator that perform the operative vaginal delivery will reduce the morbidity associated&#xD;
      with this intervention. There are data bout how to optimize the placement of the forceps on&#xD;
      the fetal head before performing the delivery but there are no data about the movement of the&#xD;
      obstetrician during this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to analyse the posture and the movement of the obstetrician during a&#xD;
      simulated forceps operative vaginal delivery using a 3D cinematic analysis. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to analyse the traction force applied on the forceps during the delivery, to&#xD;
      describe the different postures in terms of stability and last to compare the self-declared&#xD;
      practice to the objectively observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study including 40 volunteers (medical doctors and registrars).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each volunteer will perform a simulated operative vaginal delivery using a Suzor's Forceps on&#xD;
      a high fidelity mannequin. Postures and movement will be assessed using optometric analysis.&#xD;
      The force of traction will be assessed during the operative delivery thank to a force sensor&#xD;
      on the forceps. The self declared practice collected thanks to individual questionnaires will&#xD;
      be compared to the observed practice during the simulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospects are to identify the best posture and movement for performing an operative&#xD;
      vaginal delivery and to promote tools for simulation of medical students.&#xD;

    <description>It will be request from each volunteer to perform a vaginal operative delivery using a Suzor's forceps on a mannequin. The condition will be standardized (anterior occiput low fetal presentation). Each participant will be equipped with 34 reflecting markers allowing to record their movement using infra red cameras (VICON system).</description>

        The population will be constituted of 40 volunteers that are medical doctor obstetricians&#xD;

        Suzor's Forceps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All the participants will be aged of 18 or more and will give their informed and written&#xD;
        free consent before any investigation.&#xD;
