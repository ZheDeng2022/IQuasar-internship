  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is a dysfunction caused by an impingement of the&#xD;
      rotator cuff tendon between the head of the humerus and the acromion as a result of changes&#xD;
      in the subacromial space. The patients' symptoms, such as pain, limited joint mobility and&#xD;
      reduced strength, may lead to a diagnosis of SIS. The conservative treatment of individuals&#xD;
      with SIS is includes analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroid&#xD;
      injections and physiotherapy. Ultrasound therapy is one of the common physiotherapy&#xD;
      applications for SIS, but its effectiveness is controversial. Phonophoresis is a combination&#xD;
      of ultrasound therapy and medical therapy. In phonophoresis, a medicine in gel form is used&#xD;
      as a transmitter with ultrasound instead of the aquatic conductor gel. It was hypothesized&#xD;
      that ultrasound waves favoring the penetration of an anti-inflammatory drug would lead to an&#xD;
      improved response to the treatment of SIS. However, the effectiveness of ultrasound modes&#xD;
      (pulsed or continuous) can be used in phonophoresis is debatable. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to determine the effect of ultrasound therapy, pulsed mode ultrasound and continuous mode&#xD;
      ultrasound phonophoresis in patients with SIS.&#xD;

    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) is a pain rating scale first used by Hayes and Patterson in 1921. Scores are based on self-reported measures of symptoms that are recorded with a single handwritten mark placed at one point along the length of a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between the two ends of the scale-&quot;no pain&quot; on the left end (0 cm) of the scale and the &quot;worst pain&quot; on the right end of the scale (10 cm).</description>

    <measure>The Shortened version of Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Change from baseline shoulder pain and function scores at three weeks, Change from baseline shoulder pain and function at three months</time_frame>
    <description>Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) was designed to describe disability experienced by patients with any musculoskeletal condition of the upper extremity and to monitor change in symptoms and upper limb function over time. The DASH questionnaire has been validated in patients with upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and shoulder impingement syndrome. The Quick-DASH is a shortened version of the DASH</description>

    <description>Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) evaluates emotional, social, and physical health problems perceived by the patient. It consists of six parts: pain (8 items), emotional reactions (9 items), sleep (5 items), social isolation (5 items), physical mobility (8 items), and energy level (3 items). Higher scores correspond to poorer perceived health status.</description>
