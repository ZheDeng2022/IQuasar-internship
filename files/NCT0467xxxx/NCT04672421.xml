  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of MEDICURTAIN. Patients who&#xD;
      underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy were randomly assigned either into Medicurtain®&#xD;
      treatment group or non-treatment control group. Adhesion formations at 8 weeks after the&#xD;
      index surgery were compared between the two groups by using the well-defined grade scale and&#xD;
      image recording.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study was designed as multi-center, randomized, evaluator-blinded, comparative study.&#xD;
      Subjects were woman between 20~80 years of age reserved with total laparoscopic hysterectomy.&#xD;
      Subject screening was conducted for the subject who signed an informed consent form. Subjects&#xD;
      who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned into either treatment (Medicurtain®) or&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject visit clinic for follow-up examination 1week (Visit 2) and 8 weeks (Visit 3)&#xD;
      after the index surgery and before the visit subjects were received phone calls. Since the&#xD;
      target population was the patient who scheduled elective total laparoscopic hysterectomy,&#xD;
      subjects who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria after the examination for the surgery&#xD;
      signed on the informed consent at Visit 1 (Baseline: 0 day) and randomly assigned either into&#xD;
      the treatment and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 2 (1week±2days), 1week after the index surgery adverse events and general health&#xD;
      were examined. At visit 3 (8week±5days), 8 weeks after the index surgery, the investigator&#xD;
      inserted endoscope into abdominal cavity and took video clip and still images. If it was&#xD;
      necessary, adhesion was removed surgically. An independent evaluator evaluated the records&#xD;
      and graded the adhesion rate and its severity according to the grading system. If it was&#xD;
      difficult to collect images with endoscope, the investigators recorded his observation for&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator inserted endoscope into abdominal cavity and took video clip and still&#xD;
      images at 8weeks after total laparoscopic hysterectomy to evaluate the adhesion formation and&#xD;
      its grade. An independent evaluator evaluated the records and graded the adhesion rate and&#xD;
      its severity according to the grading system. If it was difficult to collect images with&#xD;
      endoscope, the investigators recorded his observation for statistical analysis. The adhesion&#xD;
      grading system was proposed by American Fertility Society (AFS) in 1988, grades adhesion with&#xD;
      Grade 0, Grade 1, Grade2 and Grade 3. Grade 0 means there is no adhesion formation, Grade&#xD;
      1~Grade 3 means there is adhesion formed, severity increases with the grade. Adhesion rate&#xD;
      and grade were evaluated between the treatment and control groups suing Grade 0~3 scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General safety of the study device was evaluated based on the adverse event rate, laboratory&#xD;
      tests, ECG test. The laboratory tests were conducted before and after the index surgery to&#xD;
      evaluate whether the device cause toxicity such as hepatic and renal toxicity for safety&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
