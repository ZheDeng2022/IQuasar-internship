      Only patients who sign an informed consent will be included. Patients after a miscarriage in&#xD;
      the 2nd trimester of pregnancy who need to perform an instrumental revision of the uterine&#xD;
      cavity (RCUI, revisio cavi uteri instrumentalis) will be randomized into two groups. In the&#xD;
      first group, RCUI will be performed according to current standards. In the second group, an&#xD;
      anti-adhesive preparation with hyaluronic acid (Hyalobarrier gel Endo) will be applied to the&#xD;
      uterine cavity at the end of the RCUI procedure. Eight to twelve weeks after the operation,&#xD;
      the occurrence of adhesions will be evaluated by ultrasound examination and diagnostic&#xD;
      hysteroscopy (if adhesions will be detected, they will be disrupted). The study will also&#xD;
      include the completion of a questionnaire in terms of the frequency and strength of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle. The presence of adhesions will be assessed according to The American&#xD;
      Fertility Society (AFS).&#xD;

      Methodology Only patients who sign informed consent will be included. Patients after a&#xD;
      miscarriage in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy who need to perform an instrumental revision of&#xD;
      the uterine cavity (RCUI, revisio cavi uteri instrumentalis) will be randomized into two&#xD;
      groups. In the first group, RCUI will be performed according to current standards. In the&#xD;
      second group, an anti-adhesive preparation with hyaluronic acid (Hyalobarrier gel Endo) will&#xD;
      be applied to the uterine cavity at the end of the RCUI procedure. Eight to twelve weeks&#xD;
      after the operation, the occurrence of adhesions will be evaluated by ultrasound examination&#xD;
      and diagnostic hysteroscopy (if adhesions will be detected, they will be disrupted). The&#xD;
      study will also include the completion of a questionnaire in terms of the frequency and&#xD;
      strength of the menstrual cycle. The presence of adhesions will be assessed according to The&#xD;
      American Fertility Society (AFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected number of enrolled subjects: a total of 200 patients, 100 in each branch Entry&#xD;
      criteria: Adult (18 to 40 years old) women with a wish for future pregnancy, abortion in the&#xD;
      2nd trimester of pregnancy (over 12 weeks of pregnancy) with instrumental revision of the&#xD;
      uterine cavity (RCUI), signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: age below 18 years, age over 40 years, history of previous uterine&#xD;
      surgery (myomectomy, resection of the intrauterine septum, disruption of intrauterine&#xD;
      adhesions), suspicion of molar pregnancy, signs of pelvic infection, disagreement with&#xD;
      participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary goals of the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. determination of the frequency of intrauterine adhesions in women who underwent&#xD;
           instrumental revision of the uterine cavity (RCUI, revisio cavi uteri instrumentalis)&#xD;
           after abortion in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine whether the application of an antiadhesive agent with hyaluronic acid has&#xD;
           an effect on the frequency of intrauterine adhesions after this procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      A similar prospective randomized multicenter study investigating the relationship of&#xD;
      intrauterine adhesions using an intrauterine gel with hyaluronic acid was published in 2017&#xD;
      by Hooker. Patients were enrolled in the study up to the 14th week of pregnancy. The&#xD;
      incidence of intrauterine adhesions was statistically lower in the hyaluronic acid group&#xD;
      compared to the no treatment group (13% vs. 30.6%, RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22-0.83, p 0.013).&#xD;
      However, this study investigated RCUI in the first trimester of pregnancy. Our study is to&#xD;
      our knowledge the first with a focus on the second trimester RCUI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goals of the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. number of pregnancies (pregnancy rate) in the period of 24 months after RCUI in both&#xD;
           groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. number of term pregnancies in the 24 months after RCUI in both groups&#xD;
