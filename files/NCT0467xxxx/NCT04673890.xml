  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Significant challenges and gaps remain in navigating transitions between acute care and&#xD;
      outpatient care for many cancer survivors. This study underscores 1) implementation of&#xD;
      Emergency Department (ED) risk-stratified treatments protocols that standardize patient care&#xD;
      and would allow for rapid re-assessment and access to specialist care with well-coordinated&#xD;
      cancer care plans, and 2) the significant numbers of minority cancer survivors seeking&#xD;
      episodic care in the ED that are at increased risk of not receiving recommended post cancer&#xD;
      treatment surveillance.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The over-arching goal of this study is to develop a portable model for ED cancer treatment&#xD;
      guidelines and management using evidence based protocols in a population at high risk for&#xD;
      poor cancer -related outcomes by identifying &amp; overcoming specific barriers to enhanced&#xD;
      survivorship. Based on the demographics of ED population (currently, 70% racial/ethnic&#xD;
      minorities), the majority of participants will be underrepresented (African-American and&#xD;
      Hispanic) and low-income individuals. The investigators propose a feasibility study of 150&#xD;
      patients in the ED over a 1 year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate the effectiveness of ED Risk-Stratified, Evidence-Based Treatment protocols&#xD;
      on the primary outcome of ED utilization rates and subsequent acute inpatient admissions at 6&#xD;
      -months post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of an ED-based Cancer Patient Navigator on the secondary&#xD;
      outcomes of patient engagement and primary care engagement at 6 -months post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Examine barriers and facilitators to compliance for cancer survivorship&#xD;
      recommendations that occur in an ED setting at 6-months post intervention.&#xD;
