  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to refine and pilot test educational material developed to&#xD;
      educate and support patients receiving immunotherapy for advanced lung cancer or melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is an educational video and question prompt list (QPL) to promote&#xD;
      communication between patients, caregivers, and the oncology team about the risks and&#xD;
      benefits of immunotherapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This two-part study will 1) refine and 2) pilot test an intervention to improve participant's&#xD;
      and caregiver knowledge and increase communication with the oncology team about&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The intervention involves watching a video developed to educate patients regarding the&#xD;
      risks, benefits, and potential outcomes of immunotherapy treatment and reviewing an&#xD;
      immunotherapy-focused QPL prior to ICI initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Part 1 of this study, investigators will conduct a small open pilot to refine the&#xD;
           intervention and study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Part 2, investigators will conduct a single-site pilot randomized controlled trial&#xD;
           including 130 patients and their caregivers, to evaluate the feasibility of intervention&#xD;
           delivery, and the preliminary efficacy of the intervention in improving patient and&#xD;
           caregiver knowledge.&#xD;
