      Monocentric, category 2 study according to Jardé Law (minimal risks and constraints) of three&#xD;
      prospective cohorts: Tumors located at the oropharynx, the oral cavity and the&#xD;
      larynx-hypopharynx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the 3D vector of the absolute residual positioning error&#xD;
      observed with the CBCT reference imaging, after repositioning performed with ExacTrac®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate: 1) the rate of residual errors ≥2mm (translations&#xD;
      in all directions) and ≥2 ° (rotations in all directions) on CBCT imaging after&#xD;
      repositionning with the ExacTrac® system; 2) the Evaluation of intrafraction movements&#xD;
      amplitude by analyzing the ExacTrac® images taken during the irradiation; 3) the evolution of&#xD;
      the relative position of the volume of the tumor at high risk of recurrence (CTVTHR) in&#xD;
      relation to the spine over the entire duration of the treatment; 4) the impact of patient's&#xD;
      weight loss, the advancement of RT and the realization of a chemotherapy / targeted therapy&#xD;
      concomitant with RT, on the evolution of the relative position of the CTVTHR in relation to&#xD;
      the column vertebral; 5) the dosimetric consequence of a strict bone registration on the&#xD;
      CTVTHR coverage by calculating the post-treatment dose on the CBCT imaging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The radiotherapy treatment preparation requires performing a dosimetric scanner (CT) of the&#xD;
      patient in the treatment position, with the compression. The repositioning of the ENT sphere&#xD;
      can be complex, especially in cases where there is irradiation of the supraclavicular lymph&#xD;
      node areas. Indeed, the height of the irradiated area can easily exceed 20cm and it is&#xD;
      necessary to ensure a good reproducibility of the repositioning of the spine relative to the&#xD;
      skull.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the dosimetric CT, the radiotherapist delineates the macroscopic tumor volume&#xD;
      (GTV) as well as the clinical tumor target volumes (CTVT) and lymph nodes (CTVN), which take&#xD;
      into account the infiltration risks of the tissue around the macroscopic tumor. Margins&#xD;
      around the VCTs then make it possible to obtain the estimated PTV target volumes (T and N),&#xD;
      defined so that the VCTs receive the prescribed dose despite the geometric uncertainties&#xD;
      associated with the treatment. Contours of organs at risk (OAR) are also carried out on the&#xD;
      dosimetric CT. Margins around the most critical OARs (eg: marrow, brainstem, chiasma and&#xD;
      optic nerves) are then added to generate predictive target volumes of organs at risk (PRV),&#xD;
      taking into account the geometric uncertainties. These uncertainties are separated into&#xD;
      errors in the treatment execution (random) and errors in the treatment preparation&#xD;
      (systematic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Execution errors include repositioning errors, organ movements (overnight), patient&#xD;
      anatomical changes, intrafraction movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Errors related to treatment preparation include repositioning errors related to patient's&#xD;
      skin spotting of the treatment isocenter during the dosimetric CT (thanks to room lasers),&#xD;
      errors related to the CT acquisition that sets the CTV in a given position, the CTV&#xD;
      delineation errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosimetry is then carried out taking into account the dose criteria to be respected on the&#xD;
      PRVs and PTVs. Whatever the protocol used [Shrinking Action Level (SAL), non-action-level&#xD;
      (NAL) or e-NAL (extented NAL)], it must at least make it possible to guarantee that the&#xD;
      delivered dose complies with the planned dose. An optimization of the imaging protocol must&#xD;
      then be able to reduce the margins without compromising the treatment quality, while reducing&#xD;
      its toxicity for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the Centre Léon Bérard accelerators equipped with both CBCT and ExacTrac®, we would like&#xD;
      to assess the possibility of replacing or reducing the frequency of CBCTs using ExacTrac®.&#xD;
      The time-consuming and irradiating characteristics of CBCT encourage to propose this study,&#xD;
      which will define the patients for whom the use of CBCT can be minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, if the correlation between ExacTrac® and CBCT is good, the use of ExacTrac® will&#xD;
      make it possible to control and correct intrafraction movements, and therefore reduce the&#xD;
      random uncertainties associated with carrying out the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possibility of using ExacTrac® imaging for the repositioning of patients treated with&#xD;
      RCMI ENT would allow a reduction in treatment time and therefore less discomfort for the&#xD;
      patient, a reduction in the dose linked to repositioning imaging, follow-up and correction of&#xD;
      patient movements during the irradiation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, this project will enable to propose new pre-treatment imaging strategies and&#xD;
      personalized margins according to the position of the lesions to be treated at the ENT level&#xD;
      in order to reduce the session time when possible, and to reduce the radiation doses. X due&#xD;
      to imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective is to improve the care and quality of treatment for the patient.&#xD;
