  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the neurophysiological mechanisms of an intervention to&#xD;
      reduce symptoms of dissociation in traumatized people. The intervention will be tested in&#xD;
      dissociative traumatized people at two sites: Emory University and University of Pittsburgh.&#xD;
      The researchers are interested in whether neural networks associated with attentional control&#xD;
      and interoceptive awareness can be enhanced in this population. The researchers propose to&#xD;
      evaluate whether different body-focused and non-body focused interventions can change these&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People exposed to chronic trauma face devastating effects to the brain and body. Chronically&#xD;
      traumatized people become highly distressed when attending to emotional stimuli, which can&#xD;
      lead to feelings of detachment from their bodies and environment. It is difficult to engage&#xD;
      highly dissociative traumatized patients in trauma-focused treatment; however, these patients&#xD;
      benefit from acquiring basic emotion regulation skills, including present-centeredness and&#xD;
      body awareness. Various practices that involve present-centeredness and body awareness&#xD;
      (including mindfulness-based interventions) have been shown to demonstrate short-term and&#xD;
      long-term improvement in cognition, emotion regulation and clinical symptoms in dissociative&#xD;
      people with trauma exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to address this issue, the researchers will evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      interventions that engage present-centered awareness and/or body focus.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Multiscale Dissociation Inventory (MDI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6 (post-intervention), 3 Months Post-intervention, 6 Months Post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The MDI is a 30-item self-report test of dissociative symptomology and measures six different types of dissociative responses: disengagement, depersonalization, derealization, emotional constriction/numbing, memory disturbance, and identity dissociation. Items are scored on a 5-point scale where 1 = never and 5 = very often. Total dissociation scores range from 30 to 150 where higher scores indicate greater symptoms of dissociation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6 (post-intervention), 3 Months Post-intervention, 6 Months Post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS is a 30-item structured interview that can be used to make current and lifetime diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as assess PTSD symptoms over the past week. Questions also examine the onset and duration of symptoms, subjective distress, impact of symptoms on social and occupational functioning, improvement in symptoms since a previous CAPS administration, overall response validity, overall PTSD severity, and specifications for the dissociative subtype (depersonalization and derealization). The identification of an index traumatic event to serves as the basis for symptom inquiry. The full interview takes approximately 45-60 minutes to administer. Items are scored from 0 to 4 where 0 = the symptom is absent and 4 = the symptom is incapacitating. A symptom severity score is obtained by summing items 1-20. Total scores range from 0 to 80 and a higher score indicates more severe PTSD symptoms.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Kentucky Mindfulness Scale (KIMS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6 (post-intervention), 3 Months Post-intervention, 6 Months Post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Kentucky Mindfulness Scale is a 39-item scale that assesses skills related to what one does while practicing mindfulness. Items are rated on a 5 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (almost always or always true). Items reflect either direct descriptions of the mindfulness skills, or they describe the absence of that skill and are reverse scored. Total scores range from 39 to 195 and higher scores reflect more mindfulness.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6 (post-intervention), 3 Months Post-intervention, 6 Months Post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This is a clinical measure that assesses various aspects of interoception, including ability to attend to body sensations, regulate distress by attending to body sensations, and experiencing body sensations as safe and trustworthy. The instrument includes 32 items and which are scored from 0 to 5, where 0 = never and 5 = always. Total scores range from 0 to 160 and higher scores indicate greater awareness of body sensations.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PTSD Symptom Checklist (PCL-5) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6 (post-intervention), 3 Months Post-intervention, 6 Months Post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure that assess the DSM-V symptoms of PTSD. Responses are given on a scale from 0 to 4 where 0 = not at all and 4 = extremely. Total scores range from 0 to 80 where higher scores indicate increased symptoms of PTSD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6 (post-intervention), 3 Months Post-intervention, 6 Months Post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The DERS is a 36 item instrument that measures emotional dysregulation symptoms. Responses are given on a 5-point scale where 1 = almost never and 5 = almost always. The DERS scales include 1) nonacceptance of emotional responses, 2) difficulty engaging in goal-directed behavior, 3) difficulties with impulse control, 4) limited emotional awareness, 5) limited access to emotion regulation strategies, and 6) lack of emotional clarity. Total scores range from 36 to 180 and higher scores suggest greater problems with emotion regulation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Attentional Control Scale (ACS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6 (post-intervention), 3 Months Post-intervention, 6 Months Post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses attentional control a 4-point Likert scale, where 1 = almost never and 4 = always. Total scores range from 20 to 80 and higher scores indicate greater difficulty with attentional control.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in State Scale of Dissociation (SSD) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6 (before and after each study visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The SSD is a 56-item self-report measure that assess present state dissociative symptoms. The SSD seven subscales are derealization, depersonalization, identity confusion, identity alteration, conversion, amnesia, and hypermnesia. Responses are given on a 10-point scale where 0 = not at all, and 9 = very much so. A total score is calculated as the mean of all survey items. Total scores range from 0 to 9 where higher scores indicate greater dissociation. This will be administered prior to and after each intervention appointment and MRI visit.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sense of Agency Rating Scale (SOARS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6 (post-intervention), 3 Months Post-intervention, 6 Months Post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The SOARS is a 10-item self-report measure that assess the sense of control one has over their body. Responses are given on a 7-point Likert scale where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree. Total scores range from 10 to 70 where lower scores indicate greater sense of agency.</description>

    <measure>Change in Affective Number Stroop (ANS) Task Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6 (post-intervention), 3 Months Post-intervention, 6 Months Post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>During the ANS task, participants are instructed to rapidly identify the number of numbers in a given display while ignoring evocative distractor images (trauma-relevant scenes). In these trials, the number of numbers presented is either consistent or inconsistent with the actual number displayed, such that there are both congruent and incongruent trials. The participants will be presented with positive and neutral pictures in addition to the negative trauma-relevant images. The task will be completed in the MRI scanner during both the pre- and post-treatment sessions. This task is meant to evoke the attentional problems that many Grady Trauma Project participants encounter while performing daily tasks by engaging attentional control resources and including images that are relevant to participants' traumas.</description>
