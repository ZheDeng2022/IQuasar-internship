    <textblock>
      In this study, the changes in cerebral oxygen saturation due to low and high pressure&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum implementation were measured in patients who underwent laparoscopic&#xD;
      nephrectomy. This prospective, double-blind study included 62 American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) PS class I-III patients aged 18-65 years who underwent laparoscopic&#xD;
      nephrectomy (simple, partial, or radical). Patients were randomly classified into 2 groups:&#xD;
      Group LP (n = 31) included patients who were treated with low pressure pneumoperitoneum (8&#xD;
      mmHg) and Group SP (n = 31) included patients who were treated with standard pressure (14&#xD;
      mmHg). A standard anesthesia protocol was used in both groups. Bilateral rSO2 values were&#xD;
      recorded at baseline, at 1 minute after induction, and then every 5 minutes until the patient&#xD;
      went to the recovery unit. Data for mean arterial pressure (MAP), peak heart rate (HR),&#xD;
      peripheral oxgen saturation (SpO2), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) were also recorded&#xD;
      at the same time intervals. Arterial blood gas was analyzed in the 5th minute after induction&#xD;
      (t1) while the patient was in the supine position, in the 5th and 30th minutes after&#xD;
      insufflation (t2, t3) while the patient was in the lateral semi-oblique position, and again&#xD;
      10 minutes after desufflation (t4) while the patient was in the supine position. Patient&#xD;
      demographic data, duration of anesthesia, duration of surgery, lateral position time,&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum time, and recovery time were also recorded. used in both groups. Bilateral&#xD;
      rSO2 values were recorded at baseline, at 1 minute after induction, and then every 5 minutes&#xD;
      until the patient went to the recovery unit. Data for mean arterial pressure (MAP), peak&#xD;
      heart rate (HR), SpO2, and ETCO2 were also recorded at the same time intervals. Arterial&#xD;
      blood gas was analyzed in the 5th minute after induction (t1) while the patient was in the&#xD;
      supine position, in the 5th and 30th minutes after insufflation (t2, t3) while the patient&#xD;
      was in the lateral semi-oblique position, and again 10 minutes after desufflation (t4) while&#xD;
      the patient was in the supine position. Patient demographic data, duration of anesthesia,&#xD;
      duration of surgery, lateral position time, pneumoperitoneum time, and recovery time were&#xD;
      also recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 62 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) PS class I-III patients between the&#xD;
      ages of 18 and 65 years who were scheduled for elective laparoscopic nephrectomy (simple,&#xD;
      partial, or radical) were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard anesthesia protocol was used in both groups. Patients did not receive any sedative&#xD;
      premedication. Upon entering the operating room, they underwent electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      non-invasive blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), rSO2 (INVOS TM 5100C&#xD;
      oximeter; Covidien), and neuromuscular monitoring (TOF-WatchTM SX; Organon, Dublin, Ireland).&#xD;
      Subsequently, anesthesia was induced with propofol (1.5-2.5 mg/kg) and remifentanil (1 mcg/kg&#xD;
      IV bolus for 30-60 seconds, then 0.25 mcg/kg/min), and rocuronium (1.2 mg/kg). Anesthesia was&#xD;
      maintained with O2/Air (fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.40; inspiratory fresh gas flow of 2&#xD;
      L/min), sevoflurane (1 minimum alveolar concentration), and remifentanil IV infusion&#xD;
      (0.1-0.25 mcg/kg/min). Radial arterial cannulation was also applied for arterial blood gas&#xD;
      analysis and continuous blood pressure measurement. A mechanical ventilator (Draeger FabiusTM&#xD;
      Plus anesthesia Workstation, Draeger Medical, Lübeck, Germany) was used at settings of tidal&#xD;
      volume 7-8 mL/kg, inspirium/exprium expiratory ratio 1:2, and positive end-expiratory&#xD;
      pressure of 5 cmH2O. With these settings, pre-insufflation Sp02 values were maintained at&#xD;
      &gt;96%, while the respiratory rate was determined with end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) of 32-37 mmHg.&#xD;
      These ventilator settings were maintained throughout the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CO2 insufflation was performed using the closed Veress needle technique with electronic&#xD;
      laparoflators in the patients who were placed in lateral semi-oblique (60°) and some flexion&#xD;
      (jackknife) positions before the surgery was started. Intra-abdominal pressure was maintained&#xD;
      at 8 mmHg in Group LS and at 14 mmHg in Group SP throughout the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the operation, a neuromuscular blockade was achieved with rocuronium infusion (0.3-0.4&#xD;
      mg/kg/hour) with a post-tetanic count of zero. At the end of the case, extubation was&#xD;
      provided by decurarizing the rocuronium with a combination of 0.02mg/kg atropine and 0.04&#xD;
      mg/kg neostigmine. All patients were followed up with nasopharyngeal temperature monitoring&#xD;
      and were actively warmed using a forced-air warming system to ensure normothermia throughout&#xD;
      the surgery. Patients were followed up in the recovery unit at the end of the surgery until&#xD;
      their modified Aldrete score reached ≤9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamics The data of mean arterial pressure (MAP), peak heart rate (HR), SpO2, and ETCO2&#xD;
      were recorded at baseline, at 1 minute after induction, and then every 5 minutes until the&#xD;
      patient went to the recovery unit. MAP and HR values were kept at ±20% of preoperative values&#xD;
      by changing the remifentanil infusion rate. Hypotension MAP was defined as &lt;60 mmHg and&#xD;
      bradycardia HR as 45 beats/minute, and these were treated with noradrenaline 4-8 mcg,&#xD;
      atropine 0.5 mg. Patients who required noradrenaline or atropine more than twice were&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The patients were randomly classified into 2 groups. The patients given the low-pressure pneumoperitoneum (8 mmHg) treatment were called Group LP (n = 30), and the patients given the standard pressure treatment (14 mmHg) were called Group SP (n = 30). Each patient and the anesthesiologist responsible for that patient's anesthesia management were blinded to the group assignments.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Patients were randomly classified into 2 groups using opaque sealed envelopes. Randomization was performed using a computer-generated random number list, and a statement indicating the patient's group was placed in a closed envelope numbered according to the result.

    <measure>Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2)</measure>
    <time_frame>The rSO2 value changes were recorded from baseline until the patient was referred to the recovery unit, up to 160 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>The rSO2 measurements were made using the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) method. For this, prior to induction, the cerebral oximetry sensor was placed at least 2 cm above the eyebrows and 3 cm from the midline in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Measurements were recorded at baseline, at 1 minute after induction, and then every 5 minutes until the patient went to the recovery unit. Baseline values were accepted as measurements in the last 30 seconds of preoxygenation for 3 minutes with 80% oxygen before induction. Cerebral desaturation was defined as a decrease in the rSO2 value of more than 25% from the baseline value (if the baseline value is &lt;50, the decrease should be more than 20%), with this condition lasting ≥15 seconds.</description>
