  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety as well as the most effective dose of&#xD;
      the alpha-lactalbumin vaccine (aLA breast cancer vaccine) to treat patients with&#xD;
      non-metastatic triple negative breast cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase I dose-escalation trial in which successive cohorts of&#xD;
      participants with high-risk triple-negative breast cancer will be treated with successively&#xD;
      higher doses of α-lactalbumin and zymosan&#xD;
&#xD;
      This aLA breast cancer vaccine is an investigational (experimental) drug that the study team&#xD;
      believes will work by stimulating the immune system to fight the participant's cancer, in a&#xD;
      way similar to the way the immune system fights off an infection after a vaccination for that&#xD;
      infection. α-lactalbumin Vaccine is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A traditional &quot;3+3&quot; Phase I trial design will be employed to determined the Maximum Tolerated&#xD;
      Dose (MTD). After identification of the MTD, if at least 1 participant has an immunologic&#xD;
      response (correlative measurement), successively lower dose levels will be expanded to a&#xD;
      total of 6 participants and immunologic response assessed. Enrollment will stop if a dose&#xD;
      level is reached for which no responses are observed. Dose-Limiting toxicities (DLTs) in 2 or&#xD;
      more of 6 participants, the next lower dose will be considered the new MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives are to determine MTD, DLT incidence, and Lowest Immunologic Dose (LID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be assessed every 2 weeks until day 56 and at day 84 or at off-study.&#xD;
      Participants will be offered participation in long-term follow-up involving contact or&#xD;
      in-person follow-up for late toxicity and survival every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months&#xD;
      for an additional 3 years, and then annually for 10 years.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be treated with successively higher doses of α-lactalbumin and zymosan in a traditional 3 + 3 phase I trial design. Treatment will involve a course of 3 vaccinations given every 2 weeks. Participants will be enrolled sequentially into 1 of 3 different dose levels each comprised of cohorts of 1-6 participants until the MTD has been identified (intra-patient dose escalation not permitted), after which the MTD will be expanded to 6 participants. Successively lower doses will be expanded to 6 participants until the lowest DL associated with immune response has been expanded. A dose level intermediate between 100 and 1000 mcg will be studied if the 1000 mcg dose is above the MTD and the 100 mcg dose does not produce the desired immunologic effect&#xD;
Dose Level (DL) 1: 10 microgram (mcg) a-lactalbumin + 10 mcg Zymosan&#xD;
