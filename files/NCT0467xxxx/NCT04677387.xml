  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) in which 120 pharmacists will be randomized&#xD;
      to an experimental or control group and data on naloxone dispensing and secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will be collected over the course of the RCT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot RCT that will evaluate the impact of naloxone communication&#xD;
      training (Nalox-Comm) on 120 pharmacists' naloxone dispensing behaviors (primary outcome).&#xD;
      Data will be collected at baseline, immediately after training is completed, and at 3-month&#xD;
      follow up. Data sources include pharmacy records (for naloxone dispensing), simulated patient&#xD;
      observations (to rate quality of communication), and survey data (for self-reports of&#xD;
      knowledge and self-efficacy).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the number of times Naloxone is dispensed over a 6 month period</measure>
    <time_frame>3-month period before and 3-month period after pharmacist completes intervention training</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacy records will indicate the number of times each pharmacy dispensed naloxone over the RCT period. These data will be aggregated into the total number of naloxone fills in the 3 months pre-intervention and the 3 months postintervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Willingness to Dispense Naloxone Score at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>An online survey including 6 self-reported Likert-scale items will assess pharmacists' willingness to dispense naloxone. Four items from the Nielsen naloxone attitudes scale and 2 items from the Wilson Hospital-based Overdose Prevention and Education (HOPE) measure will be used. These items assess pharmacists' willingness to engage in naloxone counseling activities, including educating patients to recognize overdose and administer naloxone, proactively identify individuals for naloxone dispensation, and dispense naloxone. Response options will range from 1= &quot;not at all willing&quot; to 4= &quot;very willing.&quot; Items will be averaged to create a mean willingness score (range = 1-4), with higher scores indicating more willingness to dispense naloxone. Mean willingness scores will be calculated at baseline and 3 months post-intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Naloxone Counselling Self-Efficacy Score at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>An online survey including 6 self-reported Likert-scale items will assess pharmacists' self-efficacy to counsel about naloxone. Four items from the Nielsen naloxone attitudes scale and 2 items from the Wilson HOPE measure will be used. Pharmacists will be asked to rate their confidence to engage in various naloxone communication tasks including: engage in naloxone counseling when the pharmacy is busy and discuss naloxone in a way that does not offend customers. Response options will range from 1= &quot;not at all confident&quot; to 4= &quot;very confident.&quot; Items will be averaged to create a mean self-efficacy score (range = 1-4), with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy to dispense naloxone. Mean self-efficacy scores will be calculated at baseline and 3 months post-intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Pharmacist Quality of Non-verbal Communication score up to 1 month post-training</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month period after pharmacist completes intervention training</time_frame>
    <description>Simulated patients (SPs) will call pharmacists and use a validated observation guide that has been adapted for use for telephone interactions to rate the pharmacists' quality of non-verbal communication. The guide includes 4 items (i.e., explained things clearly, listened carefully, showed respect, and spent enough time with the SP) measured on a 5-point scale (1= not at all satisfied, 2= partly satisfied, 3= satisfied, 4= more than satisfied, 5= very satisfied). Higher scores (range = 1-5) indicate a more positive evaluation of the interaction.</description>
