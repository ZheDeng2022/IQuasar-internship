  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is testing a drug called TenoMiR that is being developed for the treatment of&#xD;
      tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis). The study drug is a new compound that works by&#xD;
      improving the quality of the collagen which helps repair damage to the elbow. The study drug&#xD;
      is being developed in the hope of providing a more reliable treatment than those currently&#xD;
      available and can be given at the time of first diagnosis, so that recovery can begin as soon&#xD;
      as possible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TenoMiR a chemically synthesised mimic of microRNA-29a (miR29a) which has improved stability,&#xD;
      activity and cellular uptake while being non-immunogenic, has been created to restore miR29a&#xD;
      levels back to pre-injury levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TenoMiR is unique in directly targeting the key changes in collagen production associated&#xD;
      with tendinopathy. Unlike other therapies, TenoMiR has a well-defined mode-of-action that is&#xD;
      supported by a wealth of scientific data. Moreover, treatment with TenoMiR does not require&#xD;
      invasive biopsies and can be delivered at the point of initial diagnosis initiating recovery&#xD;
      at the very earliest time.&#xD;
