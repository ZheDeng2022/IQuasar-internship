  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn whether the study treatment (capmatinib), which already&#xD;
      shows efficacy and safety in non-Chinese patients, could help Chinese patients with&#xD;
      controlling their lung cancer in a safe way. Participants will have a type of lung cancer&#xD;
      called non-small cell lung lancer (NSCLC), with a specific alteration in a part of their DNA&#xD;
      (called mutation) of the MET gene, within a specific part of this gene called exon 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have advanced (or metastatic) non-small cell lung cancer with specific&#xD;
      mutations in the MET gene but without mutations in the EGFR or ALK genes, who are aged 18&#xD;
      years or older will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug, capmatinib (also known as INC280), is an oral drug that is called a&#xD;
      'targeted' medicine, which means it targets particular processes that may not be working&#xD;
      properly in cancer cells (called dysregulation). The dysregulation of the MET signaling in&#xD;
      cancer cells of patients with NSCLC is believed to make the cancer worse. Capmatinib has been&#xD;
      shown to selectively block the effects of the MET gene and therefore may help in keeping the&#xD;
      disease under control, stopping cancer cells from growing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter two-cohort phase II study. Chinese adult participants with&#xD;
      EGFR wild-type (wt) (EGFR mutations that predict sensitivity to EGFR therapy, including, but&#xD;
      not limited to exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R substitution mutations), anaplastic&#xD;
      lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement negative, advanced (stage IIIB, IIIC or IV) NSCLC disease&#xD;
      harboring MET exon 14-skipping (METÎ”ex14) mutations as determined by a Novartis central&#xD;
      molecular laboratory will be treated in this study. Cohort 1 will include treatment naive&#xD;
      participants and Cohort 2 participants who failed one or two prior lines of therapy in the&#xD;
      advanced stage (stage IIIB, IIIC or IV). Each participant will receive 400 mg capmatinib&#xD;
      tablet twice daily (BID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the overall response rate (ORR) by cohort as per the blinded&#xD;
      independent review committee (BIRC) review. ORR is defined as the proportion of participants&#xD;
      with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according&#xD;
      to RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be performed using full analysis set (FAS). The primary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoint ORR will be estimated and the exact 95% confidence interval (CI) will be provided by&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;
