    <textblock>
      This is a community project carried out jointly by the Technological Institute of Higher&#xD;
      Studies of the West (ITESO), the University Center of Tonalá of the University of Guadalajara&#xD;
      (CUTonalá) and the University Center of Health Sciences of the University of Guadalajara (&#xD;
      CUCS) with advice from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP), financed by the&#xD;
      Tresmontes Lucchetti company and endorsed by the Jalisco Association of Nutritionists, AC&#xD;
      (AJANUT). This project follows the provisions of the &quot;National Strategy for the Prevention&#xD;
      and Control of Overweight, Obesity and Diabetes&quot; signed by the executive branch of the&#xD;
      Federal Government. In particular, this project is inserted within the Public Health&#xD;
      Strategy, in the strategic axis of Health Promotion and educational communication (while&#xD;
      still having an impact on the axes of Epidemiological Surveillance and Prevention). In&#xD;
      addition, it follows the agreement in which the general guidelines for the expenditure and&#xD;
      distribution of food and beverages prepared and processed in the schools of the National&#xD;
      Educational System were obtained, proposed by the Ministries of Health and Public Education.&#xD;
      The aforementioned referrals are intended to protect and improve the health of Mexican&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project is a community trial that will last three years, which includes an intervention&#xD;
      group and a control group of three schools each. Acatlán de Juárez has a total of 11&#xD;
      elementary schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strategies will be implemented in collaboration with the authorities of the Acatlán de&#xD;
      Juárez community, the school authorities, ITESO staff, CUTonalá, CUCS, and AJANUT. Key actors&#xD;
      from both the school and community levels will be involved through the study to adapt the&#xD;
      strategies socially and culturally to promote community project ownership. An initial study&#xD;
      of the viability of the project and the current conditions of food and physical activity in&#xD;
      school facilities will be carried out, as well as the perception of the community. The&#xD;
      research team will design the contents and materials of the intervention taking into account&#xD;
      the opinions and suggestions of the community and the results of the initial study. The&#xD;
      schools of the control group will be chosen from the municipality of Villa Corona, Jalisco,&#xD;
      which is similar to Acatlán de Juárez.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strategies proposed for intervention by the research team, which will be agreed with the&#xD;
      community, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surveillance in compliance with the regulation of the sale of food in school buildings,&#xD;
           according to official guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensitization of children, parents, teachers (especially those in charge of the physical&#xD;
           education class) and personnel in charge of the food supply (school cooperative), to&#xD;
           improve acceptance and commitment to the regulation of the sale of food&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Training for the preparation of hygienic and healthy food for the personnel in charge of&#xD;
           food sale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Promotion of the consumption of simple water and healthy foods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rescue and promotion of the consumption of regional foods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reconditioning of the infrastructure for the consumption of simple water, free and&#xD;
           healthy food, and the realization of physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Organization of events and support in the coordination of groups that promote physical&#xD;
           activity at the community level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optimization of physical education classes at school sites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implementation of health promotion and care actions in the school context&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of skills in the school community for health care and generation of healthy&#xD;
           school environments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Creation and strengthening of health and nutrition committees in schools, with the&#xD;
           participation of directors, teachers and parents to generate necessary and permanent&#xD;
           conditions that favor healthy environments&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve a greater rapprochement with the population, qualitative instruments will also be&#xD;
      implemented before the intervention, such as focus groups and in-depth interviews, which&#xD;
      allow the identification of barriers and possible solutions to improve eating habits and&#xD;
      promote physical activity in the population. Likewise, during the intermediate and final&#xD;
      measurement phases, similar qualitative strategies will be applied to rescue successes and&#xD;
      points for improvement of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the implementation of the strategies, meticulous monitoring of the localities will be&#xD;
      carried out to identify significant changes that may affect the eating habits and physical&#xD;
      activity in either of the two groups (intervention and control).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Monitoring and evaluation of the impact of the intervention will be carried out through a community trial. There will be three schools in each study group (intervention and control). There will be three measurement periods: a baseline in the 2015-2016 school year, an intermediate measurement in the 2016-2017 school year, and a final measurement in the 2017-2018 school year. The measurement periods will have an estimated duration of two months.&#xD;
In the measurement periods, the body composition of the children from 1st to 4th grade will be obtained, and they will be followed up for two years; The dynamics of water and food consumption, physical activity, functional physical capacities, as well as availability and accessibility of food in schools will be identified. In addition, from a sub-sample of the study subjects, questionnaires on the frequency of food consumption, additional anthropometric measurements, and venous blood will be obtained to determine glucose and blood lipid levels.</intervention_model_description>
