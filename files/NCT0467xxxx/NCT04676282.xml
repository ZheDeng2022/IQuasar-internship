  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting two experimental surveys to explore clinical and&#xD;
      psychological factors that influence older adults' willingness to stop medications in the&#xD;
      face of polypharmacy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Around one-half of older adults take one or more medications that are inappropriate or&#xD;
      medically unnecessary. These medications can cause side effects that are unacceptable to&#xD;
      patients. Several studies provide guidance to clinicians about the process of stopping&#xD;
      specific types of medications (e.g., steps that clinicians can take to reduce and stop a&#xD;
      medication for anxiety or difficulty sleeping). However, these approaches are not always&#xD;
      successful. A critical gap with these approaches is they tend to focus on the medication,&#xD;
      rather than the patient, and their individual needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research team seeks to learn more about factors that are important to patients when they&#xD;
      consider reducing or stopping a medication. The investigators will do this by conducting two&#xD;
      surveys each with 4,800 older adults across four countries (United States, United Kingdom,&#xD;
      Netherlands, and Australia). Each participant will be asked to give their opinions on a&#xD;
      hypothetical patient scenario that has been developed by our diverse team in partnership with&#xD;
      our stakeholder organizations. In the first survey, the investigators will examine how the&#xD;
      reason for using the medication (e.g. preventing a disease or treating symptoms of a disease)&#xD;
      as well as the reason for a recommendation to stop the medication (e.g. lack of benefit vs.&#xD;
      potential for harm) influence older adults' willingness to stop medications. In the second&#xD;
      survey, the investigators will examine how different social and clinical factors and whether&#xD;
      the participant is making a recommendation about oneself (as if they were the patient in the&#xD;
      case) or on behalf of the patient in the case (e.g., if it was their friend) influence their&#xD;
      willingness to stop medications. The investigators will work with Qualtrics, an international&#xD;
      company that distributes surveys, to collect this data that does not include any identifying&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that once the survey is designed and show that it is successful&#xD;
      for studying patient perspectives about stopping medicines, it can then apply the same study&#xD;
      approach to test the effect of other relevant factor that may influence the decision to stop&#xD;
      or reduce a medication. The investigators anticipate that our research will significantly&#xD;
      contribute to our understanding of how older adults make decisions about stopping&#xD;
      medications. This information will be helpful to researchers and clinicians to ensure future&#xD;
      services can be developed to best support patients to make decisions about stopping or&#xD;
      reducing inappropriate or unnecessary medication.&#xD;
