  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MicrSoy-20 (MS-20), a fermented soymilk product, has been approved as an Over the counter&#xD;
      (OTC) drug in 2011. The therapeutic effect of MS-20 is to ameliorate symptoms such as fatigue&#xD;
      and loss of appetite caused by cancer chemotherapy. Animal study revealed orally&#xD;
      administration of MS-20 daily for 4 weeks altered the gut microbiota composition in mice. In&#xD;
      addition, MS-20 could activate dendritic cell and improve immunotherapy response rate. Thus,&#xD;
      it was hypothesis that MS-20 improves host immune activity thus ameliorate fatigue and&#xD;
      increase weight is through alteration the gut microbiota composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the ability of MS-20 in modulating gut microbiota and the subset of microbiome&#xD;
      to be altered by MS-20 was investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-initiated randomized trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of MS-20 on gut microbiota composition and abundance in healthy people.&#xD;
      Approximately 100 subjects who meet the criteria of this study are planned to be enrolled.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive placebo or MS-20 in a 1:1 ratio with 50&#xD;
      subjects in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprises of a 7 days screening period, a 8-week treatment period and a 8-week&#xD;
      follow-up period. Eligible subjects will receive MS-20 or placebo every day during the&#xD;
      treatment period. Participants should not use any probiotics and prebiotics during the trial.&#xD;
      In addition, All medications (especially antibiotics) should be recorded and documented,&#xD;
      however, fluoroquinolones and vancomycin will be banned during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fecal gut microbiota, serum, and urea were collect at indicated time. The gut microbiota&#xD;
      composition, gut microbiota metabolite, and serum biochemical items will be analysed.&#xD;
