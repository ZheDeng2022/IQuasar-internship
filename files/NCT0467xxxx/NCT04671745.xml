  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dressing repairs cause distress and pain in children. Although drug analgesia is commonly&#xD;
      used, some young children experience pain, distress and agitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these cases, the practice of care is not in line with a child-centred approach (CCC). In&#xD;
      addition, the use of non-pharmacological methods is recommended to optimize a child&#xD;
      procedural pain management . In addition, the use of non-pharmacological methods is&#xD;
      recommended to optimize a child procedural pain management in pediatrics. For this reason,&#xD;
      interactive music can be proposed during the course of care. We suggest that interactive&#xD;
      music transforms behaviour, attitudes, beliefs and convictions of the child, parents and&#xD;
      caregivers during the dressing process, thereby altering the perception of pain and the&#xD;
      overall experience of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this qualitative study is to explore what happens when children receive dressings&#xD;
      in the presence of a musician trained in interactive music distribution in a hospital.&#xD;
      Qualitative data will be generated through observation of clinical procedures by&#xD;
      non-participant observers (n25) and semi-structured interviews with the musician, healthcare&#xD;
      professionals, parents and children to explore this phenomenon from the participants'&#xD;
      perspective. The data will be analysed by constant comparison. We will examine the actions,&#xD;
      inactions and interactions of healthcare professionals, parents and children during dressing&#xD;
      changes through the central theoretical concept of 'Child Centered Care'.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain and distress in children as a result of care procedures is documented (1) (2). Acute&#xD;
      pain may have consequences in the short and long term(6) (7) (8,9). According to a Canadian&#xD;
      study(10) the prevalence of procedural pain is 78% in the first 24 hours of hospitalization,&#xD;
      dressing changes are common and are part of procedures that generate pain, including severe&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of distress and anxiety is demontred in the modulation of pain perception&#xD;
      (18,19). Therefore, the prevention of procedural pain must be multimodal (20). The value of&#xD;
      non-pharmacological means to reduce pain and reduce the distress of the child during&#xD;
      procedures is documented. (21-26). These approaches also help to limit the use of restraint&#xD;
      during procedure. This practice is strating to be explored in the professional literature&#xD;
      (27-32). The hypothesis of &quot;transient empathic blindness&quot; in the use of strong restraint&#xD;
      during care &quot; (37) could help to understand what happens in these circumstances. This&#xD;
      phenomenon is to be linked to either a child-centred approach or one that focuses on the&#xD;
      performance of the procedure. The Child Centered Care Theory suggests that child-centered&#xD;
      care should be produced by focusing on the child himself or herself (38,39). These approaches&#xD;
      are based on a combination of attitudes and behaviours that adjust to the child's reactions,&#xD;
      welcome his emotions, respect his pacing, and allow him to make choices. This observation&#xD;
      opens up new perspectives in the way in which the role of non-pharmacological methods is&#xD;
      considered, particularly those involving more specifically human interactions. For they allow&#xD;
      a practical and effective mediation of the relationship with the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a review of the literature concerning the effectiveness of integrative&#xD;
      approaches to pain and anxiety in children and adolescents with cancer (46), music is one of&#xD;
      the main strategies used by paediatric professionals to reduce pain and anxiety in children&#xD;
      with distraction, virtual reality, hypno-analgesia, and massage, although the lack of&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials concerning the use of these methods is to be deplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized clinical trials on the value of music for procedural (23,53,54) or postoperative&#xD;
      (55-57) pain have been conducted. There are several modalities for using music in the health&#xD;
      field. These may be listening to recorded music (55,58,59) or to a specific programme to be&#xD;
      listened to, or listening to so-called interactive music, i.e. a live musical session with&#xD;
      the child by a musician (60,61). Interactive (or active) music, i.e., provided by a qualified&#xD;
      musician trained in hospital intervention, using voice, body language and facial expression,&#xD;
      can involve the child in a way that recorded music cannot (62). A meta-analysis of 30 early&#xD;
      studies of the use of music in medical and dental procedures supports this assertion (63).&#xD;
      One study compared the effects of live singing and guitar playing on adult patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for cancer with the effects of recorded music of the same type. Active music&#xD;
      allows for personalized musical expression that can be improvised in the context of care.&#xD;
      This can be particularly crucial for young children to feel more comfortable. Indeed, musical&#xD;
      support provided by song and an instrument may be best adapted to the child's immediate&#xD;
      experience, as well as that of the parents and healthcare professionals providing the&#xD;
      treatment. Indeed, we can imagine that music can help to introduce good interaction, which&#xD;
      helps to regulate professional relations and relations with the patient and other&#xD;
      professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Live music was found to be more effective than recorded music in reducing anxiety and&#xD;
      discomfort. (65) It is also known that parental stress can be significant when their child is&#xD;
      ill and during medical procedures(68,69). Listening to music can reduce parental stress and&#xD;
      improve parent-child interactions(48,70).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (48,70) Based on this finding, interactive music can transform the behaviours, attitudes,&#xD;
      beliefs and convictions of the child, parents and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this observation, we could imagine that interactive music transforms the behaviours,&#xD;
      attitudes, beliefs and convictions of the child, parents and caregivers when performing&#xD;
      dressings, thus changing the child's approach and thus his behaviour and perception of&#xD;
      treatment and pain. It is proposed that a child-centred approach improves care. The research&#xD;
      hypothesis is therefore about the possibility that interactive music may promote a&#xD;
      child-centred approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no qualitative study has investigated the use of interactive music from the&#xD;
      perspective of the participants in the theoretical perspective of the child-centred approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative research could explore what happens when children receive dressings on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis in the presence of a musician trained in interactive music distribution at a&#xD;
      teaching hospital by generating qualitative data through non-participatory observations of&#xD;
      clinical procedures and semi-structured interviews with participants (musicians, health&#xD;
      professionals, parents and children).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to question the triangulation of interactions from a philosophical and political&#xD;
      perspective. The originality of this research is to seek to highlight the impact of&#xD;
      interactive music on the philosophy of care through the central theoretical concept of &quot;Child&#xD;
      Centered Care&quot;. More globally, the vocation of this qualitative study is to widen the&#xD;
      questioning to the political dimension by questioning the intervention of interactive music&#xD;
      (human intervention) as a mediator of the social link. This exploratory qualitative study&#xD;
      guided by the principles of grounded theory (71,72) will examine the actions, inactions and&#xD;
      interactions that occur throughout the course of dressing changes, with an emphasis on the&#xD;
      child's place in the interactions.&#xD;
