      This study is a prospective, multicenter, real world, observational study intended to&#xD;
      understand the impact of tibial run off on clinical outcome of endovascular therapy in&#xD;
      Femoropopliteal lesions. It is estimated that 1200 patients with chronic femoral popliteal&#xD;
      artery occlusion were enrolled in the group at 8 centers nationwide from January 2021 to&#xD;
      December 2022. Two groups would be divided according to whether or not the tibial run off&#xD;
      intervened for reconstruction. The intervention group and the non-intervention group. The&#xD;
      intervention group would be evaluated Run-off score again after the tibial run off&#xD;
      reconstructed. The the Society for Vascular Surgery(SVS) run-off score would be used for the&#xD;
      score of the tibial run off. The total score of the tibial run off would be 19 points, 1&#xD;
      point indicating healthy run off. According to the quality of the run off, the preoperative&#xD;
      patients would be divided into 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, and &gt;15 points. The follow-up would be&#xD;
      conducted at 1, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the operation. As it is a real world study,&#xD;
      there is no determined end point.The main indicators would be observed including the&#xD;
      reintervention rate driven by lesions' clinical symptoms, the rate of primary patency of the&#xD;
      femoral popliteal artery, the improvement of quality of life score and rutherford grading.&#xD;

      Arteriosclerosis obliterans of lower extremities (arteriosclerosis obliterans, ASO) is a&#xD;
      common and frequently-occurring disease in middle-aged and elderly people, and also an&#xD;
      important manifestation of atherosclerosis in lower extremities.ASO is reported to be present&#xD;
      in approximately 12%-14% of the population, increasing to 20% of the population over the age&#xD;
      of 75.The current treatment methods of ASO include pharmacotherapy, surgical procedures,&#xD;
      endovascular treatment, combined surgery, and autologous peripheral blood stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (ASCT), etc.Endovascular treatment of ASO for lower limbs has the advantages&#xD;
      of safety, effectiveness and fewer complications, and has become the preferred treatment for&#xD;
      ASO.Endovascular treatment mainly includes: percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and&#xD;
      bare stent implantation. Currently, the most commonly used surgical options include: ordinary&#xD;
      balloon dilatation + drug-coated balloon (DCB) dilatation + bare stent implantation.A number&#xD;
      of studies have proved that DCB and bare stent are more effective than common PTA, but&#xD;
      postoperative restenosis in ASO is always a difficulty.In addition to the chronic total&#xD;
      occlusion or diffuse lesion of the lower extremity arteries, the inferior genicular artery&#xD;
      outflow channel, age, diabetes, hemodialysis and critical limb ischemia are all&#xD;
      related.Matsumi J, et al. found that patency of the inferior genicular artery may be an&#xD;
      important predictor of adverse events after the SMART stent implantation in patients with&#xD;
      popliteal artery disease, and the preservation of the distal outflow tract may be beneficial&#xD;
      to reduce the rate of restenosis Early analysis of the patency rate of inferior genicular&#xD;
      artery bypass found that poor outflow tract could lead to an increase in bypass thrombosis&#xD;
      events.Matsumi J,et al. found that patency of the Early analysis of the patency rate of&#xD;
      inferior genicular artery bypass found that poor outflow tract could lead to an increase in&#xD;
      bypass thrombosis events. may be an important predictor of adverse events after SMART stent&#xD;
      implantation in patients with popliteal artery disease, and the preservation of the distal&#xD;
      outflow tract may be beneficial to reduce the rate of restenosis.Daniel M et al. conducted a&#xD;
      retrospective analysis of 95 patients with femoral popliteal artery stent implantation and&#xD;
      found that,for patients with poor subgenual artery outflow tract, the number of additional&#xD;
      inferior genicular artery during femoral artery stent implantation usually leads to better&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.the number of inferior genicular artery shown by preoperative angiography&#xD;
      is an independent predictor of post-stent clinical outcomes.This study demonstrates the&#xD;
      importance of distal outflow tract clinical outcomes after stent implantation.Yusuke W,et al.&#xD;
      conducted a retrospective study on 199 patients with chronic popliteal artery occlusion and&#xD;
      found that additional inferior genicular artery opening during stent implantation was&#xD;
      beneficial to the patency rate of the stent and clinical results .However, the current&#xD;
      analysis of the influence of the tibial run off on the femoral popliteal patency is mainly a&#xD;
      retrospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to evaluate the patency of the tibial run off through a prospective&#xD;
      multicenter observational real world study, whether it has an impact on the therapeutic&#xD;
      effect after endovascular treatment in femoral popliteal artery , and whether one-stage&#xD;
      reconstruction of the tibial run off can improve the postoperative patency rate of&#xD;
      endovascular treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The VascuQol was designed as a questionnaire containing five domains: pain (4 items), symptoms (4 items), activities (8 items), social (2 items), and emotional (7 items) to evaluate Health related quality of life (HRQL). Every item has seven response options, with scores ranging from 1 to 7. A total score is the sum of all 25 item scores divided by 25.And both the total score as well as the domain scores range from 1 (worst HRQL) to 7 (best HRQL).The lower the value, the poorer the quality of life.</description>

    <description>The Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) classification system was created to encompass demographic changes and expanding techniques of revascularization to perform meaningful analyses of outcomes in the treatment of the threatened limb,including wound,ischemia and foot infection.Each index was evaluated by very low,low,moderate and high,the very low represents no risk,the high reveals high risk of amputation.</description>
