  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center&#xD;
      study in adult patients with mild controlled allergic asthma and house dust mite allergy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of a screening phase, a treatment phase and a follow-up phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will undergo a bronchial allergen provocation (BAP) with mite allergen to&#xD;
      assess the asthmatic response before and after treatment. Subjects will be randomized to two&#xD;
      parallel treatment groups. Each subject will be treated weekly over 12 weeks either with test&#xD;
      product or with the reference product (placebo).&#xD;
