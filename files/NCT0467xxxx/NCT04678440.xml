  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, healthy volunteers and patients with advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer&#xD;
      will undergo [18F]F-AraG dynamic imaging on the uEXPLORER total body Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography/Computerized Tomography scanner to obtain preliminary data regarding&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and early biodistribution images.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      [18F]F-AraG, a fluorine-18 labeled analog of an FDA approved drug (Nelarabine) is a new&#xD;
      imaging tracer targeted at imaging activated T-cells. Given that immunotherapeutic&#xD;
      strategies, in particular immune checkpoint antibodies, focus on the generation of&#xD;
      T-cell-based antitumor immunity, uptake of [18F]F-AraG within the tumor is hypothesized to&#xD;
      correlate with T-cell mediated immune response seen in the biopsy samples of cancer patients&#xD;
      treated with immune checkpoint blockade. Correlation of pre- and post-treatment intratumoral&#xD;
      immune infiltration by means of PET imaging will guide the development of future clinical&#xD;
      trials investigating the role of [18F]F-AraG in the monitoring of anti-tumor immune&#xD;
      responses. Therefore, proper quantification of [18F]F-AraG uptake in tumor lesions, and&#xD;
      understanding its relation with physiologic uptake in background tissues is important. Note:&#xD;
      checkpoint therapy in this study is standard-of-care and is not under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available PET/CT scanners can obtain dynamic images only on a portion of the body as large as&#xD;
      their axial field of view, generally anywhere between 15-30 cm. The 194 cm long uEXPLORER&#xD;
      total-body PET scanner is the world's first device to offer the ability to tomographically&#xD;
      image all parts of the body simultaneously. Thus, the uEXPLORER PET/CT (now commercially&#xD;
      available and with FDA 510(k) clearance) is the only scanner in the world capable of&#xD;
      acquiring total-body dynamic images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, 2-4 healthy volunteers will undergo [18F]F-AraG dynamic imaging on the&#xD;
      uEXPLORER total body PET/CT scanner to obtain preliminary data regarding pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      early biodistribution images. In addition, 2-4 patients with advanced NSCLC and planned for&#xD;
      standard-of-care PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy will undergo [18F]F-AraG dynamic imaging similarly&#xD;
      on the uEXPLORER total body PET/CT scanner to obtain data regarding pharmacokinetics of the&#xD;
      tracer in tumor lesions in the context of normal tissue uptake. An optional second similar&#xD;
      scan will be performed 7-14 days after the first dose of immunotherapy to explore and&#xD;
      document any treatment related changes in [18F]F-AraG uptake and kinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study and data collected will be important to recommend an ideal time to acquire a whole&#xD;
      body static scan using conventional and widely available PET/CT scanners for adequate tumor&#xD;
      to background contrast and quantification, which in turn, will be essential for further&#xD;
      clinical development of [18F]F-AraG to aid the monitoring of anti tumor immune responses.&#xD;
