  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the third study in a series of 3 studies to develop a smartphone app to support&#xD;
      nondaily smokers in quitting smoking, as funded by the American Cancer Society grant #RSG&#xD;
      CPPB - 130323 (project dates: 07/01/2017 - 6/30/2021). Study 1 (2017P001106) demonstrated&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability when smokers were onboarded in person. Study 2 (2018P002699)&#xD;
      demonstrated feasibility and acceptability when smokers were onboarded remotely, nationwide.&#xD;
      The present study is Study 3. It is a 3-group proof-of-concept RCT, in which we seek to test&#xD;
      if our app (i.e., Version 3 of our developed smartphone app, called 'Smiling instead of&#xD;
      Smoking' (SiS)) is superior to treatment as usual (i.e., TAU) and superior to a control app&#xD;
      (i.e., the National Cancer Institute's smartphone app &quot;QuitGuide&quot; (QG).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a nation-wide proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial conducted entirely&#xD;
      remotely. Participation will last 6 months and entails:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completing a scripted onboarding call (approximately 30-45 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Making a quit attempt&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Engaging with smoking cessation support (randomized) over the course of seven weeks, one&#xD;
           week prior and 6 weeks following the originally chosen quit day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completing five online, REDCap-administered surveys, administered prior to the quit day&#xD;
           (online, as part of a screening test), and at 2-week, 6-week, 3-month, and 6-month&#xD;
           follow-ups of the participant's chosen quit day&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test for differences between randomized groups on the primary outcome (i.e.,&#xD;
           self-efficacy to remain abstinent, as measured via the Smoking Self-Efficacy&#xD;
           Questionnaire), as measured at end of treatment (i.e., 6 weeks after the participants'&#xD;
           chosen smoking quit day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test for differences between randomized groups on secondary outcomes (as listed in&#xD;
           Detailed Protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. (exploratory) To test, via mediational modeling, how treatment via the proposed app&#xD;
           conferred benefit; or, if not effective, if failure is due to the treatment failing to&#xD;
           impact hypothesized mechanisms of change, or because these mechanisms fail to impact&#xD;
           outcome.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Smoking Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks post quit day</time_frame>
    <description>The Smoking Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SEQ-12) (Etter, Bergman, Humair, &amp; Perneger, 2000) is a two-dimensional 12-item self-report scale measuring a person's confidence in his or her ability to abstain from smoking when facing internal stimuli (e.g. feeling depressed) and external stimuli (e.g. being with smokers) on a 0-100 slider scale (i.e., 0=not at all confident that I can refrain; 100=extremely confident that I can refrain). Scale scores are created by mean scoring across items and range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate greater self-efficacy to abstain from smoking.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported 30-day point-prevalence abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks post quit day</time_frame>
    <description>Participants respond to the multiple choice question, &quot;what is your current smoking status? (I smoke daily, I smoke non-daily (and have smoked in the past 7 days), I smoke nondaily (but have NOT smoked in the past 7 days), I do not smoke at all). If participants report abstinence they are asked, &quot;have you been abstinent during the past 30 days?&quot; (yes/no).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported past week cigarette change</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks post quit day</time_frame>
    <description>If participants report having smoked in the past 7 days, they will be asked to indicate how many cigarettes they smoked each day (&quot;Last Monday:, Last Sunday:). Changes in cigarette consumption will be calculated by subtracting the number of cigarettes smoked in the week leading up to the baseline assessment, as measured in the baseline survey, from the number of cigarettes smoked in the week leading up to the 2, 6, 12, and 24 week assessments, as assessed in these respective surveys.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with smoking cessation support</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at treatment end (6-week)</time_frame>
    <description>As measured using the Client Satisfaction Scale (CSQ-8) (Larsen, 1979), an 8 item multiple choice measure that will be used to assess participants' satisfaction with the smoking cessation support they receive (e.g., &quot;How satisfied are you with the amount of help you received?&quot;). Scores are summed across items and range from 8 to 32, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time spent applying content brought up by the apps/&quot;Clearing the Air&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at treatment end (6-week)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the following single item, &quot;During this past week, how much time did you spend applying or contemplating the content of the SiS app/QG app/&quot;Clearing the Air&quot;?&quot; [in minutes].</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of smoking cessation strategies</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at treatment end (6-week)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using a 19-item measure in which participants rate the extent to which they agree or disagree with statements about the smoking cessation support they received and the things they did while quitting (5-point Likert scale, 1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree, eg, &quot;I used techniques to help me relax&quot;). Higher scores indicate greater use of smoking cessation strategies.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived impact of the provided materials on quitting</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at treatment end (6-week)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants provide their level of agreement (5-point Likert scale, 1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree) on 17 items pertaining to the helpfulness of the app during the quitting process (eg, risky situations, take my quit attempt seriously, prepare for the quit attempt). Higher scores indicate a greater perceived impact of the materials on quitting. Participants also indicate if the app helped them in their quit attempt and if they would recommend it to a friend who wants to quit smoking (yes/no).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Appreciation</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at treatment end (6-week)</time_frame>
    <description>As measured using the Appreciation Scale, (Adler &amp; Fagley, 2005) an 18-item scale assessing the degree to which one is appreciative. Ten of the items assess frequency of action (e.g., &quot;I do things to remind myself to be thankful&quot; 7-point Likert: 1 = More than once a day, 2 = About once a day, 3 = About once a week, 4 = About once a month, 5 = About once a year, 6 = A few times in my life, 7 = Never). The remaining eight items assess level of agreement with appreciative statements (e.g., &quot;I feel that it is a miracle to be alive&quot; 7-point Likert: 1 = Strongly agree, 2 = Agree, 3 = Agree somewhat, 4 = Neither agree nor disagree, 5= Disagree somewhat, 6 = Disagree, 7 = Strongly disagree). Scale scores are created by mean scoring and range from 1 to 7 with higher scores indicating greater appreciation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Actual app usage (SiS and QG only)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks post quit day</time_frame>
    <description>Number of days participants used the assigned app during the prescribed period of app use (i.e., 7 weeks for both apps). App usage is passively recorded by the app, which time-stamps every interaction with the app.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported app usage (SiS and QG only)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 weeks post quit day</time_frame>
    <description>Number of days used app, asked per week; if used, how many minutes per typical day used app</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Likability rating of the app (SiS and QG only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at treatment end (6-week)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the single item, &quot;How much did you like using the smoking cessation app we asked you to use?&quot; Participants respond on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = I strongly disliked using the app, 2 = I somewhat disliked using the app, 3 = I neither liked nor disliked using the app; 4 = I somewhat liked using the app, and 5 = I strongly liked using the app).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction rating of the smoking cessation support (SiS and QG only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at treatment end (6-week)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the single item, &quot;How satisfied are you with the smoking cessation support this app provided you with?&quot; Participants respond on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = very unsatisfied, 2 = somewhat dissatisfied, 3 = neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 4 = somewhat satisfied, 5 = very satisfied).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>App usability ratings (SiS and QG only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at treatment end (6-week)</time_frame>
    <description>As assessed via the System Usability Scale (SUS; Brooke, 1996), a ten-item attitude scale giving a global view of subjective assessments of usability, adapted to include language specific to the smoking app (e.g., &quot;I found the smoking app unnecessarily complex&quot; 5-point Likert: 1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). Scale scores range from 0 to 100 with greater scores indicating a more favorable perception of usability of the app.</description>
