  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NEOS post-market clinical follow-up study is undertaken to demonstrate the safety and&#xD;
      clinical performance of E-vita OPEN NEO in the treatment of aneurysm or dissection in the&#xD;
      ascending aorta, aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients will be observed who receive an E-vita OPEN NEO implant for the&#xD;
      treatment of thoracic aneurysm or acute or chronic thoracic dissection. E-vita OPEN NEO will&#xD;
      be implanted according to the instructions for use and at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating physicians will provide their observations collected during routine care for&#xD;
      patients treated with E-vita OPEN NEO. Written informed consent, specifically allowing the&#xD;
      use of clinical records for this observational study, will be obtained from every patient&#xD;
      prior to data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The period of data collection will be approximately 60 months from the date of intervention&#xD;
      for each patient. Source data verification will be performed on 100% of the patients; data&#xD;
      from all the visits that was provided in the database will be reviewed and verified against&#xD;
      existing source documents. Complete DICOM image files of the CT scans will be sent to the&#xD;
      CoreLab for independent evaluation. All adverse events defined prior to study start will be&#xD;
      adjudicated by the Clinical Event Committee (CEC).&#xD;
