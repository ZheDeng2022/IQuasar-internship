      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steroid induced glaucoma(SIG) is a form of open-angle glaucoma associated with various&#xD;
      modalities of corticosteroid administration such as oral, intravenous, inhaled, ocular&#xD;
      instilled, intravitreal, and periocular u.Some histologic studies have reported the&#xD;
      accumulation of extracellular matrices including basement membrane-like material, fine&#xD;
      fibrillar-like material or proteoglycans in the trabecular meshwork (TM) of SIG patients.&#xD;
      These observations suggest that such accumulation could lead to an increased resistance to&#xD;
      aqueous outflow in the TM of SIG patients.Surgical procedures for intraocular pressure (IOP)&#xD;
      reduction in eyes with SIG include trabeculectomy, trabeculotomy,viscocanalostomy and laser&#xD;
      trabeculoplasty. Although several case series have shown that these surgeries are effective&#xD;
      for IOP reduction, surgical outcomes for SIG are not fully understood due to lack of large&#xD;
      case-control studies aiming to investigate the success rates of trabeculotomy in SIG eyes.It&#xD;
      has previously been reported that trabeculotomy more effectively reduces IOP in adult&#xD;
      Japanese patients with exfoliative glaucoma than in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).This&#xD;
      IOP lowering effect in eyes with exfoliative glaucoma is thought to be attributable to the&#xD;
      relief of abnormally increased outflow resistance that was induced by the accumulation of&#xD;
      exfoliative material within the TM. For the same reason, trabeculotomy has been the surgical&#xD;
      procedure of choice for adult patients with SIG among Japanese surgeons.Honjo etal previously&#xD;
      showed that trabeculotomy helped to reduce IOPs to 21 mm Hg or less in 14 Japanese patients&#xD;
      with SIG. However, some questions still without answers for example, whether trabeculotomy&#xD;
      with its modifications for SIG offers better IOP management than other surgeries such as&#xD;
      trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (MMC), or which characteristics of patients with SIG show&#xD;
      better prognosis after trabeculotomy. Therefore the purpose of this retrospective study was&#xD;
      to compare the long term surgical outcomes of viscotrabeculectomy(VT) and trabeculectomy with&#xD;
      mitomycin C (Trab-MMC) in patients with uncontrolled steroid induced glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective review of 86 eyes of 67 patients with medically uncontrolled SIG who&#xD;
      underwent either viscotrabeculotomy (VT) or trabeculectomy with MMC (Trab-MMC) at Mansoura&#xD;
      Ophthalmic Center (Mansoura, Egypt) between January 2008, and December 2017 was conducted.&#xD;
      The research conformed to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. The confidentiality&#xD;
      of the data was ensured. The VT group included 45 eyes and the Trab-ologen group included 41&#xD;
      eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical data were retrieved from the records such as age at surgery, gender,&#xD;
      best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA, LogMAR), intraocular pressure (IOP), gonioscopy, number&#xD;
      of glaucoma medications, surgical details and postoperative complications. Steroid-induced&#xD;
      glaucoma eyes were defined as open-angle eyes with an IOP elevation of 22 mm Hg or more after&#xD;
      the administration of corticosteroid. Glaucoma surgery was performed when IOP was&#xD;
      persistently elevated despite maximal tolerated IOP-lowering therapy with potential or actual&#xD;
      compromise of optic nerve structure (progressive optic nerve cupping) and/or function&#xD;
      (deterioration of visual field testing). All patients were required to sign informed consent&#xD;
      forms before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viscotrabeculotomy (VT) performed in this study involved the creation of a partial thickness&#xD;
      (about 50% thickness) quadrangular (4x4 mm) scleral flap, followed by localization of&#xD;
      Schlemm's canal by radial incisions straddling the limbus. High viscosity sodium hyaluronate&#xD;
      (Healon GV, Pfizer, NY, USA) was then slowly injected into both ends of Schlemm's canal.&#xD;
      Trabeculotomy was completed using the standard metal Harm's trabeculotome (Geuder&#xD;
      Instruments, Heidelberg, Germany). Rotation of these probes achieved 120-degree opening of&#xD;
      the trabecular meshwork. Next, a small amount of sodium hyaluronate was injected through the&#xD;
      open ends of the canal of Schlemm and along the trabeculotomy openings. The scleral flap was&#xD;
      then secured tightly with interrupted 10/0 Nylon sutures and conjunctival closure ensued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trabeculectomy technique involved a creation of a limbal-based conjunctival flap, followed by&#xD;
      creation of a 3 x 4 rectangular half-thickness sclera flap. MMC was applied in a&#xD;
      concentration of 0.03% for 3 minutes through soaked surgical sponge inserted underneath the&#xD;
      conjunctival flap and spread of a large surface area posterior to the limbus and planned&#xD;
      scleral flap site then thoroughly irrigated by 200mL of sterile normal saline. The procedure&#xD;
      was completed in the usual manner with both sclera and conjunctiva closed by 10/0 nylon&#xD;
      sutures. Postoperative treatment for both groups consisted of topical steroids&#xD;
      (dexamethasone) and antibiotic (ofloxacin) five times a day with gradual taper over a period&#xD;
      of 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical success was defined at the end of the 4 years of follow up as an IOP between 6 and&#xD;
      21 mmHg and /or IOP reduction greater than 35 % of baseline throughout the entire follow-up&#xD;
      period. Absolute success was defined as success being achieved without medications, and&#xD;
      qualified success was defined as achieving success with adjunctive medications. Failure was&#xD;
      defined as not meeting the above criteria, or any return to the operating theatre for&#xD;
      glaucoma reoperation, or loss of vision to no light perception or hypotony (IOP &lt;6 mmHg on 2&#xD;
      occasions after 3 months from the operation). A minimum follow-up of 3 years was required for&#xD;
      inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow up period, eyes that were labelled as &quot;Failure&quot; at any follow up time point&#xD;
      were excluded from the data analysis from that follow up time point to the end of the study&#xD;
      period (48 months). Follow up was maintained to the patient as part of the patient care&#xD;
      service routinely provided by the study setting. The patients' postoperative data was&#xD;
      collected from records at day 1, week 1, month 1, month 3, month 6, month 12, month 18, month&#xD;
      24, month 30, month 36 and month 48.&#xD;
