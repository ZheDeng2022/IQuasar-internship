  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will provide new evidence on how to optimize medication use among older people&#xD;
      with limited life expectancy. This will be done by testing whether a patient-centered&#xD;
      deprescribing intervention, focused on aligning medical treatment with patients' preferences,&#xD;
      can improve quality of life among older people with limited life expectancy. This&#xD;
      registration concerns the initial pilot study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, this project will test whether a comprehensive&#xD;
      and patient-centered deprescribing intervention can improve quality of life among older&#xD;
      people with limited life expectancy. This registration concerns the initial pilot study. All&#xD;
      patients included in the pilot study will receive the intervention (that is, the pilot study&#xD;
      will not include randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will comprise a series of consultations between the patient and general&#xD;
      practitioner (GP) (at least three) to continuously adjust the patient's medication according&#xD;
      to the patient's goals, needs, and preferences, thereby ensuring alignment with the patient's&#xD;
      priorities. Thus, the purpose of this intervention is to initiate and facilitate a continued&#xD;
      deprescribing process. The process can be summarized in seven steps: During an initial&#xD;
      consultation (1: Consultation 0), the GP assesses patient eligibility. If the patient would&#xD;
      like to participate, a project nurse subsequently visits the patient at home (2: Home visit)&#xD;
      for retrieval of informed consent as well as baseline measurements. During the next&#xD;
      consultation (3: Consultation 1), the patient and GP discuss how the patient feels about&#xD;
      his/her medical treatment, and the GP provides the patient with written material for the&#xD;
      patient to prepare prior to the next consultation. The patients prepares (4: Preparation) by&#xD;
      considering and verbalizing his/her goals of care and treatment preferences. Simultaneously,&#xD;
      a clinical pharmacist examines the patient's medication list and provides suggestions to the&#xD;
      GP on which drugs can be continued and deprescribed, respectively. During the next&#xD;
      consultation (5: Consultation 2), the patient and GP discuss the patient's preferences and&#xD;
      initiate deprescribing initiatives aligned with the patient's priorities. During a new&#xD;
      consultation (6: Consultation 3), the patient and GP follow up on the changes initiated and&#xD;
      initiate new deprescribing initiatives if such can be identified. If needed, subsequent&#xD;
      consultations (7: Consultation X) are planned until the patient and GP consider the patient's&#xD;
      medical treatment optimal.&#xD;
