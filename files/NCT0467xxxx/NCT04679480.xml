      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tumour response, safety and induction of immune&#xD;
      response in patients with advanced BCC treated with a combination of anti-PD1 antibody and&#xD;
      pulsed hedgehog inhibitor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, open, single-arm, single center, phase II trial to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      anti-PD1 antibody in combination with pulsed Hedgehog inhibitor in advanced Basal Cell&#xD;
      Carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients with advanced BCC will be included in the trial. No blinding or randomization&#xD;
      will be conducted in this open label, non-randomized clinical trial. All of the patients will&#xD;
      receive the investigative treatment (combination of anti-PD1 antibody and pulsed HHI&#xD;
      therapy). The tumor response will be evaluated comparing tumour size at baseline, at each&#xD;
      assessment, and 26 weeks after treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration from screening visit to the End of Study visit is 32 weeks with a&#xD;
      Follow-Up 1 Visit at week 28 and Follow-Up 2 Visit at week 32. The duration of the&#xD;
      translational part (secondary objectives) of the study is up to 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the best response any time at week 26 is partial response, patients will be offered to&#xD;
      continue at least one of the study drugs until complete response or until a maximum of 2&#xD;
      years. The evaluation during this period will correspond to the standard of care with&#xD;
      laboratory tests at each follow up and imaging every 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At baseline, each assessment and the week 26.</time_frame>
    <description>The response will be assessed according to the Immune-response Criteria (Appendix) in all patients with cutaneous lesions as: complete response, partial response, stable disease or progressive disease. The best response documented between treatment start and week 26 will be considered &quot;best response&quot;. In case of metastatic BCC without cutaneous lesions at screening, the primary outcome will be assessed using PET/CT imaging according to the PERCIST criteria every 12 weeks from treatment start.&#xD;
In patient withdrawn from the trial before week 26, the last tumour assessment will be used for evaluation of primary outcome. For patients withdrawn from the study a full body physical examination and laboratory results will be performed prior to withdrawal, unless refused by the patient.</description>
