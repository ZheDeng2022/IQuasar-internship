  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BRITEPath (BP) aims to support co-located mental health clinicians in the development of a&#xD;
      high quality, effective, and personalized safety plan for referred patients who screen&#xD;
      positive for depression and/or suicidal ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BRITEPath utilizes BRITE, a safety planning and emotion regulation app that is loaded on the&#xD;
      patient's smart phone and has previously been shown to be well accepted and to reduce suicide&#xD;
      attempts compared to usual care in psychiatric inpatients (HR = 0.49). To support mental&#xD;
      health clinicians in the development of effective safety plans, study investigators will&#xD;
      develop Guide2Brite (G2B), which provides step-by-step instructions for the mental health&#xD;
      clinician on how to populate BRITE onto the patient's smartphone and BRITEBoard, a clinician&#xD;
      dashboard that tracks patient symptoms, app use, and rating on helpfulness of different&#xD;
      interventions assessed through BRITE.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BRITEPath has 3 components: 1) BRITE, an emotion regulation and safety planning phone app&#xD;
      that is delivered by a co-located mental health (MH) clinician to adolescents at the time of&#xD;
      their first therapy appointment; 2) Guide2Brite, which will guide the co-located MH clinician&#xD;
      in working with the adolescent to population content onto BRITE; and 3) BRITEBoard, which is&#xD;
      a clinician dashboard delivered to the MH clinician and PCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment of Interventions: This study will utilize a 1:1 randomization scheme to randomize&#xD;
      participants to receive BRITEPath intervention or Treatment as Usual (TAU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The use of BRITEPath will decrease depressive symptoms, distress, and suicidality&#xD;
      (any self-injurious ideation, urges, or behavior) as well as improve overall functioning&#xD;
      compared to TAU.&#xD;

    <description>Satisfaction to BRITEPath will be assessed through questions developed by investigators to understand experience with the program. Questions investigators have adapted from literature reviews on satisfaction include: &quot;If a friend were in need of mental health care for depression or suicidal thoughts or behaviors, would you recommend BRITEPath to help him/her manage symptoms?; How satisfied are you with the amount of help you received?; Have the services you received helped you to deal more effectively with your problems?&quot; The response options include: No, definitely not; No, I don't think so; Yes, I think so; Yes, definitely</description>

    <description>Satisfaction with the technical components of interventions will be assessed through the certain questions from the Post System Satisfaction and Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ). The PSSUQ is 19 items with response options ranging from 1 to 7 where 1= strongly disagree and 7= strongly agree. The PSSUQ has sub-scores derived from subsets of the questions which reflect system usefulness, information quality, and interface quality. Questions from sub-domains were chosen to tailor the questioning to this particular intervention.</description>

The final completely de-identified dataset(s) will include demographic and clinical data at baseline, and primary and secondary outcomes for all studies, including those funded by the innovation contests. These analytic datasets may also include derived variables with documentation. Our form datasets will include original case report forms, a detailed codebook of variable names, value labels, and programming formats and all study documentation including the protocol and manual of procedures. For descriptive/raw data, study investigators/study staff will upload to NIMH's National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Health Illness (NDCT) on a semi-annual basis all analyzed data being uploaded prior to primary paper publication.</ipd_description>
