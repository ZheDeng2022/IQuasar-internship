  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of oral psilocybin administered under&#xD;
      supportive conditions in treatment-resistant major depression (TRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a bi-centric, prospective, randomized, active placebo-controlled study&#xD;
      investigating the effects of 25 mg and 5 mg (p.o.) psilocybin versus placebo (100 mg&#xD;
      nicotinamide) in a psychotherapeutic context in 144 patients with TRD from moderate to severe&#xD;
      degree (ICD-10 F32/F33). After giving written informed consent and down-titration of their&#xD;
      monoaminergic medication under supervision of the treating psychiatrist and the study team,&#xD;
      patients will be randomly assigned to one of four trial arms using an online randomization&#xD;
      tool: 1) receiving placebo (100 mg nicotinamide) at the first session and the full dose (25&#xD;
      mg) at the second; 2) receiving the presumably sub-effective dose (5 mg) at the first session&#xD;
      and the full dose (25 mg) at the second; 3a) receiving the full dose (25 mg) at the first&#xD;
      session and 5 mg at the second; 3b) receiving the full dose at both sessions. The two dosing&#xD;
      sessions are accompanied by three preparatory and four integration sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug administration must occur under psychotherapeutic conditions. Two trained therapists&#xD;
      (one male, one female) will be assigned to each patient and be present during each dosing,&#xD;
      preparatory and integration sessions. We will follow the safety guidelines provided by&#xD;
      Johnson et al. (2), including a thorough preparation, establishment of trust/rapport, a safe&#xD;
      and pleasing physical environment and sufficient interpersonal support. For safety reasons&#xD;
      and close monitoring, patients will stay hospitalized for one night after each dosing session&#xD;
      (i.e. in-patient setting).&#xD;

    <description>The HAM-D is a 21-item rating scale to assess the severity of depressive symptoms after a semi-structured clinical interview. Items are rated on a scale from 0 (absent) to 4. The total score is calculated by summing the first 17 items (HAM-D17) and ranges between 0 and 51.</description>

    <description>The BDI is a reliable and valid 21-item self-rating questionnaire for the assessment of depressive symptoms. Patients rate their symptoms according to four severity ratings per item (0-3). The total score determines the severity of depression, differentiating between absent (0 - 9), mild (10 - 18), moderate (19 - 29) and severe (≥ 30) depression.</description>

&#xD;
          1. 25 to 65 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of major depressive disorder (single and recurrent episodes) of moderate to&#xD;
             severe degree (HAM-D score ≥ 17) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of&#xD;
             Mental Disorders (DSM-5) without psychotic features. Included ICD-10 diagnoses are&#xD;
             ICD-10: F32.1, F32.2, F33.1, F33.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. If single episode, duration must be ≥ 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must meet criteria for treatment-resistance, defined as&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. no adequate improvement despite two adequate courses of antidepressant treatment (6&#xD;
             weeks each, minimum) with drugs of different pharmacological classes in the current&#xD;
             depressive episode. Augmentation with an add-on treatment counts as a second&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients have discontinued any monoaminergic psychiatric medication (i.e. SRIs,&#xD;
             antipsychotic medication) for at least 2 weeks before the first dosing session.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients who are still on any monoaminergic psychiatric medication at screening&#xD;
                  must agree to down-titrate over an individualized down-titration schedule&#xD;
                  (minimum 2 weeks; if they have been taken Fluoxetine the down-titration phase&#xD;
                  should be minimum 5 weeks) in close supervision by their out-patient psychiatrist&#xD;
                  and the study team. The treating psychiatrist must agree to supervise and monitor&#xD;
                  the down-titration and to collaborate with the study team by signing a &quot;treatment&#xD;
                  agreement form&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. If the treating psychiatrist refuses to monitor the down-titration, the patient&#xD;
                  has to agree to down-titrate under supervision of clinicians in the outpatient&#xD;
                  clinics of the two study sites or trial physicians and to come in for weekly&#xD;
                  monitoring visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subjects are abstinent from alcohol (breathalyzer blood alcohol concentration&#xD;
             (BAC) level 0.00) and a negative urine drug screen at days of dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject must be medically stable based on clinical laboratory tests, medical&#xD;
             history, vital signs, and 12-lead ECG performed at screening. If the results of the&#xD;
             serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference&#xD;
             ranges, retesting of an abnormal lab value(s) that may lead to exclusion will be&#xD;
             allowed once during the screening phase. In 12-lead ECG, QTcF should be ≤ 450 ms for&#xD;
             males or ≤ 470 ms for females and PR-interval &lt; 220 ms at screening. A retest of an&#xD;
             abnormal ECG value will be allowed once in the screening phase. Blood pressure will be&#xD;
             the average of 2 measurements. The subject may be included only if the investigator&#xD;
             judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or&#xD;
             to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This determination&#xD;
             must be recorded in the subject's source documents and initialed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject must be willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions&#xD;
             specified in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;

             compliance. This includes current signs/symptoms of liver or renal insufficiency,&#xD;
             hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism (subjects who are on stable treatment with thyroid&#xD;
             supplementation and show an euthyroid metabolism with normal thyroid-stimulating&#xD;

             is stably controlled (HbA1c less than 7.5% or 58 mmol/mol).&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. To rule out the presence of any serious neurological condition that might be&#xD;
             underlying the depression (e.g. Parkinson's Disease, dementia), patients must provide&#xD;
             a recent (i.e. not older than 5 years) brain neuroimaging (MRI or CT). If the clinical&#xD;
             manifestation has changed qualitatively or in severity, a more recent neuroimaging is&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women who are pregnant, nursing or refuse to use an effective method of contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) throughout their study&#xD;

             test at screening and the two dosing days.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Positive urine drug screen for any illicit drugs of abuse or alcohol at any of the two&#xD;
             dosing days. The regular drug screen includes cocaine, amphetamine, opiates, ecstasy,&#xD;
             EDDP, cannabinoids, benzodiazepines and barbiturates.&#xD;

         11. The subject has a QTc interval &gt; 450 ms (for men) or &gt; 470 ms (for women)&#xD;
             (Fridericia's correction) at screening or at baseline, as calculated by the ECG&#xD;
             equipment and evaluated by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The subject has received an investigational drug or used an invasive investigational&#xD;
             medical device within 3 months before the first administration of the study drug or&#xD;
             anticipates participation in another clinical trial until the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The subject is unwilling or unable to undergo multiple venipunctures because of poor&#xD;
             tolerability or lack of easy access.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. The subject is unable to read and understand the patient information and the consent&#xD;
             form, complete study-related procedures, and/or communicate with the study staff.&#xD;
             Cognitive impairment that would render the informed consent invalid or limit the&#xD;
             ability of the subject to comply with the study requirements also excludes from&#xD;
             participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. The subject has any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             participation would not be in the best interest of the subject (e.g., compromise the&#xD;
             well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified&#xD;
             assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject has had major surgery (e.g., requiring general anesthesia) within 12 weeks&#xD;
             before screening, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or has surgery&#xD;
             planned during the time the subject is expected to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. The subject has undergone electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) within twelve months prior&#xD;
             to screening or treatment with ketamine or esketamine within six months prior to&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. The subject has received any prior treatment with vagal nerve stimulation, or a deep&#xD;
             brain stimulation device.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subject is an employee of the investigator or study site, with direct involvement in&#xD;
             the proposed study or other studies under the direction of that investigator or study&#xD;
             site, as well as family members of the employees or the investigator.&#xD;
