  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot randomized trial, the investigators will evaluate the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and potential family-centered outcomes associated with providing asthma&#xD;
      discharge instructions in audio-recorded format in addition to written format, compared to&#xD;
      written instructions alone. The study will enroll 100 families of children being discharged&#xD;
      home from an emergency department visit, who prefer either English or Spanish for medical&#xD;
      care, and assess outcomes at 3 time-points.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot randomized controlled trial seeks to test the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      providing and evaluating outcomes associated with audio-recorded, language concordant ED&#xD;
      discharge instructions (the RECORD-ED intervention) among low-income parents of children&#xD;
      treated for an asthma exacerbation. The study will enroll 100 children and their&#xD;
      parent/caregiver with low income and/or limited English proficiency (LEP) who are being&#xD;
      discharged home from the emergency department (ED) with a diagnosis of asthma; 20 will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive usual discharge care, 40 will receive a physical card with&#xD;
      audio-recorded discharge instructions, in addition to usual care, and another 40 will receive&#xD;
      access to audio-recorded instructions through the patient portal in addition to usual care.&#xD;
      The study team will also send a brief survey to providers and nurses in the ED about the&#xD;
      intervention, and conduct qualitative interviews with parents and nurses about their&#xD;
      experiences using the recordable cards for discharge instructions. Primary outcomes will&#xD;
      focus on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and outcome ascertainment&#xD;
      protocols, as recommended for pilot studies. Parents will complete surveys at 3 time points.&#xD;
      Parent outcomes (instruction recall, adherence, comfort with home care, caregiver quality of&#xD;
      life), child outcomes (asthma control, including rescue medication use and school absence if&#xD;
      age-appropriate), and follow-up utilization (primary care follow-up, 3-month ED and hospital&#xD;
      re-visits) will be collected to inform planning for the subsequent R01 proposal.&#xD;

successful enrollment of 100 families over 15 months&#xD;
participant retention &gt;70% through 3 follow-up surveys&#xD;

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Instruction recall</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days after</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver-reported discharge instructions, in 5 domains (home care, medications [including over-the-counter], expected illness progression, follow-up, and return precautions), will be compared to chart-abstracted instructions and coded for concordance (fully or mostly concordant (3), partially concordant (2), minimally concordant (1), or wrong/ not concordant (0)). Overall instruction recall concordance will be calculated as the percent of domains that were fully or mostly concordant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comfort with home care</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days after ED visit</time_frame>
    <description>These 8 caregiver-reported care transition items pertain to having received enough information; knowing warning signs; understanding how to manage the child's care; knowing who to call; the child being healthy enough to go home; having an easily understood plan; understanding the purpose of each medication; and understanding how much and how often to give each medication. Responses are on a Likert scale, from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; (1) to &quot;strongly agree&quot; (5)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PCP follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after ED visit</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers will be asked to report on any visits to the PCP since the ED visit, and whether the visit was specifically for the condition that prompted the initial ED visit. The response will be coded as yes or no.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Caregiver Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after ED visit</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Pediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaire to measure the current impact of the child's asthma symptoms and management on caregiver QoL. This 13-item measure captures asthma-related caregiver stress, uncertainty, sleep disruption and activity limitation; it is associated with child asthma control and life stress, and exhibits good responsiveness to intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Provider-rated intervention acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 3 days of ED visit</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the 4-item Acceptability of Intervention measure to capture nurses' and providers' assessment of the acceptability of a recordable card for discharge instructions. Responses are using a 5-point Likert scale. The survey to assess this measure will be brief and anonymous, sent to nurses and providers recorded as having been part of discharge for families randomized to the intervention arm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child asthma control</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after ED visit</time_frame>
    <description>Child asthma control will be measured using the Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids (TRACK, age &lt;=4 years) or the Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire (ATAQ, age 5-10 years) control domain, depending on child age at enrollment. The TRACK includes 5 questions assessing parent-reported symptoms, nighttime awakenings, activity interference, rescue medication use, and oral corticosteroid use. It produces a scale score (0-100), with scores &lt;80 indicating poorly controlled asthma. The ATAQ control domain includes 7 questions, each dichotomously scored and summed, assessing parent-reported symptoms, nighttime awakenings, activity interference, rescue medication use, and missed school. It produces scores 0-7, with higher scores reflecting worse asthma control.</description>
