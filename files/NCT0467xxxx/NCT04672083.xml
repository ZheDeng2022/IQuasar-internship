  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of the HIV entry inhibitor CPT31 (cholesterol-PIE12-2-trimer) in healthy&#xD;
      adults. This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single ascending dose study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single subcutaneous (SC) dose study. Doses will be administered in an escalating&#xD;
      manner following satisfactory review by a Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) of the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) data through Day 6 from the lower dose levels. 32&#xD;
      healthy subjects will be studied in 4 groups (Groups A1 to A4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will comprise a placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-dose, sequential-group&#xD;
      design in healthy subjects. Each subject will participate in 1 treatment period and reside in&#xD;
      the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) from Day -1 through Day 6. It is planned for 6 subjects per&#xD;
      dose level group to receive SC CPT31 and 2 subjects to receive matching placebo. Each group&#xD;
      will be divided into 2 cohorts, with each cohort being dosed 72 hours apart. Sentinel dosing&#xD;
      will take place in the first cohort, which will comprise 2 subjects, with 1 subject receiving&#xD;
      CPT31 and 1 subject receiving placebo. The second cohort will comprise 6 subjects, with 5&#xD;
      subjects receiving CPT31 and 1 subject receiving placebo. Blood samples for PK analysis and&#xD;
      assessment of immunogenicity will be collected predose and up to 5 days postdose, with an&#xD;
      additional immunogenicity sample taken at the Follow-up visit.&#xD;
