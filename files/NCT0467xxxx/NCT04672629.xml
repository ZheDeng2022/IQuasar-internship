    <textblock>
      One of the most common cardiovascular problems that prematurely born infants experience early&#xD;
      in life is patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel that connects the two major arteries, namely the&#xD;
      aorta and the pulmonary artery, and is essential in maintaining circulation in fetal life.&#xD;
      After the baby is born and the fetal circulation changes to adult circulation, the ductus&#xD;
      arteriosus functionally closes between 18 and 24 hours of life (1 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The arterial duct is a fetal blood vessel that is programmed to close shortly after birth. If&#xD;
      the vessel remains patent beyond 3 months of life (a persistently patent arterial duct) it&#xD;
      can result in volume loading of the left heart and should be closed either surgically or by a&#xD;
      catheter-based procedure. A patent arterial duct is common in the newborn, particularly&#xD;
      premature infants, and can contribute to persistent respiratory problems. (2) Historical&#xD;
      estimates have placed the incidence of isolated PDA at approximately 0.05% of all live&#xD;
      births. Isolated PDA accounts for 5% to 10% of congenital heart defects (3) number most&#xD;
      likely represents the prevalence of a &quot;symptomatic&quot; PDA-that is, one that results in evidence&#xD;
      of increased pulmonary blood flow, left heart volume overload, elevated PA pressure, murmur,&#xD;
      etc. With the advent of color Doppler echocardiography, the incidental recognition of&#xD;
      asymptomatic &quot;silent&quot; ductus has become more common. Some have estimated the prevalence of&#xD;
      silent PDA among children and adults to be up to 0.5%, far more common than the &quot;symptomatic&quot;&#xD;
      PDA (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in babies born prematurely, the ductus arteriosus often fails to close spontaneously&#xD;
      and leads to a number of morbidities. it has been shown that in infants born with a birth&#xD;
      weight of &lt;1000 g, the ductus arteriosus remains open in 66% of infants beyond the ﬁrst week&#xD;
      of life. In the extreme premature population born at 24 weeks of gestation, only 13% of&#xD;
      infants are found to have their ductus closed by the end of the ﬁrst week (5).This makes PDA&#xD;
      an important issue from the clinical management perspective in the ﬁrst few days of life in&#xD;
      preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is associated with a number of comorbidities such as necrotising enterocolitis (NEC),&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia and intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) (6-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management controversy has mainly focused on when to treat and with what to treat. To&#xD;
      increase the complexity of m atters, these two aspects of PDA management are not mutually&#xD;
      exclusive, with the modality of treatment often being dictated by the timing of treatment.&#xD;
      There have been a large number of published studies, meta-analyses and editorials focusing on&#xD;
      different aspects of management.(8-9)Regarding the timing of treatment, prophylactic therapy&#xD;
      has gradually fallen out of favor and neonatal units have shifted towards a more conservative&#xD;
      approach by treating only the clinically and echocardiographically (ECHO) signiﬁcant PDA&#xD;
      (10).However, the big dilemma that still persists among neonatologists is what to use as the&#xD;
      primary modality of treatment.&#xD;
