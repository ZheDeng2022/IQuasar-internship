    <textblock>
      Catheter ablation of the cavo-tricuspid isthmus (CTI) is the curative first-line therapy for&#xD;
      typical atrial flutter. Currently, two approaches are used in clinical practice. In contrast&#xD;
      to the conventional linear ablation approach, the Maximum voltage-guided (MVG) strategy aims&#xD;
      to limit ablation to high voltage areas (HVAs) representing the detectable correlate of&#xD;
      relevant conducting bundles. Data from registries show that the MVG technique is sufficient&#xD;
      to reach comparable clinical outcome with significantly shorter ablation duration when&#xD;
      compared to the conventional linear strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite growing evidence, however, data from properly powered prospective randomized trials&#xD;
      are lacking and the linear approach still remains standard. In addition, data on radiation&#xD;
      exposure are controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a substrate-based approach, the MVG strategy requires detailed mapping and signal analysis&#xD;
      for identification of the individual architecture and exactly targeted energy application.&#xD;
      However, the spatial mapping resolution of large tip catheters is limited. The use of the&#xD;
      MicroFidelity catheter technology (IntellaMiFi) with high resolution mini-electrodes at the 8&#xD;
      mm catheter tip can be expected to further improve the feasibility of a voltage-guided&#xD;
      approach. In addition, the MVG approach theoretically may encompass an increased risk for&#xD;
      clinically inapparent reconduction. A prospective study with predefined invasive&#xD;
      re-evaluation of persistent CTI block is needed to further evaluate this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of this prospective randomized study is evaluate the performance of the&#xD;
      micro-sensor technology for zero-fluoroscopy voltage-guided ablation of typical atrial&#xD;
      flutter (AFL) compared with a population undergoing conventional linear ablation including a&#xD;
      predefined invasive re-evaluation of persistent CTI block in addition to clinical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been approved by the responsible ethics committee.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter ablation of the CTI represents the established curative first-line treatment for&#xD;
      typical AFl. Although the acute and chronic efficacy is high, conventional ablation is still&#xD;
      time consuming, requires a considerable amount of radiation as reported even in the most&#xD;
      recent trials and treatment failure occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MVG catheter ablation of the CTI aims to limit energy delivery by selectively treating&#xD;
      conductive bundles. Compared to the conventional linear strategy, a reduction of ablation and&#xD;
      procedural time had been shown for the MVG technique. For several reasons, however, the&#xD;
      current evidence is still not considered to be robust enough to suggest a general change in&#xD;
      the ablation approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Despite a reduction in ablation requirements, the additional time needed for voltage&#xD;
           mapping often prolongs the total procedure duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The spatial mapping resolution of large tip catheters, most often used for CTI-ablation&#xD;
           is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catheter positioning and CTI ablation is still guided by fluoroscopy with the well-known&#xD;
           potential harm in the majority of electrophysiological centers. There are conflicting&#xD;
           data for the MVG approach regarding radiation duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The MVG approach theoretically encompasses an increased risk for clinically inapparent&#xD;
           reconduction. A prospective study with predefined invasive re-evaluation of persistent&#xD;
           CTI block is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MicroFidelity catheter technology was introduced to enhance the spatial resolution of large&#xD;
      tip catheters and may facilitate zero-fluoroscopy substrate-guided ablation by&#xD;
      high-resolution (HR) electroanatomic mapping (EAM) and precisely targeted energy application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to prospectively evaluate safety and efficacy of the stepwise maximum&#xD;
      voltage mapping guided CTI ablation strategy (&quot;MVG&quot;) using IntellaMiFi technology compared&#xD;
      with a randomized cohort undergoing conventional linear CTI ablation (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond procedural efficacy (main hypothesis) and safety patients outcome will be evaluated&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. by electrophysiologic diagnostic reevaluation of the ablation success after 3 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. by clinical assessment and Holter-monitoring during 6 and 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
           Furthermore, we aim to validate efficacy and safety of three-dimensional EAM- guided CTI&#xD;
           ablation without the use of fluoroscopy as standard approach in clinical routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective randomized analysis aims to provide fundamental data to suggest a general&#xD;
      change in the CTI ablation approach towards a three-dimensional electroanatomical mapping&#xD;
      guided, substrate-orientated stepwise procedure without the use of radiation as clinical&#xD;
      standard (Zero MAGIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single center, prospective randomized trial, two arms (&quot;MVG&quot;: voltage mapping guided CTI&#xD;
      ablation versus &quot;control&quot; undergoing linear approach), patients blinded to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators that perform follow-up will be blinded regarding the patients group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to prospectively compare two different ablation strategies for the&#xD;
      curative treatment of documented typical (CTI dependent) atrial flutter regarding efficacy&#xD;
      and safety. Patients will be randomized either to undergo a voltage mapping guided CTI&#xD;
      ablation or to a second group ablated using the conventional linear approach in order to&#xD;
      investigate the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypothesis The zero-fluoroscopy MVG ablation approach significantly reduces CTI-ablation&#xD;
      duration (total radiofrequency (RF) energy (RFE) application time) to bidirectional&#xD;
      conduction block (BCB) compared with the conventional linear strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Over 90% of all procedures (MVG and conventional linear) can be safely performed without&#xD;
           the use of radiation, cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IntellaMiFi electrodes localize the higher voltage potentials with higher accuracy&#xD;
           compared to conventional bipoles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no difference in the occurrence of complications, such as tamponade,&#xD;
           atrio-ventricular (AV) block, charring of catheter tip and sedation side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no difference in the rate of persistent BCB in electrophysiologic re-evaluation&#xD;
           after 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no difference in the recurrence rate of typical atrial flutter as estimated by&#xD;
           6 and 12 month clinical and Holter electrocardiogram follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include consecutive patients with documented typical (CTI dependent) atrial&#xD;
      flutter undergoing CTI ablation according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study groups and randomization Group 1 - MVG: maximum voltage guided stepwise CTI ablation&#xD;
      (stepwise voltage guided approach (SVG)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cohort will be compared to Group 2 - control: patients undergoing conventional linear&#xD;
      CTI ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint Cumulative ablation duration (total radiofrequency energy delivery time) in&#xD;
      seconds that is needed to achieve sustained complete BCB (acute procedural efficacy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints see below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Three months after ablation a diagnostic electrophysiologic (EP) study is performed&#xD;
      to evaluate persistence of CTI block. In the case of recurrent conduction the indication is&#xD;
      given for re-ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six and 12 months after ablation patients are invited for a clinical investigation and a 72&#xD;
      hours Holter monitoring is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Endpoint: procedural efficacy - ablation duration (total radiofrequency energy&#xD;
           delivery time)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary hypothesis: MVG ablation strategy reduces the duration of RF energy&#xD;
                application (time to CTI block) by at least 35% compared to conventional linear&#xD;
                approach For result analysis it is planned to use a non-parametric&#xD;
                Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test since the primary endpoint is not normally distributed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prospective randomized trial, PROBE design&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 1: treatment with MVG ablation (stepwise approach)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 2: treatment with conventional linear ablation approach&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sample size estimation Based on the results from Deutsch et al., Medicine 2017&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conventional pull back/ fluoroscopy as low as reasonable achievable (ALARA): 726±454&#xD;
           sec.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MVG/minimal fluoroscopy: 473±317 sec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare two means two side, parametric test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  76 patients (2 groups with 38 pts per group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  power 80%, α=0.05, ratio 1:1 Due to planned use of a non-parametric test 15% are added&#xD;
           to the sample size resulting from the parametric test estimation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size: 88 patients (44 each group) plus 20% expected dropout rate: =&gt; overall&#xD;
           sample size 106 patients (53 patients each group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Data will be collected in a hospital-internal Excel file. The data will be&#xD;
      initially analyzed descriptively, including frequencies and percentages for categorical data,&#xD;
      and mean, standard deviation, median and quartiles for continuous data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the primary endpoint we plan to use a non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test&#xD;
      for comparison of a population not normally distributed, due to non-normality reported in&#xD;
      former studies. We define p &lt; 0.05 as statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Randomization will occur once patient has been determined eligible for the&#xD;
      study, he/she has received the appropriate and mandatory information about the study and the&#xD;
      informed consent form has been signed. Patients will be randomly assigned with ratio 1:1 to&#xD;
      one of two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization list will be generated using the Wei's Urn Design method as implemented in&#xD;
      the R package randomizeR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration The study has been approved by the responsible ethics committee. In all&#xD;
      respects, the clinical trial will be conducted in full conformance with principles of the&#xD;
      &quot;Declaration of Helsinki and, Good Clinical Practice (GCP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All responsible physicians will provide a valid GCP training. All participating patients have&#xD;
      the medical indication for curative CTI ablation according to the current medical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent Written informed consent is required from all subjects prior to their&#xD;
      participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients insurance The study does not evaluate the performance of a medical product. All&#xD;
      hardware and software including the catheter and EAM system are commercially available and&#xD;
      used strictly according to their Conformité Européenne (CE) marking and specification. There&#xD;
      is no increased radiation exposure due to the study. Despite the very low risks potentially&#xD;
      associated to the study, a patients insurance policy will be taken out with an insurance&#xD;
      company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator sponsored research The ZERO MAGIC trial is conducted as an investigator&#xD;
      sponsored research (ISR) project in cooperation with Boston Scientific. The contract between&#xD;
      the company Boston Scientific and the Klinikum Fuerth has been reviewed and approved in&#xD;
      detail by the department for compliance from the Klinikum Fuerth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and data security The screening and informed consent process according to the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be performed by the PI and co-investigators. All&#xD;
      participating investigators are instructed in the study protocol and provide a valid GCP&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All demographic and procedural data will be listed in a password-protected hospital-internal&#xD;
      Excel database according to the modified principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good&#xD;
      clinical Practice. Access to the data base is restricted to the PI and co-investigators. In&#xD;
      the data base, a cryptographic &quot;hash&quot; algorithm will be used for pseudonymization of&#xD;
      patients' identifying data such as name and birth date. The code book for re-identification&#xD;
      is password protected and the access strictly limited to Dr. Bastian, Dr. Vitali-Serdoz as PI&#xD;
      and first co-investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be kept in the database for a minimum of ten years.&#xD;
