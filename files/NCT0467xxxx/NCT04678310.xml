    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate the implementation of an international&#xD;
      volunteer training programme to support patients dying in the hospital setting and their&#xD;
      families. It has the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Explore the experience and perceptions of the international hospital palliative and end&#xD;
           of life care volunteer programme, including care delivery, from the perspectives of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients and their family members who receive the service&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Volunteers who deliver the service&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Health care professionals caring for patients who receive the service&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the implementation and impact of a hospital volunteer service for dying patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An excess of 5 million people die in the EU each year, with 77% of deaths resulting from&#xD;
      chronic disease and illness. Of these 4 million deaths, many people will have died in pain or&#xD;
      symptomatic distress, died alone, and/or died without structured health or social care for&#xD;
      the patient and/or their family. Volunteer support represents an important and necessary&#xD;
      community resource to enhance the experience of living at the end of life, and dying,&#xD;
      however, a Cochrane review in 2015 concluded: &quot;research is needed on the impact of training&#xD;
      and support for palliative care volunteers on patients, their families, volunteers and&#xD;
      palliative care services&quot;. Palliative care volunteer services are relatively uncommon and&#xD;
      empirical evidence of the usefulness of such services in the hospital setting remains scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An EU H2020 funded study, iLIVE, will address this concern. The iLIVE Volunteer Study, one of&#xD;
      8 workpackages within the iLIVE project, has developed an international hospital palliative&#xD;
      care volunteer training programme, to support the implementation of palliative care volunteer&#xD;
      services within five hospitals in five countries. The study will evaluate the implementation,&#xD;
      use and experience of the iLIVE Volunteer Service across the five countries, embedded within&#xD;
      the current iLIVE Cohort Study (ClinicalTrials.giv reference number: NCT04271085).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim/Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate the implementation of an international&#xD;
      volunteer training programme to support patients dying in the hospital setting and their&#xD;
      families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Explore the experience and perceptions of the international hospital palliative and end&#xD;
           of life care volunteer programme, including care delivery, from the perspectives of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patients and their family members who receive the service&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Volunteers who deliver the service&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Health care professionals caring for patients who receive the service&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the implementation and impact of a hospital volunteer service for dying patients&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline (recruitment)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is made up of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).&#xD;
The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is scored on 5 levels, using a 1-digit number: 1 = no problems, 2 = slight problems, 3 = moderate problems, 4 = severe problems and 5 = extreme problems. The digits for the 5 dimensions are then combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.&#xD;
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled '100 = The best health you can imagine' and '0 = The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>
