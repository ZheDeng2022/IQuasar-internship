  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RESOLVE-DVT study is a randomized single-center pilot study to determine the effects of&#xD;
      hydroxyethylrutoside (Venoruton) on aspects of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) resolution&#xD;
      associated with post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Based on these results, the investigators&#xD;
      will estimate its potential as a preventive therapy for PTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible consenting patients who develop an acute, objectively confirmed DVT will be&#xD;
      randomized and equally allocated to two trial arms, either the treatment group (Venoruton&#xD;
      tablet 500 mg twice daily) or the control group (usual care). The pilot trial consists of 5&#xD;
      study contacts over 12 weeks at which outcome assessment is performed: inclusion, 1 week, 4&#xD;
      weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks. Treatment allocation is masked for outcome assessors, but not for&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: After a DVT, one in three patients develops PTS of the affected leg, despite&#xD;
      anticoagulant treatment and elastic compression therapy (ECT) in the acute phase of DVT.&#xD;
      Considering the major societal burden associated with PTS, supplementation of current&#xD;
      prevention with an effective pharmacotherapeutic therapy would be of high value. Since the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of PTS is mediated through persistent inflammation during thrombus resolution,&#xD;
      causing damage to the vein wall resulting in venous insufficiency, the venoactive flavonoids&#xD;
      with their vasoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties provide an excellent candidate. As&#xD;
      investigational medicinal product, the highly effective flavonoid Hydroxyethylrutoside&#xD;
      (Venoruton) was chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the effect of Venoruton on PTS-associated aspects of DVT resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A single-center, randomized, controlled, pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adults presenting themselves at the emergency department (ED) with a first,&#xD;
      acute, proximal DVT of the lower extremity. Inclusion will be performed within 48 hours after&#xD;
      diagnosis of DVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Administration of 500 mg Venoruton twice daily for 8 weeks following DVT, in&#xD;
      addition to standard treatment by ECT and anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics: Assessments include demographic data, smoking status, site and&#xD;
      extension of DVT, side of affected leg, duration of complaints at time of diagnosis, risk&#xD;
      factors for DVT (immobilisation, trauma, etc.), type of ECT, presence/suspicion of pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism, concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters: The primary study outcome is residual vein obstruction (RVO), assessed&#xD;
      by duplex ultrasound (DUS) at 12 weeks after DVT. Main secondary outcomes are levels of&#xD;
      circulating biomarkers and severity of PTS-characterizing clinical signs at baseline, 1 week,&#xD;
      4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks. Moreover, we measure quality of life (QoL) and&#xD;
      PTS-characterizing symptoms at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional study parameters: Medication adherence and ECT compliance at 1 week, 4 weeks, 8&#xD;
      weeks and 12 weeks. Pill count of Venoruton at 8 weeks. Pill count of direct oral&#xD;
      anticoagulant (DOAC) at 12 weeks. The occurrence of relevant (serious) adverse events is&#xD;
      assessed at all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Patients have a follow-up duration of 12 weeks after diagnosis of DVT. In&#xD;
      addition to their visit at the ED, patients will visit the outpatient clinic four times&#xD;
      during follow-up. At each visit secondary outcomes are measured through questionnaires, blood&#xD;
      withdrawal and assessment of the affected leg. The first visit coincides with inclusion and&#xD;
      two subsequent visits (4 and 12 weeks) coincide with the regular clinical care pathway. The&#xD;
      primary outcome, RVO, is measured at 12 weeks after DVT by DUS. Patients allocated to the&#xD;
      intervention group will take two oral tablets daily over a period of eight weeks. Venoruton&#xD;
      has been established as safe with rarely occurring, mild, reversible side-effects through&#xD;
      many years of experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking: while patients are aware of their treatment allocation, the physicians and&#xD;
      researchers are not, as to provide unbiased outcome assessment.&#xD;
