      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of one-year Alglucosidase alfa treatment on motor function [Six-minute&#xD;
      walk test (6MWT) and lung function predicted Forced vital capacity (FVC)] among Chinese Late&#xD;
      Onset Pompe Disease patients above 5 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety of Myozyme 20mg/kg, IV biweekly in Chinese LOPD patients above 3 years&#xD;
      old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of one-year treatment with Alglucosidase alfa on improvement of manual&#xD;
      muscle test (MMT), Maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure (MIP and MEP)], Quick Motor&#xD;
      Function Test scores, and health-related quality of life (SF-12) among LOPD patients over 5&#xD;
