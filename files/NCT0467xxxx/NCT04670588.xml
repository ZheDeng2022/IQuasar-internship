  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm observational study to determine the feasibility of assessing tumor&#xD;
      response utilizing Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients of with locally advanced rectal&#xD;
      cancer (LARC) undergoing standard-of-care total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) consisting of&#xD;
      systemic chemotherapy (modified FOLFOX or modified FOLFIRINOX) followed by concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiation (50.4 Gy over approximately six weeks with concurrent radiosensitizing dose of&#xD;
      capecitabine/5-fluorouracil).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study, patients with LARC who are selected for the standard-of-care TNT&#xD;
      will be enrolled. After obtaining informed consent, a venous blood sample and the archival&#xD;
      tissue block from the initial diagnostic rectal tumor biopsy will be sent to the Natera&#xD;
      laboratory for designing patient-specific ctDNA assay, which will be used to measure ctDNA&#xD;
      levels in the peripheral venous blood samples at various time points coinciding with the&#xD;
      standard studies to assess tumor response. The blood sample needed for designing the assay&#xD;
      and measuring the baseline ctDNA level will be obtained within four weeks before neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy begins. Subsequently, for patients undergoing 16 weeks of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy, blood samples will be obtained for ctDNA level measurement at three time points&#xD;
      ( after eight weeks/4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy within +/- 5 days of the magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) study, after 16 weeks/8 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy within +/-&#xD;
      5 days of the MRI study, and one to 14 days before surgery ). For patients who receive eight&#xD;
      weeks of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, two blood samples will be obtained for subsequent ctDNA&#xD;
      measurements (after eight weeks/4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy within +/- 5 days of the&#xD;
      MRI study, and one to 14 days before surgery). All patients may also choose to undergo&#xD;
      additional serial ctDNA level measurements for surveillance after the surgery every three to&#xD;
      four months for two years (optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor response rate assessed by ctDNA (defined as reduction of ctDNA level at least by 90%&#xD;
      compared to the baseline level) will be compared with the response rate assessed by the&#xD;
      standard method (proctoscopic examination, pelvic MRI, etc.) to explore if a significant&#xD;
      correlation exists between these two response assessment methods. If preliminary data support&#xD;
      the hypothesis that peripheral blood ctDNA can be utilized for tumor response assessment in&#xD;
      this scenario, a larger study will be conducted to validate this method. Once validated,&#xD;
      ctDNA measurement can potentially replace expensive, uncomfortable, and time-consuming&#xD;
      methods of tumor response assessment like MRI.&#xD;
