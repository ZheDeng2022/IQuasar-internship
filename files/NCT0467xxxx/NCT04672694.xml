      Randomized controlled study to investigate the role of intraoperative vagal nerve block for&#xD;
      preventing the postoperative cough in patients who received the pulmonary resection for lung&#xD;
      cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatments for early primary lung cancer are surgical treatments (lobectomy and&#xD;
      lymph node resection). The usual mortality rate of lung cancer surgery is 1-2%, and the&#xD;
      incidence of complications is reported to be about 20%. In addition to these deaths and&#xD;
      complications, there are frequent sequelae such as reduction of pulmonary function reduction&#xD;
      and cough. According to a cross section study of 240 patients who underwent lung cancer&#xD;
      surgery, about 30% of patients complained of cough after surgery for one year after surgery,&#xD;
      and 50% of patients complained of cough after one year. After the pulmonary resection of lung&#xD;
      cancer, chronic coughs are the main cause of lowering the quality of life of patients after&#xD;
      lung surgery. Several studies have reported the risk factors of cough after lung cancer&#xD;
      surgery, and it is known that there is a relationship between mediastinal lymph node&#xD;
      resection and accompanying gastric-esophageal gastric acid reflux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to anatomy and physiology studies of coughs, coughing occurs due to stimulation of&#xD;
      vagus nerves, which is a type of reflex to protect the respiratory tract from harmful stimuli&#xD;
      from the outside. Cough cough is known to occur when c-fibers are stimulated, especially at&#xD;
      the end of the vagus nerve. Cough reflex-related circuits from c-fiber to brain are&#xD;
      generated, and then coughing is reported in smaller stimuli. The end of the vagus nerves in&#xD;
      the bronchial area can be damaged by the mediastinal lymph nodes dissection during lung&#xD;
      cancer surgery and it can lead to c-fiber stimulation and finally form the nerve circuit&#xD;
      which can lead to chronic cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, awake pulmonary resection (awakening surgery) has been performed in several&#xD;
      countries. Normally, sleep anesthesia gas itself is depleted of vagus nerve function and does&#xD;
      not cause cough reflex during surgery, but when operated in a waking state, coughing caused&#xD;
      by vagus nerve stimulation may occur and dangerous situations may occur during surgery, so it&#xD;
      is reported that vagus nerve block is performed at the start of surgery. These vagus nerve&#xD;
      blocks are known to prevent cough reflex during awakening surgery and enable surgery to be&#xD;
      performed stably. However, it is not yet known whether these vagus nerve block can reduce&#xD;
      acute and chronic cough after surgery. In this study, we investigated whether vagus nerve&#xD;
      block during surgery could reduce coughing after surgery in patients who underwent general&#xD;
      anesthesia lung cancer surgery.&#xD;

    <measure>COAT, Cough Assessment Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The COAT is a short, simple questionnaire that assesses cough frequency, limitation on daily activities, sleep disturbance, fatigue and hypersensitivity to irritants in recent 1 week. It consists of five items, each with a 5-point differential scale (0-4), constituting a 0-20-point total scale.</description>
