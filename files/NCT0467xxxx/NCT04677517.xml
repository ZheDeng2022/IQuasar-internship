  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The construction of our auditory space requires several prerequisites, including localization&#xD;
      abilities in 3D (azimuth, elevation and distance). These abilities rely on the proper&#xD;
      development and functionality of the auditory system to extract various acoustic cues from&#xD;
      our environment. Extraction and analysis of these auditory cues are based on the synchronous&#xD;
      use of ears, called binaurality. Other natural behaviours are useful to precisely determine&#xD;
      the location of a sound source: visual information and head movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The slightest anatomical-functional change (e.g. unilateral hearing loss, malformation of the&#xD;
      pinna) can disturb spatial hearing abilities. Many patients with hearing loss are fitted with&#xD;
      a hearing aid (HA) or a cochlear implant (CI) to ensure the best speech understanding.&#xD;
      However, this auditory rehabilitation remains insufficient to restore a good perception of&#xD;
      spatial hearing. One of the key point to improve sound localization seems to be microphone&#xD;
      positioning on hearing aids. Several questions remain on the optimal microphone positioning.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in 3d-D value at day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and day 7</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare 3d-D values obtained with baseline microphone position (at day 0) and 1 week after the first microphone positioning change. Baseline microphone position is defined as the usual position at inclusion and might vary from one patient to another. Combined with change in SRT values and SSQ15 scores, these results will allow us to assess the effect of microphones positioning on spatial auditory performance.</description>

    <intervention_name>Modification of active microphone positioning</intervention_name>
    <description>Patient will pass the experimental tests described above with 3 different active microphone positions :&#xD;
on the cochlear implant processor;&#xD;
on the antenna&#xD;
in front of the external ear canal&#xD;
Patient will pass the tests 1 week after each microphone position change, so that they can get used to the new position in their everyday life.</description>

    <intervention_name>SPHERE protocol</intervention_name>
    <description>Patient's 3D localization in noise will be assessed thnks to a 3D localization system called SPHERE based on virtual reality.&#xD;
Data from spatial hearing perception will be recorded in three-dimensional space (azimuth, elevation, and depth). First, the pointing error will be computed separately for azimuth, elevation, and depth, in terms of constant error (absolute and signed) and variable error. Then, these separate errors will be combined into a cumulative error &quot;3d-D&quot; (the 3d-D value), hence summarizing all three space dimensions, and taking into account absolute and variable error in one measure.</description>
