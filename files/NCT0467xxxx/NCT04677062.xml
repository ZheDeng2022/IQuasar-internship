      Prospective study carried out in the Pediatric Dentistry Department of the International&#xD;
      University of Catalonia. The sample was made up of children between 3 and 13 years old.&#xD;
      Baseline pain status, functional limitation, edema and lesion diameter were evaluated. The&#xD;
      treatment lasted 4 days. The parents recorded the intensity of the pain and the number of&#xD;
      pills provided daily. Statistical significance was accepted with p≤0.05 and a 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total sample of 33 patients, 11 boys (33 %) and 22 girls (67 %) was obtained. The average&#xD;
      age of the children was 7.8 years (SD: 1.41). Numerical variables referring to pain,&#xD;
      inflammation and edema presented statistically significant improvements (p-value &lt;0.05).&#xD;
      Healing efficacy was demonstrated in 13 cases (39 %) and only 3 cases (9 %) reported poor&#xD;
      taste acceptability.&#xD;

    <description>The treatment should be carried out for 4 days. Children between 3 and 6 years old had to consume 4 pills a day, children between 7 and 10 years old 5 pills, and children between 11 and 13 years old up to 6 pills. The patient had to slowly thin the tablet in the mouth, maintaining direct contact with the area to be treated.&#xD;
The study consisted of 2 visits, one initial and one final. In the initial visit , the documentation (informed consent) and the treatment were delivered. During this visit, baseline assessments of pain level, functional limitation, marginal mucosal edema, and lesion size were recorded. In addition, a photograph of the area to be treated was taken. Parents were also given a chart, in which they had to record the intensity of pain daily using the Wong-Baker face scale.</description>
