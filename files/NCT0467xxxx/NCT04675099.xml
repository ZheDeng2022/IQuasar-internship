  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to use the existing infrastructure and therapeutic&#xD;
      relationships developed by Early Intervention, a national system of child development&#xD;
      programs, to make an evidence-based intervention for parents with substance use disorder,&#xD;
      Mothering from the Inside Out, more readily accessible to postpartum women with substance use&#xD;
      disorder. This study will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of&#xD;
      the intervention in a pilot randomized controlled trial. We will also identify key&#xD;
      implementation domains that impact successful delivery. We hypothesize that the intervention&#xD;
      will be feasible and acceptable to the study participants.&#xD;

    <description>The revised Mothering from the Inside Out (MIO) Adherence Rating Scale is a 9-item measure rated on a 3-point scale for frequency of occurrence (never or seldom, sporadically, or consistent) and competence (poorly executed, adequately executed, or well-executed) of intervention delivery. The measure uses intervention session audio- or video- recordings and includes MIO specific fidelity and a measure of therapeutic alliance.</description>

    <description>&quot;Mothering from the Inside Out&quot; is an evidence-based intervention delivered in substance use treatment settings that helps mothers with substance use disorders foster parent-child attachment, cope with stressful parenting situations, and promote their child's healthy development. This 3 month counseling intervention both improves parent-child attachment and decreases rates of drug relapse among mothers. The proposed mechanism of action targeted by the intervention is a change in parental reflective functioning, defined as the capacity to recognize and make sense of mental states (especially emotional states) and understand how they influence behavior and relationships.</description>
