    <textblock>
      Phase 1 open-label study to estimate the safety, manufacturing feasibility, and efficacy of&#xD;
      intravenously administered, lentivirally transduced T cells expressing anti-CD123 chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptors expressing tandem TCRζ and 4-1BB (TCRζ /4-1BB) costimulatory domains in&#xD;
      pediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study to determine the safety, manufacturing feasibility, and efficacy of&#xD;
      CART123 cells following lymphodepleting chemotherapy in pediatric subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive CART123 cells via a single IV infusion at a dose of 2x10^6 CART123&#xD;
      cells/kg, following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The total dose administered to each subject&#xD;
      will be based on the subject's body weight obtained at the time of apheresis. The minimum&#xD;
      acceptable dose for infusion is 1x10^5 CART123 cells/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a 28-day stagger between the first 3 subject infusions, such that the next&#xD;
      subject may not receive treatment (lymphodepleting chemotherapy plus CART123 cells) until the&#xD;
      previous subject has completed their Day 28 safety follow-up visit and a DLT assessment has&#xD;
      been performed. Subsequent infusions will be staggered by a minimum of 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is recommended that subjects with marrow aplasia at Day 28+/-5 undergo an allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) as a rescue strategy. If required, this&#xD;
      procedure will be performed as part of routine care, outside of the scope of this research&#xD;
      study; however, subjects will continue to be followed onstudy. All subjects must, therefore,&#xD;
      have a previously identified stem cell donor as part of their eligibility to participate in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be followed monthly for up to 6 months after the CART123 cell infusion (Day&#xD;
      0). Thereafter, subjects will be transitioned into LTFU for up to 15 years post infusion.&#xD;

             disease. Specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Second or greater relapse defined as flow cytometric confirmation of myeloid&#xD;
                  leukemia of at least 0.1% after second documented complete remission; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Any detectable disease post-allogeneic transplant with flow cytometric&#xD;
                  confirmation (MRD) of myeloid leukemia of at least 0.1%; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Refractory disease, defined as persistent bone marrow involvement with &gt;5% blasts&#xD;
                  after two courses of induction chemotherapy for patients at initial presentation&#xD;
                  or &gt;5% bone marrow blasts after one course of re-induction chemotherapy for&#xD;
                  patients who have relapsed after previously achieving a CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must have a suitable stem cell donor available who may donate cells in the&#xD;
             event the subject needs to undergo an allogeneic HCT. Donor may be matched or&#xD;
             mismatched and must be found to be suitable according to the institution's standard&#xD;
             criteria; donors must be fully cleared to proceed as the donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Adequate organ function defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. A serum creatinine based on age/gender b. Adequate liver function i. ALT ≤ 5 x ULN&#xD;
             ii. Total bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN iii. ALT and/or bilirubin results that exceed this range&#xD;
             are acceptable if, in the opinion of the physician-investigator (or as confirmed by&#xD;
             liver biopsy), the abnormalities are directly related to ALL infiltration of the&#xD;
             liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
             c. Must have a minimum level of pulmonary reserve defined as ≤ Grade 1 dyspnea and &lt;&#xD;
             Grade 3 hypoxia; DLCO ≥ 40% (corrected for anemia) if PFTs are clinically appropriate&#xD;

             ventricular function documented by a scan or a cardiologist. In cases where&#xD;
             quantitative assessment of LVSF/LVEF is not possible, a statement by the cardiologist&#xD;
             that the ECHO shows qualitatively normal ventricular function will suffice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Adequate performance status defined as Lansky or Karnofsky score ≥ 50&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Signed informed consent must be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No contraindications for leukapheresis (unless apheresis product previously acquired).&#xD;

             therapy during collection or after infusion. Steroids for disease treatment at times&#xD;
             other than cell collection or at the time of infusion are permitted. Use of&#xD;
             physiologic replacement hydrocortisone or inhaled steroids is permitted as well.&#xD;
