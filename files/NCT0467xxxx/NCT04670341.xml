  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bubble tea drinks contain tea and tapioca pearls. Chewing tapioca pearls in bubble tea drinks&#xD;
      may increase salivary components. Because of its proteins, inorganic components, and enzymes,&#xD;
      saliva plays an important role in the body's defense against bacteria and viruses. This study&#xD;
      aims to analyze the effect of chewing the tapioca pearls in bubble tea drinks on salivary&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and calcium (Ca) levels.&#xD;

      Sixty saliva samples were collected from 15 subjects. The inclusion criterion was 18-25 years&#xD;
      of age. The exclusion criteria were receiving medication, using dentures, a history of dry&#xD;
      mouth, smoking and systemic disease. In the first week of the experiment, subjects drank&#xD;
      bubble tea as the intervention group. In the second week, the same subjects drank tea without&#xD;
      pearls as the control group. Each subject drank the bubble tea for 5 minutes per day over 3&#xD;
      days. Saliva samples were collected on the first day before bubble tea consumption (pretest)&#xD;
      and on the third day after tea consumption (posttest). Saliva collection was performed in the&#xD;
      morning (09:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.) for 1 minute. Salivary CRP levels were measured using an&#xD;
      ELISA kit, and Ca levels were determined using a test kit.&#xD;
