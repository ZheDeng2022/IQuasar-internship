      The Self-Testing options in the Era of Primary HPV screening for cervical cancer (STEP) trial&#xD;
      will evaluate effectiveness of home-based HPV kits for improving cervical cancer screening&#xD;
      uptake and its cost-effectiveness. The investigators will compare cervical cancer screening&#xD;
      uptake within six months among women randomized to different outreach approaches based on&#xD;
      prior screening behavior: A) Adherent and coming due: direct mail HPV kit vs. opt-in HPV kit&#xD;
      vs. education; B) Overdue: direct mail HPV kit vs. education; C) Unknown: opt-in HPV kit vs.&#xD;
      education.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The scientific objective of the proposed research is to study whether an in-home programmatic&#xD;
      HPV screening outreach strategy improves cervical cancer screening initiation and uptake.&#xD;
      Identifying new, patient-centered options that motivate continued screening initiation and&#xD;
      uptake is essential now and in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In August 2018, the US Preventive Services Task Force released updated cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening guidelines that include human papillomavirus (HPV) testing alone (ie, primary HPV&#xD;
      screening) as a newly recommended strategy for women aged 30-65 years. With primary HPV&#xD;
      screening, home-based screening is an emerging option, because HPV tests (unlike Pap tests)&#xD;
      can be performed on clinician- or self-collected samples. Self-collected samples are as&#xD;
      sensitive as clinician-collected samples in detecting HPV and mailing HPV self-sampling kits&#xD;
      increases screening participation. As US healthcare systems prepare to implement primary HPV&#xD;
      screening, they will need to consider a variety of strategies. To date, HPV self-sampling&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials have included only overdue women; no study has evaluated uptake&#xD;
      and acceptance of HPV self-sampling kits as an alternative to in-clinic screening in a&#xD;
      screening-adherent population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our Home-based Options to Make cervical cancer screening Easy (HOME) trial&#xD;
      (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02005510), most women will test negative (88%) and can continue&#xD;
      routine screening; 11% will require in-clinic follow-up: 3% directly to colposcopy&#xD;
      (HPV-16/18+ results) and 8% to Pap because of &quot;HPV+ other&quot; results or an unsatisfactory&#xD;
      result (&lt;1%). For home-based HPV screening strategies to be successful, ensuring high&#xD;
      follow-up compliance in the minority of women who test positive is critical.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will test interventions separately by prior cervical cancer screening behavior: Screening Adherent, Overdue, and Unknown history. Interventions will differ by screening behavior.&#xD;
Previously Adherent: Previously screened for cervical cancer with a known due date within three months&#xD;
Overdue: Never screened for cervical cancer; or HPV and Pap co-test &gt;5.25 years ago [or Pap alone &gt;3.25 years ago]; or no past Pap and continuously enrolled at Kaiser Permanente Washington for ≥3.25 years.&#xD;
Unknown Prior Screening Behavior: Enrolled at Kaiser Permanente Washington for ≥6 months and &lt;3.25 years, with no recorded cervical cancer screening history.&#xD;
Cohort randomization allocation will be assigned as follows to intervention arms: Previously Adherent (Usual Care, Education, Opt-in, and Direct Mail); Overdue (Usual Care, Education, and Direct Mail); and Unknown (Usual Care, Education, and Opt-in).</intervention_model_description>
