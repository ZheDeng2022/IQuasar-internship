  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PACIFIC-PUMCH-R is an ambispective cohort study that will enroll approximately 100 patients&#xD;
      with lung cancer who have received at least one dose of durvalumab between July 2020 and July&#xD;
      2021. Patient selection and data collection will be from Peking Union Medical College&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 will include patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (according to the Staging Manual in Thoracic Oncology, version 7, of the International&#xD;
      Association for the Study of Lung Cancer) who did not have disease progression after&#xD;
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The primary objective of Cohort 1 is to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of durvalumab in a real-life setting by evaluating PFS and OS in Chinese&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 will enroll patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC or SCLC&#xD;
      who have received chemotherapy/radiotherapy at the physician's discretion. And this Cohort&#xD;
      aimed to assess the safety of durvalumab for the treatment of lung cancer in clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
