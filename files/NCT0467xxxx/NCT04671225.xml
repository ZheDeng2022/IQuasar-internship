  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Mental health- and neurological disorders constitute 13% of the global burden of&#xD;
      disease. Alarmingly this burden has risen by 41% in the last 20 years. In&#xD;
      low-and-middle-income countries as few as 10% of people living with bipolar disorder receive&#xD;
      care. In western countries, the efficacy of psychoeducation, as an add-on treatment to&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy in the treatment of symptoms and in relapse prevention initiatives with&#xD;
      respect to bipolar disorder, is well documented. Yet, few studies on psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions for bipolar disorder have been conducted in a low-income country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To determine the effect, feasibility and acceptability of psychoeducation for patients&#xD;
      with bipolar disorder on all three levels of the health care system in Rwanda - at the&#xD;
      community health centre, district- and university hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients will be randomized into either group A) group-psychoeducation at a referral&#xD;
      hospital; or B) group-psychoeducation for both patients and relatives or C) waiting list.&#xD;
      Moreover a district trial will test the impact and feasibility of psychoeducation at the&#xD;
      district level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Reduction in symptom severity and incidence of relapse, improved quality of life,&#xD;
      medical adherence and knowledge, as well as reduced self-stigmatization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives: If proven successful, this is of importance for closing the huge treatment gap&#xD;
      in mental health particularly affecting low- and middle-income countries and may reduce the&#xD;
      mortality and increase quality of life in the population suffering from bipolar disorder.&#xD;
      Furthermore, potential positive outcomes may be implemented in similar low-resource settings&#xD;
      elsewhere.&#xD;

      Background: Mental health and neurological disorders constitute 13% of the global burden of&#xD;
      diseases. Alarmingly this burden has risen by 41% in the last 20 years. It is estimated that&#xD;
      severe mental disorders (i.e. severe depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other&#xD;
      psychotic disorders) have a two to three times higher average mortality compared to the&#xD;
      general population. Treatment rates for these disorders are low in low-and-middle-income&#xD;
      countries (LMICs), where treatment gaps of more than 90% have been documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In western countries, the efficacy of psychoeducation, as an add-on treatment to&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy in the treatment of symptoms and relapse prevention initiatives concerning&#xD;
      bipolar disorder (BD), is well documented. Yet, few studies on psychosocial interventions for&#xD;
      BD have been conducted in low-income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the study is to determine the effect, feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      psychoeducation for patients with BD in Rwanda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study is divided into a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) and a&#xD;
      district trial. Patients with bipolar disease type I or II that meet DSM-V diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria given by a trained psychiatrist and age â‰¥ 18 years will be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the RCT study participants will be randomised to 1) group-psychoeducation for patients&#xD;
      and relatives, 2) a waiting list. The RCT will take place at a referral hospital. The&#xD;
      district trial compares the impact of psychoeducation given at the district level by mental&#xD;
      health nurses with psychoeducation conducted at referral hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Manual-structured group psychoeducation with eight sessions of 90 minutes over&#xD;
      eight weeks (at one session per week). Patients will be offered to invite their relatives for&#xD;
      2-3 psychoeducation-days for relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcome is a reduction in symptom severity, the incidence of relapse&#xD;
      and hospitalization. Secondary outcomes include Improved quality of life and medication&#xD;
      adherence and knowledge, as well as reduced self-stigmatization. All outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at the 3 and 6 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: In the literature on group-psychoeducation, 13 out of 18 RCT's have a reduction&#xD;
      in general psychiatric symptom severity, the incidence of relapse and hospitalization as main&#xD;
      outcomes. Eighteen RCT's on group psychoeducation for BD were reviewed before a study of&#xD;
      Colom et al. was selected as the base of the power calculation. The incidence of relapse in&#xD;
      the study was (92%) (55 subjects) in the control group vs 67% (40 subjects) in the&#xD;
      psychoeducation group. For this study, a sample size of 40 patients for each arm is required&#xD;
      to achieve a level of 80% power with a 5% level of significance when comparing the mean&#xD;
      change in each intervention with the control arm via a two-sample t-test. Adjusting for a&#xD;
      drop-out rate of 20%: 40/(1-(20/100))= 50 participants will be needed for each group (50 for&#xD;
      intervention, 50 for waiting-list and 50 for the district trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Study participants at the hospital level who meet the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      sign the informed consent form will be randomized individually into either intervention-arm&#xD;
      or waiting list through block-randomization with a ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients at the district level will not be randomized since the number of patients with BD at&#xD;
      these levels is unknown and can result in the sample size will be too small. Instead, all&#xD;
      will be offered participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Approval The research protocol and study-related documents have been approved by the&#xD;
      College of Medicine and Health Sciences Institutional Review Board, Rwanda and The National&#xD;
      Council for Science and Technology (NCST) in Rwanda.&#xD;
