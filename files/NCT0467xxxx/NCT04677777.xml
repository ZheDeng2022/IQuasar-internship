      The study will evaluate the safety of a single administration of PP-007 in patients admitted&#xD;
      to a hospital for Acute Ischemic Stroke. PP-007 is pegylated bovine carboxyhemoglobin and&#xD;
      will be administered via IV infusion. The effects on collateral flow, infarct size and&#xD;
      functional outcome will also be evaluated. Patients will be randomized to either standard of&#xD;
      care excluding tPA, or PP-007. Patients may also receive thrombectomy.&#xD;
