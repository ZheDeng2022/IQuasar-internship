  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SPRINT PNS System will be offered to patients with postoperative knee pain following primary&#xD;
      unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) who meet eligibility criteria and consistent with&#xD;
      established coverage policy. SPRINT PNS System will be implanted for 60 days. At the&#xD;
      discretion of the physician, the first lead may be placed to stimulate the nerve innervating&#xD;
      the region of greatest pain. If pain is not adequately addressed by the first lead when&#xD;
      assessed at 10 days, a second lead may be placed approximately 2 weeks following the initial&#xD;
      lead placement.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is Pain Intensity using Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) from 0-10 with the higher number (10) being worse pain and (0) being no pain.&#xD;
Incidence of chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) through Pain Intensity will be looked at for patients throughout the study along with usage of the Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (PNS) device (hours/day).&#xD;
A collection of surveys already approved for patients following total knee arthroplasty from Stanford's Collaborative Health Outcomes Information Registry (CHOIR) will also be sent to patients.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 21 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Underwent a primary or revision unilateral TKA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed all CHOIR questionnaires before and after TKA surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent postsurgical knee pain ≥ 5 of 10 during ambulation as demonstrated on the&#xD;
             CHOIR assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must meet the definition of chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Pain that continues or is expected to continue for longer than 3 months from its&#xD;
                  initial onset or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Persistent pain that at the discretion of the physician has not resolved within&#xD;
                  the normal time course of healing or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Pain requiring opioid use beyond 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a pre-operative history of moderate to high dose use of opioids (≥ 50&#xD;
             morphine milligram equivalents (MME) average per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking opioids for reasons other than pain in knee that underwent TKA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with arthrofibrosis or indicated for manipulation under anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI &gt;35&#xD;

          -  Vulnerable population (e.g. pregnant women, prisoners, minors, or employees)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Deep brain stimulation (DBS) system, an implanted active cardiac implant, or any other&#xD;
             implantable neurostimulator whose stimulus current pathway may overlap the SPRINT&#xD;
             stimulator's current pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition that may interfere with the ability to participate in a clinical&#xD;
             trial (e.g., anatomy that may interfere with lead placement, nerve damage in affected&#xD;
             leg, pain caused by knee implant requiring revision, compromised immune system) as&#xD;
             determined by the Investigator&#xD;
