  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CiproPAL is a randomised trial comparing daily ciprofloxacin with local standard care during&#xD;
      the induction phase of paediatric ALL treatment, and aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the efficacy of ciprofloxacin prophylaxis in the reduction of infection during&#xD;
           the induction phase of treatment for paediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia within the&#xD;
           ALLTogether-1 Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the impact of ciprofloxacin prophylaxis on antimicrobial resistance, both of&#xD;
           invasive infections and colonising organisms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre randomised trial of prophylactic ciprofloxacin (10mg/kg BD,&#xD;
      enteral/IV) versus standard of care during the neutropenic period of induction (with an&#xD;
      internal pilot study) in patients aged 1-17 years with de-novo ALL treated on ALLTogether-1.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include: patients with Down syndrome (who already receive ciprofloxacin&#xD;
      prophylaxis), contraindication to fluoroquinolones, non-consent to ALLTogether-1 or CiproPAL.&#xD;
      AMR of colonising organisms will be assessed with stool or peri-rectal swab cultures&#xD;
      performed at five timepoints within the first year. Longer term invasive infection AMR&#xD;
      monitoring will include sensitivity testing of all organisms isolated in confirmed infection&#xD;
      for the duration of ALLTogether-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the rate of sterile site bacterial infections during induction,&#xD;
      evaluated by intention to treat analysis. Secondary outcomes include rates of febrile&#xD;
      episodes, febrile neutropenia, severe infection and infection-related death; rates of AMR;&#xD;
      antibiotic exposure; secondary infections; and quinolone side effects. A model-based health&#xD;
      economic analysis will be undertaken. Using a conservative effect estimate of 40% reduction&#xD;
      in bacteraemia (i.e. a reduction from 15% to 9%) 1052 patients randomised 1:1 gives 85% power&#xD;
      with a 5% 2-sided alpha.&#xD;
