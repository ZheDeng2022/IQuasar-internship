    <textblock>
      Research question is can volunteers be trained to deliver an exercise programme for&#xD;
      community-dwelling older people attending community clubs and is the intervention acceptable&#xD;
      to older people and volunteers? Physical activity is important for older adults and studies&#xD;
      have shown the benefits of physical activity on health outcomes including maintenance of&#xD;
      physical function, improvement in well-being and quality of life, and reduction in mortality&#xD;
      risk. A recent report on physical activity guidelines published by the Department of Health&#xD;
      and Social Care highlighted the importance of physical activity in healthy ageing.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, current evidence suggests that less than 7% of community-dwelling older adults&#xD;
      meet the recommended physical activity guideline of 150 minutes of moderate vigorous physical&#xD;
      activity per week. A review of current literature suggests some evidence that volunteers can&#xD;
      be trained to deliver physical activity interventions for community-dwelling older people.&#xD;
      Yet few studies have been conducted in the UK, and there is a knowledge gap in understanding&#xD;
      the facilitators and barriers of training volunteers to deliver physical activity&#xD;
      interventions for community-dwelling older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore the feasibility and acceptability of implementing volunteer-led&#xD;
      exercise classes at local community clubs to encourage older people living in the community&#xD;
      to be more active. The investigators aim to develop and evaluate a training programme for&#xD;
      volunteers, determine the acceptability of the intervention through qualitative methods and&#xD;
      identify facilitators and barriers to its implementation. The investigators will also explore&#xD;
      the impact of the intervention on health outcomes for older people to inform future trial.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quasi-experimental mixed methods approach will be used to determine the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of implementing volunteer-led exercise sessions in community clubs. This&#xD;
      feasibility study will be conducted at community-clubs managed by Brendoncare. The&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention will also be examined through qualitative interviews and&#xD;
      focus groups to explore the views and experiences of volunteers and older adults involved in&#xD;
      this study. The impact of the intervention on physical activity levels and functional&#xD;
      outcomes will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quasi-experimental mixed methods approach will be used to determine the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of this volunteer-led physical activity intervention. This feasibility study&#xD;
      will be conducted at community-clubs with a focus on social interactions managed by&#xD;
      Brendoncare. Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the community clubs are currently meeting online.&#xD;
      The exercise intervention will be conducted online and will consist mainly of seated&#xD;
      exercises. The impact of the intervention on physical activity levels and functional outcomes&#xD;
      will be measured. The acceptability of the intervention will also be examined through&#xD;
      qualitative interviews and focus groups to explore the views and experiences of volunteers&#xD;
      and older adults involved in this study. Facilitators and barriers to the intervention will&#xD;
      be identified to inform future implementation studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community-dwelling older adults who attend Brendoncare community clubs will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in this study. The inclusion criteria are community-dwelling older adults age 65&#xD;
      years and above who able to provide written consent. Club members who are not able to&#xD;
      transfer or walk independently, and those who are actively participating in other exercise&#xD;
      classes, will be excluded from the study. A sample size of 30 participants was chosen for&#xD;
      pragmatic reasons for this feasibility study. Each Brendoncare club consists of between 10 -&#xD;
      20 regular members and to achieve the desired sample size, the intervention will need to be&#xD;
      implemented in three clubs. The regional manager and club volunteers of the respective clubs&#xD;
      will inform eligible club members about the study and those who are keen to participate in&#xD;
      this study will be approached by the research team to be recruited to the study. Club members&#xD;
      who have been approached but decline to take part will be asked if they are willing to&#xD;
      discuss their reasons for doing so. This will help in the evaluation of the acceptability of&#xD;
      the intervention. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the community clubs are currently meeting&#xD;
      online. The clubs will reconvene according to government guidance taking into consideration&#xD;
      social distancing measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and training of volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Brendoncare clubs are managed by paid staff members but the activities are led by&#xD;
      volunteers. Existing volunteers who are actively involved in the clubs will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in this study and receive training to deliver the intervention. Volunteers will&#xD;
      be provided with participant information sheets and written consent will be obtained from&#xD;
      volunteers who are willing to participate in this study. The volunteer training programme&#xD;
      will consist of a half a day theoretical training session followed by practical sessions.&#xD;
      This will be conducted online. It will be led by a senior physiotherapist, Esther Clift (EC)&#xD;
      and the study PI, Stephen Lim (SL). The training programme will be developed based on&#xD;
      clinical expertise from therapists and current evidence including experience from a recently&#xD;
      completed study (the SoMoVe study). The training session will include training on personal&#xD;
      safety and safety of participants, and the exercise and mobility protocols. As these are&#xD;
      existing volunteers, they would have been recruited, and received the generic clearance and&#xD;
      training provided by Brendoncare. Throughout the study period, fidelity checks will be&#xD;
      conducted by EC and SL to ensure that the volunteers are delivering high quality exercise&#xD;
      sessions. Volunteers will also receive training on how to document adverse events that occur&#xD;
      during the exercise classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of a once weekly volunteer-led group exercise which will take place&#xD;
      online and at the community clubs over 6 months. Besides exercising, participants are also&#xD;
      encouraged to increase mobility levels. The exercise sessions will be piloted in one club&#xD;
      before being extended to other clubs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant characteristics including age, gender, domicile status, body mass index,&#xD;
      co-morbidities and number of medications will be recorded. PRISMA 7 will be used to&#xD;
      characterise participants' frailty status. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) will be used&#xD;
      to assess participants' cognitive function. The club location, size, usual activity details&#xD;
      and age range of club members will also be recorded to provide contextual information for&#xD;
      each club.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is the feasibility of implementing volunteer-led exercise&#xD;
      sessions in the community for older adults. This will be assessed by determining the number&#xD;
      of volunteers recruited, trained and retained at the end of the study, the number of physical&#xD;
      activity sessions delivered and fidelity of volunteer delivery of and participants'&#xD;
      participation in the exercise sessions. The secondary outcome measures include the&#xD;
      measurement of physical activity levels and physical function. Physical activity levels will&#xD;
      be measured using the CHAMPS questionnaire. Physical function will be measured using the&#xD;
      Barthel Index. Other outcome measures include EuroQOL as a measure of quality of life, and&#xD;
      measure of sarcopenia using SARC-F questionnaire. These outcome measures will be recorded at&#xD;
      recruitment and repeated at 6 months and 12 months to capture any changes. Cost analysis will&#xD;
      be conducted to determine the cost of implementing this intervention. To determine the safety&#xD;
      of the intervention, adverse events that occur as a result of the intervention will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be conducted among older adults and volunteers to determine the acceptability&#xD;
      of the intervention and explore any barriers and enablers to participation and adherence to&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older adults will be selected by purposive sampling to share their thoughts and views&#xD;
      regarding the implementation of the volunteer-led physical activity session. To ensure a wide&#xD;
      range of views are included in the interviews, participants will be selected to ensure equal&#xD;
      distribution of male and female patients, different clubs and a representative age range. The&#xD;
      aim is to interview at least three participants per club, with a total number of 9&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will also be conducted for volunteers leading the intervention. The shared&#xD;
      experience of volunteers in delivering the intervention will be explored through a group&#xD;
      setting. The aim is to interview at least two volunteers from each club, with a total number&#xD;
      of six volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews will be semi-structured and consist of several key open-ended questions that&#xD;
      help define the areas explored but allow the interviewer or interviewee to expand and diverge&#xD;
      with the aim of pursuing or developing an idea with more depth. The interview schedules will&#xD;
      be underpinned by Normalisation Process Theory.The interviews will seek to explore the views&#xD;
      of older adults and volunteers on the exercise sessions, the barriers and facilitators to the&#xD;
      intervention and suggestions for future implementation studies. The interviews will be&#xD;
      audio-recorded for data collection purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data analysis Data collected will be double entered into a secured database for&#xD;
      analysis. Statistical analysis will be conducted using the statistical software SPSS.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics -median (IQR); mean (SD); number (%) - will be used to analyse the&#xD;
      numbers of volunteers recruited, trained and retained, as well as the type and extent of&#xD;
      progression of the resistance exercise, and duration of their activity, and patients'&#xD;
      adherence to the intervention. Analysis of the above outcome measures will be used to develop&#xD;
      an assessment of the feasibility of delivering this intervention. To determine suitability&#xD;
      for a future, fully-powered effectiveness study of the intervention, outcome measures&#xD;
      recorded at baseline will be compared to measurement at 6 and 12 months to determine if PA&#xD;
      intervention had an impact of physical activity levels measured by CHAMPS, functional&#xD;
      outcomes including Barthel Index, and quality of life (EuroQol). The distribution of each&#xD;
      outcome measure will be assessed for normality and described using parametric or&#xD;
      non-parametric statistics accordingly. A basic cost-analysis of the training programme will&#xD;
      be carried out, costing the time of clinical staff involved in delivering the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data analysis Data collected from the interviews will be transcribed verbatim and&#xD;
      analysed using thematic analysis (TA). The audio-recordings will be transcribed by an&#xD;
      administrative colleague within the research department who is experienced in transcribing&#xD;
      qualitative data. Analysis of qualitative data will be conducted using either Microsoft Word,&#xD;
      or with the help of NVIVO, depending on the amount of data collected. Transcribed text will&#xD;
      be read and coded separately and then together by two researchers. The codes will be analysed&#xD;
      to generate concepts and ideas to determine the acceptability of the intervention, and to&#xD;
      identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation process. The codes act as tags or&#xD;
      labels to help catalogue key concepts embedded within the raw data. From the codes, themes&#xD;
      will be developed to reflect the views and experiences of the community-dwelling older adults&#xD;
      and volunteers regarding the community-based PA intervention.&#xD;
