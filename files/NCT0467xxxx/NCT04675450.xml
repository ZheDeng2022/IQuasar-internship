  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple center, randomized, double-blind, Phase 2 study of NBP administered to&#xD;
      women with metastatic breast cancer who receive nab-paclitaxel as therapy. Nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      will be administered at a dose &gt;260 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 4 planned cycles. Subjects will&#xD;
      begin receiving NBP orally at a dose of 400 mg administered every 12-hours (BID) or matching&#xD;
      placebo 5 days (10 doses) prior to starting nab-paclitaxel therapy and continue to&#xD;
      self-administer it BID until Visit 6/Day 100/Week 15. The primary objective is to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of NBP relative to placebo at preventing or reducing symptoms associated with&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel induced toxic neuropathy (CIPN). The secondary objectives include an&#xD;
      evaluation the efficacy of NBP relative to placebo at preventing or attenuating taxane&#xD;
      induced acute pain syndrome (TAPS), the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of NBP&#xD;
      relative to placebo and to determine if NBP administration impacts the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel or if nab-paclitaxel affects the pharmacokinetics of NBP.&#xD;
