  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MK-8189 in participants&#xD;
      with moderate hepatic impairment (based on the Child-Pugh classification) to healthy&#xD;
      participants. This is Part 1 of the study; following review of the safety and PK data from&#xD;
      Part 1, a decision will be made as to whether Part 2 of the study will be initiated. If done,&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study will compare the PK of MK-8189 in participants with mild hepatic&#xD;
      impairment to healthy participants.&#xD;

    <description>AUC0-inf is a measure of the total amount of drug in the plasma from the dose administration to the last measurable sample. Blood samples collected pre and post-dose at multiple timepoints will be used to estimate AUC0-inf following MK-8189 administration.</description>

    <description>Cmax is the maximum concentration of MK-8189 observed in plasma. Blood samples collected pre and post-dose at multiple timepoints will be used to estimate Cmax following MK-8189 administration.</description>
