    <textblock>
      MIL93 is a recombinant humanized anti-Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) IgG1 monoclonal antibody. This&#xD;
      is an open label Phase I study to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      efficacy of MIL93 in Advanced or Metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;

      This study is composed of two stages:Part I is mono-therapy dose escalation and dose&#xD;
      expansion study, and Part II is the study of combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation study will be conducted using Part I for testing optimal doses at 0.3,1,&#xD;
      3, 10, 20, 30 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W). An accelerated titration followed by traditional 3+3&#xD;
      design will be used in this study with a 21-day dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation&#xD;
      period. Based on the data of dose escalation study, determine whether to carry out dose&#xD;
      escalation at frequency of every 2 weeks(Q2W) and how many cohorts will be added in dose&#xD;
      expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the data of Part I, one or two doses will be conducted in the study of combination&#xD;
      therapy. The study of PART II is composed of two cohorts. Cohort 1:Subjects with untreated&#xD;
      CLDN18.2 positive gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma(G/GEJAC) will be treated&#xD;
      with MIL93 and standard first-line chemotherapy.Cohort 2:Subjects with untreated CLDN18.2&#xD;
      positive pancreatic cancer will be treated with MIL93 and standard first-line chemotherapy.&#xD;
