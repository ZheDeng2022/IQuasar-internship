      Background Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is most commonly located at the uterosacral&#xD;
      ligaments, rectovaginal septum, pararectal space and vesicouterine fold. A nodule within the&#xD;
      uterosacral ligaments (i.e involvement of the dorsal parametrium), increases the complexity&#xD;
      of surgical resection. Parametrial involvement in DIE cases occurs in 25% of patients with&#xD;
      severe endometriosis, possibly with hypogastric/sacral plexus or sciatic nerve involvement.&#xD;
      The bladder functional impairment, after surgery for DIE involved the parametria, may vary&#xD;
      between the 6.5% to 32.8%. Preservation of the hypogastric and pelvic splanchnic nerves&#xD;
      represents the key aspect in pelvic surgery to prevent postoperative voiding disfunction.&#xD;
      Several techniques for the excision of DIE have been described, but large, prospective RCTs&#xD;
      are lacking. In particular, a clear standardization of the parametrectomy for DIE is missing.&#xD;
      Systematic reviews on the surgical treatment of DIE demonstrated that it is impossible to&#xD;
      compare the literature about the parametrectomy for DIE, because to unclear definitions and&#xD;
      lack of standardization. We therefore believe it is necessary to propose a standardization of&#xD;
      the definition of parametrectomy performed during procedures for DIE, to allow a clear&#xD;
      comparison in the future between scientific works on surgical treatment of DIE, as already&#xD;
      widely accepted in gynaecologic oncology with the classification of radical hysterectomy of&#xD;
      Querleu-Morrow. In particular we believe that the parametrectomy for DIE must be described&#xD;
      based on its anatomical extension and focused on the concepts of nerve sparing dissection,&#xD;
      and vascular structures preservation, to reduce the risk of complications due to ischemia&#xD;
      (i.e. ureter fistula).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale A standardized description of the procedure (parametrectomy) will allow the&#xD;
      comparison between the different techniques in terms of functionality preservation of the&#xD;
      pelvic sympathetic and parasympathetic neural pathway. Therefore, the availability of a clear&#xD;
      classification able to define parametria involvement during surgery would be clinically&#xD;
      relevant, as they would allow to optimize counselling (risk of neurological consequences) and&#xD;
      surgery planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of the study Multicentric prospective observational study. Primary objective To&#xD;
      determinate the incidence of bladder functional impairment, after surgery for DIE involved&#xD;
      the parametria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives To classify the parametrectomy into a clear system of classification,&#xD;
      based on anatomical landmark, and evaluate intra/postoperative complication to each classes&#xD;
      of proposed parametrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size has been calculated on the basis of the primary objective; in&#xD;
      order to detect a proportion of bladder functional impairment of 30%, with a confidence level&#xD;
      of 95% and a margin of error of 9%, a sample of N=100 patients is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria - Patient scheduled for surgery for DIE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmation of DIE needed of parametrectomy at laparoscopic surgery Exclusion criteria&#xD;
           - Patients younger than 18 years and older than 50 years at time of operation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refusal to answer the questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of sexual activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-operative urodynamic diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction Statistical&#xD;
           analysis The sample will be described in its clinical and demographic characteristics&#xD;
           using descriptive statistics techniques. Qualitative variables will be summarized as&#xD;
           frequencies and percentages. Quantitative variables will be presented as mean (std.dev).&#xD;
           Normality of data will be checked with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The primary objective&#xD;
           will be achieved calculating the incidence of bladder functional impairment after&#xD;
           surgery. The secondary objective will be achieved using descriptive statistics&#xD;
           techniques already described.&#xD;
