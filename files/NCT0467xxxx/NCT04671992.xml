  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caudal block is an easy and effective type of central neuraxial block that is widely used in&#xD;
      subumbilical surgeries to provide intraoperative and postoperative analgesia in the pediatric&#xD;
      population. Caudal block application with ultrasound (USG) was first applied in 2003. Sacrum,&#xD;
      sacral cornular, sacrococcygeal ligament and sacral hiatus can be easily distinguished by&#xD;
      ultrasound. The probe is positioned in a horizontal midline position on the lower sacrum.&#xD;
      Sacral roots within the caudal epidural space can be seen as hypoechoic ellipses. In&#xD;
      addition, anatomical variations of the sacral hiatus and the process area can be clearly&#xD;
      observed. A accurate probe use with ultrasound guided is confirmed by advancing the caudal&#xD;
      needle in the desired direction, widening in the sacral hiatus with local anesthetic&#xD;
      injection, and the turbulence observed during injection into the sacral canal if the color&#xD;
      doppler feature is used. Thus, a decrease in complications and an increase in the success of&#xD;
      the procedure can be achieved with simultaneous imaging. In addition, in cases where the&#xD;
      block is difficult, the in-plane technique can be preferred in the midline plane.The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to compare the success rates and postoperative pain levels of caudal block&#xD;
      applications with the out of plane technique (probe applied by holding horizontal) and&#xD;
      in-plane technique (probe applied vertically), which is routinely applied with ultrasound in&#xD;
      pediatric hypospadias surgery.&#xD;

      This study will be scheduled between January - March 2021 at Selcuk University Department of&#xD;
      Anesthesiology and Reanimation. A total of 70 patients from American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists classification physical status of (ASA-PS) I-II, aged 6 months to 10 years,&#xD;
      will be included in the study. Routine monitoring electrocardiogram (ECG), peripheral oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2) and non-invasive blood pressure measurements will be made to patients into&#xD;
      the operating room, and their basal levels will be recorded. All patients were transferred to&#xD;
      the operating room without premedication. The patients will be assigned to two groups as&#xD;
      in-plane technique (Group IP) and out of-plane technique (Group OP) according to the program&#xD;
      randomization list. Routine anesthesia induction will be performed with 7-8% sevoflurane,&#xD;
      100% oxygen until the patient loses consciousness with a face mask. Then, vascular access&#xD;
      will be established and propofol 2-3 mg for general anesthesia induction. kg 1 and fentanyl 1&#xD;
      μg. kg-1 IV will be used. After the eyelash reflex disappears without any neuromuscular&#xD;
      blocker medication, a suitable laryngeal mask airway device will be placed into supraglottic&#xD;
      area, and the patient will be connected to the anesthesia device for ventilation. For the&#xD;
      maintenance of anesthesia, 2% sevoflurane, nitrous oxide will be stopped, and 50% oxygen +&#xD;
      air mixture will be used. For caudal epidural block, the patient will be turned to the&#xD;
      lateral position. After the asepsis of the perianal region is achieved, the sterile 8-18 MHz&#xD;
      lineer USG probe for Group OP will be placed transversely in the midline to obtain a&#xD;
      transverse view in the sacral hiatus. For group IP, the probe will be rotated 90 degrees and&#xD;
      applied with the in-plane technique. After it is observed that there is no blood or&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with aspiration, local anesthetic (LA) injection will be performed&#xD;
      under hemodynamic and ECG monitoring by calculating the dose as 0.5 mg.kg-1 (0.25%&#xD;
      bupivacaine) and the volume as 0.5 ml.kg-1. A successful block will be defined as the absence&#xD;
      of significant motor movements after surgical induction, after heart and respiratory rates do&#xD;
      not increase up to 20% above basal levels. In addition, block application time, number of&#xD;
      needle attempts, success at first entry, ease of visualization, LA spread will be recorded&#xD;
      and evaluated as the success rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, the surgical caudal block will begin 10 minutes after anesthesia.&#xD;
      Intraoperative opioids or sedative drugs will not be used. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate&#xD;
      and oxygen saturation of the patients will be recorded every 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the surgery, patients will be extubated and followed up in the postoperative&#xD;
      recovery unit. Postoperative pain 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th&#xD;
      hours FLACC pain scale (Face Legs Activity Cry Consolabity = face , legs, activity, crying,&#xD;
      consolation). Time to first analgesia requirement, total analgesic consumption and&#xD;
      postoperative complications will be recorded. In the evaluations made to patients in both&#xD;
      groups, if the FLACC scale is&gt; 4, rescue analgesia will be administered intravenously with 15&#xD;
      mg.kg-1 paracetamol.&#xD;
