      This study will ask ranked first person shooters in esports to participate on three separate&#xD;
      days from their home computer to test executive function prior tp play and following two&#xD;
      hours of play. One testing day will incorporate a 6 minute walk break, another day will&#xD;
      incorporate a 6 minute rest break, and the third day will be continuous play. Executive tests&#xD;
      will be administered electronically prior to game play and post game play.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A ranked first person shooter player will play for two hours each session, and on separate&#xD;
      days will take a 6 minute walking break or a 6 minute resting break within 2 hours of game&#xD;
      play. This study is virtual and you may play from your regular home gaming computer. The&#xD;
      third day will be continuous play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place on 3 separate days. Preferably 2 -3 days in -between testing days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will sign an electronic consent form to sign and agree to participate. It&#xD;
           will explain the study in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will then be asked to take two executive function tests online. These test&#xD;
           will be sent electronically through email. This is for practice. These tests take&#xD;
           approximately 6-7 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will schedule one day where the participant will play a first -person shooter game.&#xD;
           Prior to playing the participants will be take to take the two executive function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On one day the participant will be asked to stop after the first hour (they will be&#xD;
           allowed to finish the test) they will either walk for 6 minutes near their computer or&#xD;
           rest for 6 minutes. Participants will be contacted through cell phones or discord.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Game play will resume normally for another hour. When that hour is completed the&#xD;
           participant will be asked to take the two online tests again.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This will be 2 days. The third day the participant will take the online tests and play&#xD;
           continuous for 2 hours with no break and then repeat the online tests.&#xD;
