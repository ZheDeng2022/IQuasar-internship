  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of E2730 of multiple ascending oral doses in healthy adult participants&#xD;
      and to assess the differences in PK, safety, and tolerability of E2730 between healthy&#xD;
      Japanese and non-Japanese participants following multiple doses. This study will also&#xD;
      determine the effect of food on PK of E2730.&#xD;
