  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ospemifene is the first oral and non-hormonal treatment for moderate or severe vulvo-vaginal&#xD;
      atrophy (VVA) in postmenopausal women who are not candidates to treatment with local&#xD;
      oestrogens. Its effects are mediated though the regeneration of the proportion of superficial&#xD;
      and intermediate cells of the vagina, improving menopausal symptomatology such as dryness and&#xD;
      dyspareunia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only two studies to date have directly compared brain activation patterns in women with&#xD;
      normal sexual function with women complaining with hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Arnow&#xD;
      et al. demonstrated that women with normal sexual function showed brain activations in&#xD;
      multiple regions different from women with FSIAD. When comparing the two groups, women with&#xD;
      normal sexual function showed greater activation of the bilateral entorhinal cortex while&#xD;
      women with FSIAD exhibited greater activation of the medial frontal gyrus, right inferior&#xD;
      frontal gyrus, and bilateral putamen. The medial frontal gyrus activation has been associated&#xD;
      with self-monitoring; thus, it is possible that women with FSIAD allocate more attention to&#xD;
      monitoring their response, which may be inhibitory to sexual functioning. The other study was&#xD;
      done by Woodard and colleges showing that women with normal sexual function showed&#xD;
      significantly differences on cerebral activation in comparison with women with FSIAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These differences observed in women with FSIAD could suggest that they may have alterations&#xD;
      in activation of limbic and cortical structures responsible for acquiring, encoding, and&#xD;
      retrieving memory, the processing and memory of emotional reactions, and areas responsible&#xD;
      for heightened attention to one's own physical state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason the authors believe that it is essential to determine if the effect of&#xD;
      ospemifene on the improvement on sexual function is due to the improvement on the vagina&#xD;
      tract or due to its effect on brain function.&#xD;

      To evaluate changes from baseline in brain activation patterns, by using functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques and sexual stimuli, in postmenopausal women with moderate&#xD;
      to severe vulvovaginal atrophy and FSIAD after 3 months treatment with ospemifene 60mg/day&#xD;
      compared to those treated with placebo. fMRI technique allows the study of brain activation&#xD;
      by detecting brain blood flow and oxygen level dependent changes induced by neuronal&#xD;
      activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain activation patterns will be defined by the number of voxels that significantly&#xD;
      changed their signal intensity during the stimuli presentation compared to the neutral&#xD;
      stimuli. Brain connectivity will be evaluated by using the activation map and the atlas of&#xD;
      neuroanatomic regions and comparing the number of voxels, its level of significance and the&#xD;
      different regions activated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain activation patterns changes (with fMRI) after sexual stimuli (visual or olfactive), in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with moderate to severe VVA and FSIAD after 3 months treatment with&#xD;
      ospemifene 60mg/day compared to those treated with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the fMRI session, the activation of each brain circuits/pattern is measured by the&#xD;
      blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal and with the Statistical Parametric Mapping method&#xD;
      regularly used in fMRI studies to visualize brain activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the longitudinal study, a paired t-test will be used within each group to detect changes&#xD;
      in activation over time. The statistical threshold criterion to compare the different&#xD;
      activation maps between both groups is p &lt; 0.001 uncorrected with a minimum extent of 10&#xD;
      voxels. Only clusters that survive a p &lt; 0.05 FWE (family wise error) correction for multiple&#xD;
      comparisons will be considered statistically significant The region of interests who were&#xD;
      mainly observed are: medial occipital gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral thalamus,&#xD;
      caudate nucleus, left pale globe, cerebellum, left inferior parietal lobe, postcentral gyrus,&#xD;
      praecuneus, right medial frontal gyrus and left praecuneus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 consecutive postmenopausal women with moderate to severe VVA and FSIAD with&#xD;
      symptomatology will be recruited to participate in the study, 10 of which will be randomised&#xD;
      to the ospemifene group (VVA-FSIAD ospemifene group) and 10 will be randomised to the placebo&#xD;
      group (VVA-FSIAD placebo group). Additionally, a total of 5 consecutive postmenopausal women&#xD;
      with moderate to severe VVA not treated with ospemifene neither with any other VVA treatment&#xD;
      and without FSIAD will also be recruited (VVA not treated patients without FSIAD).&#xD;
