      The aim of this study is to investigate effects of Anulom vilom pranayama/ Alternate nasal&#xD;
      breathing (ANB) on cardio-respiratory parameters including vitals i.e. heart rate, blood&#xD;
      pressure, chest expansion, arterial blood gases (ABGs), pulmonary function test and&#xD;
      functional capacity in phase 1 post CABG patients. This study will help Cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      physiotherapists to incorporate evidence based protocols for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft&#xD;
      Surgery (CABG) in phase 1 of cardiac rehabilitation.&#xD;

      Breathing is essential function of the body. Learning of breath regulation permits to control&#xD;
      body's different mechanisms. &quot;Pranayama&quot; means control of breathing. ANB training consist of&#xD;
      mindful breathing. Alternate nostril breathing works on regulating respiratory pattern,&#xD;
      improvement of ventilation, clearance of lungs from retaining mucus, decrease in work of&#xD;
      breathing and relax the mind and body. Alternate-nostril breathing (ANB) is one type of&#xD;
      pranayama that contains inhalation from left side nostril and exhalation by right nostril&#xD;
      afterwards inhalation by right nostril and exhalation from left nostril. This technique&#xD;
      includes inhalation, exhalation and in advance training retention is also include. Its&#xD;
      duration can be vary as depends on person's own capacity. ANB is usually considered to&#xD;
      release mental conflict and stimulate mental stability and physical health. There are various&#xD;
      studies to evaluate the outcomes of alternate breathing technique on definite functions of&#xD;
      cognitive and physiological systems. cardiovascular disorder is the foremost reason of&#xD;
      passing away for both gender. Coronary Artery Disease(CAD) is narrowing or obstruction of the&#xD;
      arteries/vessels (which deliver nutrients and oxygen to the heart) as a result of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque or clot formed in the arteries. 50% patient with CAD showed their&#xD;
      first symptoms as cardiac arrest. In western world CAD is the most common root for death. In&#xD;
      worldwide, with the risk factors of Smoking, High cholesterol, Hypertension, Diabetes,&#xD;
      Emotional stress, Obesity and Sedentary life, each year 3.8 million men &amp; 3.4 million women&#xD;
      die due to CAD. Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(CABG) is most common surgery performed for&#xD;
      CAD. This operation can be one week of daily training of Pranayama revealed to induce&#xD;
      improvement in the sympathetic tone. Yoga practice along with different breathing exercises&#xD;
      improve cardiac output, reduce hepatic, renal blood flow and increases blood flow in cerebral&#xD;
      peripheral vessels. Heart rate vary with every single thought and environmental situation. In&#xD;
      Anulom - Vilom pranayama, practitioner not only tries to breathe, but at the same moment,&#xD;
      retain his focus on the action of breathing, leading to get awareness. This act of&#xD;
      attentiveness distract him from tough concerns and evokes relax response. In this stress free&#xD;
      state, parasympathetic nerve action supersedes sympathetic nerve's activity lead to&#xD;
      noteworthy reduction in systolic blood pressure. Short term training of Anulom vilom&#xD;
      pranayama indicated a substantial impact on Systolic Blood Pressure and showed an encouraging&#xD;
      outcome on mental and digestive functions. Studies conducted showed that three months Yoga&#xD;
      training is highly beneficial for the improvement of blood pressure and heart rate in stage 1&#xD;
      hypertensive patients. Role for ANB in hypertensive people is beneficial to perform focused&#xD;
      tasks without sympathetic activation (based on an increased BP). Practice of ANB in&#xD;
      Prehypertensive obese young adults for 15 min daily showed a significant improvement in&#xD;
      cardiovascular parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANB plays a significant role in improving the various ventilatory functions of lungs, vital&#xD;
      capacity and PEFR in pranayama practicing subjects. Increase in VC signifies complete&#xD;
      emptying and fullness of air. Blood Pressure and Pulse rate is related with Cardio Vascular&#xD;
      System, which is controlled by Autonomous nervous System (ANS). Pranayama accompanied by&#xD;
      breath control increases cardiac output, decreases hepatic, renal blood flow and increases&#xD;
      cerebral peripheral vessels blood flow. Heart rate varies with single thought and thoughtless&#xD;

      artery bypass surgery (CABG) is well recognized. It is a life-saving process which is usually&#xD;
      related with substantial postoperative pain. Various lungs functions may become compromised,&#xD;
      or visibly vain, because of severe chest pain and there is frequently chances to develop&#xD;
      restrictive lung disease after cardiac surgery. Though painkillers may be effective to&#xD;
      diminish the pain but they have side effects which include respiratory depression or&#xD;
      respiratory muscles weakness. Hence, development of chemical free approaches for effective&#xD;
      pain control is a long standing interest. After Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), the&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL) is main factor to morbidity and mortality. Adding of Yoga Based&#xD;
      Lifestyle Program (YLSP) to cardiac rehabilitation has established a valuable and actual&#xD;
      improvement in ejection fraction and decreasing in risk factor profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have been done on the efficacy of this exercise practice in healthy and clinical&#xD;
      populations on cardiovascular and the autonomic functions. Numerous investigations have&#xD;
      recommended that ANB improves the balance between sympathetic vagal and parasympathetic&#xD;
      dominance. Training of ANB after CABG improves chest expansion, peak expiratory flow rate and&#xD;
      decrease in pain. ANB along with conventional physiotherapy play a key role in improving&#xD;
      Respiratory function and depression issues in CABG patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature reviewed from different search engines has shown that alternate breathing&#xD;
      technique has significant positive effects on cardiorespiratory functions but very little&#xD;
      literature has been found specifically on phase 1 post CABG studies, regarding to ANB effect.&#xD;
