  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine the impacts of a 2-week relaxing music&#xD;
      intervention on stress, anxiety, and gut symptoms in individuals who regularly perform&#xD;
      structured aerobic exercise. Gut symptoms like bloating, reflux, cramping, nausea, etc. are&#xD;
      relatively common during prolonged aerobic exercise. In addition, previous research has&#xD;
      established that levels of anxiety and stress are associated with a higher occurrence of&#xD;
      these gut symptoms. Relaxing music has reduced anxiety in certain populations, but currently,&#xD;
      no studies are available on its effects on anxiety, stress, and gut symptoms in people who&#xD;
      regularly do aerobic exercise.&#xD;

    <time_frame>The intervention will last 2 weeks. Gastrointestinal symptoms will be collected for a 1-week period before the intervention and during the 2nd week of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of several gastrointestinal symptoms will be assessed on a validated 0-10 scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety levels</measure>
    <time_frame>The intervention will last 2 weeks. The General Anxiety Disorder-7 will be assessed before the intervention begins and again after 2 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of anxiety will be assessed with the General Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire. Scores on the General Anxiety Disorder-7 range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in visceral sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>The intervention will last 2 weeks. The Visceral Sensitivity Index will be assessed before the intervention begins and again after 2 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Perceptions of visceral sensitivity will be assessed via the Visceral Sensitivity Index. Scores on the Visceral Sensitivity Index can range from 0 to 75, with higher scores indicating a higher level of visceral sensitivity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceived stress</measure>
    <time_frame>The intervention will last 2 weeks. The Perceived Stress Scale 14 will be assessed before the intervention begins and again after 2 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived life stress will be evaluated with the Perceived Stress Scale 14. Scores on this scale can range from 0 to 56, will higher scores indicating greater amounts of stress.</description>
