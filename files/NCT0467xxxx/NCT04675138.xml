      Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) to augment clinical care and decision making. These&#xD;
      are platforms which aim to improve healthcare delivery by enhancing medical decisions with&#xD;
      targeted clinical knowledge, patient information, and other health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the benefit of developing a CDSS, we sought to develop an alternative CDSS for&#xD;
      oncologic therapy selection through a partnership with Ping An Technology (Shenzhen, China),&#xD;
      beginning with gastric and oesophagal cancer. This would be done in a piecemeal fashion, with&#xD;
      the prototype platform utilizing only international guidelines and high-quality published&#xD;
      evidence from journals to arrive at case-specific treatment recommendations. This platform&#xD;
      would then be evaluated by comparing its recommendations with that from the multidisciplinary&#xD;
      tumour boards of several tertiary care institutions to determine the concordance rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Management of cancer is a complex process which involves numerous stakeholders. In view of&#xD;
      this, institutions worldwide have adopted the use of Multidisciplinary Tumor Boards (MTBs)&#xD;
      for delivery of cancer care. By tapping on the collective specialized knowledge and&#xD;
      experience of various specialties, MTBs have been shown in some studies to result in more&#xD;
      appropriate recommendations and improved patient outcomes. At our institution, cancer cases&#xD;
      are similarly discussed at regular MTBs which comprises surgeons, oncologists, pathologists&#xD;
      and radiologists who review and recommend treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in smaller centres or centres with limited resources and minimal multi-disciplinary&#xD;
      expertise, delivery of timely and appropriate cancer care could be a challenge. Additionally,&#xD;
      clinicians, with their busy schedule, may not be able to keep abreast of new developments in&#xD;
      cancer research. With rapid advances in scientific research, this pool of knowledge is&#xD;
      expected to continue to burgeon, making keeping up-to-date increasingly onerous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this need, clinicians have adopted the use of Clinical Decision Support Systems&#xD;
      (CDSSs) to augment clinical care and decision-making. These are platforms which aim to&#xD;
      improve healthcare delivery by enhancing medical decisions with targeted clinical knowledge,&#xD;
      patient information, and other health information. Various studies have shown CDSSs to be&#xD;
      beneficial in selected settings such as patient safety and diagnosis [4], and to even&#xD;
      increase adherence to clinical guidelines. In recent years, advancements in artificial&#xD;
      intelligence have also seen its use expand to include oncologic therapy selection, with IBM's&#xD;
      Watson for Oncology (WFO) being the most prominent and only platform in use to-date. In a&#xD;
      2018 study, WFO's ability to provide treatment advice for breast cancer was compared against&#xD;
      recommendations from a multidisciplinary board, where it showed a high degree of concordance.&#xD;
      Since then, several other studies have sought to examine WFO's ability to provide treatment&#xD;
      recommendations for cancer such as ovarian, gastric, lung, cervical and colorectal cancers,&#xD;
      with mixed results. In particular, both studies which examined the recommendations for&#xD;
      gastric cancers showed a much lower concordance rate compared to other cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the above, we sought to develop an alternative CDSS for oncologic therapy&#xD;
      selection through partnership with Ping An Technology (Shenzhen, China), beginning with&#xD;
      gastric and esophageal cancer. This would be done in a piecemeal fashion, with the prototype&#xD;
      platform utilizing only international guidelines and high-quality published evidence from&#xD;
      journals to arrive at case-specific treatment recommendations. This platform would then be&#xD;
      evaluated retrospectively and prospectively by comparing its recommendations with that from&#xD;
      the multidisciplinary tumor boards of several tertiary care institutions to determine the&#xD;
      concordance rate.&#xD;
