  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fast access to the Emergency Medical Communication Center (EMCC) is essential for the&#xD;
      population in emergency situation. It is therefore essential that these call centers operate&#xD;
      quickly and provide good quality service. However, in recent years, EMCCs have experienced a&#xD;
      constant and increasing demand from the population. Thus, maintaining the current&#xD;
      organization of emergency medical communication centers raises questions about both the&#xD;
      volume of incoming calls to EMCCs and the economic constraints, which make it difficult to&#xD;
      manage call peaks, especially in periods of crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to assess the impact of incoming call distribution virtualization in&#xD;
      EMCCs on their service quality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      France is facing political decisions on the evolution of Emergency Medical Communication&#xD;
      Center organization to improve population accessibility. Regarding the performance targets&#xD;
      requested by the French government (MARCUS report:&#xD;
      http://www.urgences113.fr/marcus/Rapport_MARCUS3.pdf), the virtualization of inbound call&#xD;
      distribution could improve EMCC service quality indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Virtualization is a process that consists of centralizing calls from different&#xD;
      territories before distributing them to the centers concerned according to their&#xD;
      availability. The objective through this process is to improve the population' access to the&#xD;
      EMCC by reducing waits time. And on the other hand, to optimize the activity rate of&#xD;
      dispatchers and physicians.&#xD;
