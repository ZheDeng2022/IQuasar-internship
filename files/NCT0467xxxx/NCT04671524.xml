  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that movements of the upper extremity during walking are associated with&#xD;
      lower extremity mobility. For example, when walking at a slow pace, the swing frequency of&#xD;
      the arms is 2: 1 compared to the legs, while the limb frequency decreases to 1: 1 as the&#xD;
      walking speed increases. That is, in order to walk fast, the lower extremity takes advantage&#xD;
      of the acceleration of the upper extremity [1]. It is known that the muscles of the shoulder&#xD;
      girdle also support this oscillating movement in the upper extremity during walking. Thus, it&#xD;
      is thought that blocking or restricting shoulder girdle and arm movements during walking&#xD;
      increases energy expenditure and heart rate, decreases gait stability, and decreases stride&#xD;
      length and walking speed [2,3]. However, the possible effects that the upper limb can aid in&#xD;
      movement include decreasing vertical displacement of the center of mass, decreasing angular&#xD;
      momentum or decreasing ground reaction moment, and increasing walking stability [2-4]. In&#xD;
      these studies that restrict arm swing, methods such as crossing the arms on the chest [5],&#xD;
      holding the arm in a sling or pocket [6], or fixing the arms to the trunk with a bandage [7]&#xD;
      were used. Studies have generally been conducted on healthy individuals or on the&#xD;
      biomechanical model, and arm swing during walking has not been investigated in pathologies&#xD;
      with only upper extremity involvement (upper extremity fractures, Juvenile Idiopathic&#xD;
      Arthritis) without any problems with lower extremity and/or walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is aimed to reveal the effects of decreased upper extremity functionality on&#xD;
      walking and balance.&#xD;

      It has been shown that movements of the upper extremity during walking are associated with&#xD;

      [2-4]. In these studies that restrict arm swing, methods such as crossing the arms on the&#xD;
      chest [5], holding the arm in a sling or pocket [6], or fixing the arms to the trunk with a&#xD;
      bandage [7] were used. Studies have generally been conducted on healthy individuals or on the&#xD;
      biomechanical model, and arm swing during walking has not been investigated in pathologies&#xD;
      with only upper extremity involvement (upper extremity fractures, Juvenile Idiopathic&#xD;
      Arthritis) without any problems with lower extremity and/or walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies performed in pathologies where upper extremity mobility and arm swing are affected&#xD;
      have shown that the kinetic and kinematic parameters of walking are also affected [8-11].&#xD;
      This change in walking dynamics also changes foot pressure behavior. In a study investigating&#xD;
      the effect of arm swing on the affected side on walking in hemiplegic individuals, ground&#xD;
      reaction forces on the affected and unaffected sides by foot pressure analysis were examined&#xD;
      and it was found that the maximum forces applied during the first contact and toe-off on both&#xD;
      sides decreased [12]. In addition, the stance phase duration was higher in hemiplegic&#xD;
      patients compared to healthy controls in both lower extremities [12]. This suggests that the&#xD;
      affected upper extremity may change the time to transfer weight while walking. In a study&#xD;
      investigating the changes in gait parameters in patients with brachial plexus [13] in which&#xD;
      ground reaction forces were examined, different gait phase durations and maximum ground&#xD;
      reaction force times were found in the affected lower extremity compared to the unaffected&#xD;
      side. In a study examining whether the degree of upper extremity functionality has an effect&#xD;
      on walking in patients with hemiparetic cerebral palsy; Patients were included in the&#xD;
      exercise program aimed at increasing upper extremity function, and as a result, it was found&#xD;
      that while upper extremity function increased, patients improved walking parameters and&#xD;
      walking distance [14]. Zhou et al. investigated the effects of an active upper extremity&#xD;
      exercise program in patients with spinal cord injuries and demonstrated the usefulness of&#xD;
      active upper extremity participation in walking [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these results in the literature, the effect of reduced upper extremity function on gait&#xD;
      and balance in disease groups (such as rheumatic diseases with only upper extremity&#xD;
      involvement, upper extremity fractures) without affecting walking or any&#xD;
      neurological/orthopedic diagnosis that may affect walking was not investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to reveal the effects of decreased upper extremity functionality on&#xD;
      walking and balance.&#xD;
