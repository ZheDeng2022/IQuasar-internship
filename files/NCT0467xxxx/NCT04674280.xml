  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, a number of new prospective comparative trials have either started or are in&#xD;
      preparation, and the EBMT guidelines recommend treatment on a clinical trial, where&#xD;
      available. However, some MS patients receiving aHSCT will not be eligible for these trials,&#xD;
      which are predominantly focussed on a tightly defined group of patients with highly active&#xD;
      RRMS. In addition, access to such trials is not universal across EBMT and therefore there is&#xD;
      a need for structured data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose here to conduct an observational cohort study that systematically&#xD;
      gathers experience from MS patients, for whom an adequate set of data about their clinical&#xD;
      history and their clinical situation at baseline is available; patients will be then be&#xD;
      followed prospectively according to their local clinical center protocol. The expectation is&#xD;
      that local clinical protocols will be in line with the current EBMT guidelines and&#xD;
      recommendations. Therefore, the aim will be to prospectively and non-interventionally capture&#xD;
      a complete dataset to safety, tolerability and efficacy outcomes for aHSCT in various&#xD;
      sub-types of MS treated in accordance with the current EBMT guidelines and recommendations.&#xD;
      Alongside ongoing clinical trials, the investigators hope this study will meaningfully inform&#xD;
      the evidence-base and future guidelines and recommendations for good clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1- Study design Multi-centre, non-interventional prospective study in patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis, treated with aHSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Aims and objectives of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate the outcome of patients undergoing aHSCT for MS as primary indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To gain further knowledge on safety, tolerability and toxicity of aHSCT in MS&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To gain further knowledge on the quality of life and long-term disability of&#xD;
                patients treated with aHSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To gain further knowledge about the MRI outcome after aHSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
                3. Study schedule The clinical assessment at enrolment and during follow-up will be&#xD;
                carried out according to local policies, with the expectation that centres will be&#xD;
                working in line with the EBMT Guidelines and Recommendations for MS and&#xD;
                immune-mediated neurological diseases. However, based on common clinical practice&#xD;
                in patients with MS on therapy, an MRI and one neurological assessment are usually&#xD;
                carried out yearly. Baseline MRI should be carried out within 3 months before the&#xD;
                start of the mobilization regimen, whilst neurological examination should be&#xD;
                accomplished as baseline assessment no more than one month before the start of the&#xD;
                treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment time is 2 years from the registration of the first patient. Follow-up is&#xD;
      anticipated for 24 months from individual start of treatment.&#xD;
