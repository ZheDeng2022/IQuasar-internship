      This is a multi-site, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to examine the weight&#xD;
      loss efficacy and cardiovascular safety of phentermine 15 mg daily plus lifestyle therapy&#xD;
      versus placebo plus lifestyle therapy among 200 adolescents ages ≥10 to &lt;18 years with&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;

      Obesity in children and adolescents (body mass index [BMI] ≥95th percentile) is a chronic,&#xD;
      progressive, and debilitating disease with a prevalence of &gt;20% in the U.S.1 Cardiovascular&#xD;
      (CV) complications of obesity in this population are common,2 with nearly 40% of youth having&#xD;
      ≥2 CV risk factors. Moreover, obesity in youth increases the risk of CV mortality in&#xD;
      adulthood by nearly 5-fold. Treatment of obesity in adolescents includes lifestyle therapy&#xD;
      (LST), and when this is ineffective, adjunct pharmacotherapy is recommended.5 However, there&#xD;
      are few pharmacological options for pediatric obesity, and none are utilized to any&#xD;
      significant degree by primary care pediatricians, even though obesity is the most common&#xD;
      chronic disease of childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, orlistat is the only medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) for the treatment of obesity in youth ages ≥12 years. However, adoption of orlistat in&#xD;
      the clinical setting has been hampered by its significant side effects and poor accessibility&#xD;
      due to high cost and poor insurance coverage. Two additional anti-obesity medications,&#xD;
      liraglutide and combination phentermine-topiramate, are in the FDA approval pipeline for&#xD;
      pediatric obesity, yet these are also unlikely to be widely prescribed by primary care&#xD;
      pediatricians. Both of these medications are also expensive and are unlikely to be covered by&#xD;
      many insurance plans. Furthermore, liraglutide is delivered by injection and topiramate has&#xD;
      associated cognitive side effects. The paucity of safe, effective, and accessible&#xD;
      pharmacological options has spurred pediatric obesity specialists to improvise by utilizing&#xD;
      medications in an &quot;off-label&quot; manner, resorting to extrapolation of safety and efficacy data&#xD;
      from adult clinical trials and opting for medications that are either covered by insurance or&#xD;
      are inexpensive. One of the most commonly used medications prescribed in an &quot;off-label&quot;&#xD;
      manner is phentermine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phentermine, a sympathomimetic, was FDA approved for obesity in 1959, before obesity was&#xD;
      considered a chronic disease and when standards for clinical trials were lower than today.&#xD;
      Accordingly, it was approved for short-term use, often interpreted as ≤12 weeks, in people&#xD;
      ages &gt;16 years. The popularity of phentermine among pediatric obesity specialists is likely&#xD;
      driven by its demonstrated safety and efficacy in adults (4-5% mean placebo-subtracted weight&#xD;
      loss over 26-28 weeks), oral route of administration, and affordability. Yet in spite of its&#xD;
      popularity and routine use beyond 12 weeks, significant gaps exist in our knowledge regarding&#xD;
      its safety and efficacy in children and adolescents, many of whom may have abnormal CV&#xD;
      profiles at baseline. Indeed, pediatric data regarding phentermine use are sparse: only one&#xD;
      retrospective clinical report (published by our group), demonstrated a 4% BMI reduction at 6&#xD;
      months with no significant increase in blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these important gaps and generate evidence to directly inform clinical care, we&#xD;
      propose this multi-site, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to examine the weight&#xD;
      loss efficacy and CV safety of phentermine 15 mg daily plus LST vs. placebo plus LST among&#xD;
      200 adolescents ages ≥10 to &lt;18 years with obesity. To maximize the overall impact and&#xD;
      clinical scalability, our explicit goal will be to generate the data necessary to support an&#xD;
      FDA label change for phentermine to include a pediatric indication (down to age 10 years) and&#xD;
      remove restrictions on the duration of use, thereby setting the stage for utilization in the&#xD;
      primary care setting.&#xD;
