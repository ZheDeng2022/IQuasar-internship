  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frozen Human Cadaver Allograft (FHCA) is, nowadays, the gold standard for temporary coverage&#xD;
      of excised full-thickness burns, but is also very expensive and requires additional personnel&#xD;
      and major storage spaces in comparison to other products. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the extent to which PermeaDerm® dressing promotes wound bed maturation when used as&#xD;
      a temporary dressing for excised full-thickness burn wounds. Efficacy and safety in promoting&#xD;
      wound bed maturation for successive autografting will be determined through direct comparison&#xD;
      to FHCA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomized, matched design pilot study, we aim to compare the current&#xD;
      standard of care FHCA to PermeaDerm®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients for each study arm (n total = 60) meeting the inclusion criteria will be enrolled&#xD;
      to randomly receive FHCA and PermeaDerm® on two adjacent or symmetric body areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomization of study areas and application of study dressings, baseline&#xD;
      assessments of wound size and burn depth will be performed by the experienced physician and&#xD;
      documented using photography and when indicated laser Doppler (Moor Laser Speckle®, Moor&#xD;
      Instruments, Devon, UK) measurements. Percentage of graft take and wound healing after&#xD;
      removal of the temporary wound dressings and secondary autografting (study arm 1) or after&#xD;
      excision and direct autografting with wiedely-meshed autograft and temporary wound dressings&#xD;
      as overlay (study arm 2) will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include complications such as infections, signs of&#xD;
      rejection/non-adherence, fluid accumulation/hematoma beneath dressings and mid- and long-term&#xD;
      clinical scar maturation, as assessed by the POSAS and objectively with the DermaLab Combo®&#xD;
      device (Cortex Technology ApS, Hadsund, Denmark).&#xD;
