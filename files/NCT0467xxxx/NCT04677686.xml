      This study aims to evaluate whether the colorectal bundle designed and implemented at&#xD;
      Cantonal Hospital Lucerne, will lead to a significant reduction of SSIs. The impact of&#xD;
      potential risk factors for SSIs will additionally be evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections (SSIs) remain a relevant problem in colorectal surgery. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to implement a bundle of care in order to reduce SSIs in colorectal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergoing colorectal surgery between October 2018 and September 2021 will be&#xD;
      included in a prospective observational study. Since our colorectal bundle has been&#xD;
      established gradually, patients will be grouped in a pre-implementation (2018-2019),&#xD;
      implementation (2019-2020) and post implementation phase (2020-2021), in order to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the actions undertaken. Primary endpoint of this study will be surgical site&#xD;
      infection (SSI) rate, while secondary endpoints encompass potential risk factors for SSIs. We&#xD;
      assume that obesity, age, diabetes, alcoholism and smoking may lead to a higher risk for&#xD;
      SSIs.&#xD;

    <arm_group_label>Pre-implementation phase (October 2018 - September 2019)</arm_group_label>
    <description>During this time period, 137 patients underwent colorectal surgery. Only basic measures for preventing SSI were performed:&#xD;
Hair was removed in the operating field with a clipper instead of shaving hair.&#xD;
Blood glucose was monitored only during the operation.&#xD;
Antibiotic prophylaxis was applied 60 minutes before the operation.&#xD;
The application of an antibiotic prophylaxis was repeated if the operation lasted longer than 4 hours.&#xD;
Measures of warming were only applied during the operation and in the recovery room.&#xD;
Instruments and gloves were changed after finishing the anastomosis.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Implementation phase (October 2019 - September 2020)</arm_group_label>
    <description>During this phase, additional measures have been introduced:&#xD;
Implementation of wound protectors during colorectal surgery.&#xD;
Colorectal operations were only performed with the support of an experienced consultant surgeon.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Post-implementation phase (October 2020 - September 2021)</arm_group_label>
    <description>During this phase, additional measures are implemented.&#xD;
Close monitoring of blood glucose. During the stay in the recovery room and for 48 hours post-operative, blood glucose is monitored closely. Moreover, if blood glucose is higher than 9 mmol/l, the patient will be treated with insulin. This measure is applied to diabetic as well as to non-diabetic-patients.&#xD;
The measures of warming will be intensified. First of all, during the operation and during the stay in the recovery room patients will be placed on warming mattresses. Moreover, a warming towel will be placed on the operating field directly after the operation.&#xD;
The patients will be asked to take a shower the night before surgery. In case of an emergency operation, patients will be asked to wash the axilla, trunk, genitalia, groins and umbilicus</description>
