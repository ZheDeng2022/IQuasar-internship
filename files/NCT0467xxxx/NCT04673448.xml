  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IB trial evaluates the effect of niraparib and TSR-042 in treating patients with&#xD;
      BRCA-mutated breast, pancreas, ovary, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that&#xD;
      cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) or has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (metastatic). Niraparib is an inhibitor of PARP, an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA) when it becomes damaged. Blocking PARP may help keep cancer cells from repairing&#xD;
      their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as TSR-042, may help the body's immune system&#xD;
      attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      Giving niraparib and TSR-042 may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive niraparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 of cycle 1. Beginning&#xD;
      cycle 2, patients receive niraparib PO QD on days 1-21 and dostarlimab intravenously (IV) on&#xD;
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 6, patients receive niraparib PO QD on days 1-42 and&#xD;
      dostarlimab IV on day 1. Cycles repeat every 42 days for up to 24 months in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 6 months for&#xD;
      2 years, and then annually for up to 5 years.&#xD;
