  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the potential effects of Wii fit rehabilitation programs on functional&#xD;
      capacity, mobility, balance and muscle strength in lower limb burn patients after hospital&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of virtual reality technology in burn conditions improved joint flexibility and&#xD;
      reduced pain associated with physical therapy, dressing changes, and wound debridement.&#xD;
      However, the primary concern of burn rehabilitation is not only survival but also maximizing&#xD;
      functional outcome and decreasing the time for return to work.&#xD;

    <measure>high mobility assessment tool</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>used to assess mobility assessment after burn injuries. It is a valid and reliable unidimensional assessment tool which includes nine functional tasks, where 0 = inability to do and 4= able to do extremely well, with a total score of 54. Each Functional task is rated on a five-point performance scale with higher scores indicate a higher level of performance</description>

    <measure>Lower Limb Functional Index</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>a valid and reliable patient self-reported questionnaire to assess lower limb function for patients with a burn injury. It is consisted of fifteen general and ten lower-limb specific items that assess the functional status of the patients during the last 2-3 days. The scoring options for the LLFI Items are Yes=1 point, Somewhat= 0.5 point and No= 0 point. The scoring points are added and then multiplied by four for a total score of functional limitation. The total score of the LLFI ranges from 0 (maximum limitation) to 100 (no limitation or normal functional status)</description>

    <measure>Timed-up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>used to evaluate functional mobility of the patients that requires both static and dynamic balance. The TUG test is a basic mobility assessment tool which records the time taken to stand up from a chair, walk 3 meters, return and sit down on the chair. The TUG test was performed with a standardized instruction, asking patients to walk as fast as possible during the test. All participants performed the TUG test from a standard chair (seat height of approximately 46 cm) with back support and no arms</description>

    <time_frame>at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>used to assess functional exercise capacity of the participants. The 6-MWT was performed in a 30-meters flat corridor according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines. Patients were asked to walk as far as possible in the 30-m corridor during the 6-min period. Standardized verbal encouragement is given to the patients during the 6-MWT. At the end of the test, the walking distance was measured. The predicted values of 6-MWT were calculated according to age and gender</description>

    <measure>Isokinetic Muscle Strength Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by A Biodex dynamometer (Biodex Medical System, Shirley, NY, USA). The values of knee flexors and extensors muscle peak torque of dominant leg were measured regardless the location of burns at an angular velocity of 150°/seconds, hip angle of 100° and patient were supported with a securing belt placed over the mid- thigh, pelvis and trunk. Three sub-maximal repetitions were allowed for the patient without any load as a warm-up. The patient then carried out 10 of maximum voluntary muscle contractions continuously without rest and the highest values were recorded for analysis.</description>

    <description>assessed by A Biodex Balance System (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY) which consists of a movable balance platform that provides 20° surface tilt through 360° range of motion. The platform interfaces with computer software that enables the device to serve as an objective assessment of balance. All measurements were performed at level eight of stability, and the test duration was set at 20 seconds for three successive trials.</description>

    <description>Received Standard of care and Wii Fit protocol consisted of strength, balance, and aerobic programs that were performed on the Wii Fit balance board (Nintendo Inc., Kyoto, Japan). For muscle strengthening exercise, lunges, single-leg extensions, sideways leg lifts, single leg twists, and rowing squats were performed. For exercise that enhances balancing sense, the soccer heading, ski slalom, penguin, table tilt, and balance bubble games were used. Aerobic games as hula hoop, super hula hoop and basic step.</description>
