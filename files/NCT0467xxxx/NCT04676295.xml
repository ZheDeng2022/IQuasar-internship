  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: PE (pre-eclampsia) is a common pregnancy-specific vascular hypertensive disease&#xD;
      affecting 3-5% of pregnancies. PE independently increases the risk for premature&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) in mothers and their offspring long-term. PE provides a unique&#xD;
      window for early risk profiling and CVD prevention. However, the efficacy of a family&#xD;
      oriented lifestyle intervention to lower CVD risk in families with history of PE has not&#xD;
      previously been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: This study will explore the impact of PE on CVD progression 8-12 years from delivery in&#xD;
      mothers and their children, and assess whether a lifestyle intervention is useful for&#xD;
      lowering mother and child blood pressure and improving the CVD risk profile overall in&#xD;
      families with a history of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: PE is related with CVD progression mediated by elevated blood pressure. Blood&#xD;
      pressure and the CVD risk profile overall is modifiable in mothers and children by a 12-month&#xD;
      behavioral lifestyle intervention in families with a history of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized controlled behavioral lifestyle intervention trial where families&#xD;
      (mother, child and father from the FINNPEC study) are offered the opportunity to participate&#xD;
      in a lifestyle intervention program 8-12 years after a PE pregnancy. 300 PE families will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to a 12-month lifestyle intervention program or to a control group. A parallel&#xD;
      group of 100 non-PE control families will be assessed at baseline and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome: 24 hour mean blood pressure change between baseline and follow-up in mother and&#xD;
      child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This study will provide information on CVD progression in mothers and children&#xD;
      8-12 years from a PE pregnancy. Furthermore, the study assess the effect of a 12-month&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention on blood pressure and CVD risk profile overall following a PE&#xD;
      pregnancy. Potentially, the study provides the opportunity to identify PE families at highest&#xD;
      risk of CVD progression and families amenable to blood pressure and CVD risk profile&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;

      Power analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations were performed in order to detect 5.5 mmHg reduction in maternal systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure with a power of 80% and a 2-sided p-value of 0.05 for the difference between&#xD;
      the groups (intervention and control PE) (NICE 2011). Accounting for a 20% loss to follow-up&#xD;
      or missing data, a sample of 148 women in the PE intervention group and 148 women in the PE&#xD;
      control group is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess cardiovascular health and CVD progression in families (mother, child and&#xD;
           father) 8-12 years following a PE pregnancy compared with non-PE control families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the effectiveness of a behavioral 12-month lifestyle intervention in mothers&#xD;
           and their children 8-12 years following a PE pregnancy to lower blood pressure and&#xD;
           improve their CVD risk profile overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention on the awareness of CVD risk&#xD;
           after a PE pregnancy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Families are recruited from the FINNPEC cohort. In FINNPEC, PE was defined as hypertension&#xD;
        and proteinuria occurring after 20 weeks gestation (American College of Obstetricians and&#xD;
        Gynecologists 2002 criteria). Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm&#xD;
        Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg. Proteinuria was defined as urinary excretion of&#xD;
        ≥0.3 g protein in a 24-hour specimen, or 0.3 g/L, or two ≥1+ readings on a dipstick in a&#xD;
        random urine determination with no evidence of a urinary tract infection. Each PE diagnosis&#xD;
        was ascertained based on hospital records and confirmed independently by a research nurse&#xD;
        and a study physician in the original FINNPEC case-control study including 1450 nulliparous&#xD;
        or multiparous women with a singleton pregnancy with PE and 1065 pregnant control women&#xD;
        without PE (aged 18-47 years) from all 5 university hospitals in Finland during 2008-2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria in the FINNPEC: multiple pregnancy, inability to speak Finnish or&#xD;
        Swedish.&#xD;
