  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to identify whether the systematic anticipation of&#xD;
      highly structured specialized palliative home care into primary care influences the quality&#xD;
      of care and care utilization. Quality of care focusses on the sense of security of patients&#xD;
      and family caregivers, satisfaction with care of patients, family caregivers, general&#xD;
      practitioners, home care nurses and specialized palliative care nurses, and availability and&#xD;
      access to advanced directives. Health care utilization focus on the number of&#xD;
      hospitalizations and the length of hospital stays.&#xD;

      The University Center for Palliative Care from the Inselspital Bern conducts this monocentric&#xD;
      mixed-methods randomized controlled study and is responsible for the informed consents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection consists of questionnaires of patients, their family caregivers, general&#xD;
      practitioners, home care nurses and if involved specialized palliative home care nurses.&#xD;
      Patients and their family caregivers will fill out baseline questionnaires and follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires at 2, 8, 16 and 24 weeks. After the 24 weeks follow up measurement, new&#xD;
      measurements will only occur if the patients experiences a decline in health like a&#xD;
      hospitalization or specialized palliative home care crises intervention. Patient follow-up&#xD;
      will end if the patients dies or the study ends. Family caregivers will be asked to fill out&#xD;
      a questionnaire two months after the patient's death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General practitioners, home care nurses and specialised palliative home care nurses will fill&#xD;
      out questionnaires after patient's death or at the end of the study. Patient survival data&#xD;
      will be collected from administrative health data after the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, a nested qualitative study with semi-structured qualitative interview with&#xD;
      patients, family caregivers and care providers will provide an in-depth understanding of&#xD;
      preferences, needs, experiences from this phase of life and facilitated through the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
