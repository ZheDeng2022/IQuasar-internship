      This study is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing an online mindfulness based&#xD;
      course (10ofZen) with a treatment as usual group (delayed 10ofZen course materials).&#xD;
      Participants will be informed about the study and asked to undertake a screening&#xD;
      questionnaire to ensure the eligibility criteria is met. Following this, participants will be&#xD;
      invited to give online consent. A battery of self-report measures will be administered online&#xD;
      at baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 10) and at follow-up (week 14). A sleep measure&#xD;
      will also be undertaken and used as a co-variate during data analysis. At the end of&#xD;
      participation in the research study, all participants will gain access to the course&#xD;
      materials, including audio recordings of meditations and any written materials used within&#xD;
      the course.&#xD;
