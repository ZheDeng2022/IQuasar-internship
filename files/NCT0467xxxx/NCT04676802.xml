    <textblock>
      In the US, pain management after surgery for surgical treatment of osteoarthritis at the base&#xD;
      of the thumb typically consists of prescription opioids during the early recovery phase.&#xD;
      Given the highly addictive nature of prescription opioids, guidelines are being evaluated by&#xD;
      hand surgeons to reduce opioid use while still maintaining pain control after surgery. A&#xD;
      promising approach is to use non-narcotic medication as the first line of treatment. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of a combination of non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ibuprofen and acetaminophen, in comparison to a morphine&#xD;
      analogue substance (oxycodone) for pain management in the first 30 days after surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (qDASH) is a responsive measure to patient-reported functional change in the hand and upper extremity patient population, ranging from 0 to 100. Lower scores signify limited function and increased pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PROMIS-PI scores over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-operative weeks 1, 3, 5, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS-PI scores (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System - Pain Interference) are effective measures of the change in perceived pain, supporting intervention related studies assessing power analyses for comparative research.&#xD;
We use the Pain Interference - Short Form version 6b, which consists of 6 questions regarding how much the pain experienced in the last 7 days interfered with everyday aspects of life (i.e. enjoyment, ability to concentrate, day to day activities, recreational activities, doing tasks away from home, and socializing with others). The answers to all questions are ordinals ranging from 1 (not interfered at all) to 5 (interfered very much).</description>
