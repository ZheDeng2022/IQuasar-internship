  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether PG-DN-20WS is a better pain reliever in&#xD;
      patients with diabetic neuropathic pain of the feet than a placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled in the study for a maximum of 43 days, including an optional 14-day&#xD;
      screening period, 28 days of active product administration, and followed by a post-treatment&#xD;
      follow-up within 1 day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of PG-DN-20WS for the treatment of painful DPN of the feet&#xD;
           compared to a placebo control, including emergence of suicidal thoughts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of PG-DN-20WS on subject's neuropathic pain, anxiety, and sleep&#xD;
           quality compared to a placebo control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of PG-DN-20WS on the subject's impression of their response to&#xD;
           the treatment compared to a placebo control.&#xD;
