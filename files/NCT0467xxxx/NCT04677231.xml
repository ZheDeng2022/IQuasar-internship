  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall survival of adult patients (15-59y) with Philadelphia-negative acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL/LL) was dramatically improved by the use of full&#xD;
      pediatric or pediatric-inspired protocols (GRAALL2003/05-LL03-FRALLE2000) that aimed to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of relapse by adopting more intensive chemotherapeutical schedule. This&#xD;
      approach led to a global improvement in overall survival (5y-OS, 57%) whatever patient age&#xD;
      but was responsible for an excess of treatment-related mortality in patients older than 45&#xD;
      years (5y-TRM in patients &gt; 45y, 19%). Pediatric longitudinal studies pointed out that long&#xD;
      term leukemia survivors have an increased risk of developing specific adverse events like&#xD;
      dysmetabolic syndrome, obesity, decreased fertility, organ dysfunction, osseous events, or&#xD;
      impaired cognitive functions. This study aims to evaluate the impact in term of long-term&#xD;
      events and QoL in adult patients that received an intensified therapeutic approach recently&#xD;
      implemented in adult cooperative groups. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      prevalence of late effects in adult patients treated 10 years ago for ALL/LL with an&#xD;
      intensified pediatric-inspired protocol (GRAALL2003/05-LL03-FRALLE2000) that exposed patients&#xD;
      to increased cumulative doses of chemotherapy, central nervous system irradiation or w/o&#xD;
      allogeneic transplant after total body irradiation-based regimen w/o boost irradiation on&#xD;
      central nevous system. One of the secondary endpoint of the study is to assess quality of&#xD;
      life of these patients.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life will be assess using the SF36-questionnaire. SF-36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. These measures rely upon patient self-reporting. Items are grouped into three categories: functional status, well-being, overall health assessment. In two dimensions, the answer is binary (yes / no) and in the other 6 in ordinal quality (3 to 6 possible answers). For each dimension, the scores for the different items are coded and then summed and transformed linearly on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. A physical composite score and a mental composite score can be calculated according to an established algorithm</description>
