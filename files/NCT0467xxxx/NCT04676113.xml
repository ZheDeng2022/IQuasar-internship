    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to determine the prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia&#xD;
      and hyperglycemia in the pediatric population with sickle cell disease who are obese in&#xD;
      Mississippi compared to those pediatric patients with sickle cell disease who are not&#xD;
      overweight/obese. The pediatric hematology department at the University of Mississippi&#xD;
      Medical Center (UMMC) has a relatively large population of patients with sickle cell disease&#xD;
      who are overweight and obese. This is a paradoxical trend since high-energy expenditure of&#xD;
      the body to produce new red blood cells usually results in underweight to normal weight&#xD;
      patients. From our previous chart review, the investigators found our pediatric patients with&#xD;
      sickle cell disease to have similar rates of overweight and obesity to that of state and&#xD;
      national levels. The metrics our team will measure include: blood pressure, blood cholesterol&#xD;
      levels and blood glucose levels. The investigators expect to find higher rates of&#xD;
      hypertension, high cholesterol and high glucose levels in the overweight and obese patients&#xD;
      with SCD compared to that of underweight and normal weight. Our ultimate goal for follow up&#xD;
      projects will be to determine the baseline risk of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and&#xD;
      hyperglycemia in this population so we can then determine effective, sustainable&#xD;
      interventions for weight and the co-morbidities that come with increasing weight status. Our&#xD;
      goal would also be to educate the patient and families on these interventions and provide&#xD;
      them with resources, which could lead to an overall improvement in health and patients&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;

      SIGNIFICANCE Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is the most common genetic disorder in the world and&#xD;
      in the United States (U.S.), with about 1 in 13 African Americans born with sickle cell trait&#xD;
      and approximately 100,000 individuals currently living with SCD. In this disease, irregular&#xD;
      shaped red blood cells (RBC) termed sickle RBC, get trapped in the microcirculation thereby&#xD;
      causing ischemic organ damage throughout the body. Due to the chronic hemolysis (breaking of&#xD;
      RBCs), patients with SCD have traditionally had a high basal metabolic rate and increased&#xD;
      energy consumption (measured by resting energy expenditure) resulting from rapid production&#xD;
      of new RBCs. Therefore, patients with SCD tended to be underweight and did not experience&#xD;
      weight-related comorbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia. In recent&#xD;
      years, there has been significant improvement in the medical management for patients with&#xD;
      SCD, which has resulted in improved morbidity and mortality and increased life span. With&#xD;
      these advancements in medical management, recent research has begun to describe increased&#xD;
      rates of overweight and obesity in both pediatric and adult patients with SCD. Our research&#xD;
      team's pilot data in Mississippi shows that 24% of our pediatric patients with SCD are&#xD;
      overweight or obese, defined as body mass indexes (BMI) ≥ 85th percentile. Overweight and&#xD;
      obesity is a new medical phenomena in SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two leading causes of death in individuals with SCD are cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      stroke. In 1973, Lemuel Whitley Diggs estimated a median survival of 14.3 years for&#xD;
      individuals with SCD, with 20 percent of deaths occurring in the first 2 years of life.&#xD;
      However, as a result of improved medical management, patients with SCD are living longer. In&#xD;
      1994, life expectancy had increased to 42-48 years for the most severe SCD genotype HbSS, and&#xD;
      60-68 years for the less severe SCD genotype HbSC. Since patients with SCD are no living&#xD;
      longer and overweight and obesity is a new phenomenon in SCD there is very little knowledge&#xD;
      regarding its clinical impact on precipitant risk factors (i.e., hypertension,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia) for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and overall morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two published studies to date have been in adults with SCD and document that overweight&#xD;
      and obese weight status is associated with metabolic syndrome, hypertension and dyslipidemia&#xD;
      resulting in a higher risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke. Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) has&#xD;
      historically not been clinically documented in patients with SCD. Yet, recent studies have&#xD;
      shown that the prevalence of T2D in adult patients with SCD now approaches that of their&#xD;
      healthy African American counterparts. The same study showed that the risk of stroke and&#xD;
      overall morbidity for patients with both SCD and T2D was significantly higher compared to&#xD;
      patients with just one disease. It is critically important to assess and characterize these&#xD;
      potential increased risk factors for cardiovascular disease and stroke in pediatric patients&#xD;
      with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate Measurement of Outcomes in SCD In order to accurately assess weight-related risk&#xD;
      factors for cardiovascular disease and stroke (i.e., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and&#xD;
      hyperglycemia) in pediatric patients with SCD, research is needed that appropriately adjusts&#xD;
      for disease-related blood processes. Specifically, individuals with SCD have lower systemic&#xD;
      blood pressures compared to individuals without SCD. In adults with SCD, clinical problems&#xD;
      are observed with blood pressures at or greater than the 90th percentile. When utilizing the&#xD;
      90th percentile, rates of hypertension are similar in adults with SCD (40%) as their healthy&#xD;
      counterparts. It is thus recommended that blood pressure values be assessed relative to the&#xD;
      lower values expected for patients with SCD, and that a lower threshold of ≥ 90th percentile&#xD;
      be used to define 'relative hypertension' in individuals with SCD. Unfortunately, there are&#xD;
      no current published age, sex and height-matched norms for blood pressure in youth with SCD.&#xD;
      To robustly characterize the association between weight status and elevated blood pressure,&#xD;
      the current study will utilize published age, sex and height blood pressure norms for healthy&#xD;
      youth without SCD but define relative hypertension (primary outcome) ≥ 90th percentile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overweight/obesity is associated with impaired glucose intolerance and is a strong predictor&#xD;
      of development of T2DM, which increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke.&#xD;
      Specifically, early development of T2DM leads to significant microvascular and macrovascular&#xD;
      complications in early adulthood. The greatest risks for impaired glucose tolerance in&#xD;
      children is weight status (overweight and obesity) and family medical history of overweight&#xD;
      and obesity. Screening for hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in high-risk youth is&#xD;
      recommended, as children are often asymptomatic. Expert committees and the American Diabetes&#xD;
      Association have endorsed the use of fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c for screening those who&#xD;
      are overweight or obese (BMI &gt; 85th percentile), staring at age 10 years of age. However, the&#xD;
      use of HbA1c for glucose tolerance testing in SCD is not reliable due to the shortened life&#xD;
      span of RBCs in SCD. Therefore, fasting glucose levels and serum fructosamine are recommended&#xD;
      for patients with SCD. Fructosamine is a glycated protein and predicts glucose levels over a&#xD;
      period of approximately 3-4 weeks and will be used as the primary measure of hyperglycemia&#xD;
      (secondary outcome) in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to lower systemic blood pressure, individuals with SCD have historically been shown&#xD;
      to have low cholesterol levels due to high levels of hemolysis and consumption of the lipids&#xD;
      for new membrane synthesis. The estimated overall prevalence of dyslipidemia in all children&#xD;
      in the US is 20.3% and increases to 42.9% in youth with obesity. With current treatments&#xD;
      decreasing hemolysis and overall turnover of RBCs it is unknown if the medical community will&#xD;
      start to see an increase in hyperlipidemia (secondary outcome) in pediatric patients with&#xD;
      SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Risk Factors for Overweight/Obesity Though reasons for the development of&#xD;
      overweight/obesity in the general pediatric population are multifaceted, energy imbalance&#xD;
      (e.g., consuming more calories than exerted through physical activity) has the most research&#xD;
      support and identified areas for intervention. Children spend about 15 minutes a day engaged&#xD;
      in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, far less than national recommendations of 60&#xD;
      minutes a day. Children also spend over 85% of their time in sedentary activities, which is&#xD;
      associated with increased weight status. Additionally, very few children eat a diet&#xD;
      consistent with national guidelines and instead consume large portions of high-calorie,&#xD;
      nutrient-poor foods and sugar-sweetened beverages, all of which are associated with weight&#xD;
      gain and obesity. These problems are especially severe in Mississippi, which has the highest&#xD;
      rates of physical inactivity and obesity in the U.S. In addition, African American youth&#xD;
      demonstrate the highest rates of sedentary activity. Finally, family history of obesity,&#xD;
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia, T2D, and maternal history of diabetes during pregnancy are&#xD;
      significantly associated with increased risk for being children being overweight/obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To begin addressing these gaps in knowledge, the investigators will evaluate blood pressures,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia in pediatric patients with SCD who are overweight/obese&#xD;
      compared to pediatric patients with SCD who are underweight/normal weight. We will further&#xD;
      evaluate diet, exercise, and family medical history as key risk factors for&#xD;
      overweight/obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia in this population. If an&#xD;
      increased risk for hypertension, hyperlipidemia and/or hyperglycemia is found related to&#xD;
      overweight/obesity, it will be important for future prospective studies to examine the&#xD;
      clinical impact on traditional complications of SCD, including cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      stroke, vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, and neuropathies. This knowledge will be&#xD;
      critically important as hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia are all risk factors&#xD;
      that can be modified with pharmacologic intervention and/or behavioral lifestyle changes such&#xD;
      as dietary counselling and exercise. This new knowledge can further lead to updated screening&#xD;
      recommendations, as there are currently no standardized guidelines for screening for&#xD;
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in pediatric patients with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planning Phase: The first phase of the study will include 2 months for Research Nurse&#xD;
      training, obtaining study supplies, and finalizing IRB approval (which will be submitted&#xD;
      within two weeks of grant submission). Our team anticipates starting participant enrollment&#xD;
      in October 2020 and plan to complete enrollment by August 2021. Study recruitment will occur&#xD;
      for 8 months of the 1 year study period. The final two months of the project will be&#xD;
      dedicated to data analysis, manuscript preparation and additional grant applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants (N=200): The UMMC Pediatric Sickle Cell Clinic is the only specialty&#xD;
      pediatric SCD clinic in Mississippi. It is one of the largest pediatric SCD programs in the&#xD;
      nations, serving approximately 800 patients annually throughout the state of Mississippi.&#xD;
      Pediatric SCD clinic is held twice weekly on the UMMC main campus in Jackson, MS. There is&#xD;
      also a multidisciplinary clinic twice monthly and satellite clinics in Hattiesburg, Meridian&#xD;
      and Gulfport, MS. Pediatric patients and a primary caregiver/parent (parent) (&gt;21 years old)&#xD;
      will be recruited from the UMMC main campus. Approximately 300 pediatric patients with SCD&#xD;
      ages 10-19 years were seen in clinic in 2019. Dr. McNaull and Dr. Karlson have an approximate&#xD;
      80% recruitment rate to single-visit research studies in this population. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigators do not anticipate any difficulty with recruitment for the current&#xD;
      cross-sectional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team will recruit 60 youth who are underweight/normal weight and 60 youth who are&#xD;
      overweight/obese, along with a parent for each youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological Variable: The following biological variables will be extracted from the&#xD;
      participants electronic health record (EHR): age, sex, SCD genotype, and pubertal status&#xD;
      according to Tanner Stage criteria. Tanner stage will be determined by the regular medical&#xD;
      provider at the clinic visit and extracted from the EHR. SCD occurs equally in males and&#xD;
      females. Thus, males and females will be recruited in equal numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Recruitment: All study procedures will be completed at youth's regularly scheduled&#xD;
      hematology appointment. A SCD research nurse coordinator will call potentially eligible&#xD;
      families (based on age, SCD genotype, and clinic visit history) one to three days prior to&#xD;
      their clinic visit as youth need to come fasting for study-related lab draws at their&#xD;
      appointment. If families are interested in the study, then the procedures will be explained&#xD;
      over the phone. The research nurse coordinator will be present in clinic the day of the&#xD;
      youth's appointment to explain procedures in detail, enroll youth participants and a parent,&#xD;
      and obtain written informed consent, permission, and assent. Procedures: After providing&#xD;
      consent, the parent will complete two electronic questionnaires in REDCap on iPads (5-15&#xD;
      minutes to complete). One questionnaire will be the Family Nutrition and Physical Activity&#xD;
      (FNPA) screening tool to assess youth's nutrition and exercise. The second questionnaire will&#xD;
      be a family history evaluation of the most common family risk factors for overweight/obesity&#xD;
      and its co-morbidities. Blood pressure measurement will be taken three times in concordance&#xD;
      with the 2004 New Task Force Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents. Youth&#xD;
      participants will then complete study blood collection during regularly scheduled clinical&#xD;
      venipuncture blood draws (15 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: Body mass index z-score (BMI z-score) will be calculated at the study visit&#xD;
      using height (cm) and weight (kg). Trained nurses will take height to the nearest 0.1cm using&#xD;
      a standard Stadiometer and weight to the nearest 0.1kg on a calibrated electronic scale while&#xD;
      the children are wearing light clothing and no shoes. BMI will then be calculated by dividing&#xD;
      the weight in kilograms by the height in square meters (kg/m2) and then be converted to BMI&#xD;
      z-score based on age and gender norms. The BMI percentile will be charted using current&#xD;
      Pediatric Center for Disease Control guidelines, with underweight defined as &lt;5th percentile,&#xD;
      normal weight 5-85th percentile, overweight defined at BMI &gt;85th percentile and obese defined&#xD;
      as &gt;95th percentile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Pressure Measurements: Systolic and Diastolic blood pressures will be collected&#xD;
      according to recommendations of the 2004 New Task Force Report on High Blood Pressure in&#xD;
      Children and Adolescents using the proper cuff size with routinely calibrated automated blood&#xD;
      pressure monitors (SphygmoCor version 8.0, AtCor Medical). Youth will be seated comfortably&#xD;
      at rest for 5 minutes with feet flat on the floor. Measurements will be made on the&#xD;
      non-dominant arm supported at heart level and will be taken 3 times, one minute apart. The&#xD;
      first measure will be used for adaptation purposes and the mean of the second and third&#xD;
      measures will be recorded and used for analyses The median and 90th percentile blood pressure&#xD;
      in over 1500 children with SCD has been previously published although it did not take into&#xD;
      consideration height or include data for each year of age individually. Pre-hypertension,&#xD;
      termed relative hypertension in SCD, is defined as blood pressure greater than the 90th&#xD;
      percentile but less than the 95th percentile. This new clinical recommendation of using the&#xD;
      90th percentile blood pressure to define hypertension in pediatric SCD will be used in the&#xD;
      current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressures for all participants will be classified using the National High Blood&#xD;
      pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) Working Group on Children and Adolescent. For our study,&#xD;
      (1) Normotensive will be assigned to patients with systolic blood pressure &lt;90th percentile&#xD;
      and (2) hypertensive will be reported as any patient with blood pressure &gt;90th percentile for&#xD;
      age, sex and height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Blood Draws: Peripheral blood (10 mL) will be collected at scheduled blood draws&#xD;
      in green and red top heparinized tubes. Blood will be sent to the laboratory at UMMC for&#xD;
      analysis and send out lab analysis to Mayo Clinic Laboratories. The following laboratory&#xD;
      analyses will be obtained: CBC, Reticulocyte count, lipid panel, fasting glucose and&#xD;
      fructosamine. CBC, reticulocyte count and glucose are laboratory tests that are taken at&#xD;
      regular scheduled appointments as a part of maintenance SCD care. Lipid panel and&#xD;
      fructosamine are additional tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperlipidemia: Fasting lipid panel which includes total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and&#xD;
      Triglycerides will be obtain from blood samples from each participant. Each participant will&#xD;
      be classified into 1 of 3 risk groups for total cholesterol and LDL lipid panel. Risk groups&#xD;
      are defined as follows: (1) Acceptable level &lt;170mg/dL and&lt;110mg/dL for LDL (2) borderline&#xD;
      level 170-199mg/dL and 110-129 mg/dL and (3) High level &gt;200mg/dL and &gt;130mg/dL for total&#xD;
      cholesterol and LDL respectively. HDL and triglyceride levels will be stratified by&#xD;
      percentile based on age and sex. All reference levels are in concordance with lipid screening&#xD;
      guidelines from the AAP which were adapted from the Lipid Research Clinic Pediatric&#xD;
      Prevalence Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperglycemia: Both fasting glucose and serum fructosamine will be drawn to assess for&#xD;
      hyperglycemia. Participants will be categorized by fasting glucose: (1) Normal glucose&#xD;
      80-100mg/dL (2) Elevated glucose 101-125mg/dL (3) Hyperglycemia &gt;126mg/dL. Impaired fasting&#xD;
      glucose included any subject with glucose &gt;100mg/dL. Serum fructosamine levels will be&#xD;
      categorized into (1) Normal levels 203-263umol/L and (2) Elevated &gt;263 umol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: Parent participants will complete the below questionnaires. Food and Exercise&#xD;
      Survey: Parents will complete the 20 Question Family Nutrition and Physical Activity (FNPA)&#xD;
      screening tool to assess youth's nutrition and exercise. The FNPA instrument was developed at&#xD;
      Iowa State University in collaboration with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics following&#xD;
      a comprehensive evidence analysis examining the influence of physical activity, sport&#xD;
      participation, television viewing and video games for their influence on child adiposity.&#xD;
      Initial validation was performed in a sample of 854 children and their parents in Des Moines&#xD;
      Iowa. Correlational analysis and logistic regression were used to examine associations among&#xD;
      FNPA factors and the relationship between these factors and child weight status. Significant&#xD;
      correlations were found between BMI and seven of the ten constructs (breakfast/family meals,&#xD;
      modeling nutrition, high calorie beverage intake, television in the bedroom, parent physical&#xD;
      activity, child physical activity and sleep schedule) as well as between BMI and the overall&#xD;
      FNPA score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family History Survey: Parents will complete a short family history survey of the most common&#xD;
      family risks for overweight and obesity which include: maternal history of BMI greater than&#xD;
      the 85th percentile, maternal history of gestational diabetes, family history of&#xD;
      overweight/obesity, family history of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol,&#xD;
      and T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Chart Review: In addition to the biological variables above, the following variables&#xD;
      will be extracted from the participants EHR from the current clinic visit: demographics&#xD;
      (race, insurance payer), history of acute chest, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, avascular&#xD;
      necrosis and stroke, medications, disease severity score calculated based on number of ED&#xD;
      visits and hospitalizations during the past 3 years. BMI and clinical visit laboratory&#xD;
      results (hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, random non-fasting glucose) over the last 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Problems and alternative strategies: Recruitment and retention. Despite COVID-19,&#xD;
      all pediatric SCD are operating in-person at full capacity. To maximize recruitment and&#xD;
      retention, the study nurse coordinator will customize recruitment materials and strategies&#xD;
      (e.g., study brochure, visual aids, and confirming Medicaid transportation to appointment).&#xD;
      The investigators will use compensation and methodologies (research paired with medical&#xD;
      appointments) effective for ≥80% recruitment in previous cross-sectional studies with this&#xD;
      population [e.g. Physical Activity and Pain in Youth with Sickle Cell Disease. While the&#xD;
      investigators do not anticipate problems with recruitment, the team will plan to add the&#xD;
      Meridian and Hattiesburg satellite clinics if 30% below recruitment goals in Month 3. Age&#xD;
      range. Another potential concern is the broad age range of 10-19 year olds, with differences&#xD;
      in weight potentially being due to pubertal Tanner stage. To address these biological&#xD;
      confounds, age will be stratified for in equal numbers during recruitment (10-14 years and&#xD;
      15-19 years) and pubertal Tanner stage will be controlled for in analyses. Finally, youth&#xD;
      participants may refuse blood draw, weight/height measurement, or blood pressure measurement.&#xD;
      However, these are standard medical procedures that this pediatric patient population is very&#xD;
      familiar with by 10 years of age. Our clinic routinely uses ultrasound guided blood draws to&#xD;
      reduce the number of needle sticks needed to obtain adequate blood sample. Additionally,&#xD;
      every effort to use lidocaine numbing cream and distraction during blood draws will be made&#xD;
      for youth who express anxiety regarding venipuncture blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses Power and Sample Size: Statistical analyses will be conducted with the&#xD;
      MCCTR Biostatistical Core (Seth Lirette, PhD). G*Power 3.0.10 chi-squared a-priori power&#xD;
      analyses specified that a sample size of 100 youth (50 per weight-status group) will provide&#xD;
      greater than 90% power for detecting differences in the prevalence rate of relative&#xD;
      hypertension (primary outcome) in youth with SCD who are overweight/obese versus youth with&#xD;
      SCD who are underweight/normal weight. An anticipated large effect size (.8) for power&#xD;
      analyses is based on the prevalence rate of 4.5% for hypertension in African American youth&#xD;
      10-19 years who were obese compared to a prevalence rate of 40.2% for relative hypertension&#xD;
      in African American young adults 18-20 years with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attrition and Missing Data: The investigators anticipate a small portion (approximately 5%)&#xD;
      of unusable laboratory data due to clinical difficulties with blood draw (e.g., nurse not&#xD;
      able to draw enough blood). Based on the above power analyses, the total target sample of&#xD;
      N=100 youth will provide a large enough sample size to account for this type of random&#xD;
      missing laboratory data. Questionnaires will be checked by the study nurse coordinator for&#xD;
      completeness prior to study completion. Random missing questionnaire data will be handled or&#xD;
      imputed using author recommendations or mean imputation strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic plan Aim 1: Statistical analyses will be calculated in SPSS 26.0 or Stata 15.0.&#xD;
      Prevalence rates of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia will be calculated for the&#xD;
      two study groups. A series of non-parametric exact Fisher tests will examine the prevalence&#xD;
      rate of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in pediatric patients with SCD who are&#xD;
      overweight or obese (i.e., have a BMI ≥ 85th percentile) compared to their underweight and&#xD;
      normal weight (i.e., have a BMI 1st to 84th percentile) counterparts, controlling for Tanner&#xD;
      pubertal stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic plan Aim 2: A series of logistic regressions will examine the differential impact&#xD;
      (odds ratio) of diet, exercise, and family history of overweight/obesity on the risk for&#xD;
      weight status, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia in youth with SCD, controlling&#xD;
      for Tanner pubertal stage.&#xD;
