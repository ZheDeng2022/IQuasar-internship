  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, observational, cross-sectional cohort study, comparing&#xD;
      nurse-performed bedside lung ultrasound to standard portable CXR, for the detection of&#xD;
      pneumothorax in the cardiac surgery patient population, following chest tube removal. This&#xD;
      study aims to be conducted at an academic, tertiary adult center cardio-vascular intensive&#xD;
      care unit (CVICU at TGH).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To avoid the accumulation of blood and fluids in the mediastinum or pleural cavities after&#xD;
      cardiac surgery, mediastinal and pleural drains are routinely used. The rate of pneumothorax&#xD;
      following chest drain removal is approximately 1.5-13%, resulting in increased patient&#xD;
      morbidity and hospital stay. The standard method for the determination of pneumothorax (PNX)&#xD;
      in most institutions is to obtain a chest radiography (CXR) following chest tube removal, but&#xD;
      the reliability of the supine anteroposterior chest radiography is not utter, with up to 30%&#xD;
      of pneumothoraxes misdiagnosis. The delay of ordering, performing and interpreting a CXR post&#xD;
      mediastinal tube removal, results in potential delay in patients transfers, with an estimated&#xD;
      cost savings of omitting an additional chest radiography, of approximately $10 000 per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung ultrasound (LUS) is recommended for detection of pneumothorax as per evidence-based&#xD;
      guidelines and expert consensus. Lung ultrasound is a safe technique due to minimal&#xD;
      radiation, with the potential for immediate results when compared with the standard CXR. LUS&#xD;
      has high accuracy for PNX detection, with better pooled sensitivities (78.6%) when compared&#xD;
      to CXR (39.8%) and equal specificity (98.4 vs 99.3%). In intensive care units, those results&#xD;
      have been reproducible, with LUS having greater sensitivity than CXR for PNX diagnosis (0.87&#xD;
      vs 0.46) and equal specificity, 0.99 vs 1.00. LUS is more accurate and faster than chest&#xD;
      radiography.&#xD;

    <description>Patients who have undergone heart surgery and have decided to enroll in our study, will have the standard chest x-ray and an additional lung ultrasound. Within a maximum of two hours of the chest tube removal, the standard chest x-ray will be performed, and then a different nurse will perform the lung ultrasound to check for pneumothorax.</description>
