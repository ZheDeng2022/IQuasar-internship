  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-1701 in&#xD;
      combination with famitinib in subjects with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumor. There&#xD;
      are two parts of the study: combinational therapy part and monotherapy part. Phase I of&#xD;
      combinational therapy part is to determine the recommended dose for Phase II (RP2D) for&#xD;
      famitinib in the combined regimen, then efficacy and safety of SHR-1701 plus famitinib (RP2D)&#xD;
      will be further evaluated in the following Phase II in cohorts 1/2/3, with simon's two-stage&#xD;
      design. Meanwhile, efficacy and safety of famitinib will also be assessed in cohorts 4/5 in&#xD;
      the monotherapy part.&#xD;
