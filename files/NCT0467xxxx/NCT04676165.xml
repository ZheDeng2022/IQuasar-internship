  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adverse drug events (ADEs) are a leading cause of death in North America, with over 2 million&#xD;
      ADEs causing 100,000 deaths every year and millions in economic costs. The majority of ADEs&#xD;
      that occur within 30 days of discharge from hospital are related to prescription medications&#xD;
      and of these, more than 50% are preventable. Among the causes of ADEs are incomplete and&#xD;
      unclear medication lists, and a lack of patient understanding and adherence. Patients are&#xD;
      usually discharged from hospital on substantially difference medication regiments than those&#xD;
      prior to admission. In the absence of supportive mechanisms that ensure patients'&#xD;
      understanding of their medication list, adherence to prescribed medication changes is likely&#xD;
      to be reduced and the subsequent risk of ADEs increased. Secondary analyses from a recently&#xD;
      conducted randomized controlled trial (RCT) by our team suggest that more than 50% of study&#xD;
      patient were non-adherent to at least one in-hospital medication change, and that this&#xD;
      non-adherence significantly increased the risk of hospital re-admission and emergency&#xD;
      department visits in the 30 days post-discharge. Furthermore, analyses of interview data&#xD;
      suggest that non-adherence may be driven by unclear communication with patients about&#xD;
      medication changes and the reasons for these changes, as well as difficulties in managing&#xD;
      complex dosing schedules and drug regimen information. There is therefore a clear need to&#xD;
      implement and evaluate patient support mechanisms that reduce non-adherence to essential&#xD;
      changes in therapy following hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project is to conduct a pilot RCT that will evaluate the usability of a&#xD;
      medication management mobile application and its efficacy in reducing non-adherence to&#xD;
      in-hospital medication changes following discharge. We will randomize 100 patients from the&#xD;
      internal medicine unit of the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) Glen site to either the&#xD;
      intervention or control arm. Patients in the control arm will receive usual care (i.e. no&#xD;
      medication management support), whereas those in the intervention arm will receive a tablet&#xD;
      with the installed mobile application. The application will integrate prescription claims&#xD;
      data from the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ) for the 3-month period prior to&#xD;
      hospital admission with the patient's discharge prescription to generate a patient-friendly&#xD;
      medication list, along with details of in-hospital medication changes. The app will also&#xD;
      offer a number of features designed to maximize patient understanding and adherence,&#xD;
      including pill images, patient-friendly drug monographs, weekly dosing schedules, drug&#xD;
      alerts, home refill services, and features that connect with the patient's caregiver and&#xD;
      hospital pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 1 week post-discharge, study coordinators will conduct a usability assessment to obtain&#xD;
      patient feedback on the app (via a technology acceptance questionnaire) and to document&#xD;
      usability using the &quot;think aloud&quot; protocol, which is based on observing and recording&#xD;
      patients as they use the application and verbalize any thoughts that might occur to them.&#xD;
      Qualitative analysis of recorded and transcribed sessions will then be used to assess the&#xD;
      technology's ease of use, user-friendliness, efficiency, and any features that may cause&#xD;
      confusion, frustration, or user errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-adherence to in-hospital treatment changes will be assessed by comparing patients'&#xD;
      discharge prescriptions with medications dispensed in the 30 days following hospital&#xD;
      discharge (obtained from RAMQ pharmacy claims). We will compare, between intervention and&#xD;
      control groups, the average number of in-hospital medication changes not adhered to in the&#xD;
      30-day follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will assess a technological intervention that has the potential to improve&#xD;
      patient adherence to in-hospital medication changes and may subsequently reduce the&#xD;
      occurrence of ADEs. Given the high costs associated with ADEs, this small investment has the&#xD;
      potential to incur significant cost savings for the Quebec healthcare system.&#xD;

    <description>Users will be observed as they use the app, following the &quot;think aloud protocol&quot;. This involves users verbalizing their thoughts as they perform a standardized set of tasks, while being audio-recorded. In this pilot, a field assistant familiar with the SAM app will observe and record users as they access SAM and complete the following standardized tasks: view medications lists and dosing schedule, peruse drug information, and examine alerts. Each session will be transcribed and transcriptions will be qualitatively analyzed to assess the following usability concepts: (1) ease of use, (2) user-friendliness, (3) efficiency, and (4) features that may cause confusion, frustration, or user errors.</description>

    <description>Participants in the intervention arm will complete the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) Questionnaire 1 week following discharge from hospital. The questionnaire was developed using the TAM 1, 2, and 3, which were developed by Davis (1989), Venkatesh &amp; Davis (2000), and Venkatesh and Bala (2008), respectively. The questionnaire is self-administered and consists of 38 questions, each of which is on a Likert scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The questionnaire assesses users' satisfaction with the application and its usability.&#xD;

    <description>Pharmacy claims data from the public insurance provider will be used to identify community medications dispensed to participating patients in the 30 days following hospital discharge. These data will be compared with the patient's hospital discharge prescription to identify non-adherence to in-hospital medication changes. Non-adherence to in-hospital treatment changes in the 30-day post-discharge period will be defined as (1) failure to fill newly prescribed medications, (2) re-filling a previous prescription that was stopped at discharge, or (3) filling a previous prescription whose dosage was modified at discharge, but was dispensed post-discharge at the incorrect daily dose.</description>

    <description>SAM generates a patient-friendly list of prescribed and dispensed medications and offers several features:&#xD;
Drug information: Patient-friendly monographs that describe treatment indications and the harms/benefits of medications.&#xD;
Adherence alerts: Alerts users to non-adherence, such as when they fill prescriptions that were stopped at hospital discharge, don't fill prescribed medications, or buy medications at the incorrect dose.&#xD;
Side-effect checker: Provides a list of side effects associated with individual medications and the patient's overall drug profile.&#xD;
Rate my med: Allows patients to rate medications and describe experiences with a medication. Patients can view ratings given by users.&#xD;
Caregiver connect: Provides patients' caregivers with access to the app.&#xD;
Pharmacy connect: Allows patients to connect with their hospital pharmacist to ask questions regarding their medications and adherence alerts.&#xD;
Other: pill images, daily pill reminders, weekly dosing schedule</description>
