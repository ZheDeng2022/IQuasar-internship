  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project the investigators will look for auto-antibodies to relevant proteins both in&#xD;
      native form and importantly in post-translationally modified forms. Potential modified&#xD;
      auto-antigens are eosinophil proteins (analogous to the cytoplasmic neutrophil proteins&#xD;
      identified in vasculitides such as Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (formerly known as&#xD;
      Wegener's granulomatosis) and alternatively structural proteins such as collagen V. As well&#xD;
      as advancing the understanding of asthma pathology, identifying a serum auto-antibody that&#xD;
      could then be used as a clinical blood test, analogous to anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide&#xD;
      (CCP) antibodies in rheumatoid arthritis, may revolutionise diagnosis of severe eosinophilic&#xD;
      asthma and Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA). There is a considerable&#xD;
      burden of undiagnosed severe eosinophilic asthma in part due to difficulties in definitive&#xD;
      diagnosis and a diagnostic blood test would help diagnose these patients, allowing them to&#xD;
      receive necessary treatment.&#xD;

      The investigators will approach the research question with parallel agnostic and targeted&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the agnostic approach the presence of auto-antibodies in patient serum and sputum to&#xD;
      inactive and activated eosinophils, with and without post-translational modification, will be&#xD;
      examined by indirect immunofluorescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the targeted approach the investigators will examine by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA)&#xD;
      the presence/absence of antibodies to pre-selected candidate eosinophil and base membrane&#xD;
      proteins both in native form and post-translationally modified. Proteins to examine will be&#xD;
      chosen based on literature review (e.g. eosinophil peroxidase and collagen V) and&#xD;
      eosinophil-specific proteins identified by FANTOM5 (Functional Annotation of the&#xD;
      Mouse/Mammalian Genome) geneset analysis (FANTOM Consortium et al. 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both blood and sputum samples from highly-characterised patients with severe eosinophilic&#xD;
      asthma and/or EGPA will be examined given the possibility of compartment-specific immune&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once candidate auto-antigens have been identified in the selected group of patients with&#xD;
      severe eosinophilic asthma and EGPA, the investigators will then examine their prevalence in&#xD;
      serum samples from a wider selection of patients with eosinophilic airways diseases including&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate asthma, severe eosinophilic asthma, EGPA, nasal polyposis and eosinophilic&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as well as healthy controls. Length of disease,&#xD;
      atopy, presence/absence nasal polyps, gender, age will be examined as co-variates.&#xD;
      Correlations with highest blood eosinophil counts, requirement for oral corticosteroids and&#xD;
      presence of other auto-antibodies, e.g. anti-MPO (myeloperoxidase) ANCA (anti-neutrophil&#xD;
      cytoplasmic antibody), will be examined. In particular the investigators will look for the&#xD;
      presence of novel autoantibodies in specific patient subsets: i) ANCA negative, ii) ANCA&#xD;
      positive by immunofluorescence but negative for anti-MPO and anti-PR3 (proteinase-3)&#xD;
      antibodies, iii) ANA (anti-nuclear antibody) positive but ANCA and extractable nuclear&#xD;
      antigen (ENA) negative; since patients in all three groups may have novel, as yet&#xD;
      undetermined autoantibodies. ROC (receiver operator characteristic curve) AUC (area under&#xD;
      curve) analyses will be conducted to ascertain the predictive value of blood auto-antibodies&#xD;
      for diagnosis of eosinophilic airways disease.&#xD;
