      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab administered concomitantly with topical corticosteroids&#xD;
      (TCS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab administered concomitantly with TCS. To assess the&#xD;
      safety of dupilumab over 16 weeks of treatment when administered concomitantly with TCS in&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess immunogenicity as determined by the incidence, titer, and clinical impact of&#xD;
      treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to dupilumab over time in pediatric patients&#xD;
      with atopic dermatitis (AD) (aged ≥6 months to &lt;18 years old) To assess the concentration of&#xD;
