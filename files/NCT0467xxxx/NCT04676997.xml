    <time_frame>Up to approximately 27-30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>pCR rate (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the percentage of participants without residual invasive tumor on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery in all participants.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 27-30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>pCR rate (ypT0/Tis) is defined as the percentage of participants without invasive cancer in the breast irrespective of ductal carcinoma in situ or nodal involvement following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery in all participants</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Event-Free Survival (EFS) in all participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>EFS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy (breast or other cancers) or death due to any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 25-30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as percentage of participants with best (confirmed) overall response (BOR) of either CR or PR. ORR was assessed by the investigator according to RECIST version 1.1 and is based on BOR, which is defined as best response recorded from start of study treatment until definitive surgery or disease progression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 35 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AEs were graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.&#xD;
In general, AEs are graded according to the following: Grade 1 Mild AE Grade 2 Moderate AE Grade 3 Severe AE Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE Grade 5 Death related to AE.&#xD;
