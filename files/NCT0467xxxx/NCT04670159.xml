  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pandemic process has caused very important changes and effects in the economy, social&#xD;
      life and education practices, especially health at global level. Within the scope of the&#xD;
      measures taken, with the closure of educational institutions and interruption of face-to-face&#xD;
      education, the education of 1.6 billion students, which corresponds to approximately half of&#xD;
      the student population from all educational levels, has been interrupted. The need and&#xD;
      approach to open and distance learning has come to the fore with significant changes and&#xD;
      effects on education worldwide. Pandemic measures, the transition to distance education and&#xD;
      the increase in computer usage caused an increase in ergonomic risks in students. Due to the&#xD;
      pandemic process, it has been reported that the physical activity level of students decreases&#xD;
      and the sitting period is prolonged. In this study, physiotherapy students who receive&#xD;
      distance education will be given online ergonomics and physical activity training and the&#xD;
      results will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, change from baseline ergonomics risks levels at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ergonomic risk levels of the participants in the distance education process will be determined by Rapid Office Strain Assessment (ROSA) .The Rapid Office Strain Assessment (ROSA) was designed to quickly quantify risks associated with computer work and to establish an action level for change based on reports of worker discomfort. Ergonomic risk assessment will be done after online training and brochure information for all participants.</description>

    <measure>Measuring the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorder By Cornell questionniare Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire is an outcome measure used widely when examining musculoskeletal disorders in various occupational groups and students alike.The Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire was taken from the instruments provided by Human Factors and Ergonomics Laboratory at Cornell University.&#xD;
The changes in the musculoskeletal disorders of the participants will be evaluated before and after the online training and brochure information.</description>

    <description>Online ergonomics, exercise and physical activity training will be provided 3 times a week for 6 weeks. The trainings it is planned to be made with a video-based online platform called Edpuzzle. With the online classroom created, the student education will be provided. A total of 18 training videos will be prepared, each video is 6-10 minutes. After the training there will be an individual motivational interview with the students in the this group with the zoom application. With motivational interview solutions by revealing the willingness, obstacles and indecision of the student to transfer the learned information to his daily life will be recommended.</description>
