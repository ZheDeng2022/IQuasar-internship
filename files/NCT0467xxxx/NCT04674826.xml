  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a single dose of 300 mg tralokinumab administered as a 1 × X mL&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) injection with Device A and 2 × Y mL consecutive SC injections with Device&#xD;
      B.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, open label, 2 period, 2 sequence cross over trial&#xD;
      designed to compare the PK and to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 300&#xD;
      mg tralokinumab administered as a 1 × X mL SC injection with Device A (test treatment [T])&#xD;
      and 2 × Y mL consecutive SC injections with Device B (reference treatment [R]) in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Additionally, the experience of tralokinumab being administered with Device A&#xD;
      compared to Device B will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being informed about the study and the potential risks, all subjects giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will be enrolled and randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences, Sequence TR&#xD;
      or Sequence RT in a 1:1 ratio (i.e., subjects receive the 2 treatments in the specified&#xD;
      order).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of a helminth parasitic infection within 6 months prior to the date of&#xD;
