      the ARMANI trial will test the hypothesis, if an anatomic resection (AR) improves long-term&#xD;
      outcome vs. a non-anatomical resection (NAR) in patients undergoing surgery for RAS-mutated&#xD;
      colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite increasing application and success of personalized treatment in medical oncology,&#xD;
      little progress has been made in personalized surgical cancer therapy. The ARMANI trial&#xD;
      presents the first prospective, randomized trial to evaluate effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      molecular-guided resection in patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM). While CRLM&#xD;
      might be removed independently of the liver's segmental borders, retrospective data favor&#xD;
      anatomic resections in the subgroup of patients with a mutation in the RAS oncogene.&#xD;
      Therefore, the ARMANI trial will test the hypothesis, if an anatomic resection (AR) improves&#xD;
      long-term outcome vs. a non-anatomical resection (NAR) in patients undergoing surgery for&#xD;
      RAS-mutated CRLM. The trial will be carried out among 11 high-volume centers of&#xD;
      hepato-biliary surgery in Germany. A total of 220 patients will be enrolled and randomized in&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio to undergo an AR vs. NAR. The primary endpoint is intrahepatic disease-free&#xD;
      survival (iDFS). In addition, the study will provide important data on perioperative outcomes&#xD;
      and quality of life for both surgical techniques. Given the trend among liver surgeons to aim&#xD;
      for parenchymal-sparing operations to preserve liver parenchyma, a positive trial will be&#xD;
      practice changing and present the first piece of high-level evidence on benefits of&#xD;
      personalized surgical therapy guided by the tumor's mutational profile in patients with CRLM.&#xD;
