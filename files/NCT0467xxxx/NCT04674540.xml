  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedation and analgesia is a very important part of the comprehensive treatment of critically&#xD;
      ill patients. The comprehensive management strategy of sedation and analgesia in the&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the control of infection, the application of antibiotics, and&#xD;
      active recovery-are equally important. Effective sedation and analgesia assessment tools and&#xD;
      reasonable comprehensive management strategies can not only improve patient comfort, reduce&#xD;
      discomfort memory, but also reduce nursing workload and improve clinical outcomes. The&#xD;
      &quot;eCASH&quot; theory proposed by Vincent et al. in 2016 further improved the comprehensive&#xD;
      management strategy for sedation and analgesia. Its main contents are early analgesia to make&#xD;
      patients comfortable, minimal sedatives and maximum humanitarian care. However, unreasonable&#xD;
      sedation, especially early deep sedation, is closely related to the poor prognosis of&#xD;
      patients. With the update of the ICU sedation and analgesia guidelines and the continuous&#xD;
      progress of related research, ICU doctors have gradually deepened their understanding of&#xD;
      sedation and analgesia. At present, the level of emergency ICU development in various regions&#xD;
      of the country is uneven, and the implementation of sedation and analgesia may also vary&#xD;
      greatly. Therefore, by investigating and understanding the implementation of emergency ICU or&#xD;
      ICU sedation and analgesia in various regions of the country, you can indirectly understand&#xD;
      the familiarity of medical staff with sedation and analgesia guidelines, and formulate&#xD;
      corresponding strategies for specific situations, which may help improve critical illness.&#xD;
      The level of sedation and analgesia of the patient improves the treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, there are few domestic research reports on the implementation of sedation and&#xD;
      analgesia in critical patients, especially the data in the emergency ICU. This study intends&#xD;
      to investigate the implementation status of sedation and analgesia in critically ill patients&#xD;
      in ICU, to understand the familiarity of medical staff with sedation and analgesia&#xD;
      guidelines, and provide a basis for further measures.&#xD;

      Part 1: Cognitive survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: emergency and critical illness medical staff (doctors and nurses) of&#xD;
      participating units. The number of medical staff in each unit is at least 12, among which&#xD;
      doctors and nurses are ≥6 (the ratio is ≥3 for elementary level and ≥3 for intermediate and&#xD;
      above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate awareness of sedation and analgesia guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Current status of sedation and analgesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: patients older than 18 years old in the ICU of the participating unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Collect general information of patients that meet the inclusion criteria, including the&#xD;
      patient's gender, age, body mass index (BMI), length of stay in ICU (days, with 1 effective&#xD;
      decimal), diagnosis, acute physiology and chronicity on day 1 Health status score (Acute&#xD;
      Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, APACHE II), whether to receive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, whether to use vasoconstrictor to maintain blood pressure and other information;&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Assess whether the patients need sedation and analgesia, and divide the patients into&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sedation assessment: Use the Richmond Sedation and Restlessness Score (RASS score) for&#xD;
           sedation assessment. For mechanically ventilated patients, if the RASS score is ≥1,&#xD;
           sedation is considered necessary; for patients without mechanical ventilation, if the&#xD;
           RASS score is ≥2, consider Sedation is needed; for patients who have been given sedation&#xD;
           and the RASS score reaches the target, sedation is also considered necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analgesia evaluation: The digital pain scoring method is used for awake patients, and&#xD;
           when the score is ≥4 points, the drug is administered according to the WHO three-step&#xD;
           analgesic principle; non-conscious patients should use the Critical-Care Pain&#xD;
           Observation Tool (CPOT), If CPOT ≥ 3 points, it is considered that there is pain, and&#xD;
           analgesia is needed; for patients who are already on analgesia treatment and the pain&#xD;
           score reaches the standard, it is also considered that analgesia is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluation of delirium: Has delirium occurred after entering the ICU? Do you use&#xD;
           delirium assessment tools? Record the means of delirium management;&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. If sedation and analgesia is required, relevant information will be collected according to&#xD;
      the actual situation of each research unit. For patients who do not require sedation and&#xD;
      analgesia after the second step assessment, there is no need to collect sedation and&#xD;
      analgesia information. This information includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is there any sedation and analgesia?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Information about sedation: Are sedation assessment tools used (if used, what kind of&#xD;
           sedation assessment tools are used); are sedation target values set (record specific&#xD;
           values)? Actual sedation score; name and dose of sedative drugs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analgesia-related information: whether to use analgesia evaluation tools (if used, what&#xD;
           analgesia evaluation tools are recorded); whether to set an analgesia target value&#xD;
           (record the specific value)? Actual analgesic score; name and dosage of analgesic drugs;&#xD;
