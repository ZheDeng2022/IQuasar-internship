  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a Phase 3 multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-arm study to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of HLX01 versus European Union (EU)-sourced Mabthera® as first line&#xD;
      treatment in patients with low tumour burden FL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a Screening Period (up to 42 days), Treatment Period (Week 1 to&#xD;
      Week 44/Month 11), and End of Study (EOS; Month 12 Visit). Approximately 212 patients (106 in&#xD;
      each treatment group) will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utilising a 1-sided 97.5% CI for the risk difference, a reference proportion of 83.2% for&#xD;
      Mabthera®, delta for non-inferiority of -17%, and assuming a true difference of 1%, a sample&#xD;
      size of 106 patients per arm (212 total) provides approximately 85% power to show&#xD;
      non-inferiority of HLX01 to Mabthera® on a primary endpoint of risk difference in ORR up to&#xD;
      Week 28. No dropout is included, as all patients will either have data provided for ORR&#xD;
      (based on best response), or will be classed as non-responder.&#xD;
