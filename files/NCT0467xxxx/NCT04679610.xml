      Infections caused by resistant gram-negative bacteria are becoming increasingly prevalent and&#xD;
      now constitute a serious threat to public health worldwide because they are difficult to&#xD;
      treat and are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Among nosocomial&#xD;
      infections, the most major threat represent infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR)&#xD;
      and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Gram-negative pathogens.&#xD;

      Infections caused by resistant gram-negative bacteria are becoming increasingly prevalent and&#xD;
      now constitute a serious threat to public health worldwide because they are difficult to&#xD;
      treat and are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Among nosocomial&#xD;
      infections, the most major threat represent infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR)&#xD;
      and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Gram-negative pathogens. The most problematic are the&#xD;
      ESKAPE microorganisms, an acronym of the most frequently isolated MDR bacteria (Enterococcus&#xD;
      faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) have emerged as a major source of antimicrobial&#xD;
      resistance in gram-negative pathogens. Generally encoded by plasmid-borne genes, these&#xD;
      enzymes confer resistance to penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam. In addition, their&#xD;
      presence in bacteria has been associated with resistance to other classes of nonpenicillin&#xD;
      antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and&#xD;
      β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations. Thus, ESBL-producing organisms often possess a&#xD;
      multidrug resistance phenotype. Furthermore ESBL production has been associated with severe&#xD;
      adverse clinical and economic outcomes, including increased mortality, increased length of&#xD;
      stay, delay in the institution of effective therapy, decreased functional status on&#xD;
      discharge, and increased cost of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent emergence and spread of infections caused by carbapenem-resistant&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are concerning because carbapenems have represented a last line of&#xD;
      defense against resistant strains of gram-negative pathogens [6]. The most clinically&#xD;
      relevant carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae are the class D enzymes of the OXA-48 group,&#xD;
      class A enzymes of the KPC type and the zinc-dependent class B metallo-β-lactamases (MβLs),&#xD;
      represented mainly by the VIM, IMP, and NDM type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteria cause serious infections in debilitated and&#xD;
      immunocompromised patients, in association with prolonged hospital stays and increased&#xD;
      mortality rates, ranging from 24% to as high as 70%, depending on the study population [8,9].&#xD;
      Given the critical condition of these patients, treatment should be timely and rapidly&#xD;
      efficacious. However, therapeutic options are obviously limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The environmental bacterium P. aeruginosa is one of the most important nosocomial pathogens,&#xD;
      especially in intensive care units. Intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance makes P.&#xD;
      aeruginosa one of the most difficult organisms to treat. The high intrinsic antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance of P. aeruginosa is due to several mechanisms: a low outer membrane permeability,&#xD;
      the production of an AmpC β-lactamase, and the presence of numerous genes coding for&#xD;
      different multidrug resistance efflux pumps[10]. Loss of OprD is the most prevalent mechanism&#xD;
      of resistance to carbapenems and is associated with resistance to imipenem and reduced&#xD;
      susceptibility to meropenem [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United States, there has been a steady increase since 2000 in rates of&#xD;
      extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae, and multidrug-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and&#xD;
      Acinetobacter baumannii, particularly among hospitalized patients with intraabdominal&#xD;
      infections, urinary tract infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and bacteremia [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Russia there are some key issues of antimicrobial resistance according to the national&#xD;
      multicenter surveillance study on antimicrobial resistance of nosocomial pathogens,&#xD;
      &quot;MARATHON&quot; (2011-2012). Data were collected in 25 hospitals of 18 cities of Russia (1700&#xD;
      isolates). Enterobacteriaceae isolates jointly comprised 33.7% of all bacterial nosocomial&#xD;
      isolates. Production of ESBL was detected in 78.2% of all isolates [13]. Thus there is an&#xD;
      extremely high frequency of resistance to 3rd gen. cephalosporins in all species of&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae (&gt; 80%) and especially K. Pneumoniae (&gt; 90%), due mainly spread of ESBL&#xD;
      (78%), which complicates the possibility of their use in the empirical treatment of&#xD;
      nosocomial infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of resistance to carbapenems among Enterobacteriaceae was: non-susceptibility to&#xD;
      meropenem - 2.8%, to imipenem - 8.4%, to ertapenem - 14.0%, including conferred by&#xD;
      carbapenemases - 3.7% of isolates OXA-48 (3.3%), NDM (0.4%) [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the fact that the carbapenems are active against most (86-97%) of nosocomial&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae strains, the proportion of isolates resistant to carbapenems is increasing&#xD;
      rapidly [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Russia P. aeruginosa is the most common nosocomial pathogen, comprising 20.2% of all&#xD;
      bacterial nosocomial isolates. The high level of resistance P. aeruginosa to carbapenems and&#xD;
      high level of MBL were detected: resistance to imipenem - 88.0%, to meropenem - 66.8%,&#xD;
      including resistance conferred by VIM-type MBL in 28.3% of the isolates [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above date shows the need to develop novel antimicrobials. In an era of increasing&#xD;
      resistance to antimicrobials, ceftolozane-tazobactam provides clinicians with an additional&#xD;
      treatment option for infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms,&#xD;
      including ESBL-Enterobacteriaceae and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa[16]. In vitro,&#xD;
      ceftolozane-tazobactam has been shown to be active against P. aeruginosa and demonstrates&#xD;
      high activity against Enterobacteriaceae [17]. Ceftolozane-tazobactam demonstrated in vitro&#xD;
      activity against Enterobacteriaceae in the presence of some ESBLs and other betalactamases of&#xD;
      the TEM, SHV,CTX-M, and OXA groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the activity of ceftolozane-tazobactam against contemporary clinical&#xD;
      isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, including those with resistance&#xD;
      to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems. It will also assess the prevalence of&#xD;
      various ESBLs of TEM-, SHV-, CTX-M- and GES-types, as well as carbapenemases of class A (KPC,&#xD;
      GEScarb.), class D (OXA-48-like) and class B (NDM, VIM, IMP) and will evaluate the in vitro&#xD;
      activities of ceftolozane-tazobactam and other antimicrobials against nosocomial isolates&#xD;
      with respect to their beta-lactamase content. The results of this study will help to advance&#xD;
      the understanding of ceftolozane-tazobactam's role in Russian hospitals.&#xD;
