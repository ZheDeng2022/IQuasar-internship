  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases all over the world. Currently, about&#xD;
      70 million people have epilepsy worldwide. In particular, more than 30% of epilepsy patients&#xD;
      still have seizures even though they are treated with appropriate anti-epileptic drugs&#xD;
      (AEDs). This number has remained unchanged even after more than 20 years with many new&#xD;
      anti-epileptic drugs being introduced. According to International League Against Epilepsy&#xD;
      (ILAE), drug-resistant epilepsy is defined when a patient does not achieve seizure-free the&#xD;
      seizure with two optimal antiepileptic drugs. This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of thread-embedding acupuncture (TEA) as palliative treatment of&#xD;
      drug resistant epilepsy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this clinical trial are twofold: the effectiveness of TEA is assessed by&#xD;
      comparing the changes in the seizure control and quality of life at 5 months between 2&#xD;
      groups: the TEA + baseline AEDs group and the sham-TEA (STEA) + baseline AEDs group. Adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) that occur during the study will be investigated to evaluate the safety of TEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is investigated by the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TEA can increase the probability of becoming seizure free.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TEA can reduce the frequency and duration of seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TEA can improve quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TEA is associated with adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will be performed as a 2-arm parallel design, randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      assessor-blinded, clinical trial.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of life (QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was recorded by QOLIE-31 (Quality of Life in Epilepsy) questionnaire The Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31) contains seven multi-item scales that tap the following health concepts: emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, cognitive functioning, seizure worry, medication effects, and overall quality of life. The scoring procedure for the QOLIE-31 first converts the raw coded numeric values of items to 0-100 point scores, with higher converted scores always reflecting better quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Seizure Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The National Hospital Seizure Severity Scale (NHS3) was recorded The scale is administered by a health professional during an interview with a patient and a witness to the seizures. It contains seven seizure-related factors and generates a score from 1 to 27. The higher score reflects the more severity of seizure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Epileptiform discharges</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Epileptiform discharges (ED) were recorded in Electroencephalograph (EEG). Epileptiform discharges are defined as generalized or focal polyspikes, polyspike-wave, spike-wave, sharp and sharp - wave occurring in the forms of a single discharge or a burst. The duration of discharges are from 20 - 200 milliseconds. The EDs are interpreted and numbers of ED are counted during a standard EEG by trained neurologists.</description>
