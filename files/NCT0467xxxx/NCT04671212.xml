  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to establish a mechanism to obtain discarded bone&#xD;
      marrow-containing bone samples from hemoglobinopathy, as well as non-hemoglobinopathy&#xD;
      individuals. The processing of samples will help to understand how best to manipulate HSPC's&#xD;
      from hemoglobinopathy patients with gene therapy and gene technologies in the laboratory&#xD;
      environment. It will also allow us to establish a reservoir of samples that can be studied in&#xD;
      the future to assess cellular function and fitness for transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop gene transfer and gene editing strategies as potentially curative therapy for&#xD;
           hemoglobinopathies (e.g. sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a drug treatment strategy which elevates the expression of fetal hemoglobin&#xD;
           to a potentially curative level for hemoglobinopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the biology of bone marrow cells isolated from patients with&#xD;
           hemoglobinopathies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hemoglobinopathies (e.g. sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia) are devastating&#xD;
      inherited anemias that shorten and reduce quality of life. The only current curative therapy&#xD;
      for SCD is bone marrow transplantation. However, many patients lack access to suitable donors&#xD;
      for transplant. Alternative treatments based on gene therapy, gene editing and novel drugs&#xD;
      are currently being developed and show great promise for hemoglobinopathies. Gene therapy and&#xD;
      gene editing are especially appealing because they eliminate both the need for donors and the&#xD;
      potentially devastating side effects of Graft-versus-Host Disease because they take advantage&#xD;
      of the patients own cells. In gene therapy approaches, hematopoietic stem and progenitor&#xD;
      cells (HSPCs) are collected from a patient and then treated to 'correct' or 'replace' the&#xD;
      disease-causing mutation. However, much work remains to develop optimal gene therapy and gene&#xD;
      editing protocols, as well as better understand the inherent biology of HSPCs in patients&#xD;
      with hemoglobinopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers at St. Jude want to learn how to best manipulate HSPCs from hemoglobinopathy&#xD;
      patients with gene therapy and gene editing technologies to achieve optimal gene correction&#xD;
      and/or replacement, as well as optimal engraftment of 'corrected' HSPCs after&#xD;
      transplantation. St. Jude researchers also seek to test candidate drugs on SCD HSPCs that&#xD;
      might ameliorate the symptoms of SCD. Finally, St. Jude researchers seek to thoroughly&#xD;
      characterize the basic biology and function of HSPCs isolated from hemoglobinopathy patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow-containing bone samples that are typically discarded during orthopedic surgery&#xD;
      will be saved from hemoglobinopathy patients, as well as non- hemoglobinopathy patients,&#xD;
      undergoing these surgeries. These samples will be shipped to the St. Jude Hematology&#xD;
      Department for experimental research aimed at addressing the primary and secondary objectives&#xD;
      of this protocol.&#xD;
