  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with type 2 diabetes have too much sugar in their blood and need treatment to control&#xD;
      their sugar level. The 3 study compounds in this study are similar to an approved&#xD;
      antidiabetic medicine that helps to lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      This approved antidiabetic medicine is generally safe and well tolerated. The study compounds&#xD;
      are expected to have the same antidiabetic effect as the approved medicine. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate how quickly and to what extent each of the 3 study compounds are&#xD;
      broken down in the body (this is called pharmacokinetics). The dose of each study compound&#xD;
      will be very low (this is called a microdose), and will be labelled with a small amount of&#xD;
      carbon-14. This is radioactive, and it makes it possible to track the study compound in the&#xD;
      blood. The 3 study compounds in this study have not been given to humans before. The study&#xD;
      will be performed in up to 18 healthy male volunteers. The study will consist of 3 groups of&#xD;
      6 volunteers each. Each participant will receive only one dose of study medicine.&#xD;
