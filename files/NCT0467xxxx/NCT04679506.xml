      This study is a prospective, open, multiple -centered, sing-arm trial. The major aim of this&#xD;
      studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CLAE regimen (cladribine + cytarabine +&#xD;
      etoposide) in the treatment of relapsed/refractory T-ALL/LBL. The study will include 50&#xD;
      subjects to receive CLAE regimen for reinduction chemotherapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma according to World&#xD;
             Health Organization (WHO) criteria which has relapsed or is refractory to&#xD;
             chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The expected survival period is more than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one measurable nidus&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min using the cockcroft -Gault formula&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST, ALT, total bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) except for Gilbert's&#xD;
                  disease or when in the opinion of treating physician elevated levels are due to&#xD;
                  direct involvement of leukemia (e.g., hepatic infiltration or biliary obstruction&#xD;
                  due to leukemia), in which case ALT and AST may be elevated up to ≤ 5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to understand and willing to sign an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved&#xD;
             written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

          -  Previous treatment with nelarabine or clofarabine or fludarabine or cladribine was&#xD;
             ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received any other investigational agent or systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy within the&#xD;

             or unstable medical or surgical condition or any other condition that cannot be&#xD;
             well-controlled by the allowed medications permitted in the study protocol that would&#xD;
             preclude safe and complete study participation, as determined by medical history,&#xD;
             physical examinations, laboratory tests, and according to the investigator's judgment.&#xD;
