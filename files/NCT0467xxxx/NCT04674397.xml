      Most dialysis patients die from vascular disease, which is statistically associated with&#xD;
      changes related to chronic kidney disease associated mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD)3-9.&#xD;
      Understanding the mechanisms behind this high death rate is crucial to improving the length&#xD;
      and quality of life for patients with all grades of kidney disease, including those on&#xD;
      dialysis. This is a priority for patients and clinicians alike.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most humans with early CKD are asymptomatic and unaware that they have a problem with their&#xD;
      kidneys. Therefore they are unlikely to consult a doctor and early CKD is often unrecognised.&#xD;
      Patients who are aware of early CKD often have other co-morbidities including diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension and vascular disease which, in the setting of a clinical study, complicate the&#xD;
      identification of changes solely resulting from CKD. However over the past decade living&#xD;
      kidney donation has become increasingly common and is now the source of organs for more than&#xD;
      120 patients annually at Manchester's renal transplant centre. Prospective donors are&#xD;
      carefully examined and known to have normal kidney function without other co-morbidities.&#xD;
      They then undergo a planned unilateral nephrectomy and lose approximately 50% of their kidney&#xD;
      mass, creating an immediate state of moderate CKD. Over subsequent months the remaining&#xD;
      kidney will hypertrophy and partially correct this, although the mechanisms are unknown. In&#xD;
      the immediate post-operative period donors are inpatients on the kidney transplant ward and&#xD;
      have regular blood and urine tests meaning that careful study of metabolic processes during&#xD;
      their recovery is relatively easy by analysis of serial plasma and urine samples. Sequential&#xD;
      changes in the plasma and urine levels of different bone turnover markers and metabolites can&#xD;
      be analysed and will provide valuable new information to increase our understanding of the&#xD;
      initial stage of CKD-MBD development.&#xD;

      The likelihood of five year survival for a 60 year old dialysis patient (50%) is&#xD;
      significantly worse than for breast (88%), prostate (90%) or colon cancer sufferers (56%)1,&#xD;
      but robust information about the contributory risk-factors to inform clinician-patient&#xD;
      discussions is lacking2. Most dialysis patients die from vascular disease, which is&#xD;
      statistically associated with changes related to chronic kidney disease associated mineral&#xD;
      bone disorder (CKD-MBD)3-9. Understanding the mechanisms behind this high death rate is&#xD;
      crucial to improving the length and quality of life for patients with all grades of kidney&#xD;
      disease, including those on dialysis. This is a priority for patients and clinicians alike.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) statement highlighted the poor&#xD;
      level of understanding of the mechanisms of CKD-MBD in early and late kidney disease which&#xD;
      inhibits the development of targeted therapies to either halt the process or at least improve&#xD;
      outcomes10-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CKD confers certain atypical risk factors for mortality, most notably a state of disordered&#xD;
      mineral metabolism which is implicated in the development of hyperphosphataemia,&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism and vascular calcification. Despite the variety of biological&#xD;
      malfunctions attributed to CKD-MBD, the pathophysiology is not understood, partly because&#xD;
      there is no animal model of progressive CKD. Rodent models do not survive long enough for the&#xD;
      all changes of CKD-MBD to develop. Therefore current therapy is inadequate, and usually&#xD;
      deployed late in the course of CKD when the patient has progressed to end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease. Furthermore there is no reliable evidence that current therapies improve patient&#xD;
      outcome in terms of length or quality of life. The progression of CKD is not always linear&#xD;
      and less than 5% of patients proceed to end-stage renal disease. While aetiology of renal&#xD;
      impairment determines progression to some extent, there is no reliable means of determining&#xD;
      who will progress and who will not so that targeted study of early CKD-MBD pathogenesis is&#xD;
      not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most humans with early CKD are asymptomatic and unaware that they have a problem with their&#xD;
      kidneys. Therefore they are unlikely to consult a doctor and early CKD is often unrecognised.&#xD;
      Patients who are aware of early CKD often have other co-morbidities including diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension and vascular disease which, in the setting of a clinical study, complicate the&#xD;
      identification of changes solely resulting from CKD. However over the past decade living&#xD;
      kidney donation has become increasingly common and is now the source of organs for more than&#xD;
      120 patients annually at Manchester's renal transplant centre. Prospective donors are&#xD;
      carefully examined and known to have normal kidney function without other co-morbidities.&#xD;
