  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we aim to continuously and comprehensively measure the mental and physical&#xD;
      status of US Military Special Operation Forces (SOF) through a confidential and cybersecure&#xD;
      research mobile application (app) over a six-month period. In conjunction with data collected&#xD;
      via the mobile app, wearable sensors, such as the Apple Watch, will be used to continuously&#xD;
      collect physiologic (e.g. heart rate) and other data (e.g. activity, sleep). Additionally,&#xD;
      the app will have the capability of delivering helpful features, such as information and&#xD;
      activities to ideally support study subjects, mitigate degradation, and optimize performance.&#xD;
      The overall objective of the proposal is to investigate whether the app can contribute to&#xD;
      reducing overall warfighter degradation and if degradation can be predicted from daily&#xD;
      continuous measures of physical and mental behavior.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighters experience tremendous physical and mental strain&#xD;
      and degradation after returning from deployment and during training prior to deployment. This&#xD;
      degradation has been loosely linked to behavior termed &quot;red-line&quot; events, such as alcohol&#xD;
      abuse, suicide, and divorce, however there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation directly&#xD;
      linking &quot;red-line&quot; behavior to physical and mental degradation. To address this issue, a&#xD;
      program called Comprehensive Operator Readiness Assessment (cORA) was implemented for 3rd&#xD;
      SFG(A) Green Beret warfighters at Fort Bragg as a holistic one- day physical and mental&#xD;
      assessment to help identify and mitigate performance-degrading factors. However, due to the&#xD;
      in-person nature of the cORA assessment, the scalability of the program is limited.&#xD;
      Additionally, the current program only captures a snapshot of physical and mental status as&#xD;
      all the data is collected on one day. In this study, we aim to perform a research study where&#xD;
      we scale the cORA program by transforming it into a confidential, cybersecure research mobile&#xD;
      application (app), called Digital cORA, that will digitize the existing measures of the&#xD;
      program, as well as collect continuous measures of warfighter physical, neurocognitive (e.g.&#xD;
      spatial memory, working memory), psychological, and lifestyle factors over a six-month&#xD;
      period. In conjunction with data collected via the mobile app, wearable sensors will be used&#xD;
      to collect physiologic (e.g. heart rate) and other data (e.g. activity, sleep), continuously&#xD;
      during their approximately six-month study participation. In addition to collecting data, and&#xD;
      similar to the in-person program, the app will have the capability of delivering helpful&#xD;
      features, such as information and activities around nutrition, meditation and mindfulness&#xD;
      features to best support warfighters, mitigate degradation, and optimize performance. The&#xD;
      overall objective of the proposal is to investigate whether a digital version of the&#xD;
      in-person cORA program can be created to reduce &quot;red-line&quot; behavioral events (e.g. injury,&#xD;
      suicide, divorce, DUI, etc.) specifically, or overall warfighter degradation more generally,&#xD;
      can be predicted from daily continuous measures of physical and mental behavior. We will&#xD;
      recruit the following: 1) 250 warfighters from 3rd Special Forces Group (SFG(A)) (Fort Bragg,&#xD;
      NC) and 2) 250 warfighters from 1st Recon Battalion (Camp Pendleton, CA). These are both&#xD;
      elite military warfighting groups. 3rd SFG(A) will be enrolled within 3months of returning&#xD;
      from deployment (e.g. the Red Cycle), while Reconnaissance Marines will be enrolled up to 6&#xD;
      months prior to deployment during combat training (e.g. individual and unit training phases&#xD;
      (ITP/UTP)). The research will allow collection of a comprehensive dataset of continuous&#xD;
      physical and mental factors that can be tied to behavioral outcomes, particularly &quot;red-line&quot;&#xD;
      events. We will analyze the data with traditional descriptive statistics to understand the&#xD;
      structure of the data. We will then analyze the relationship between the various types of&#xD;
      data and self-reported red-line events or general behavioral wellbeing/degradation using&#xD;
      correlations and multiple regression analyses where appropriate. We will use the&#xD;
      multi-faceted and continuous data from the study as a training data set to develop a novel&#xD;
      machine-learning algorithm. Therefore, we will extract novel behavioral features from the&#xD;
      actively and passively created data from the app.&#xD;
