      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab plus Apatinib&#xD;

      This trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Camrelizumab plus Apatinib in&#xD;
      participants with advanced non-squamous NSCLC previously treated with first-line&#xD;
      immunotherapy. The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the Camrelizumab&#xD;
      plus Apatinib improves progression-free survival (PFS) . All the efficacy and safety are&#xD;
      assessed by investigator : 1) response rate (ORR), 2) duration of response(DoR), 3) overall&#xD;
      survival(OS), 4) disease control rate (DCR); the safety and quality of life assessment&#xD;
      Explore objective is potential biomarker associated with efficacy.&#xD;
