  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fixed-dose combination product Budesonide/Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation&#xD;
      Aerosol, BGF pMDI and dual combination product Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation&#xD;
      Aerosol , GFF pMDI are developed for maintenance treatment for patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are still some unmet medical needs and evidence gaps in COPD therapy, such as could BGF&#xD;
      Inhalation Aerosphere reverse the disease progression such like airway-remodelling? Could BGF&#xD;
      Inhalation Aerosphere reduce inflammation in small airways? Before differences proven between&#xD;
      medication groups, pilot study is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 52 weeks, Single-center, prospective, interventional pilot study could help discovering&#xD;
      intervention effect of BGF and GFF on small airways through OCT measurement, which would show&#xD;
      outcome of AEROSPHERE™ Delivery Technology on COPD patients.&#xD;

      The subjects eligible for this study will receive a 52-week of BGF or GFF treatment, and a 30&#xD;
      days follow-up telephone call after the last study drug dose.&#xD;
