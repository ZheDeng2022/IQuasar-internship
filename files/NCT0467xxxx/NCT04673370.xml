    <textblock>
      There is growing interest in mind-body therapy that could potentially improve patients'&#xD;
      psychological health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ba Duan Jin, a traditional Chinese health-preserving technique, combines techniques&#xD;
      regulating body, breath and spirit. The effects of Ba Duan Jin on patients with symptoms of&#xD;
      depression and anxiety are yet to be further investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present pilot clinical study aims to apply Ba Duan Jin to patients with symptoms of&#xD;
      depression and anxiety, and to evaluate the psychological effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants allocated to the Health Education Group take part in the 16-week health&#xD;
      education including work, rest, diet and other basic programs according to the different&#xD;
      conditions of participants. Participants allocated to the Ba Duan Jin Group take part in the&#xD;
      16-week Ba Duan Jin plus health education program. The study plans to enroll 60 participants&#xD;
      (30 for Ba Duan Jin plus health education program, and 30 for health education program),&#xD;
      expecting that Ba Duan Jin has a better effect on improving psychological condition.&#xD;
