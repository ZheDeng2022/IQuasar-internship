  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following preliminary studies carried out in our department on these subject and subjective&#xD;
      findings during clinical examinations, it has been shown that pain is a symptom that is&#xD;
      rarely reported following treatment. Instead, neurosensory disorders such as hypoesthesia and&#xD;
      paresthesia are found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to map and qualitatively evaluate neurosensory disorders in&#xD;
      patients treated for cancers of the oral cavity and oropharynx.&#xD;

      The protocol, which is done during the usual follow-up consultation of the patient by the&#xD;
      maxillo-facial surgeon, is divided into 3 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Verification of inclusion and non-inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General patient history:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ongoing Treatments&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Histological type&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Search for risk factors for peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check for symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 2: Collecting Treatment Data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Operating data:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Operation date&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Type of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Severed sensory nerves&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Perioperative complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the way out:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adjuvant treatment including radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exit analgesic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  EN (Numerical Scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 3: Collection of data related to neurosensory disorders and pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analgesics consumed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire DN4 for each operated area separated according to the curage, lumpectomy&#xD;
           and reconstruction if they take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If DN4 positive, completion of the QCD and QEDN questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination for sensory disturbances reported on a chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Generic quality of life questionnaire adapted to cancer pathology EORTC QLQC30 and its&#xD;
           specific Head and Neck35 add-on module adapted to head and neck cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thermotest and hot water, cold water (for the oral cavity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HADS Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catastrophe Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative sensory testing (QST) for neuropathic patients :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical neurosensory disorders will be tested with the Von frey filament and the brush.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypoesthesia or mechanical anaesthesia will be sought with the Von Frey filament and the&#xD;
           brush.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mechanical hypersensitivity, a painful sensation exacerbated by a sharp, non-traumatic&#xD;
           object, will be sought with a large calibre Von Frey filament.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Static Allodynia, felt painful on contact, will be sought at Von Frey's filament.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dynamic Allodynia, felt painful when rubbed, will be sought with a wide brush (8 mm)&#xD;
           over a distance of several centimetres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermal neurosensory disorders will be sought for the skin with the Thermotest and at the&#xD;
      level of the oral cavity with the application of standardised test tubes containing water at&#xD;
      4째C stored in the fridge or hot water at 63째C (the protocol consists of heating water at 4째C&#xD;
      in the microwave for 30 seconds to obtain the temperature of 63째C); these examinations will&#xD;
      allow the evaluation of thermal allodynia and hypoesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examination will cover the entire face, the oral cavity, the cervical region and the area&#xD;
      where the reconstruction flaps are taken. The pathological areas identified will be delimited&#xD;
      on diagrams previously made with a coding according to the sensations collected.&#xD;
