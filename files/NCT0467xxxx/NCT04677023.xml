  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with compound posterior proximal cavities, will the use of organically modified&#xD;
      ceramic resin composite restorative material have similar clinical performance to&#xD;
      conventional bulk fill resin composite, evaluation of restorations will be done at&#xD;
      baseline,six and twelve months using World Dental Federation FDI criteria.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted in the clinic of Conservative Dentistry Department, Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Cairo University; the operator in charge Safinaz Hussien ,The subjects fulfilling&#xD;
      the eligibility criteria of the trial will be selected from the regular attendees at the&#xD;
      clinic of Conservative Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.Patient&#xD;
      examination will be done including medical history, dental history, extra-oral examination&#xD;
      and intra-oral examination. A periapical radiograph will be taken prior to restorative&#xD;
      procedures to assess the degree of approximation of caries to pulp, intactness of lamina dura&#xD;
      and/or presence of any periapical radiolucency to exclude the case.The field of operation&#xD;
      will be isolated with the application of a rubber dam if possible. Otherwise, cotton rolls&#xD;
      and the saliva ejector will be used for moisture control. For cavity preparation, local&#xD;
      anesthetic (Mepecaine-L, Alexandria Company, Egypt) solution will be administrated to control&#xD;
      patient discomfort during the procedure.The cavities will be prepared by using cylindrical&#xD;
      #314 (Komet®, Germany) in a high speed handpiece (Sirona, Germany) rotating at high speed&#xD;
      with copious coolant. Remaining soft caries -if present- will be removed using sharp&#xD;
      excavator (Maillefer, Dentsuply, Switzerland).After the cavity preparation is finished, it&#xD;
      will be thoroughly air-water cleaned. The bonding system; FuturabondU(Voco, Germany) will be&#xD;
      applied according to the following instructions recommended by the manufacturer: Futurabond&#xD;
      M+ will be applied to prepared tooth structure and cured for 20 seconds using Elipar™ S10 LED&#xD;
      curing light (3M ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA) with light intensity of 1200 mW/cm2. The prepared&#xD;
      cavities will be restored with Admira fusion X--tra® bulk (VOCO, Cuxhaven in layers that are&#xD;
      a maximum of 4 mm thick then cured for 20 seconds using usingElipar™ S10 LED curing light (3M&#xD;
      ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA) with light intensity of 1200 mW/cm2. and for the control group&#xD;
      cavities will be restored with GrandioSO x-tra(VOCO, Cuxhaven) in layers that are a maximum&#xD;
      of 4 mm thick then cured for 20 seconds using usingElipar™ S10 LED curing light (3M ESPE, St&#xD;
      Paul, MN, USA) with light intensity of 1200 mW/cm2.&#xD;

    <description>The special ORMOCER® compound molecules in Admira Fusion x-tra reduce the volume shrinkage to an extremely low level (1.25 % by volume) in conjunction with very low shrinkage stress (3.87 MPa). Admira Fusion x-tra is the bulk fill version of Admira Fusion. This means that this restorative material can be applied in layers of up to 4 mm and then reliably cured. This makes placing posterior restorations particularly quick and economical. The universal shade U further simplifies handling, as it provides aesthetic results by adapting, chameleon-like, to the surrounding dental substance</description>

    <description>a nano-hybrid composite which is in a class of its own. It is distinguished by outstanding handling and excellent physical properties, modelled on the natural tooth.its the packable bulk fill material for the highest standards in durability and aesthetics.GrandioSO x-tra has outstanding surface hardness, at 223 MHV, which is closer to natural tooth enamel, compared with other bulk fill composites. Because of this, GrandioSO x-tra ensures restorations which are abrasionresistant and dimensionally stable over the long term. In addition to the surface hardness, reliable curing is very important when larger increments are used. Here as well, GrandioSO x-tra achieves an outstanding result and, at the 219 MHV measured at a depth of 4 mm, it even significantly exceeds the values measured for other bulk fill composites at the surface.</description>
