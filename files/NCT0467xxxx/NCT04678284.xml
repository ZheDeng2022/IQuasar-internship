      This single-arm trial of the Diabetes Homeless Medication Support intervention alone (n=15)&#xD;
      will test the perception and feasibility of anticipated study procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is part 2 of a set of studies with an overall goal to develop and pilot test a&#xD;
      collaborative care intervention using motivational interviewing and behavioral activation&#xD;
      alongside education and psychosocial support to improve medication adherence tailored to the&#xD;
      experiences of people experiencing homelessness and diabetes (DH). Our team's central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that medication adherence and diabetes self-care (and eventual glycemic&#xD;
      control, health care use/cost) will improve with an intervention tailored to the unique&#xD;
      context of DH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work builds upon part 1 during which we completed Aim 1 activities to develop the&#xD;
      initial Diabetes Homeless Medication Support (D-Homes) treatment manual through focus groups&#xD;
      with DH at various levels of glycemic control and interviews with their multi-disciplinary&#xD;
      providers. Data from this phase has identified barriers and strategies for medication&#xD;
      adherence, patient values regarding medication, and treatment preferences and informed&#xD;
      development of this part 2 application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol addresses Aim 2, to test patient perceptions of the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of study procedures and refine the D-Homes treatment manual through test cases&#xD;
      (n=15). With a hypothesis that the D-Homes manual and study procedures will be feasible and&#xD;
      acceptable to DH as measured by self-report and post-treatment interview.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This will be an in-person, phone, or video based behavioral intervention. It will involve a diabetes wellness coach assisting participants to set goals related to diabetes self-care and co-morbidities or social conditions that get in the way of diabetes self-care. There will be encouragement to work on diabetes medication adherence and to address any un/under-treated behavioral health conditions.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>There will be 10 sessions offered within 12 weeks to participants. Sessions will last 30-60 minutes. During sessions a diabetes wellness coach will use behavioral activation and motivational interviewing to get to know participants and set goals to improve diabetes care. The coach will encourage a focus on medication adherence behaviors to the extent that participants are willing. The coach will also help with resource and care coordination. The coach will also provide brief diabetes education as needed.</description>
