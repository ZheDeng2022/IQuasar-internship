  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose escalation and expansion study. During the study,&#xD;
      subjects will be evaluated for safety, toxicity, tolerability, PK/PD, immunogenicity,&#xD;
      biomarkers, and antitumor activity of HB0025. The phase I study will enroll up to 78 subjects&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors who have progressed on or after standard of care therapy and for&#xD;
      whom there is no further treatment available that in the judgement of the patient's physician&#xD;
      would be beneficial. One cycle is defined as 28 days.&#xD;
