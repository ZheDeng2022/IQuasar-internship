  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this enabling study are to characterize the wheal and flare responses over&#xD;
      time following skin challenges with ascending concentrations of Substance P. This will be a&#xD;
      2-part study: Part 1 will aid in the understanding of the wheal and flare responses following&#xD;
      Substance P. Part 2 will investigate the variability of the responses. Participants may be&#xD;
      enrolled into Part 1 or Part 2, not both.&#xD;
