  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of the IS-free Treg-cell&#xD;
      graft-engineered haplo transplant method in people with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) and/or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) receiving a haploidentical donor&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation-Total Myeloid and Lymphoid Irradiation (TMLI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy (Fludarabine, Thiotepa, Cyclophosphamide plus Mesna)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infusion of haplo Treg-enriched donor cells (experimental therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infusion of unmodified haplo donor T cells (includes cancer-fighting T effector cells)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infusion of haplo donor CD34+ Peripheral Blood Stem Cells&#xD;

      This study is assessing whether the IS-free Treg-cell graft-engineered haplo HSCT) approach&#xD;
      will reduce risk of relapse while preventing usual toxicities related to stem cell&#xD;
      transplants (e.g., graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD)). GVHD is a complication of&#xD;
      transplantation where the T cells (a type of white blood cell that helps protect the body&#xD;
      from relapse by killing cancer cells) in the donor graft attack and damage some of the host&#xD;
      tissues. Patients who receive an allogeneic (using another person as the donor) hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplant (HSCT) may develop graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) toxicity and are&#xD;
      also at risk of disease relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the study intervention Treg-enriched donor cells and will then be&#xD;
      followed for 1 year after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 10 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dana-Farber Cancer Institute research funds along with charitable donations are supporting&#xD;
      this research study. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a pharmaceutical company) is also&#xD;
      supporting this research study by providing funding and support for correlative laboratory&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically-confirmed disease in the prior 4 weeks, despite at least 1 prior line&#xD;
             of therapy (e.g., 3+7 chemotherapy, HMA therapy): Rel/ref AML (de novo or secondary)&#xD;
             with ≥5% blasts in BM (or extramedullary sites); MDS EB-2 (BM &gt;10% blasts, PB 5-19%&#xD;
             blasts).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Available haploidentical HLA-matched (-A, -B, -C, -DRB1) related donor aged 18-65&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 to 65 years. Older patients are not candidates for myeloablative HCT. Because&#xD;
             no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of IS-free haploHCT&#xD;
             in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be&#xD;
             eligible for future pediatric trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60, see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pulmonary Function: FEV1, FVC and DLCO ≥ 60% of predicted (corrected for&#xD;
                  hemoglobin)&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Hepatic: Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits (exception permitted&#xD;
                  in Gilbert's Syndrome after discussion with study PI, on a case by case basis);&#xD;
                  and AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt;2x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Renal: Serum Creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine&#xD;
                  clearance &gt; 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 (see Appendix B) for participants with creatinine&#xD;
                  levels above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of IS-free haploHCT on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason and because radiation and chemotherapeutic agents are known to be teratogenic,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and a minimum of 4 months after completion of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks (4&#xD;
             weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study. Use of&#xD;
             hydroxyurea, HMA, e.g., azacytidine, decitabine) and/or FDA-approved novel targeted&#xD;
             agents (e.g., venetoclax, FLT-3 inhibitors, IDH 1/2 inhibitors) are permitted up to&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer&#xD;
             therapy (i.e., have residual non-hematologic toxicities &gt; Grade 1) with exception of&#xD;
             alopecia, unless cleared by study PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who received Mylotarg or other therapies associated with increased risk&#xD;
             of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) or have known prior or active VOD. All novel&#xD;
             therapies will be reviewed with PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents within 21 days (or 5&#xD;
             halflives) prior to study entry, whichever is longer, unless cleared by the study PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with extramedullary disease at immune privileged sites (e.g., CNS,&#xD;
             testes, eye) are excluded, as these sites are less susceptible to the curative graft&#xD;
             vs. leukemia effect of HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myocardial infarction within 2 years prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Venous thromboembolic event (VTE) of DVT/ PE within 1 year prior to enrollment.&#xD;
             Patients with line-associated DVT within the past year may be enrolled if they have&#xD;
             completed anticoagulation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 1 year prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of bleeding peptic ulcer disease, erosive gastritis, intestinal perforation or&#xD;
             clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage or hemoptysis within the prior&#xD;
             6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) or hemolytic uremic&#xD;
             syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (HUS/TTP).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of life-threatening reactions to iron infusions or murine antibody-containing&#xD;
             products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known donor-specific antibodies (DSA) in the recipient of clinical significance (e.g.,&#xD;
             requiring DSA depletion with plasmapheresis, rituximab) are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to withhold agents that may interact with hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes&#xD;
             involved in cyclophosphamide and/or thiotepa metabolism (see Section 5.5) during day -&#xD;
             10 through day -5. It is acceptable use alternative non-interacting medications during&#xD;
             this period, and then restart prior medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infections (i.e., currently&#xD;
             taking medications with progression of clinical symptoms or signs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recipients of prior allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation, or&#xD;
             solid organ transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation exposure or other medical condition (e.g., Fanconi syndrome) that&#xD;
             precludes use of myeloablative radiation (TMLI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with the multiple agents used&#xD;
             routinely in myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In addition, these&#xD;
             individuals are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral&#xD;
        therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants seropositive for hepatitis B or C infection are ineligible as they are at&#xD;
             high risk of lethal treatment-related hepatotoxicity after myeloablative HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance&#xD;
             with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because radiation and conditioning&#xD;
             chemotherapy has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. A negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test is required for females of childbearing potential. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with IS-free haploHCT breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;
             the mother is treated with IS-free haploHCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of another non-hematologic malignancy are ineligible&#xD;
             except for the following circumstances: Individuals with a history of other&#xD;
             malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are&#xD;
             deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy.&#xD;
             Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within&#xD;
             the past 5 years: cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
             of the skin.&#xD;
