  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare plasma and urine pharmacokinetic (PK)parameters of&#xD;
      MK-3402 between participants with impaired renal function and healthy control participants,&#xD;
      to investigate the extent to which MK-3402 is removed from the plasma by hemodialysis (HD),&#xD;
      and evaluate the safety and tolerability of MK-3402 in participants with impaired renal&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
