      The main objective of the clinical trial is to determine if modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX)&#xD;
      alternated with biweekly Gemcitabine plus Nab-Paclitaxel (mGnabP) administered as a combined,&#xD;
      front-line therapy will result in longer time to treatment failure (TTF) compared to the&#xD;
      current standard of care with mFFX alone in treatment-naive patients with metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine whether mFFX and mGnabP administered as a combined, alternating, front-line&#xD;
           therapy can provide longer first line treatment for patients with metastatic pancreatic&#xD;
           cancer, with the primary metric of time to treatment failure (TTF), including&#xD;
           progression of disease (PD), death or treatment discontinuation due to toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Primary endpoint: TTF (treatment discontinuation due to toxicity, disease progression,&#xD;
           or death).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) To determine objective response rate (ORR) of the regimen. 2) To determine&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) rate of the regimen. 3) To determine overall survival (OS)&#xD;
      rate of the regimen. 4) To assess biomarker response (CA-19.9) to the regimen. 5) To examine&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of the new regimen. 6) To examine health-related quality of life in&#xD;
      patients receiving this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ORR as determined by the proportion of subjects with either complete response (CR) or&#xD;
           partial response (PR), as defined by RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PFS as determined by the time interval from the date of first dose of study regimen to&#xD;
           first documented PD or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Overall survival (OS) as defined as the time interval from the date of the first dose of&#xD;
           study regimen to date of death from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Biomarker response, measured by serum CA 19-9 levels every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Safety and tolerability of the mFFX alternating with mGnabP regimen; Grade 3 and 4&#xD;
           toxicities will be assessed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
           (CTCAE) v5.0. Follow up for toxicity will be recorded for the first 30 days following&#xD;
           the last chemotherapy cycle, and any long-term toxicity will be followed for up to 2&#xD;
           years after completion of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the tumor molecular profile prior to initiation of chemotherapy and&#xD;
           correlate with treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To analyze ct-DNA as a biomarker of response to therapy and early detection of disease&#xD;
           progression.&#xD;
