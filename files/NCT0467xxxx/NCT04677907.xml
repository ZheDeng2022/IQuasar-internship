    <textblock>
      To compare the differences, if any, in clinical outcome, patient satisfaction and&#xD;
      survivorship between cemented and uncemented Total Knee Replacements (TKR)? To investigate if&#xD;
      there are health economic implications of using uncemented TKRs in the NHS?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to undertake a randomised controlled trial comparing Trabecular&#xD;
      metal uncemented TKR with cemented TKR. The primary aim will be to determine whether there is&#xD;
      a clinically significant difference in outcome between cemented and uncemented knee&#xD;
      prosthesis over a 10-year period. The investigators will assess the patient's functional&#xD;
      ability using two clinical knee scores the New Knee Society Score (NKSS) and Oxford knee&#xD;
      score (OKS). In addition to employing these two standard clinical scores, the investigators&#xD;
      will also utilise the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS). The FJS differentiates patients' awareness&#xD;
      of the participant's artificial joint which is an important concept in knee arthroplasty. In&#xD;
      contrast to hip arthroplasty where the majority of patients are unaware of their joint after&#xD;
      surgery, knee arthroplasty patients rarely 'forget' that their joint is artificial. Given the&#xD;
      difference in physical properties of trabecular metal and standard implants, the FJS scoring&#xD;
      system may highlight potential differences that are important to patients and linked to&#xD;
      patient satisfaction. Non-subjective assessment will be performed using Inertial Measuring&#xD;
      Units (IMU), which measure the relative position of limbs in space and is a useful measure&#xD;
      for clinical movement analysis. Participants will be asked to perform daily task such as&#xD;
      walking, standing from a chair and walking up and down stairs, wearing the IMU, before and&#xD;
      after surgery. This allows us to see functional improvements after surgery and if there are&#xD;
      functional differences between the cemented and uncemented implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation and radiological assessment will be carried out over a 10-year period&#xD;
      recording complications and clinical performance of patients and implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to carrying out a clinical evaluation of the trabecular metal uncemented knee and&#xD;
      cemented knee systems, the investigators will also undertake a health economic assessment of&#xD;
      the benefits of using uncemented trabecular metal prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most expensive resources in a hospital theatre environment are the surgeon and&#xD;
      anaesthetist and maximising their utilisation is essential. The removal of cement mixing and&#xD;
      curing time from a TKR offers a potential time saving during the operation. However, the time&#xD;
      saved using an uncemented prosthesis during a single operation is unlikely, in isolation, to&#xD;
      be sufficient to allow additional clinical activity to be carried out. Nevertheless, by&#xD;
      combining multiple uncemented knee replacement operations in a single theatre session it may&#xD;
      be possible to save sufficient time during the entire day to facilitate an additional&#xD;
      surgical procedure, thus increasing the utilisation of surgeons, anaesthetists and theatre&#xD;
      staff. If this were achievable, it would add significant value for health care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the success of knee arthroplasty 18% of patients are dissatisfied with their outcome&#xD;
      [16]. These are an important group of patients and understanding better the issues that these&#xD;
      patients encounter is key in achieving better satisfaction rates and ensuring appropriate use&#xD;
      of Orthopaedic implants. The investigators will therefore also study patient factors such as&#xD;
      depression and ability to deal with pain/discomfort and correlate these with post-surgical&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trabecular metal uncemented implants potentially offer benefits to both patient and surgeon&#xD;
      but as yet there is insufficient data available to support widespread use of this product. It&#xD;
      is the investigators belief that uncemented knees are underutilised by surgeons because there&#xD;
      are a number of areas of concern which have not been adequately addressed in clinical&#xD;
      studies. The investigators hope to address these concerns in this study.&#xD;
