  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treated head and neck cancer patients are subject to tissue swelling and scarring, known as&#xD;
      lymphedema and fibrosis (LEF). LEF in the head and neck cancer patient occurs in up to 90% of&#xD;
      treated patients and is associated with inflammation cells. Aerobic exercise is known to&#xD;
      mediate these same inflammatory cells in an anti-inflammatory manner due to chronic&#xD;
      adaptation of the cells. The investigators are therefore proposing a prescription exercise&#xD;
      study for head and neck cancer patients. This study's primary aim is feasibility and safety&#xD;
      of the aerobic exercise prescription. Feasibility of gathering study participant inflammation&#xD;
      markers, visible LEF, and patient LEF symptoms will be a secondary aim of the study. Patient&#xD;
      will be asked to journal their experience for a qualitative analysis. The prescription&#xD;
      aerobic exercise is that of high intensity interval exercise, since this form of exercise can&#xD;
      achieve similar or better results to moderate exercise with less time and patient burden.&#xD;
      Each exercise session will take place on a cycle ergometer, will be 5 minutes warm up, 5&#xD;
      minutes cool down, and 20 minutes of exercise (1 minute intervals alternated by 1 minute&#xD;
      rests x 10 each).&#xD;

      Treated head and neck cancer patients are subject to tissue swelling and scarring, known as&#xD;
      lymphedema and fibrosis (LEF). LEF in the head and neck cancer patient occurs in up to 90% of&#xD;
      treated patients, is associated with inflammation cells. Aerobic exercise is known to mediate&#xD;
      these same inflammatory cells in an anti-inflammatory manner due to chronic adaptation of the&#xD;
      cells. The investigators are therefore proposing a prescription exercise study for head and&#xD;
      neck cancer patients. This study's primary aim is feasibility and safety. Feasibility of&#xD;
      gathering study participant inflammation markers, visible LEF, and patient LEF symptoms will&#xD;
      be a secondary aim of the study. Patient will be asked to journal their experience for a&#xD;
      qualitative analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the evidence, the aerobic exercise prescription for those who provide informed&#xD;
      consent will consist of 10 intervals of intensity, and 10 intervals at rest. Each interval of&#xD;
      intensity will be 1 minutes long and each rest period will be 1 minute long, and there will&#xD;
      be a five-minute warm-up and five-minute cool down of easy pedaling for a total of 30&#xD;
      minutes. Participants will complete two sessions per week, and there will be at least one&#xD;
      business day in between each session, for a total of 10 total exercise sessions. The total&#xD;
      study duration will be less than 35 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supervised prescribed HIIE intervention will be performed on a stationary cycle&#xD;
      ergometer. A cycle ergometer is preferred for safety reasons since it requires less gross&#xD;
      motor coordination than might be required with a treadmill. To assist in establishing safety&#xD;
      (primary aim), the study participants heart rate will be continually monitored by a clinician&#xD;
      during the exercise, guiding them to keep their heart rate within their specifically&#xD;
      calculated 80-95% of their maximum HR during the periods of intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare outcomes at baseline with outcomes at the end of the 5-week&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
