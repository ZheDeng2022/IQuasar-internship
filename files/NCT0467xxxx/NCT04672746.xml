    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial with an allocation ratio 1:1,&#xD;
      by comparing the 12-month drug abuse reduction between the youth drug abusers who are&#xD;
      individually randomized to participate in the intervention group receiving medical&#xD;
      peer-delivered intervention of interactive brief motivational interviewing via instant&#xD;
      messaging communication and those in the control group receiving general health information.&#xD;

      Introduction Drug abuse is a worldwide problem especially among youth. Due to easy access to&#xD;
      a wide range of illicit drugs via multiple approaches in Hong Kong, growing drug abuse is&#xD;
      exposing and spreading among the youth. According to the Central Registry of Drug Abuse&#xD;
      Report in Hong Kong, 87.3% of drug abusers reported the first abuse of drugs at ages of 25 or&#xD;
      below. The comparison of the Central Registry of Drug Abuse between 2014/15 and 2017/18&#xD;
      showed that the number of students claiming to have used drugs has gone up by 23 percent&#xD;
      compared to the last survey, and 81% of them started to use drugs at an age younger than&#xD;
      15-year. The early age of first drug use is strongly associated with the risk of developing a&#xD;
      substance use disorder in later life. Youth who persistently abuse substances often&#xD;
      experience an array of problems, including academic difficulties, health-related problems&#xD;
      (including mental health), poor peer relationships, risky sexual behavior, the likelihood of&#xD;
      having blood-borne diseases, and involvement with the juvenile justice system. Additionally,&#xD;
      there are harmful consequences for family members, the community, and the entire society. The&#xD;
      statistics above alarm that youth drug abuse in Hong Kong is becoming a major problem and can&#xD;
      not be overlooked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of medical treatment and counselling is the most common treatment for drug&#xD;
      abusers. However, more than half of the youth drug abusers reported never attempting to quit,&#xD;
      only 12.2% of youth drug abusers attempted to seek help, and more than 75% did not accept&#xD;
      medical treatment as they did not think they were addicted. Although many non-pharmaceutical&#xD;
      interventions have been applied, a meta-analysis found that the existing non-pharmaceutical&#xD;
      interventions showed insignificant effectiveness in helping youth drug abusers to change&#xD;
      their behaviour. One of the major reasons for the failure to assist youth drug abusers to&#xD;
      change was that the patient education method may lead the youth abusers resistant to accept&#xD;
      the intervention. Previous research has confirmed that the recovery from drug abuse is&#xD;
      influenced by the users' intention to change, which is determined directly by their&#xD;
      perceptions of anti-drug and their perceived self-efficacy to change. While, drug-abusers'&#xD;
      attitudes, social influences, and demographic characteristics have more indirect effects on&#xD;
      recovery from drug abuse. Another reason may be that standard interventional content may not&#xD;
      be able to meet the personal needs of drug abusers. In addition, the meta-analysis also&#xD;
      showed that individual interventions with more than one session had a stronger effect, while&#xD;
      previous brief interventions provided insufficient sessions to support the behavior changes&#xD;
      among youth abusers. In addition, according to qualitative interviews conducted for youth&#xD;
      drug abusers, adolescents were reluctant to seek help from sources that they believed would&#xD;
      be judgmental, lacked expertise, personal information exposed or would inform their parents.&#xD;
      Given that, more feasible, individualized, and effective non-pharmaceutical interventions&#xD;
      should be developed and evaluated to help this youth population to change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conceptual framework Medical peer-delivered counselling Comparing with general counselors,&#xD;
      the use of peer counselors can increase the appeal of addiction services to youth and young&#xD;
      adult users. Since most young people are not eligible to hold positions of power in their&#xD;
      society, they find themselves, subject to authority. Such powers differential made&#xD;
      communication between adults and youth difficult. When one is trying to engage the youth in&#xD;
      drug abuse reduction initiatives, this power differential manifests itself also as a&#xD;
      knowledge gap. Comparing with adults, the equality in power status between the youth makes&#xD;
      peer-delivered risk communication successful. However, Addiction counseling on drug abuse is&#xD;
      more complex compared with smoking cessation or alcohol and requires more professionalism.&#xD;
      With the advantages of similar age and capability to better master related knowledge and&#xD;
      counseling skills, peers with a medical background can address youths' concerns relevant to&#xD;
      their experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instant messaging Given the ubiquity of mobile technology among youth, and the considerable&#xD;
      logistical barriers to face-to-face-based care, instant messaging (IM) via mobile&#xD;
      applications such as WhatsApp or WeChat is increasingly used as a new strategy for health&#xD;
      promotion and to enhance treatment compliance. As reported in the previous study,&#xD;
      drug-abusing clients prefer to use online counseling as it was less confronting to&#xD;
      traditional forms of counseling by providing a private and emotionally safe environment.&#xD;
      Therefore, the interaction via smart phone apps encourages those who are reluctant to get&#xD;
      help face-to-face to seek direct anti-drug advice. In addition, another advantage of using&#xD;
      instant messaging is to offer quick, real-time interactions, thus delivering continuous&#xD;
      professional advice and personalised support to drug abusers to help them overcome withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Motivational Interviewing Motivational interviewing (MI) was originally developed in&#xD;
      the field of alcohol abuse and found to be transferable to other health-related behaviors.&#xD;
      Differing from prevailing patient education methods, MI is a directive, client-centered&#xD;
      counselling strategy that encourages clients to explore and resolve their ambivalence and&#xD;
      promotes their confidence in their ability to change their behaviour. Brief MI, with the&#xD;
      advantage of manpower saving, shares the same core as MI that individuals are advocates to&#xD;
      initiate and continue behavioural change, and yet often in a state of ambivalence with&#xD;
      fluctuating motivations before the behavioural change. Brief MI emphasizes adopting shorter&#xD;
      and simpler strategies, which include opening strategy, a typical day, the good things and&#xD;
      the less good things, providing information, the future and the present, exploring concerns,&#xD;
      and helping with decision-making. By using these specific techniques in the dynamic and&#xD;
      interactive process, brief MI explore and resolve the ambivalence, develop discrepancies&#xD;
      between individuals' core belief and the behaviour of not engaging in desirable&#xD;
      health-related lifestyle practice, consequently enhancing the confidence and motivation in&#xD;
      the behavioural change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incorporating of Medical peer counselling, instant messaging, and brief MI in promoting drug&#xD;
      abuse reduction among youth In combination, the medical peer-delivered intervention via&#xD;
      instant messaging interaction may be more effective in helping drug-abusing youth to&#xD;
      eliminate or reduce the fear of personal information exposure, the unknown to expect from the&#xD;
      treatment, and the whole lifestyle change, and worries about withdrawal symptoms. This&#xD;
      approach has the potential to increase the help-seeking behavior and intention to quit among&#xD;
      youth drug abusers who reluctant to seek help from services requiring real-name registration.&#xD;
      By using the brief MI strategies, youth drug abusers can be guided to attempt behaviour&#xD;
      change step by step, and subsequently, could abstain from drugs with assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated above, the proposed intervention may be feasible and own potentially effective in&#xD;
      reducing drug abuse among youth. However, according to our literature search, there is a&#xD;
      paucity of studies exploring its effectiveness. Given that, this study aims to conduct a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to inform the effectiveness of a medical peer-delivered&#xD;
      intervention of interactive brief motivational interviewing via instant messaging&#xD;
      communication in reducing drug abuse among youth in Hong Kong&#xD;
