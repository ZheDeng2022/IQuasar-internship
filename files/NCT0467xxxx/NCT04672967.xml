  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial tests the hypothesis that certain blood metabolite levels can be&#xD;
      used to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The study cohort will consist of 200&#xD;
      participants between the ages 18 and 60 months who have been referred to a developmental&#xD;
      pediatric center for clinical evaluation of ASD or other developmental delay. Two selected&#xD;
      sites will enroll 75 participants each with another 50 typically developing participants.&#xD;
      Participants will receive a physical exam (including a dysmorphology evaluation), ADOS, VABS,&#xD;
      MSEL, DSM-5, and M-CHAT assessments, and receive a diagnosis. A fasting blood draw is&#xD;
      required, consisting of 2 mL vacutainer tubes (max 4 mL). Sites must process blood according&#xD;
      to sponsor requirements (outlined in the Sponsor's Laboratory Manual). Certain metabolite&#xD;
      levels in the blood will be used for diagnostic screening test development.&#xD;

      The primary objective is to conduct a double-blind, proof-of-concept, two-site, prospective&#xD;
      study of 200 children aged 18-60 months that have been referred for an ASD evaluation by a&#xD;
      physician to assess the feasibility of a blood test that measures a set of blood plasma&#xD;
      metabolites and the classification algorithm developed thereof to predict the risk of ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to collect additional information for sub-classification of&#xD;
      participant cohorts including Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) and Mullen Scale of&#xD;
      Early Learning (MSEL) as well as any comorbidities that may correlate with blood test scores.&#xD;

    <measure>Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (At study entry (one time evaluation))</time_frame>
    <description>The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) is considered a gold-standard instrument for diagnosing and assessing autism with good diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in young children (37). The ADOS consists of a series of structured and semi-structured tasks that involve social interaction between the examiner and the person under assessment. The examiner observes and identifies segments of the subject's behavior and assigns these to predetermined observational categories. Categorized observations are subsequently combined to produce quantitative scores for analysis and diagnostic classification of ASD. Children at or above predetermined cutoff lines are considered to be positive for ASD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (At study entry (one time evaluation))</time_frame>
    <description>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS). The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) will measure functional abilities within several domains including communication, daily living skills, socialization, and motor skills. The VABS has been used widely in ASD assessments and provides a measure of core symptoms and adaptive function across a wide age range (38). All sections of the VABS up through physical activity &quot;using small muscles&quot; will be completed. Subsequent sections consisting of problem behaviors will not be completed, as these are not needed to obtain an adaptive behavior composite score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (At study entry (one time evaluation))</time_frame>
    <description>The Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) is a measure of cognitive functioning for infants and preschool-age children from birth through age 68 months. The MSEL is organized into 5 subscales: (a) gross motor, (b) fine motor, (c) visual reception (or non-verbal problem solving), (d) receptive language, and (e) expressive language. An early learning composite score can be derived from fine motor, visual reception, receptive language, and expressive language scales. For young children this early learning composite score is considered equivalent to a more traditional &quot;IQ&quot; score or a developmental standard score (38). Each subscale is standardized to calculate a standard score, percentile, and age-equivalent score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ModiÔ¨Åed Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (At study entry (one time evaluation))</time_frame>
    <description>The M-CHAT is a 23 question (yes/no) parent-completed screening measure for ASD. The M-CHAT is a routinely used level 1 screening instrument for ASD and is recommended for universal screening for ASD at 18- and 24-month well baby visits by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)</description>
