  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are over 7 million people living with stroke in the United States. Per year,&#xD;
      approximately 17,000 Veterans are admitted to the VA for acute stroke. Chronic pain after&#xD;
      stroke can occur between 10-50% of stroke survivors. Post-stroke pain (PSP) can lead to&#xD;
      further complications in a stroke survivor's recovery. Exercise has improved PSP and&#xD;
      associated symptoms such as mobility, fatigue, and quality of life. Repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive technique using electromagnetic induction for&#xD;
      cortical neurostimulation. The use of rTMS has been explored shown to be effective in&#xD;
      treating chronic PSP but is limited in effect duration. Our proposal will test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that rTMS is feasible and safe to be paired with exercise. Additionally, the investigators&#xD;
      believe a complementary effect can develop to enhance the neurostimulation duration of rTMS.&#xD;

    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) is a validated, subjective measure for pain. Scores are based on self-reported measures of symptoms that are recorded with a single handwritten mark placed at one point along the length of a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between the two ends of the scale-&quot;no pain&quot; on the left end (0 cm) of the scale and the &quot;worst pain&quot; on the right end of the scale (10 cm)</description>
