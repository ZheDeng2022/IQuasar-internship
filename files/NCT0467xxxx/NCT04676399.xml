  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study (PASSION study) is to monitor symptoms of chronic pain before and&#xD;
      after 4 weeks of a standard drug commonly used to treat elevated blood pressure so that we&#xD;
      may better understand how blood pressure affects your level of pain. This study is not&#xD;
      testing an experimental drug.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the PASSION study is to determine the extent to which reductions in blood&#xD;
      pressure improve pain management via SCS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the extent to which reductions in blood pressure (4 weeks of diuretic) improve a&#xD;
           SCS device among patients with chronic pain and hypertension compared with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the extent to which arterial baroreflex function, which is critical to blood&#xD;
           pressure regulation, is impaired in patients with chronic pain and hypertension and is&#xD;
           correlated with chronic pain symptoms.&#xD;

    <description>A battery of questionnaires is intended to understand key aspects of pain, mood, and function as quickly and efficiently as possible. The focus of these measures is on obtaining an accurate assessment of pain, while also asking about physical function, anxiety, and other associated somatic disturbances. These questionnaires will be taken prior to SCS implant (Baseline) and after SCS implant (1 week post-op, 4 weeks post-op, and 8 weeks post-op ) to assess and compare.&#xD;
