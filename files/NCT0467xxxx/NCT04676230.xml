      The aim of this study is to compare in schoolchildren the effectiveness of an updated caries&#xD;
      management program based on the current caries paradigm with the ICCMS™ system (International&#xD;
      Caries Classification and Management System) versus an adjusted Colombian dental public&#xD;
      health service caries management program, in terms of: 1- caries risk probability, 2- caries&#xD;
      lesions, 3- parents' knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding children's oral health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: the caries management program based on its current paradigm offers the same&#xD;
      degree of effectiveness than the conventional caries management program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis: the caries management program based on its current paradigm offers a&#xD;
      different degree of effectiveness than the conventional caries management program.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Synthesis and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The synthesis and analysis of the gathered information will conduce to the ICCMS™ caries&#xD;
      management decision plan in terms of caries risk likelihood management and caries lesions&#xD;
      management with a structure conservative approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step of the management plan considers the caries risk likelihood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management options include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low likelihood: Tooth brushing 2/day with a fluoride toothpaste (≥1,000 ppm F-),&#xD;
           following the dental team instructions; motivational engagement (discuss with patients&#xD;
           how to improve oral health behaviors - including amount of sugar); cross-brushing for&#xD;
           erupting first molars; use of dental floss; recalls every 6 months, including&#xD;
           professional cleaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate likelihood: Previous activities plus prescribed F- mouthrinse; sealants in&#xD;
           caries risk surfaces, F- varnish 2 times/year; motivational interviewing; recalls every&#xD;
           3 months, including professional cleaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High likelihood: Previous activities and increase F- varnish to 4 times/year plus&#xD;
           Topical F- application; counseling: reduce sugar amount &amp; frequency; recalls every 3&#xD;
           months, including professional cleaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's caries risk factors management plan is tailored at the individual level and&#xD;
      involves actions to protect sound tooth surfaces from developing new caries lesions, and all&#xD;
      current active and inactive lesions from progressing. In addition, it aims at lowering the&#xD;
      caries risk likelihood of the patient when moderate or high, and to maintain it if low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second step is the caries diagnosis decision making at the surface level which conducts&#xD;
      to the surface diagnosis decision matrix. This decision relies on the clinical classification&#xD;
      of dental caries using ICCMS™ criteria and the radiographic extent of the lesion (enamel or&#xD;
      dentin) plus the activity status of the lesions. Only active caries lesions require caries&#xD;
      management. The level of intervention depends on the clinical caries classification of the&#xD;
      surface or tooth and the radiological extent (when information is available) of the lesion in&#xD;
      enamel or dentin. Management levels of active caries lesions are classified as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MInitial: Initial caries management stage (non-operative care (NOC)-control)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MModerate: Moderate caries management stage (minimally invasive surgical caries&#xD;
           management with no or minimal dentin removal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MExtensive: Extensive caries management stage (invasive surgical caries management with&#xD;
           dentin removal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For sound surfaces, risk based prevention is performed. For inactive lesions, restorations&#xD;
      might be performed depending on esthetic and plaque retention reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children will be randomized in two groups as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (Experimental): ICCMS™ caries management according to the surface diagnosis decision&#xD;
      matrix of active Ci, Cm3/4, and Ce caries lesions. Individual management according to the&#xD;
      future patient caries risk likelihood with specific prevention strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (Control): conventional caries management. Operative treatment of Cm and Ce caries&#xD;
      lesions (caries shadows and cavities) with conventional restorative treatment. Systematic&#xD;
      caries risk management with twice-a-year fluoride gel application, sealants on all occlusal&#xD;
      surfaces and oral health literacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the management plan is finalized in both groups, patients must continue attending the&#xD;
      clinic according to their group for the following three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessments will be conducted at one and three years after baseline, with the&#xD;
      baseline indicators as described above.&#xD;
