  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open label, study of CC-95266 in subjects with relapsed&#xD;
      and/or refractory multiple myeloma. The study will consist of two parts: dose escalation&#xD;
      (Part A) and dose expansion (Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation (Part A) of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      increasing doses of CC-95266 in a single administration to establish a maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and the dose expansion (Part B) of the study&#xD;
      will further evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK)/ pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy&#xD;
      of CC-95266 at the RP2D.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE.</description>
