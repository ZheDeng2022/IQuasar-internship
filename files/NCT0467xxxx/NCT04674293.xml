      1. RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY 1.1. The urgency of the problem Cerebral stroke ranks second in&#xD;
           the frequency of deaths from diseases of the circulatory system in the Russian&#xD;
           Federation. Mortality rates from cerebrovascular diseases are among the highest in the&#xD;
           world (175 per 100 thousand population) and, unlike most economically developed&#xD;
           countries, not only do not decrease, but also tend to increase. The annual death rate&#xD;
           from a stroke in Russia is one of the highest in the world (175 cases per 100 thousand&#xD;
           population per year). The early 30-day mortality rate after stroke is 34.6%, and about&#xD;
           50% of patients die within a year, i.e. every second sick [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
           International experience shows that a decrease in mortality from cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
           is achieved as a result of the implementation of coordinated complexes, the main of&#xD;
           which are raising the awareness of the population about the risk factors of vascular&#xD;
           diseases and their prevention, the introduction of effective preventive programs and the&#xD;
           improvement of the system of medical care in stroke. stroke include the use of modern&#xD;
           highly effective methods of reperfusion of the brain substance in the first hours of the&#xD;
           disease, aimed at restoring blood flow in the affected vessel, which allows to prevent&#xD;
           the development of irreversible damage to the brain substance or to reduce its volume,&#xD;
           i.e. to minimize the severity of residual neurological deficit [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
           The safety and efficacy of systemic thrombolysis in ischemic stroke using rt-PA&#xD;
           (alteplase) has been proven in a number of large randomized placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
           trials (NINDS, ECASS I, II, III, ATLANTIS) [3], as well as the SITS-MOST and SITS-ISTR&#xD;
           registers [4 , 5]. According to the recommendations of the European Stroke Organization&#xD;
           (ESO) and the American Stroke Association (ASA), systemic thrombolytic therapy (TLT)&#xD;
           using rt-PA (alteplase) is the most effective treatment for ischemic stroke in the first&#xD;
           4.5 hours from the onset of the disease [6, 7].&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Rationale for the study To date, two alteplase preparations are registered in the&#xD;
           Russian Federation - Revelisa® (JSC GENERIUM, Russia) and Actilyse®&#xD;
           (BoehringerIngelheimPharma GmbH and CoKG, Germany). The information obtained in this&#xD;
           register will help to clarify the data on the use of thrombolytic therapy in patients&#xD;
           with acute ischemic stroke in the Russian Federation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE RESEARCH 2.1. Purpose of the study The aim of this study&#xD;
           is to collect and analyze data on patients with acute ischemic stroke during intravenous&#xD;
           thrombolytic therapy with alteplase (Revelisa®) in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Research objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collecting and analyzing data on patients with acute stroke who received TLT in&#xD;
                routine clinical practice;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Obtaining data on the outcomes of AII in patients who received TLT in routine&#xD;
                clinical practice;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Obtaining data on the complications of TLT in patients with acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
                in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. RESEARCH DESIGN This study is an open, prospective, multicenter, non-interventional&#xD;
           (registry) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study does not provide for any interference with normal clinical practice,&#xD;
           including the use of investigational therapy or special research methods. The physician&#xD;
           will collect data on all patients with acute ischemic stroke who are admitted to the&#xD;
           hospital and who meet the inclusion criteria for this study, starting from 1 July 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. SELECTION AND EXCLUSION OF RESEARCH SUBJECTS 4.1. Description of the study population&#xD;
           The study will include all patients of any gender and age with a confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
           stroke of ischemic type (AII) who meet the selection criteria for the study and&#xD;
           hospitalized in specialized hospitals. At least 500 patients are planned to be included&#xD;
           in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be included in the study, patients must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients of any gender and age with a confirmed diagnosis of ischemic stroke (AII);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Carrying out the patient with intravenous thrombolytic therapy with the drug alteplase&#xD;
           (Revelisa®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. SURVEY MANAGEMENT The principal investigators of the centers are responsible for&#xD;
      conducting research at each specific clinical center. The national project coordinator is&#xD;
      prof. Shamalov N.A. Operational project management and statistical analysis is carried out by&#xD;
      Generium JSC, database maintenance and data management will be carried out on the basis of&#xD;
      the ROSMED.INFO online medical platform, medical monitoring will be carried out by the&#xD;
      Federal Center for Cerebrovascular Pathology and Stroke of the Ministry of Health of the&#xD;
      Russian Federation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. THERAPY The use of any investigational drug is not foreseen in this register. All patients&#xD;
      included in the study will receive thrombolytic therapy with drugs registered in the Russian&#xD;
      Federation, and in accordance with&#xD;
