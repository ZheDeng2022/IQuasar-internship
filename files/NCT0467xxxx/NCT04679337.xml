      The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in renal oxygen saturation (rrSO2) and its&#xD;
      relationship with central venous oxygen saturation (cvSO2), cerebral cortical oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (rcSO2), and hemodynamic parameters while displacing the heart for each coronary&#xD;
      anastomosis in 19-80 year old adult patients receiving off-pump coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
      surgery (OPCAB) under general anesthesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the current clinical trial, systemic perfusion and oxygenation through hemodynamic&#xD;
      variables such as cardiac index and mean arterial pressure, and central venous oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (cvSO2) are monitored during surgery. However, it has not been studied whether the&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters and systemic oxygen saturation adequately reflect the perfusion and&#xD;
      oxygen saturation of the kidney. Although there are various new serum biomarkers that are&#xD;
      known to reflect renal function or damage, they are not real-time monitoring of renal&#xD;
      function because they take time and cost to collect and analyze.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measures the distribution of oxygenated hemoglobin and&#xD;
      deoxygenated hemoglobin in tissues by sending two different near-infrared wavelengths (730&#xD;
      and 810 nm) from the sensor. It is a device that can continuously monitor the oxygen&#xD;
      supply-demand balance to a specific region non-invasively. NIRS is mainly used to measure the&#xD;
      oxygen demand-supply balance of the cerebral tissue by attaching a sensor to the forehead in&#xD;
      the surgical patient. Since it is known to be closely related to the reduction of cerebral&#xD;
      oxygen saturation during surgery and the occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction,&#xD;
      it is used as an indispensable monitoring device to prevent neurological complications in&#xD;
      heart surgery patients. Recently, with technological advances, it has become possible to&#xD;
      measure oxygen saturation by attaching sensors to various body tissues other than the brain.&#xD;
      When monitored with an NIRS sensor attached to the kidney, the relationship between renal&#xD;
      oxygen saturation reduction and postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) in children and adult&#xD;
      patients undergoing heart surgery was reported. However, so far, the effects of systemic&#xD;
      hemodynamic and oxygen saturation changes during the displacement of heart for coronary&#xD;
      anastomosis during OPCAB on the oxygen saturation in the cerebral cortex and kidney, have not&#xD;
      been studied. In addition, it is not known whether the cerebral cortical oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (rcSO2), which is commonly used in heart surgery, can reflect the renal oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (rrSO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in renal oxygen saturation (rrSO2) and its&#xD;
      relationship with central venous oxygen saturation (cvSO2), cerebral cortical oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (rcSO2), and hemodynamic parameters while displacing the heart for each coronary&#xD;
      anastomosis in 19-80 year old adult patients receiving off-pump coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
      surgery (OPCAB) under general anesthesia.&#xD;
