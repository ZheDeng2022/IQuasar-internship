    <textblock>
      A two arm pilot study investigating the rate of pathologic complete response in patients with&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency and triple negative breast cancer undergoing standard neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy + vitamin D supplementation, including an observational arm to describe response&#xD;
      in patients who are not deficient. Investigators hypothesize that vitamin D supplementation&#xD;
      during neoadjuvant chemotherapy in operable triple negative breast cancer patients with&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency, will increase the rate of pathologic complete response chain reaction&#xD;
      to that of vitamin D sufficient patients based on historical controls.&#xD;

      Primary Objective: To determine if pathologic complete response in vitamin D deficient&#xD;
      patients receiving vitamin D supplementation during neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable&#xD;
      triple negative breast cancer is greater than or equal to 60% or less than or equal to&#xD;
      pathologic complete response in historical controls (30%) using a one-stage phase II design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the proportion of patients with residual cancer burden (RCB) classes I, II,&#xD;
           and III in vitamin D deficient patients receiving vitamin D supplementation during&#xD;
           neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate pathologic complete response reaction in the observational arm of vitamin D&#xD;
           sufficient patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable triple negative&#xD;
           breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility of delivery of vitamin D supplementation with standard of&#xD;
           care chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of vitamin D supplementation&#xD;
           with standard of care chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the change in vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression from pre- and&#xD;
           post-neoadjuvant treatment breast tumor tissue samples of vitamin D deficient patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the change in VDR expression from pre- to post-neoadjuvant treatment breast&#xD;
           tumor tissue samples in a sample of 5 vitamin D sufficient patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the changes in the fecal microbiome and mammary gland microbiome of vitamin&#xD;
           D deficient patients from pre- to post-neoadjuvant treatment, and to explore the&#xD;
           concordance in the changes between the mammary and fecal microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the changes in the fecal microbiome and mammary gland microbiome in a sample&#xD;
           of 5 vitamin D sufficient patients from pre- to post-neoadjuvant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for a minimum of 30 days after the last study intervention is&#xD;
      administered for adverse events monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 30 days after removal from study or until death, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed&#xD;
      until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.&#xD;

             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an IRB-approved informed consent&#xD;
             document (either directly or via a legally authorized representative).&#xD;

             composition to vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because vitamin D supplementation greater&#xD;
             than the recommended daily allowance (RDA) is a pregnancy class C agent with no&#xD;
             adequate or well controlled studies in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with high dose vitamin D (greater than RDA),&#xD;
             women who are breastfeeding are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment for this malignancy including surgery, radiation therapy,&#xD;
             chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or investigational agent prior to study entry.&#xD;
