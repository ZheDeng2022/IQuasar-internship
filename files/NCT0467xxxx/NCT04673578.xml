  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, single-centre phase II superiority trial to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of 12 weeks of celecoxib (50 mg or 100 mg orally twice daily, dosed based on weight)&#xD;
      compared to placebo as an adjunct to treatment-as-usual in children and youth with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe obsessive-compulsive disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes oxidize arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, which modulate&#xD;
      normal neuronal function and inflammatory responses in the central nervous system. COX-2,&#xD;
      which is constitutively expressed by glutamatergic neurons in the cortex, hippocampus, and&#xD;
      amygdala, plays an important physiological role in synaptic plasticity and long-term&#xD;
      potentiation. Pre-clinical studies point to a potential role for non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which inhibit COX enzymes, in modulation of mood and&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms. Recent meta-analyses also suggest a role for adjunctive COX inhibitors in&#xD;
      the treatment of depression and first-episode schizophrenia. While consensus guidelines on&#xD;
      the use of anti-inflammatory therapy in children with acute-onset subtypes of childhood-onset&#xD;
      obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) suggest NSAIDs as a first-line option for patients with&#xD;
      mild impairment, there is limited empirical evidence to support their use in this population.&#xD;
      Two small randomized-controlled trials in adults with OCD demonstrated improved symptom&#xD;
      severity with celecoxib - a selective COX-2 inhibitor - raising the possibility that COX&#xD;
      inhibition may be effective in a general OCD population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effects of celecoxib and placebo as&#xD;
      adjuncts to treatment-as-usual on reduction in symptom severity, as determined by Children's&#xD;
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) after 12 weeks in children and youth with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe OCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, controlled, single-centre superiority trial with two parallel groups&#xD;
      (celecoxib 50 mg [≤25 kg] or 100 mg [&gt;25 kg] twice daily and placebo). Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from the BC Children's Hospital (BCCH) Provincial OCD Program and based on&#xD;
      self-referral from community practices. Randomization will be performed as block&#xD;
      randomization with a 1:1 allocation and stratified based on pre-treatment symptom severity.&#xD;
      The investigator, outcomes assessor, clinician, and patient will be blinded to the&#xD;
      intervention groups. Labs at baseline and 12 weeks will include complete blood count (CBC)&#xD;
      with differential, creatinine, electrolytes, liver enzymes, and CRP. Participants will be&#xD;
      assessed for OCD severity and adverse events at weeks 6 and 12. Analysis will be carried out&#xD;
      according to intention-to-treat principles. Power calculations using estimates based on&#xD;
      previous studies suggest a target recruitment of 80 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is OCD severity (as measured by total CY-BOCS score) after 12 weeks in&#xD;
      the celecoxib compared to placebo arm, adjusted for baseline. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      CY-BOCS score after 6 weeks adjusted for baseline OCD severity, difference in the proportion&#xD;
      of participants achieving a clinically meaningful response or remission; mean clinical global&#xD;
      impression of severity and improvement after 6 and 12 weeks; and difference between celecoxib&#xD;
      and placebo arms in the proportion of participants reporting adverse events that are&#xD;
      possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NSAIDs are common in clinical practice and referenced in both adult and pediatric treatment&#xD;
      guidelines for OCD, but no controlled studies have evaluated the effects of COX inhibitors in&#xD;
      childhood-onset OCD. This study will be the first to assess the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      adjunctive celecoxib in this population and will inform clinical management of children and&#xD;
      youth with OCD.&#xD;

    <measure>Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, 1st Edition (CY-BOCS-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks (adjusted for baseline severity)</time_frame>
    <description>The CY-BOCS is a well-validated clinician-rated measure to assess obsessive-compulsive symptom severity. This results in two subscale total scores, Obsessions and Compulsions, each ranging from 0-20, with a higher score indicating greater symptom severity. These subscale scores are summed to provide a total score, ranging from 0 to 40, that is used to measure overall OCD symptom severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants achieving a clinically meaningful treatment response.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as a 25% reduction in the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, 1st Edition (CY-BOCS-I) score or Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) of 1 or 2. As described for the primary outcome measure, this scale has a total score ranging from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.&#xD;
The CGI scales includes single item, clinician-rated, Likert-type scales of severity and improvement. The CGI-S (severity) is a frequently-used measure for assessment of symptom severity across multiple psychiatric illnesses due to its face validity and ease of clinical use. Responses range from 1 (no symptoms) through 7 (among the most severely ill patients, extremely severe symptoms, or completely non-functional). The CGI-I (improvement) typically but not always tracks with CGI-S and has been used previously to define response in treatment trials of pediatric OCD. CGI-I scores range from 1 (very much improved) through to 7 (very much worse).</description>
