  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a multi-center, prospective randomized controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      current standard of care treatment to the SEXTANT treatment protocol in patients with Type&#xD;
      III open fractures of the tibia and IIIB fractures of the ankle and hindfoot.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: To compare the surgical site infection (SSI) rates of the current severe open&#xD;
      fracture antibiotic strategy to a revised SEXTANT treatment strategy designed to address the&#xD;
      modern wound bioburden at the time of wound closure or coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To compare the terminal bioburden of the wounds at the time of definitive&#xD;
      closure or coverage as sampled by standard tissue microbiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To compare rates of antibiotic-related serious adverse events (SAEs) of the&#xD;
      two treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 4: To pilot the use of available and emerging rapid PCR platforms for wound&#xD;
      pathogen identification in a sub-cohort of patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Gustilo type III tibia (OTA 41 plateau, OTA 42 shaft and OTA 43 pilon) requiring&#xD;
                  a second procedure for final debridement and definitive coverage / closure&#xD;
                  following the index stabilization&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Gustilo type IIIB ankle fractures (OTA 44)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Gustilo type IIIB calcaneus fractures (OTA 82)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Gustilo type IIIB talus fractures (OTA 81)&#xD;
&#xD;
