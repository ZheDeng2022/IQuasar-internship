  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, blinded, sham controlled regional anesthetic&#xD;
      (supra-orbital and infra-orbital nerve block) pain study to compare the systemic&#xD;
      postoperative pain medication requirements in patients having Trans-sphenoidal Pituitary&#xD;
      surgery. The patients will receive general anesthesia +/- regional anesthesia for&#xD;
      trans-sphenoidal pituitary surgery and systemic pain medication during the intra-operative&#xD;
      and postoperative (6hrs) period. The amount of systemic pain medication requirements will be&#xD;
      compared between those patients receiving regional and general anesthesia versus general&#xD;
      anesthesia alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combined regional and general anesthesia for surgery is known to provide superior pain&#xD;
      control in the peri-operative period (intra and post-operative). Of particular interest in&#xD;
      neurosurgery are more rapid patient awakening and earlier ability to perform adequate&#xD;
      post-operative neurological exam. In addition to this, regional anesthesia can decrease the&#xD;
      total amount of systemic pain medications necessary and thus decrease their associated side&#xD;
      effects. Consequently, less systemic pain medications can benefit the patient in many ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By modifying the postop pain regime to include intraoperative regional anesthesia, there&#xD;
      could be increased patient satisfaction, and significant economic gains to the hospital&#xD;
      through a more streamlined, shorter, more pleasant hospital course for the patient. Patients&#xD;
      who have this trans-sphenoidal pituitary surgery are usually same day admission patients who,&#xD;
      following their surgery, are admitted for up to 24 hours postoperatively. Usually prolonged&#xD;
      admissions result from headache and nausea +/- vomiting. Etiology of the headache is likely&#xD;
      multifactorial. One theory is that stimulation of the peripheral trigeminal (Cranial Nerve&#xD;
      Number V) fibers in the V1 and V2 distribution of the face by the surgical endoscope and&#xD;
      surgical trauma may lead to release of inflammatory mediators and post-operative migraine. It&#xD;
      has been shown that repetitive injection of local anesthetics in the distribution of&#xD;
      supra-orbital nerve V1 and infra-orbital nerve V2 can decrease the incidence of chronic&#xD;
      idiopathic migraine headaches not related to surgery. By administering regional anesthesia to&#xD;
      the patient intra-operatively during their general anesthetic for the surgery, pain scores&#xD;
      may be reduced, PONV (postoperative nausea and vomiting) decreased, and hospital stay&#xD;
      shortened.This study will be examining the use of regional anesthesia (infra-orbital and&#xD;
      supra-orbital nerve blocks) combined with general anesthesia versus general anesthesia to&#xD;
      observe the systemic opioid consumptions of adult transsphenoidal pituitary surgery patients.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints of the study will be: (1) presence of PONV, (2) time in PACU (post&#xD;
      anesthesia care unit) and finally, (3) duration of hospital stay until discharge.&#xD;
