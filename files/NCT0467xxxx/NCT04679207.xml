    <textblock>
      This study is looking into whether the procedure called Vacuum Assisted Excision (VAE) is a&#xD;
      safe method for the removal of small and medium sized invasive breast cancers in patients who&#xD;
      are unfit or have refused to have surgery to remove cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) is a minimally invasive technique performed under local anaesthetic as an outpatient procedure by radiologists using x-ray or ultrasound guidance. It was developed in the USA in the mid 1990s and has become well established as a diagnostic test for suspected breast disease. It uses the combination of a large gauge biopsy needle and suction to allow larger pieces of tissue to be removed than can be obtained with a standard needle biopsy device. The technique is used widely for diagnostic purposes and, in some centres, for the therapeutic removal of benign breast lumps such as fibroadenomas and papillomas.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is aged 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis on core needle biopsy of invasive cancer of the breast&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unifocal invasive tumour on imaging (hormone receptor positive or negative)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  T1 or T2 primary or locally recurrent tumour measuring ≤25mm on imaging, excluding any&#xD;
             adjacent ductal carcinoma in situ (largest of the measurements on mammography&#xD;
             (including digital breast tomosynthesis if performed) and ultrasound)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The tumour is clearly visible on ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vacuum-assisted excision of the entire ultrasonically visible tumour is deemed to be&#xD;
             technically feasible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is considered to be at high risk of complications or death from a general&#xD;
             anaesthetic and therefore surgery under general anaesthesia is not considered&#xD;
             appropriate. This must be confirmed by agreement by two named consultant breast&#xD;
             surgeons, a multidisciplinary team meeting (including at least one consultant breast&#xD;
             surgeon) or by formal anaesthetic assessment. Unsuitability for surgery under local&#xD;
             anaesthetic must be confirmed by a consultant breast surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  or - The patient refuses to undergo surgery. This must be confirmed by a consultant&#xD;
             surgeon and breast care nurse following full discussion of the treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  or - The patient is considered unlikely to benefit from surgical removal of the cancer&#xD;
             by virtue of known metastatic disease or other life-shortening condition. This must be&#xD;
             confirmed by discussion in a multidisciplinary team meeting which includes an&#xD;
             oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has given written informed consent for the study Women who are already on&#xD;
             primary endocrine therapy for a breast cancer and meet the inclusion criteria will&#xD;
             also be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is on anticoagulants or has a known clotting disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to local anaesthetic&#xD;
