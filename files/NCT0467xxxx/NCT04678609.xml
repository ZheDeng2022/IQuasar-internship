    <textblock>
      Background: Clinical recommendations suggest exercises as the core treatment for knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA) patients. However, the biomechanical modification following exercise&#xD;
      therapy and its influence on pain remains unclear. The purpose of the study to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of two different exercise programs, open kinetic chain (CKC) and closed kinetic&#xD;
      chain (CKC) strengthening exercises, on pain and lower limb biomechanics for people more than&#xD;
      50 years old with painful mild grade knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: 66 individuals with mild knee OA, with knee pain in the previous one week, aged 50&#xD;
      years and above, and who have body mass index (BMI) between 18.9kg/m2 - 29.9 kg/m2 in&#xD;
      Kelantan, Malaysia will be recruited in this study. Participants will be randomly allocated&#xD;
      into three different groups, either OKC, CKC, or control groups. Participants in OKC and CKC&#xD;
      groups will perform the exercises at their home three times per week for eight weeks. The&#xD;
      control group will receive only the patient's clinical education about clinical&#xD;
      manifestations, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and nursing care for knee OA and printed&#xD;
      materials will be given. The outcome will be measured before and after the intervention.&#xD;
      Primary outcomes are self-reported pain, disability, and quality of life scores. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include lower limb biomechanics during gait and sit-to-stand, and knee isokinetic&#xD;
      strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This study will compare the efficacy of two different home-based exercise&#xD;
      intervention programs for people with mild grade knee OA. Findings will provide valuable&#xD;
      information for creating an effective exercise program that could slow down the progression&#xD;
      of OA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to compare the effects of two&#xD;
      different home-based exercise programs namely OKC and CKC strengthening exercise&#xD;
      intervention, on pain, disability, and quality of life on individuals with mild grade knee&#xD;
      OA. Our secondary aim is to compare the effectiveness of OKC and CKC strengthening exercises&#xD;
      on lower limb biomechanics during walking gait and sit to stand task. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      after eight weeks of intervention OKC and CKC groups will show more improvements in pain,&#xD;
      disability, and quality of life scores (what about the secondary outcomes) than the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the CKC and OKC exercise group, participants will perform an 8-week individualized home&#xD;
      exercise, a minimum of three sessions in a week. Each session lasts about 30 minutes,&#xD;
      including 5 minutes of walking as warming up session and quadriceps and hamstring stretching&#xD;
      as the cooldown session. Daily Paracetamol 3000mg will be provided to all three groups.&#xD;
      However, the consumption depends on each participant's needs, and the participants need to&#xD;
      record it in the diary given. The exercise diary will be given to each participant to ensure&#xD;
      patients' adherence to home exercise. During the intervention phase, a designated research&#xD;
      team member will contact the participants personally to encourage them to continue their&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The untreated control group received the patient's clinical education about clinical&#xD;
      manifestations, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and nursing care for knee OA except the&#xD;
      information related to exercise. The control group will not receive any home exercise&#xD;
      guidance. Upon completing the trial, participants in the control group will receive either&#xD;
      CKC or OKC exercises depending on their preference.&#xD;

    <description>pain intensity will be assessed using a visual analogue scale. It consists of a bidirectional 10-cm straight line, where 0 cm is &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 cm is &quot;worst imaginable pain,&quot; located at either end of the line. Patients will be instructed to draw a vertical mark on the line indicating their pain level.</description>

    <description>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index consists of a number of questions designed to assess the clinical severity of the disease (5 questions for pain, 2 questions for stiffness and 17 questions for physical function). It includes 24 questions, each question scored using a five-point scale (0-4) with higher scores representing greater levels of pain, stiffness and severity of the disease. The overall score (index) is determined by summing the scores across the three dimensions and the score ranges between 0-96 (derived from a 0-4 Likert scale).</description>

    <description>The Osteoarthritis Knee and Hip Quality of Life in Malay Version consists of 43 items divided into five dimensions: physical activity, mental health, pain, social support, and social functioning Each item in the five dimensions is measured on a numerical rating scale from 0 to 10. Each item is scored on a scale from 0 to 10, and the normalized scores were obtained by computing the sum of item scores for each domain and calculated to a scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) possible quality of life.</description>

The value is in Newton metre and will be compared pre- and post-intervention. Reduced knee adduction moment indicates improved biomechanics.</description>
