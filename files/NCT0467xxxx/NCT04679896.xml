  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV post-marketing study for MagnetOs Putty. MagnetOs Putty is a synthetic&#xD;
      bone graft extender product that is routinely used by surgeons as a treatment for patients&#xD;
      with leg pain and/or back pain and undergoing spinal fusion surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, MagnetOs Putty will be used according to the latest U.S. Instructions For Use,&#xD;
      specifically as a bone graft extender mixed with autograft in a 1:1 vol.% in the&#xD;
      posterolateral spine.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, following a screening period of a maximum of 30 days, 30 patients will undergo&#xD;
      up to a three-level instrumented posterolateral fusion (PLF) procedure. Prior to surgery,&#xD;
      each patient will be randomized to receive MagnetOs Putty on the assigned side of the spine&#xD;
      and local autograft bone on the other at the diseased levels. They will be followed up at&#xD;
      discharge, Week 2, Week 6, Month 3, Month 6, and Month 12. An interim analysis will be&#xD;
      performed once 15 patients have completed their Month 6 visit and have measurements for the&#xD;
      endpoints available to measure effectiveness. The primary endpoint will be analyzed at Month&#xD;
      12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, MagnetOs Putty will be applied according to the latest Instructions for Use&#xD;
      approved in the United States. Specifically, MagnetOs Putty will be used as a bone graft&#xD;
      extender mixed with autograft in a 1:1 vol.% in patients with with leg pain and/or back pain&#xD;
      requiring up to three-level instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion procedure. The fusion&#xD;
      procedure (PLF) will be left to the surgeon's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographs will be obtained at Screening, Day 0, Week 6, Month 3. CT scans will only be&#xD;
      obtained at Month 6 and Month 12.&#xD;
