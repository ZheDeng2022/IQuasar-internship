  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, multiple dose Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, MTD or MAD, PK, and PD of TJ210001 in subjects with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors. Beginning with Dose Level 1, TJ210001 will be given every week&#xD;
      starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1). The criteria for dose escalation/de-escalation will be&#xD;
      based on the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design with sequentially enrolled cohorts. The&#xD;
      BOIN design is implemented in a simple way similar to the traditional 3+3 design but is more&#xD;
      flexible and possesses superior operating characteristics that are comparable to those of the&#xD;
      more complex model-based designs, such as the continual reassessment method (CRM).&#xD;
