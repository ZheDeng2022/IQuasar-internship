  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a double-blined randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of statin therapy (atorvastatin 40 mg daily) for the treatment of NASH and&#xD;
      hepatic fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from this study will facilitate the design of a larger interventional study with&#xD;
      proper consideration of biological disparities and eventually inform NASH treatment and&#xD;
      personalized HCC chemoprevention approach using statins.&#xD;
