  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is seeking to evaluate the binding of a commercially-available, recombinant human&#xD;
      osteoinductive growth factor, rhBMP-2, to a human blood derived product scaffold, enhanced&#xD;
      Platelet-rich fibrin (E-PRF), and the release of such a growth factor over time in an in&#xD;
      vitro (laboratory) environment. The investigators will compare these release kinetics to&#xD;
      those of the FDA approved carrier for rhBMP-2, an absorbable collagen sponge (ACS), a&#xD;
      combination of E-PRF and ACS, and E-PRF alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Innovations in biomedicine and recombinant protein technology show promising advances for the&#xD;
      regeneration of advanced alveolar defects. Recombinant growth factors and biologics encourage&#xD;
      minimally invasive procedures with improved clinical outcomes/healing times in complex oral&#xD;
      surgery procedures. Recombinant human bone morphogenic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) is a morphogen&#xD;
      that is a well-known regulator of bone formation1 and has been widely studied for bone&#xD;
      reconstructive treatments.2-6 RhBMP-2 is currently commercially available and loaded on an&#xD;
      absorbable collagen sponge (ACS). This recombinant growth factor has been approved by the US&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration as an alternative to autogenous bone grafting in sinus&#xD;
      augmentation and localized alveolar ridge augmentation for defects associated with extraction&#xD;
      sockets. It is also used off-label for vertical bone augmentation. However, there are&#xD;
      limitations of the ACS as a carrier because it is compressible and does not ideally support&#xD;
      soft tissues to maintain space for osteogenesis to occur. Furthermore, the release kinetics&#xD;
      of rhBMP-2 in a standardized in vitro environment from its ACS carrier are unknown and it is&#xD;
      further unknown how such release would compare to the use of other carriers. Subcutaneous&#xD;
      implantation in rats and implantation at orthotropic sites in rats and rabbits has also&#xD;
      revealed that rhBMP-2-loaded ACS has a release of rhBMP-2 over 21 days with a half-life of 2&#xD;
      days. The use of an alternative delivery system may retain and sequester rhBMPs at the target&#xD;
      site and extend its growth factor release over time. This may be clinically relevant as&#xD;
      prolonging tissue exposure to an osteoinductive growth factor like rhBMP-2 could extend the&#xD;
      period of osteoblastic bone deposition and improve repair at regenerative sites. E-PRF as an&#xD;
      autologous carrier for rhBMP-2 may be advantageous based on its resorption properties of up&#xD;
      to 4-6 months, as well as its ability to support the healing process due to the slow and&#xD;
      gradual release of several growth factors including, PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, TGF- Î²1,VEGF, IGF, and&#xD;
      EGF. This study aims to quantify the release of rhBMP-2 over a 120 day period with the use of&#xD;
      a novel delivery system, E-PRF.&#xD;

    <description>During its preparation, 1.5 mg/ml rhBMP-2 will be incorporated into standardized samples to assure similar E-PRF to rhBMP-2 ratios. To allow for consistency across all samples, standardized E-PRF volume will be established using formation templates. Following its preparation, the E-PRF/rhBMP2 scaffold will undergo a standard in vitro assay to investigate growth factor release over time (ELISA quantification assay). Briefly, the e-PRF/rhBMP2 scaffold will be placed in a shaking incubator at 37 degree Celsius and assessed for growth factor release of rhBMP-2 over time.</description>
