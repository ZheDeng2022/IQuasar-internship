  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, the Baxter Retching Faces (BARF) Scale will be used to assess&#xD;
      chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in the pediatric cancer population during&#xD;
      chemotherapy admissions, and the corresponding administration of anti-emetic medications will&#xD;
      be reviewed.&#xD;

    <description>Nursing staff (which may include patient technicians and nursing assistants) will use the scale to assess the patient's nausea for the entire duration of the admission. These assessments will take place in conjunction with vital sign monitoring, every 4 hours. The associated script will be read while the laminated scale is shown to the patient.&#xD;
The nurse will then log the patient's response in the patient's electronic medical record</description>

    <description>-Patients in the control group will proceed with their inpatient chemotherapy admissions without any interventions. These admissions will take place prior to the admissions of the experimental group, so as not to bias providers.</description>

    <intervention_name>Baxter Retching Faces (BARF) scale</intervention_name>
    <description>Pictorial scale that was developed for use by pediatric patients in self-reported assessments of nausea severity&#xD;
A patient will respond by choosing a picture or a number on the scale that best represents how they feel. The patient may speak or simply point to their response. While the numbers 0-2-4-6-8-10 are listed alongside the pictures, patients are also allowed to choose &quot;in between&quot; or odd numbers. If a patient is unwilling to participate, the patient's parent or guardian may serve as their proxy and choose a number for them, based off of their symptoms.&#xD;
The BARF scale has 6 faces with assigned scores ranging from 0 to 10 with a score difference of 2 between each face (a higher score indicates more nausea).</description>
