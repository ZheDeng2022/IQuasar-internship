  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the presence of L. Crispatus in the rectum and&#xD;
      vagina after oral administration of BIOVAGINIL by searching for specific DNA of the bacterial&#xD;
      strain, to evaluate the tolerability of BIOVAGINIL and evaluate the minimum duration of the&#xD;
      oral administration necessary to determine the appearance of L. Crispatus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In fertile, premenopausal healthy women, the vaginal ecosystem is dominated by Lactobacillus&#xD;
      spp., but a diverse array of other bacteria can be present in much lower numbers. Over 120&#xD;
      species of Lactobacillus have been identified and more than 20 species have been detected in&#xD;
      the vagina. Molecular-based techniques have demonstrated that healthy vaginal microflora does&#xD;
      not contain high numbers of many different species of Lactobacillus. Rather, one or two&#xD;
      lactobacilli from a range of three or four species (mainly L. crispatus and L. iners but also&#xD;
      L. jensenii and L. gasseri) are dominant, whereas other species are rare, lower in titer and&#xD;
      tend to be novel phylotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginitis is defined as a spectrum of conditions that cause vaginal and sometimes vulvar&#xD;
      symptoms such as itching, burning, irritation, odor and vaginal discharge. Infection is the&#xD;
      most common cause of vaginitis, including bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis&#xD;
      and trichomoniasis. Bacterial vaginosis is a very common microbiological disturbance of the&#xD;
      vaginal environment in adult women and is characterized by a depletion of lactobacilli in&#xD;
      favor of an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria. Colonization by L. crispatus or L. jensenii is&#xD;
      associated with a lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis, and L. crispatus is strongly&#xD;
      correlated with the absence of BV, low pH, negative whiff test, absence of clue cells and&#xD;
      normal vaginal discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although antibiotic treatment of BV is strongly recommended, attempts at improving the&#xD;
      efficacy of therapy are still a matter of debate. In fact, antimicrobial treatment of&#xD;
      urogenital infections is not always effective, and problems remain due to bacterial and yeast&#xD;
      resistance, recurrent infections and side effects. Alternative remedies are thus of interest&#xD;
      and many studies have provided evidence of the beneficial functions of the human microbiota&#xD;
      and prompted the selection of bacterial strains with health-promoting capacities for the&#xD;
      treatment of conditions in which the microbiota, or its optimal functioning, is altered. The&#xD;
      rationale for the use of probiotics in women is based on the genitourinary regulatory role&#xD;
      played by the healthy vaginal microbiota and the need for restoration of this microbial&#xD;
      ecosystem after insult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until today, the most common way of delivering probiotic lactobacilli was the administration&#xD;
      of vaginal suppositories.However, this route will no longer be acceptable as products&#xD;
      containing probiotics (live microorganisms) are not admissible as medical devices as per&#xD;
      European Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/245. Oral administration therefore represents an&#xD;
      alternative and more patient-friendly concept for the restitution of the normal vaginal&#xD;
      microbiota. Indeed, several studies demonstrated the ability of rectal bacteria to move from&#xD;
      the intestinal tract to the vagina. Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that the&#xD;
      administration of a yoghurt containing Lactobacillus spp. including L.. crispatus in addition&#xD;
      to antibiotic treatment may improve recovery rate and symptoms of BV and is well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore reasonable to suppose that the oral administration of a food supplement&#xD;
      containing an adequate concentration of a strain of L. crispatus, one of the predominant&#xD;
      species, in the vaginal microbiota in asymptomatic women, may promote the re-colonization of&#xD;
      the vaginal environment. Since this species is so representative and crucial in maintaining a&#xD;
      healthy vaginal environment, we believe that it is of utter importance to understand its&#xD;
      activity to fully disclose its potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the presence of Lactobacillus crispatus&#xD;
      NTCVAG04 in the vagina after oral administration of BIOVAGINIL, a food supplement, as a&#xD;
      precondition for the subsequent evaluation of the ability of NTCVAG04 to rebalance the local&#xD;
      microbiota and promote healing and/or prevention of recurrences of vaginitis/vaginosis.&#xD;
