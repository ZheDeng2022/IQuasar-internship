      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study of BKR-017&#xD;
      and placebo that will be conducted at two investigative sites. The total duration of subject&#xD;
      involvement is approximately 15 weeks; the screening period can be up to 3 weeks prior to the&#xD;
      start of test period, followed by a 12-week test period. During the test period, subjects&#xD;
      will self-administer three tablets of test product, two times daily: before breakfast and&#xD;
      before bedtime.&#xD;
