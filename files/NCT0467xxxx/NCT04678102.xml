    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the safety and tolerability of PHI-101 in patients with&#xD;
      platinum-resistance/refractory ovarian, fallopian tubal, and primary peritoneal cancer. This&#xD;
      study also evaluates the pharmacokinetics of PHI-101 and efficacy of PHI-101 during treating&#xD;
      platinum-resistance/refractory ovarian, fallopian tubal, and primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHI-101 is a CHK2 inhibitor that is a checkpoint kinase binding specifically to CHK2, rather&#xD;
      than CHK1, and it inhibits the DDR system by inhibiting the ATM-CHK2 pathway, which is&#xD;
      activated in response to DSBs. When a high-grade serous ovarian (HGSO) cancer cell line and&#xD;
      various ovarian cancer cell lines (CAOV3, OVCAR3, SK-OV-03, and SW626) were treated with&#xD;
      PHI-101 in a non-clinical study, the therapeutic effect of PHI-101 against ovarian cancer was&#xD;
      demonstrated by a decrease in viability of ovarian cancer cells. In addition, a stronger&#xD;
      growth inhibition effect was observed compared to that of treatment with olaparib or&#xD;
      rucaparib alone, and a much stronger inhibition effect was observed when concomitantly used&#xD;
      with paclitaxel, cisplatin, and topotecan. Based on the aforementioned results of the&#xD;
      non-clinical studies, the potential of PHI-101 as a new treatment or concomitant cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapeutics for patients with ovarian cancer who are resistant to existing&#xD;
      antineoplastic drugs was confirmed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a maximum of 6 dose levels (cohorts) were planned for daily oral&#xD;
      administration of PHI-101. Subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria of this study&#xD;
      will be enrolled in each cohort and assessed for safety and tolerability after administering&#xD;
      PHI-101 to determine the MTD. Subjects will be enrolled sequentially starting from the&#xD;
      low-dose cohort, and DLT will be assessed for the first 28 days (Cycle 1) after the first&#xD;
      dose of PHI-101. Before DLT is assessed in a specific cohort, enrolling a subsequent subject&#xD;
      in the next higher dose cohort will not be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the accelerated 3+3 design, the accelerated dose escalation scheme, which&#xD;
      assesses DLT in 1 subject in each cohort ('single subject cohort'), is applied until toxicity&#xD;
      (ADRs) related to PHI-101 ≥ [CTCAE version 5.0] grade 2 occurs. If ADRs ≥ grade 2 do not&#xD;
      occur in 1 subject, DLT can be assessed in one level higher cohort according to the SRC's&#xD;
      recommendation. If an ADR ≥ grade 2 occurs in a specific cohort, the accelerated 3+3 design&#xD;
      will be immediately switched to the standard 3+3 scheme, and 2 additional subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in that cohort (1 subject + 2 additional subjects) to assess DLT during 1 cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After switching to the standard 3+3 scheme, 3 to 6 subjects will be enrolled in each cohort.&#xD;
      If no DLT is observed in the first 3 subjects, DLT can be assessed in one level higher cohort&#xD;
      according to the SRC's recommendation. If DLT is observed in 1 out of 3 subjects (DLT: 1/3&#xD;
      subject), that cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects by enrolling 3 additional subjects. If 2&#xD;
      out of 3 to 6 subjects experience DLT (DLT: 2/3 to 6 subjects), this means that the MTD is&#xD;
      exceeded. Thus, additional enrollment will be ended for that cohort. The one level lower&#xD;
      cohort will expand to 6 subjects (If 6 subjects were already enrolled in that cohort,&#xD;
      additional enrollment is unnecessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject not evaluable for DLT (withdrawal for reasons other than AEs or ADRs, or less than&#xD;
      20 out of 28 doses of PHI-101 were administered during Cycle 1) may be replaced by another&#xD;
      subject according to the judgment of the investigator (decision/recommendation of the SRC, if&#xD;
      necessary). If a subject in the single subject cohort is not evaluable for DLT, a substitute&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the same cohort (1 subject + 1 additional subject) to assess DLT. If it&#xD;
      is determined not to replace the subject not evaluable for DLT, the subject will be&#xD;
      considered to have experienced DLT when the dose escalation is decided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If DLT is observed in &gt; 1 out of 6 subjects in a specific cohort (χ) and DLT is observed in ≤&#xD;
      1 out of 6 subjects in the cohort (χ-1) that is one level lower than the specific cohort, the&#xD;
      one level lower cohort (χ-1) will be considered as the MTD. The dose of PHI-101 will be&#xD;
      escalated until an MTD is determined. If the MTD is not determined at the MPD, dose&#xD;
      escalation will be ended at that dose (Addition of cohorts may be reviewed by and discussed&#xD;
      with the SRC, if necessary, but reporting to the MFDS and the IRB and protocol amendment&#xD;
      should occur first.) According to the schedule of activities (SOA), observation, questioning,&#xD;
      examination, and tests to assess the safety and tolerability of PHI-101, PK sampling to&#xD;
      assess PK, and tumor response assessment to explore efficacy will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the EOT of PHI-101, the EOT visit will take place. Survival of subjects and initiation&#xD;
      of new antineoplastic therapy will be periodically checked until the EOS. The follow-up will&#xD;
      be performed for 1 year after the EOS to obtain such information.&#xD;
