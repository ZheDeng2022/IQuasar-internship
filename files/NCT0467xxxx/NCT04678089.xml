  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the emergence of new drugs, the short-term survival rate of multiple myeloma has been&#xD;
      significantly increased. How ever, in clinical treatment, doctors found that different&#xD;
      patients may present different clinical efficacy and adverse reactions when using standard&#xD;
      treatment. Some studies have shown that gene and metabolic differences in patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma may be an important factor affecting clinical efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, peripheral blood samples from patients with multiple myeloma will be studied&#xD;
      by using the methods of genomics, metabonomics and analytical omic. It is expected to find&#xD;
      biomarkers and genes related to clinical efficacy, adverse reactions, and blood concentration&#xD;
      of bortezomib in peripheral blood samples. If the sample size is large enough, the project&#xD;
      team expects to establish a prediction model for the efficacy and safety of bortezomib&#xD;
      containing regimen for multiple myeloma patients through the above studies. Investigators&#xD;
      hope that the evaluation system can provide a reference for clinical formulation of&#xD;
      appropriate drug delivery scheme.&#xD;
