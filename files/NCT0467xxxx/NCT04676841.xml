  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study we will compare bacteriological findings and the incidence of SSI in&#xD;
      relation to laminar airflow (LAF) ventilated ORs, conventional (also called displacement or&#xD;
      mixed) ventilated ORs and conventional ventilated ORs with the addition of tables equipped&#xD;
      with units providing a local LAF over the surgical instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that there exist a correlation between number and types of airborne&#xD;
      bacteria and bacteria in the surgical wound and on surgical instruments at the time of wound&#xD;
      closure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The scientific literature on the relationship between airborne bacteria and wound&#xD;
      contamination during different conditions is scares. A study from 1982 (Whyet et al.),&#xD;
      demonstrated that the most important and consistent source of contamination of the wound&#xD;
      during clean surgery (in this case hip implant surgery) was via air. The study concluded that&#xD;
      approximately one third of bacteria in the wound were caused by direct air contamination&#xD;
      whereas the remaining number of bacteria were transferred to the wound by indirect routes&#xD;
      such as via contaminated instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study includes patients undergoing hemiarthroplastic surgery due to hip fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the surgery active air sampling, for microbial analysis, will be done within 30 cm&#xD;
      from the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive sampling of instrument tables, to measure number of depositing bacteria on the&#xD;
      surface during the procedure, will be performed by placing sterile filters on the table&#xD;
      surfaces before initiating the surgical procedure and collecting them at the end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin and wound sampling will be performed with sterile flocked nylon swabs. The method for&#xD;
      skin and wound sampling was decided based on a literature review and discussions with the&#xD;
      department of Clinical microbiology at Sahlgrenska University hospital. Both aerobe and&#xD;
      anaerobe bacteria will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wound will be measured and number of personnel, door openings and clothing, at each&#xD;
      procedure will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study will be interviewed after 6 weeks and 1 year, to evaluate&#xD;
      incidence rate of SSI.&#xD;
