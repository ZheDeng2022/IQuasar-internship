  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the study is to further characterize the risks and the safety profile of&#xD;
      Baclocur® in real life settings, over a 12-month follow-up period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, non-comparative non-interventional post-authorisation&#xD;
      safety study (PASS) conducted in France. There will be no experimental intervention utilized.&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will receive treatment and evaluations for their disease as determined by&#xD;
      their physicians in accordance with local standard of care. Visits will be scheduled by their&#xD;
      physician according to patient-specific needs and national clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For purposes of this study, physicians will be requested to record information on enrolled&#xD;
      patients at the time of study enrolment (baseline), and then to conduct follow-up patient&#xD;
      visits based on their usual practice for a period of 12 months following Baclocur®&#xD;
      initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study end, further investigations on patients confirmed as lost to follow-up (LFU) will be&#xD;
      performed through the use of the French medico-administrative database called the Système&#xD;
      National des Données de Santé (SNDS). The goal will be to determine their vital status and&#xD;
      collect relevant treatment and safety data over the studied period to further assess the&#xD;
      safety of Baclocur®. A probabilistic approach using relevant matching variables (e.g. gender,&#xD;
      year of birth, date of Baclocur prescription, department of care) will be used to retrieve&#xD;
      these SNDS data of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient study enrolment period is expected to be approximately of 3 years. Accounting for&#xD;
      the 12 months follow-up period per patient, the full study field duration is expected to be&#xD;
      approximately of 4 years. One additional year will be needed before the SNDS matching is&#xD;
      performed, taken into account the delay required for the SNDS to be updated. With the final&#xD;
      analysis and final clinical study report, this will lead to a total study duration of&#xD;
      approximately 6 years.&#xD;
