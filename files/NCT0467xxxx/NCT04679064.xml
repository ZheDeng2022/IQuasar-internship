      Randomized phase 3 trial evaluating niraparib plus dostarlimab vs chemotherapy at physician's&#xD;
      choice in the treatment of recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer&#xD;
      patients for which platinum is not an option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients must have received no more than 2 previous chemotherapy lines. Stratification&#xD;
      factors will include HRD status, previous treatment with parp and anti PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitors,&#xD;
      Bevacizumab treatment and PDL1 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will continue to receive niraparib until disease progression (determined using&#xD;
      RECIST v.1.1 criteria and clinical criteria), unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent, or lost to follow-up, whichever comes first. Patients will continue to receive&#xD;
      dostarlimab for a maximum of 2 years, or until disease progression (determined using RECIST&#xD;
      v1.1 criteria and clinical criteria), unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent,&#xD;
      lost to follow-up, whichever may come first. Dose interruption and/or reduction may be&#xD;
      implemented at any time for any grade toxicity considered intolerable by the patient.&#xD;
