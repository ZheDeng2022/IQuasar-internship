  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) infections are emerging in the Western world with a predominance of&#xD;
      HEV genotype (gt) 3. Except for age older than 50 years, male gender, chronic liver disease&#xD;
      and immunosuppressed status, no correlators with clinical outcomes have been identified so&#xD;
      far. With this study, we want to examine viral factors associated with the morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality of HEV infections in Belgium as well as find correlators with clinical outcomes.&#xD;

      1. Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To examine viral factors, such as gt, subtype and viral load, associated with the&#xD;
           morbidity and mortality of HEV infections in Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To describe host factors associated with the morbidity and mortality of HEV&#xD;
                infections in Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To find independent host and/or viral factors that are associated with the&#xD;
                morbidity and mortality of HEV infections in Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigational plan&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. General study design&#xD;
&#xD;
           Retrospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Study duration, enrollment and number of sites&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects for which a serum sample is sent to the Belgian National Reference Center for&#xD;
           Viral Hepatitis Sciensano to diagnose a HEV infection between January 2010 and June&#xD;
           2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3. Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients with a confirmed or possible HEV infection at Sciensano between January&#xD;
           2010 up to and included June 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.1. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Lab confirmation of the HEV infection performed at Sciensano&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All ages will be included&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Cases not diagnosed in Belgium&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cases without clinical outcome data&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
           Review of records. Re-evaluation of available liver biopsies by an expert liver&#xD;
           pathologist (Prof. Tania Roskams, UZ Leuven).&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1. Data sources&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Belgium, Sciensano acts as a National Reference Center (NRC) for viral hepatitis.&#xD;
           Most of the documented HEV infections in Belgium are confirmed in Sciensano and samples&#xD;
           on which HEV serology (IgM and IgG), PCR and genotyping have been performed are&#xD;
           biobanked.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2. Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
           A questionnaire will be sent to all treating physicians of patients with HEV infections&#xD;
           in Belgium. If no response is received, a reminder will be sent by regular mail and&#xD;
           later by e-mail. Different options will be offered to the treating physicians: to fill&#xD;
           in the questionnaire, to complete the questionnaire by telephone with an investigator&#xD;
           from Sciensano, to let the data to be collected at the center site by an investigator of&#xD;
           Sciensano. Available liver biopsies from confirmed HEV cases will be retrieved from the&#xD;
           pathology department of each center and re-evaluated by an expert liver pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3. Variables collected&#xD;
&#xD;
           Demographic data:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Age and geographical origin. Date of symptom onset, date of diagnosis, date of loss to&#xD;
           follow-up / death. Pregnancy at the time of diagnosis. Diabetes mellitus at the time of&#xD;
           diagnosis. Immunocompromised status at the time of diagnosis. Known cirrhosis (fibroscan&#xD;
           / biopsy / â€¦), hematological or oncological disease. Other comorbidities. Blood&#xD;
           transfusion history. Solid organ or stem cell transplantation preceding the HEV&#xD;
           infection, type of organ and date. Renal function or renal replacement therapy.&#xD;
           Infection in other family members. Use of alcohol and number of units per week. Use of&#xD;
           illicit drugs. Travel abroad preceding the HEV infection and name of the country&#xD;
           visited. Consumption of pork meat.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment data:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment with ribavirin. Treatment with other known/putative antiviral therapy.&#xD;
           Reduction of immunosuppressive medication because of the HEV infection. Stop of&#xD;
           immunosuppressive therapy because of HEV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Disease course and outcomes data:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Acute hepatitis with complete recovery. Liver failure. Hospitalisation. Duration of&#xD;
           hospitalisation in days. Admission to the intensive care unit. Duration of&#xD;
           hospitalisation at the intensive care unit in days. Variceal bleeding. Bacterial&#xD;
           peritonitis. Hepatic encephalopathy. Extrahepatic manifestations and type. Neurologic&#xD;
           disease and type. Chronic HEV infection (as defined by HEV RNA positive for 3 months or&#xD;
           more). Progression to cirrhosis as a consequence of HEV infection. Liver transplantation&#xD;
           as a consequence of HEV infection and date of transplantation. Death and date of death.&#xD;
           Death as a consequence of HEV infection. Total duration of symptoms in weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Biochemical data:&#xD;
&#xD;
           HEV IgM, HEV IgG, HEV (quantitative) PCR, HEV genotype and subtype. HEV genotyping was&#xD;
           performed by Sanger sequencing of a 348 base pair (between 2010 and 2016) or a 493 base&#xD;
           pair (from 2017) region of ORF2. The obtained sequences were aligned against HEV&#xD;
           reference genomes and submitted to HEVnet for genotype assignment (13). Presenting ALT,&#xD;
           peak ALT, presenting AP, peak AP, presenting bilirubin, peak bilirubin, presenting INR,&#xD;
           peak INR, presenting albumin, lowest albumin, presenting eGFR (CKD-EPI), lowest eGFR&#xD;
           (CKD-EPI).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Liver biopsy scoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Histological grading and staging on H&amp;E stained liver biopsy slides will be applied in a&#xD;
           blinded manner. One expert liver pathologist, who is unaware of the infection status of&#xD;
           the patient, will score the liver biopsies. The following parameters will be scored from&#xD;
           0-4 in a semi-quantitative manner: general architecture, lobular and portal&#xD;
           inflammation, presence of immune cells and necrotic cells, presence of interfaces. Per&#xD;
           patient, a global score will be assigned taken into account the spread, mean and mode of&#xD;
           the different scored parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristics of patients will be analysed with the chi-square test for categorical&#xD;
      variables and student t-test (Welch test if unequal variances or Wilcoxon Rank sum test when&#xD;
      normality is not met) for the continuous variables. Numerical data are presented as the mean&#xD;
      and standard deviation or 95% confidence interval, while categorical are expressed as counts&#xD;
      and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following independent viral variables are defined: HEV gt 3 clade type (abchijklm, efg&#xD;
      and ra), viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following independent host variables are defined, given their known association with&#xD;
      disease outcome or severity: alcohol consumption, diabetes, gender, age, cirrhosis and&#xD;
      immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between demographic factors, disease severity (expressed by laboratory data and&#xD;
      histology) and disease outcomes (as defined by hospitalization status and duration, ICU stay,&#xD;
      chronic infection, extrahepatic manifestations and death) will be analysed for the&#xD;
      independent viral variables with an univariate analysis. Multivariable linear or logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis will be performed with dependent variables that were found to be&#xD;
      significantly associated with the independent variables in univariate analysis. Given the&#xD;
      retrospective nature of the analysis, an upfront power calculation for the number of included&#xD;
      patients for the investigated outcome is not possible. Statistical analyses are performed at&#xD;
      a significance level of 5% using the statistical software R or SAS.&#xD;
