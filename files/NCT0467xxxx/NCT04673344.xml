  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is a common complaint with the most common reason being tendinopathy and/or&#xD;
      tearing of the rotator cuff. While many rotator cuff tears are often considered normal,&#xD;
      age-related degenerative disorders, with either partial- or full-thickness rotator cuff tears&#xD;
      evident in 4% of patients aged &lt;40 years and in 54% of patients aged &gt;60 years, once they&#xD;
      become symptomatic and conservative management fails, they are typically repaired surgically.&#xD;
      Data suggest that the incidence of surgery to repair and re-attach the cuff continues to&#xD;
      rise. However, despite positive clinical results overall, reports of repair failure after&#xD;
      surgery can range from 16%-94%, and of those that do fail, or fail to heal, generally do so&#xD;
      within the first 3 to 6 months post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the aforementioned reported issues with the gold standard for the treatment of&#xD;
      unresponsive and symptomatic partial or full rotator cuff tears (surgical repair), together&#xD;
      with the invasiveness of this surgery and lengthy period of restricted activity, other means&#xD;
      of treatment have been proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The REGENETEN scaffold/implant seeks to support new tendon growth and disrupt disease&#xD;
      progression. This study seeks to investigate the outcome of surgical rotator cuff repair&#xD;
      versus scaffold augmentation (using the REGENETEN scaffold) for symptomatic partial thickness&#xD;
      rotator cuff tears.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females aged 40-75 years with a partial-thickness rotator cuff tear (50% or&#xD;
             more) confirmed on MRI scan that, in combination with patient-report symptoms and&#xD;
             clinical examination by the orthopaedic surgeon, would confirm the rotator cuff tear&#xD;
             as the primary pathology driving pain, symptoms and functional disability .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptoms &gt; 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unsuccessful conservative treatment comprising of a corticosteroid injection (into the&#xD;

             modalities may be available to patient's presenting with apparent symptomatic rotator&#xD;
             cuff pathology, for the current study, physiotherapy has been defined specifically as&#xD;
             a course of 'exercise-based' therapy specific to the individual patient, though&#xD;
             generally comprising of exercises designed to strengthen the rotator cuff and scapula&#xD;
             stabilizing musculature, improving flexibility and shoulder mobility)&#xD;
