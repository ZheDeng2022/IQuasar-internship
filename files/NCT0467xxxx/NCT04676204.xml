  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      STATURE is a prospective observational four-arm translation multi-site study that will run&#xD;
      for approx. 4.5 years. The primary aim is to measure treatment burden and its relationship to&#xD;
      medication adherence across four self-administered oral disease-modifying therapies&#xD;
      (cladribine, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, and teriflunomide) in multiple sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
      The information gained will assist prescribing decision-making; accounting for medication&#xD;
      burden at a patient level and potential implications on medication adherence and persistence,&#xD;
      thus minimising primary and secondary healthcare costs. Three-hundred and twenty-three&#xD;
      individuals with MS will be recruited into the study. Patient-reported outcome measures will&#xD;
      be administered via Qualtrics, a secure online data collection tool. Medicare and&#xD;
      pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) data will also be collected.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>24-months</time_frame>
    <description>Identification of medication burden will be calculated into indices of pre-workup and monitoring time, refill and administration and side-effects. This will allow the development of an indices of overall perceived burden, as well as sub-indices of specific perceived burden.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Adherence (MPR)</measure>
    <time_frame>24-months</time_frame>
    <description>Identification of medication adherence, persistence and switching between oral DMTs will be calculated as the medication possession ratio (MPR) collected from pharmaceutical benefit scheme claims over the 24-month enrollment period. In addition, basic self-reported adherence and discontinuation will be collected.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Adherence (PDC)</measure>
    <time_frame>24-months</time_frame>
    <description>Identification of medication adherence, persistence and switching between oral DMTs will be calculated as the proportion of days covered (PDC) collected from pharmaceutical benefit scheme claims over the 24-month enrollment period. In addition, basic self-reported adherence and discontinuation will be collected.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54)</measure>
    <time_frame>24-Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) is a structured, self-report questionnaire examining quality of life that contains 54-items, generating 12 subscales with two summary scores (physical health and mental health) and two additional single-item measures (satisfaction with sexual function and change in health). In scoring the MSQOL-54, two summary scores (physical and mental health) are produced from a weighted combination of scale scores, where scale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scale score indicating improved quality of life. Quality of life (QoL) is being utilised as an outcome measure to identify whether QoL is predicted by 24-month MPR/PDC adherence and persistence.</description>
