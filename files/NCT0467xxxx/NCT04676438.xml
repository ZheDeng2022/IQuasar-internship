  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post Mastectomy Pain Syndrome (PMPS) is a major complication of breast surgery responsible&#xD;
      for depression and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project consists of a prospective cohort on patients going for oncological breast surgery&#xD;
      at National Institute of Oncology of Rabat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic postoperative pain (CPP) remains a disturbing and obscure clinical problem, which&#xD;
      could last for more than 3 months after surgery. The aim of present study was to assess the&#xD;
      prevalence of CPP, investigate its impact on life quality and explore its potential risk&#xD;
      factors. After informed consent was signed, patients receiving surgery under general&#xD;
      anesthesia in Peking Union Medical College Hospital and other medical centers participating&#xD;
      in this study during 2018 will be included. Patients' preoperative information will be&#xD;
      collected from medical record, including basic demographic data, primary disease and previous&#xD;
      chronic diseases. Intraoperative information will be obtained from anesthesia record,&#xD;
      including surgical scope, duration, length and location of incisions and blood loss. Acute&#xD;
      pain will be evaluated in the ward of the department of surgery, when an app will be&#xD;
      installed on patients' mobile phones. Our long-term postoperative follow-up would be&#xD;
      performed by sending out survey questionnaires via this app in the 4th, 8th, 16th, 32th, and&#xD;
      48th weeks after surgery. The survey covers questions regarding the intensity,&#xD;
      characteristic, location and impact on daily activities of CPP. Information regarding&#xD;
      treatment of CPP will also be collected, if any. All the data gained will be summarized in&#xD;
      our database and analyzed.&#xD;

      Type of work: This is an observational, prospective, open, data-driven, single-center study&#xD;
      at the National Institute of Oncology (NIO) - Mohamed Ben Abdellah Hospital in Rabat,&#xD;
      affiliated to Mohammed V University in Rabat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study we are proposing is to determine the incidence and risk factors of&#xD;
      chronic post-surgical pain in oncological breast surgery on the Moroccan population operated&#xD;
      on and followed at the Sheikha Fatma Center of the National Institute of 'Oncology of Rabat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Determine the incidence of chronic post-surgical pain in carcinological breast surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the clinical characteristics of chronic post-surgical pain and in particular&#xD;
           the proportion of neuropathic pain and / or post-mastectomy pain syndromes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative risk factors of developing&#xD;
           chronic post-surgical pain in the Moroccan population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the incidence of acute severe postoperative pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the characteristics of acute postoperative pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the risk factors for severe acute postoperative pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work flow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The medical care of patients will be free to the responsible practitioners, according to&#xD;
           the usual practice&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nursing staff will be informed of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An investigator will be appointed after training in the protocol. He will be independent&#xD;
           and not responsible for the nursing activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients eligible for the study will be identified during the pre-anesthetic&#xD;
           consultation, carried out in the week before surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The recorded agreements will be obtained during these consultations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be included once admitted to the operating room and operated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The data collected is presented in the observation book in the appendix with the&#xD;
           definitions of the events and the entry rules&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will be followed up and reviewed at 3 months and 6 months in surgery&#xD;
           consultation for reassessment and completion of the observation book&#xD;
