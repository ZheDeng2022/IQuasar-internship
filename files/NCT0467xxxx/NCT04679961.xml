      Skin biopsy is the main method to diagnose skin tumors, skin inflammation, and pigmented&#xD;
      diseases. However, biopsy is an invasive method that can cause wounds and scars. Optical&#xD;
      coherent tomography (OCT) technology is a fast, non-invasive, non-radioactive, and label-free&#xD;
      imaging method. This technology generates real-time images of living tissue by detecting the&#xD;
      variations in the refractive indexes of various components in soft tissues. Recently, there&#xD;
      is a breakthrough progress that the newly designed ultrahigh resolution OCT can provide in&#xD;
      vivo cellular resolution similar to histopathological sections in the high magnification. In&#xD;
      our previous clinical trial &quot;Early feasibility study: application of OCT imaging in&#xD;
      dermatology&quot; (approved by IRB of MacKay Memorial Hospital, no. 17CT062Be), it showed&#xD;
      characteristic features of different skin inflammatory diseases and tumors can be&#xD;
      distinguished successfully in tomograms. There were no adverse event or serious adverse event&#xD;
      in this trial. Artificial intelligence technologies have been used widely in the image&#xD;
      analysis in recent years. Hence, we aim to collect OCT tomograms of common skin inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases, skin tumors, and pigmented diseases, and compare with normal skin for machine&#xD;
      learning. We expect the integration of tomograms with deep learning artificial intelligence&#xD;
      may assist identifying histological features in these images and provide new alternative way&#xD;
      for non-invasive diagnosis in dermatology.&#xD;

      Introduction Optical coherent tomography (OCT) technology has been widely used in medical&#xD;
      practice, such as ophthalmology. The application in dermatology is slowly progressed until&#xD;
      the marked improvement of resolution recently. One of the newly designed OCT devices using in&#xD;
      this study is based on the research and development of Professor Sheng-Lung Huang of National&#xD;
      Taiwan University. The light source was made with original glass-covered crystalline fiber&#xD;
      which has successfully provided sub-micron resolution on the skin, which is better than the&#xD;
      traditional 5-10 micron resolution of high-definition OCT. This new OCT system (ApolloVueâ„¢&#xD;
      S100 image system, Viper1-S003, Apollo Medical Optics) has been used in this previous&#xD;
      clinical trial &quot;in vivo OCT images of different skin diseases&quot; without adverse events. OCT&#xD;
      images of different skin diseases collected in that trial were compared with HE-stained&#xD;
      pathological sections. They provided useful information to physicians. The risk-benefit&#xD;
      assessment of this clinical trial is the same as expected. The risk is low in clinical use,&#xD;
      and both for the operators and the subjects. In recent years, the application of artificial&#xD;
      intelligence technology in the analysis of tissue classification of medical images is rapidly&#xD;
      developing. Therefore, we are going to use deep learning technology to improve the&#xD;
      interpretation of OCT images to help the subsequent diagnosis of skin diseases.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. Minors aged under 20 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Suspected a transcutaneous infectious disease, including infections such as bacteria,&#xD;

        7. Vulnerable populations, including prisoners, pregnant women, handicapped, mentally&#xD;
           disabled, known AIDS patients, and homelessness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Minors under 20 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Epidermal inflammatory disease&#xD;

           and a physician determine the surgery will affect outcome of the OCT images.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) was used to mark tissue and lesions in OCT images.&#xD;
      When training DCNN models, transfer learning strategies will be used to fine-tune the&#xD;
      parameters from pre-trained models that contain a lot of image knowledge, such as GoogLeNet,&#xD;
      rather than training the models from scratch. This method retains the low-level image&#xD;
      knowledge common to natural and medical images, and significantly reduces the time to train&#xD;
      the model. During the training process, the parameters of the first few layers that store the&#xD;
      low-order image knowledge in the model are fixed, and the parameters of the subsequent layers&#xD;
      of the model are changed by the back-propagation algorithm. Finally, a layer of linear&#xD;
      classifier is added to the end of the DCNN to determine the type / size of the symptoms in&#xD;
      the input image.&#xD;
