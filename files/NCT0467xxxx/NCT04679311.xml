  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are among the most important and widely&#xD;
      prescribed drugs. They reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with high blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart disease, and kidney disease. Unfortunately, their use carries the risk of&#xD;
      causing life-threatening airway swelling in some patients. There is currently no treatment&#xD;
      for this condition. A novel treatment approach that may reduce or completely reverse the&#xD;
      swelling will be tested.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that treatment with fresh frozen plasma that&#xD;
      contains high levels of ACE activity will increase serum ACE activity and thereby cause the&#xD;
      degradation of mediators of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema, such as bradykinin and&#xD;
      substance P, resulting in a shortening of the course of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with&#xD;
      either 2 units of fresh frozen plasma that has been preselected for high ACE activity content&#xD;
      (≥50 U/L) or an equal volume of normal saline. A baseline assessment of the severity of the&#xD;
      angioedema will be performed and baseline serum levels of ACE activity, bradykinin, and&#xD;
      substance P will be determined. The severity of angioedema will be assessed and serum levels&#xD;
      of ACE activity, bradykinin and substance P will be determined at specific intervals after&#xD;
      each subject is treated.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females 18 years of age or older&#xD;

          -  Presenting with moderate to severe angioedema affecting the upper aerodigestive tract&#xD;
             (face, lips, cheeks, tongue, soft palate/uvula, pharynx, and larynx). The severity of&#xD;
             the angioedema attack will be determined by the subject's worst severity rating at&#xD;
             baseline among 4 clinical domains (difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, voice&#xD;
             changes, and tongue swelling) based on a clinically validated angioedema severity&#xD;
             scale29 (Table)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presenting with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema within 12 hours after onset&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All females must have a locally obtained negative pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
             administration of the study drug. Those who have had a total hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy, or are two years post-menopausal do not require a pregnancy test.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with morbid obesity as defined by BMI&gt;40; morbidly obese patients have a&#xD;
             higher volume of blood needing higher amounts of plasma and therefore will be excluded&#xD;
