      This study assesses the quality of life in patients with cutaneous lymphoma diagnosis as it&#xD;
      relates to their personal, clinical, and therapeutic information using the Skindex29&#xD;
      questionnaire and also assesses patients' understanding of their diagnosis and need for&#xD;
      resources related to their care. Cutaneous lymphomas are a rare type of blood cancers&#xD;
      (non-Hodgkin lymphoma) that present in the skin. The information gained from this study, may&#xD;
      help researchers improve quality of life in cutaneous lymphoma patients.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To prospectively assess quality of life (QoL) in adult patients with cutaneous lymphoma&#xD;
      (CL) via use of a validated questionnaire (Skindex-29) and identify the psychosocial needs of&#xD;
      our patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To prospectively evaluate the burden of pruritus in patients with CL via use of 10-point&#xD;
      pruritus scale and compare to QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate QoL for any correlation with demographic and clinical information,&#xD;
      specifically, age, gender, race/ethnicity, type of CL, stage of mycosis fungoides (MF)/Sezary&#xD;
      syndrome (SS), treatment regimen, and social work involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To track changes in QoL and burden of pruritus as they relate to therapeutic strategies&#xD;
      used to manage disease, including social work involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To prospectively assess patients' knowledge and understanding of their cancer diagnosis,&#xD;
      prognosis, and overall survival; and to track changes in their knowledge and understanding,&#xD;
      and assess for any correlation to QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To prospectively evaluate our patients' need for resources, and our ability to meet those&#xD;
      needs; and to assess for any correlation to demographic or clinical category, or QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete quality of life questionnaires over 10-20 minutes about symptoms, emotions,&#xD;
      and functioning related to diagnosis of cutaneous lymphoma.&#xD;

    <description>Skindex-29 domain (symptom, function, and emotion) scores will be summarized by diagnosis group, demographics, disease characteristics, treatment/intervention, and disease response/clinical outcome. Cross-sectional and longitudinal summary of the data will be performed. Descriptive statistics for continuous data (mean, standard deviation, median, range, etc.) will be used to summarize quality of life. Descriptive and summary statistics or continuous and categorical data (counts and percentages) will be used to summarize continuous or categorical demographics or other patient/disease characteristics respectively. Graphical representation of the data will be used when helpful. Descriptive statistics for categorical data will be used to assess patients' understanding of their cancer diagnosis and need for resources based on the survey.</description>
