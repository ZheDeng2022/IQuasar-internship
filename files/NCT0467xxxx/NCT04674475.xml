      Hypothesis: the clinical outcome of patients with indication of PCI and coronary stent&#xD;
      implantation that are at high risk of events can be improved with a widespread use of&#xD;
      intra-coronary tools that allow a PCI optimization (i.e. functional assessment by pressure&#xD;
      guidewire and intra-coronary imaging techniques).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: to evaluate whether the use of pressure guidewire and intra-coronary imaging&#xD;
      techniques (mainly optimal coherence tomography) in patients at high risk of events&#xD;
      undergoing coronary angiography for myocardial revascularization is associated with an&#xD;
      improved clinical outcome in comparison with patient with angiographic alone guided&#xD;
      cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting coronary stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Prospective observational multicentric international study with a follow-up of 12&#xD;
      months, including 1.000 patients in 40 sites located in 3 European countries (Spain, France,&#xD;
      and Portugal). The control group will be comprised by a similar number of matched patients&#xD;
      included in the &quot;extended-risk&quot; cohort of the XIENCE V USA study. PCI will be performed&#xD;
      following local standard protocols and accordingly to the physician criteria. The use of&#xD;
      pressure guidewire will be recommended according to the current guidelines, in patients with&#xD;
      angiographically intermediate lesions and in those with multivessel disease. The use of OCT&#xD;
      will be strongly recommended, as patients included will be considered to be at high risk of&#xD;
      events, accordingly to the current recommendations. The primary endpoint will be target&#xD;
      lesion failure (TLF) at 1 year.&#xD;

        Prospective observational multicentric international study with a follow-up of 12 months,&#xD;
        including 1.000 patients treated with coblat-chromium everolimus-eluting coronary stents&#xD;
        and high risk of events in 40 sites located in 3 European countries (Spain, France, and&#xD;
        Portugal). The control group will be comprised by a similar number of matched patients&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one of the following high-risk characteristics: lesion length &gt; 28 mm;&#xD;
             reference vessel diameter &lt; 2.5 mm or &gt; 4.25 mm; chronic total occlusion; bifurcation&#xD;
             with side branch â‰¥ 2 mm; ostial lesion; left main; in-stent restenosis; more than 2&#xD;
             lesions stented in the save vessel; more than 2 vessels treated; acute myocardial&#xD;
             infarction; renal insufficiency; ejection fraction &lt; 30%; or staged procedure. There&#xD;
             will be no protocol exclusions on the basis of clinical features or angiographic&#xD;
