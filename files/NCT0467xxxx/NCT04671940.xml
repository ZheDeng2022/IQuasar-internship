  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radical radiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) can be administered to&#xD;
      primary disease with curative intent. Residual disease, recurrence or further tumours may&#xD;
      subsequently occur in this irradiated field. It is unknown whether these cancers reflect&#xD;
      primary resistance or represent the evolution of resistance on treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding this could allow stratification of patients to more effective primary&#xD;
      treatments, such as transoral robotic surgery, or help tailor systemic therapies for these&#xD;
      cancers in previously irradiated fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECUT+ is an exploratory molecular analysis study to assess the selective impact of radiation&#xD;
      therapy on HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH), Chelsea, a tertiary&#xD;
      referral H&amp;N cancer unit in London, UK, specialising in transoral robotic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective participants will be identified from previous Head and neck MDT lists at RMH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective participants will be screened for by the RECUT+ team during the weekly H&amp;N MDT&#xD;
      meetings at the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood/saliva samples will be collected pre operatively (prospective participants) and post&#xD;
      operatively (retrospective and prospective participants) for germline and circulating tumour&#xD;
      DNA analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy samples from the original cancer and resected specimens from the post radiotherapy&#xD;
      residual/recurrent/new primary disease will undergo molecular analysis to assess for any&#xD;
      selective impact of radiotherapy on these further tumours.&#xD;

    <description>Patients who have previously had radiotherapy and then have had their local residual/recurrent disease managed with salvage TORS at the Royal Marsden Hospital will be eligible for inclusion. They will be informed of the RECUT+ study by a member of their usual care team at RMH during their routine outpatient appointments for follow up of their H&amp;N cancer.&#xD;
Potential participants will be asked to consent to provide blood/saliva sample for germline DNA and for permission for their original tumour biopsy sample and their residual/recurrent resection to undergo DNA analysis. Where patients have returned to their referring institution and are no longer under active regular follow up at RMH, a research pack will be sent to the patient via post and email. This pack will contain the Cover Letter, the Participant Information Sheet and the Informed Consent Form. It will also contain a saliva collection tube, buccal swab, blood tubes and instructions for how to provide blood/saliva samples.</description>
