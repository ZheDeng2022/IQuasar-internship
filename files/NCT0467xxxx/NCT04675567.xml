      The Safety-Net project, is intended to disrupt disparities in mental health treatment access&#xD;
      for children at-risk for childhood trauma (ACEs) and/or serious emotional disturbance (SED).&#xD;
      &quot;Safety Net&quot; will use mobile clinical and family support teams to improve mental health&#xD;
      outcomes. This clinical innovation, nested in an integrated system-of-care will be piloted&#xD;
      for children, ages 3-18 yrs., with SED who receive primary care through Cambridge Health CHA.&#xD;

      The Safety-Net project, is intended to disrupt disparities in mental health treatment access&#xD;
      for children at-risk for childhood trauma (ACEs) and/or serious emotional disturbance (SED).&#xD;
      &quot;Safety Net&quot; will use mobile clinical and family support teams to improve mental health&#xD;
      outcomes. This clinical innovation, nested in an integrated system-of-care will be piloted&#xD;
      for children, ages 3-18 yrs., with SED who receive primary care through Cambridge Health CHA.&#xD;
      Massachusetts had the highest rate of child abuse and neglect in the US during 2016 (DHHS,&#xD;
      2017). Approximately, 25% of these children live below the federal poverty level (American&#xD;
      Community Survey, 2011-2013). The &quot;gateway&quot; cities this study targets in Metro-Boston (Malden&#xD;
      and Everett) have 2-3 times the rate of foreign-born residents (43% vs. 15%) compared to the&#xD;
      rest of the MA, and twice the statewide rate of children whose parental language is not&#xD;
      English (54% vs. 22.3%). Together, SED and ACEs put children at much higher risk for adverse&#xD;
      health and mental health outcomes in childhood and beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHA's Children's Health Initiative (CHI) leadership will combine evidence-based interventions&#xD;
      from its earlier MHSPY program (family support, care management and shared goals) with new&#xD;
      strategies, such as interdisciplinary child mental health evaluation teams, all within&#xD;
      primary care. Clinical expertise will be combined with peer-to-peer parent/guardian support&#xD;
      for trauma-informed care delivery to both parent and child. All aspects of the care continuum&#xD;
      will be provided in a culturally and linguistically competent manner, with child and&#xD;
      family-driven care planning. Overall, the program will be sited in two cities, supported by a&#xD;
      larger, specialized system of care involving state and local child serving agencies, schools&#xD;
      and community-resources. The study team anticipates serving 248 children and families in&#xD;
      total, at approximately 70 children per year. Program goals include: 1) Promote earlier&#xD;
      recognition of child mental health needs; 2) Family-driven assessment approach to offset&#xD;
      disparities in treatment engagement and outcomes; 3) Facilitate state, local and care&#xD;
      planning team coordination and collaboration using SOC principles. Objectives: 1) Assess&#xD;
      presence of SED (Serious Emotional Disturbance) via Standardized measures of Clinical&#xD;
      Functioning (CGAS and CAFAS) 2) Screen for adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) by use of&#xD;
      modified ACE-Q tool, 3) Increase access to child mental health evaluation and treatment using&#xD;
      Pre-post measures of patterns of service use for study participants and Assessment of&#xD;
      patterns of care for propensity-score weighted comparison group, 4) Improve family care&#xD;
      experience, as measured by Baseline and follow-up Family Professional Partnership Scale&#xD;
      assessments, 5) Improve clinical functioning, as measured by Baseline and follow-up CGAS and&#xD;
      CAFAS assessments. Safety-Net's goals align with CHA's goals within its Accountable Care&#xD;
      Organization contract with MassHealth, thus offering a chance to measure and evaluate&#xD;
      outcomes for a customized system-of-care for some of the state's most&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The Safety-Net Model consists of the delivery of intensively integrated clinical care within pediatrics, combined with community-based parent support from family support specialists. Innovations include child mental health specialists joining the pediatrics team for &quot;huddles&quot;, psychiatry notes shared with pediatricians via the Electronic Medical Records and active inclusion of pediatricians in pre-evaluation discussions with the Safety-Net Team and post-evaluation recommendations for the families. In addition, the Safety-Net model includes active communication with school personnel, child welfare, and community-based resources, when needed.</intervention_model_description>
