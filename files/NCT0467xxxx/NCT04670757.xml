  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the following clinical trial is to determine safety an pharmacokinetic parameters&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers after oral administration of Janus kinases and Rho-kinases inhibitor&#xD;
      (JAK/ROCKi), called CPL409116.Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are a new class of small molecule&#xD;
      drugs that modulate inflammatory pathways by blocking one or more JAK receptors. In recent&#xD;
      years, JAK inhibitors have emerged as a new option for the treatment of various inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthritis, skin&#xD;
      disorders and others. CPL409116 inhibits JAK1 and JAK3 with less inhibitory activity against&#xD;
      JAK2 and Tyk2. Inhibition of these kinases decreases inflammatory cytokine release which in&#xD;
      turn decreases lymphocyte activation and proliferation. Moreover, CPL409116 blocks&#xD;
      Rho-kinases (ROCKs), which are involved in diverse cellular processes including actin&#xD;
      cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion and motility, proliferation, apoptosis as well as&#xD;
      smooth muscle contraction. ROCKs signalling is one of the major pathways implicated in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of cardiovascular, renal as well as fibrotic diseases. However recent data&#xD;
      indicate their role in immune cell regulation and inflammatory disease development. CPL409116&#xD;
      was designed predominantly for the therapy of immune-related diseases: rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
      psoriasis and because antifibrotic therapies are needed. Dual inhibition of JAK/ROCK kinases&#xD;
      may be beneficial for patients suffering from fibrotic complications of inflammatory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterised by&#xD;
      persistent joint inflammation leading to loss of joint function as well as cartilage and bone&#xD;
      damage. Chronic, progressive course of the disease results in disability, reduced quality of&#xD;
      life, as well as higher comorbidity and mortality rates. It is well documented that JAK&#xD;
      kinases play a pivotal role in cytokine receptor signalling to phosphorylate and activate&#xD;
      signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Several of these&#xD;
      JAK-controlled cytokine receptor pathways are immediately involved in the initiation and&#xD;
      progression of RA pathogenesis. Cytokines promote autoimmunity, maintain chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      synovitis and drive the destruction of joint tissue. In consequence on the basis of the&#xD;
      preclinical study results the IMP with the active ingredient CPL409116 has been qualified as&#xD;
      a good clinical candidate for the treatment of RA.&#xD;

      The following clinical trial consists of two phases IA and IB. Approximately 68 volunteers&#xD;
      who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are going to be enrolled into&#xD;
      the study. Phase IA (approx. 24 male and female volunteers) is to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      tolerability after single oral administration of the Investigational Medicinal Produkt (IMP)&#xD;
      to healthy volunteers. Additional cohort (approx 12 healthy volunteers) is going to be&#xD;
      included in the phase IA of the study to assess the food effect on CPL409116 compound's&#xD;
      bioavailability after one dose of single oral IMP administration. There are to be two&#xD;
      treatments periods for this cohort: fasted and fed. Phase IB (approx. 32 male and female&#xD;
      volunteers) is to evaluate safety and tolerability after two weeks of oral administration of&#xD;
      IMP to healthy volunteers.&#xD;
