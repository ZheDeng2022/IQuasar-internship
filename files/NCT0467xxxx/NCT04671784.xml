  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and EUS-guided tissue acquisition (EUS-TA) are minimally invasive&#xD;
      techniques to establish the benign or malignant nature of lymph nodes (LNs) with a very high&#xD;
      accuracy. In particular, for mediastinal LNs, a meta-analysis underlined that EUS features&#xD;
      alone are not enough to reach a good sensitivity and specificity, while EUS-TA showed a&#xD;
      slightly high sensitivity (88% vs. 85%) and a significantly high specificity (96% vs. 85%)&#xD;
      for diagnosing the cause of LN enlargement. Considering all sites, according to the&#xD;
      meta-analysis of Xu and colleagues, the assessment of LNs by EUS-elastography is a useful&#xD;
      tool in differentiating benign and malignant LNs, with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity&#xD;
      of 85%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For lymphadenopathy of unknown origin, ESGE recommends performing EUS-TA (or alternatively&#xD;
      endobronchial ultrasound [EBUS]-guided) if the patient management requires a pathological&#xD;
      result and no superficial lymphadenopathy is easily accessible. Unfortunately, EUS-TA may&#xD;
      sometimes be challenging or inconclusive, due to blood contamination or insufficient&#xD;
      material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS elastography (EUS-E) is a non-invasive ultrasound technique that measures the hardness of&#xD;
      tissues. The level of hardness of region of interest (ROI) can be evaluated using qualitative&#xD;
      scores and/or quantitative methods (strain ratio; SR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, most of the studies on EUS-E have been carried out using the Hitachi ultrasound&#xD;
      machine. In particular, Paterson performed a quantitative analysis considering as a&#xD;
      pathological value cut-off, the SR â‰¥7.5 for EUS-E in the nodal staging of esophageal cancer.&#xD;
      The study involved 53 LNs using cytology as gold standard: their data showed that EUS-E had a&#xD;
      sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 96%, PPV of 95% and NPV of 86%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a new compact ultrasound processor, EU-ME2 (Olympus SE &amp; CO. KG, Hamburg, Germany)&#xD;
      that includes an elastography software was developed although data regarding its application&#xD;
      in LNs evaluation are still not available. The concept of fractal geometry as a tool for&#xD;
      describing natural objects was originally introduced by Benoit Mandelbrot. A fractal can be&#xD;
      considered as an irregularly shaped object and that can be divided into fragments, each of&#xD;
      them representing a self-similar reduced copy of the whole. The hun body is an example of&#xD;
      natural fractal, as many of its parts are characterized by features resembling the typical&#xD;
      fractal nature. It has been demonstrated that fractal geometry can be used to efficiently&#xD;
      evaluate the geometrical complexity of imaging patterns observed in oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently published a study on the role of EUS elastography and fractal&#xD;
      based analysis in the differentiation of solid pancreatic lesions. However, data regarding&#xD;
      the application of fractal analysis to evaluate lymphadenopathies are still not available.&#xD;
