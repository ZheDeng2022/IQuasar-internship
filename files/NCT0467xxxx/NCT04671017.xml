    <textblock>
      A multicenter, 3-arm randomized dose finding study in the UK to evaluate safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and immunogenicity of a vaccine candidate against Covid-19. 150 healthy volunteers will be&#xD;
      enrolled and receive two shots of the vaccine candidate. All participants who receive two&#xD;
      doses of the vaccine candidate will be invited to participate in the Booster phase.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The multicenter, dose finding Phase 1/2 study starts off with an open-label, dose-escalation&#xD;
      part, thereafter, during the double-blind part of study, participants will be randomized&#xD;
      1:1:1 to receive the low, medium or high dose of the vaccine (VLA2001). All participants will&#xD;
      received a total of two vaccinations intramuscularly, on day 1 and day 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 5 participants in each dose group will receive VLA2001 open label, starting with&#xD;
      the low dose of VLA2001. If no safety concerns are identified, the next 5 subjects will&#xD;
      receive the medium dose of the vaccine. Again, if no safety issues are identified, 5&#xD;
      participants will be vaccinated with the high dose of the vaccine. A Data Safety and&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review accrued safety data before randomization of the remaining&#xD;
      135 subjects across all sites will be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will be followed up for safety and immunogenicity up to approximately&#xD;
      6 months after receiving their second vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was extended to investigate the tolerability, safety and immungenicity of a&#xD;
      booster vaccination with VLA2001. All study participants, in the Booster phase, will be&#xD;
      followed up for safety and immunogenicity up to 6 months after receiving their Booster&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
