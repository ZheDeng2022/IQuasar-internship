  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study, where participants will be given ceftolozane-tazobactam as the&#xD;
      primary treatment for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. Open-label means both the&#xD;
      investigator and the participant will known what drug will be given. Participants will be&#xD;
      followed for approximately 60 days. Ceftolozane-tazobactam is approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for treatment of serious bacterial infection and the investigator&#xD;
      hypothesizes that ceftolozane/tazobactam may be effective as the primary antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.&#xD;
