  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Examine the impact of the protein supplements leucine, HMB and BCAA on muscle recovery and&#xD;
      inflammatory response following acute exercise.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants, both females and males, will perform an acute bout of exercise. A bout of&#xD;
      exercise that will involve multiple drop jumps. Prior to and post exercise, functional&#xD;
      outputs will be measured and blood will be collected to quantify the inflammatory response.&#xD;
      The protocol will involve attending the laboratory on 6 occasions over a two week period to&#xD;
      complete the above measures.&#xD;

    <description>Perform 100 drop jumps from 40 cm height. The protocol is divided into 5 sets of 20 repetitions. Between each repetition participants get 10 seconds, and between each set 2 minutes rest. Stand on the box, drop of the box and land with feet shoulder width apart. Then immediately bend knee to approx 45 degrees and jump straight up. Throughout each jump hands are placed on hips and should not move.</description>
