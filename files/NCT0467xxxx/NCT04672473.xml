    <textblock>
      Tumor-specific antigens can be induced by demethylation drugs. Antigen-targeting DC-CTL cells&#xD;
      supposed to eliminate cancer cells efficiently and specifically. In this study investigators&#xD;
      co-culture DCs cells with peptides derived from tumor specific antigen to generate&#xD;
      antigen-specific DC-CTLs (Ag-CTL). Following treatment with demethylation drugs, Ag-CTL will&#xD;
      be used to eliminate tumor cells. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      Ag-CTL combined with demethylation drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large number of studies have confirmed that demethylated drug decitabine can effectively&#xD;
      induce tumor-specific antigen expression. Tumor-specific antigens have strong specificity and&#xD;
      are ideal therapeutic targets. In this study, tumor-specific antigens were used as&#xD;
      therapeutic targets. The researchers screened the tumor-specific epitope peptides through&#xD;
      bioinformatics database combined with in vitro experiments. The peptide-loaded DCs are&#xD;
      co-cultured with T lymphocytes to induce the proliferation of CTLs, which are then refusion&#xD;
      to tumor patients to treating diseases.&#xD;
