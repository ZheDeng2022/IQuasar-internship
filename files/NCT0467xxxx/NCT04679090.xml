  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of our project is to describe what characteristics (e.g., age, current&#xD;
      physical activity level) women present when starting the exercise program are potentially&#xD;
      associated with an improvement in functional abilities measured with different tests such as&#xD;
      the distance you can cover while walking for six minutes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main research objective is to investigate the relationship between baseline physical&#xD;
      activity and improvement in physical function, quantified using changes in 6-minute walk test&#xD;
      (6MWT) results over the course of the 12-week program. An association is hypothesized to&#xD;
      exist between the two variables even when adjusted for weeks into treatment. The goal of the&#xD;
      6MWT is to cover as much distance as possible in six minutes, using as many breaks s&#xD;
      necessary. The test is often performed using a 20-meter hallway but requires no specific&#xD;
      equipment. A recent study reported that the result of the 6MWT could be used as a measure of&#xD;
      the major components of global health in women with breast cancer, making its use in our&#xD;
      research especially relevant. Aside from physical functions, baseline characteristics will&#xD;
      also be used to determine what characteristics, if any, are associated with health and&#xD;
      psychosocial outcomes such as quality of life, social connectedness/support, and mental&#xD;
      well-being. The data collected is certain to fill a gap in the literature, and will therefore&#xD;
      be likely published in an important journal in the field.&#xD;
