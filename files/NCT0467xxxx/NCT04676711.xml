  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GFH312 is a small molecule inhibitor of receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein-1(RIP1)&#xD;
      kinase, a key regulator of the TNF-α downstream. RIPK1 can regulate the NF- κB signaling and&#xD;
      necroptosis, a type of cell death which can trigger immune response and enhance inflammation.&#xD;
      As such, GFH312 represents a novel, selective mechanism for the treatment of inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the first administration of GFH312 to humans. The purpose of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects. The intention of&#xD;
      this study is to provide confidence in the safety of the molecule to inform progression to&#xD;
      further proof-of-concept studies. The dose range proposed in this study is based on a low&#xD;
      starting dose escalating to supra-therapeutic doses.&#xD;

             mass index (BMI) within the range of 18-32 kg/m2 inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At screening, vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate) will&#xD;
             be assessed in the sitting position after the subject has rested for at least three&#xD;
             minutes, and again (when required) after three minutes in the standing position.&#xD;
             Sitting vital signs should be within the normal ranges.&#xD;

             of becoming pregnant must use highly effective methods of contraception during&#xD;
             intercourse while taking drug and for 30 days after stopping study medication; and&#xD;
             sexually active males must use a condom, during intercourse while taking drug and for&#xD;
             30 days after stopping study medication.&#xD;
