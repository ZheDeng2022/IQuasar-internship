    <textblock>
      This study is planned to compare the effects of Muscle Energy Techniques (MET) with breathing&#xD;
      exercises for improving functional outcomes in patients with fibromyalgia. A randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will be conducted. Sample size would be 26 patients with fibromyalgia&#xD;
      randomly allocated to the Muscle energy techniques group and breathing exercise group. Both&#xD;
      the groups will receive 8 weeks of treatment, 3 times per week. Data will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline 5th week and 8th week. Outcome measurements include a Numeric pain rating scale, 6&#xD;
      min walk test, chest expansion, Pittsburgh sleep quality index, and Fibromyalgia Impact&#xD;
      Questionnaire scores.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common syndrome characterized by widespread pain and at least 11/18&#xD;
      painful tender points (American College of Rheumatology). Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a&#xD;
      rheumatic condition of increasing prevalence worldwide) approximately 2-7% of the populations&#xD;
      are affected. Some of the symptoms associated with fibromyalgia is sleep disturbance,&#xD;
      dizziness, headache, fatigue, depression/tension, pain, cognitive disorder, irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome, and different somatic symptoms. These factors negatively influence physical and&#xD;
      emotional characteristics and decrease the quality of life. Fatigue and dyspnea are the&#xD;
      significant signs and symptoms of fibromyalgia, which can be related to respiratory system&#xD;
      changes. Major affected areas in fibromyalgia include breathing mechanics, the upper&#xD;
      trapezius muscle, the cervical muscle mass, the scalene, Sternocleidomastoid, and the area&#xD;
      around the second rib and all the paravertebral muscle mass. These regions are coordinated&#xD;
      with the tender points placed in the upper half body of patients with FM. Fibromyalgia&#xD;
      patients, without a doubt, exhaust and come to be fatigue due to the dyspnea. It is&#xD;
      widespread among females; however, it can additionally affect both men and teenagers. Many&#xD;
      pharmacological therapies were being used to treat FM with uncertain consequences, and&#xD;
      steadily growing small doses are usually recommended to maximize efficacy. Among non&#xD;
      pharmacological management including exercise is typically endorsed in the management of&#xD;
      patients with fibromyalgia. Regular workout is an essential keystone of fibromyalgia&#xD;
      management. Aerobic workout interventions have shown reduced ache, depression, and fatigue,&#xD;
      improving health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Related literature includes meta-analysis&#xD;
      regarding the exercise effects (endurance, aerobic, or mixed aerobic and strength workout) on&#xD;
      worldwide welfare in people with fibromyalgia. Breathing issues tend to intensify FM&#xD;
      symptoms. The FM patients exhaust quickly, and dyspnea causes fatigue related to respiratory&#xD;
      muscle weakness, mainly diaphragmatic deficiency, that can decrease the physical condition&#xD;
      and capability inside the daily activities. Breathing exercises have been proven to be useful&#xD;
      in decreasing symptoms of FM. MET is the osteopathic manipulation strategies of the tender&#xD;
      tissues that evolved to recover the musculoskeletal system's function and decrease pain. Both&#xD;
      these techniques have proven effects for reduction of symptoms in FM patients. This study is&#xD;
      intended to compare the effects of both in order to find out the technique that can&#xD;
      effectively improve the functional outcomes in patients with fibromyalgia.&#xD;

    <description>The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire is an assessment and evaluation instrument developed to measure fibromyalgia patient status, progress and functional capacity. It has been designed to measure the components of health status that are believed to be the most affected by FM.</description>

    <measure>6 Minute walk test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-min walk test is a submaximal exercise test that entails measurement of distance walk over a span of 6 min. The 6-minute walk distance provides a measure for integrated global response of multiple cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal systems involved in exercise.</description>

    <description>Three exercises will be performed in a circuit, 2 circuits in every session. It will include diaphragmatic breathing exercise in which patient will be in supine position inhaling through nose and expiration through moth with half closed lips. Second exercise pursed lip breathing also in supine position with the hands on abdomen and then inspiration through nose and expiration through mouth with half closing of lips. Third exercise resisted diaphragmatic breathing also in same pattern as second exercise with an addition of 1 kg weight on abdomen.</description>
