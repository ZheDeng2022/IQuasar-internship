      Introduction: Colorectal surgery (CRS) is associated with high morbidity rates, being&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage (AL) one of the most serious complications with an incidence as high as&#xD;
      15%, accounting for up to a third of mortality in these procedures. The identification of&#xD;
      pre-clinical markers may allow an early diagnosis and a timely intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare the performance of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) vs C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP) as early predictors of AL in CRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: A retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients who underwent a colorectal&#xD;
      surgery with anastomosis from June 2015 to April 2019. Receiver-operating characteristic&#xD;
      (ROC) curves were used to find the cutoff points with the best diagnostic performance of AL.&#xD;

      Introduction Colorectal surgery (CRS) has improved immensely over recent decades as a&#xD;
      consequence of better presurgical preparation, antibiotic prophylaxis, surgical technique,&#xD;
      and postoperative management. However, it is may still be associated with somehow high&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality rates. Prospective multicenter studies have demonstrated that 30-day&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality may go up to 35% and 9% respectively. The most frequent postoperative&#xD;
      complications include surgical site infection, intraabdominal abscess, ileus, hemorrhage, and&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage (AL). Of these, AL is considered the most serious, with an incidence that&#xD;
      varies from 3% to 15% and is responsible for up to a third of mortality in these patients. It&#xD;
      is worth noting that most of them become evident between postoperative days 5 and 7, and the&#xD;
      highest rates occur in coloanal anastomosis (10 to 20%). Early detection of serious&#xD;
      postoperative complications such as AL in patients who undergo CRS is crucial for effective&#xD;
      decision-making that anticipates septic complications. Although few markers have been studied&#xD;
      as predictors of postoperative complications, in an era of enhanced recovery after surgery&#xD;
      (ERAS) or Fast Track Surgery in which patients are discharged rapidly, the identification and&#xD;
      use of pre-clinical inflammatory biomarkers may become of utmost importance to allow early&#xD;
      diagnosis of serious complications. C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase reactant of&#xD;
      hepatic synthesis, which raises in most of the inflammatory processes in response to&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines as interleukin (IL) 6, IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and&#xD;
      interferon-gamma. It has been noted that high concentrations of CRP at the third and fourth&#xD;
      postoperative day may be associated with the development of septic intra-abdominal&#xD;
      complications such as AL after CRS. On the other hand, pre and postoperative&#xD;
      neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a simple and costless marker of a subclinical&#xD;
      inflammatory response, has recently been identified as a useful predictor of major&#xD;
      complications after surgery. Moreover, it has been recently suggested that preoperative NLR&#xD;
      might be better than CRP as a predictor of 30-day morbidity after major abdominal surgery.&#xD;
      With regards to CRS, it has been recently suggested that an elevated preoperative NLR may be&#xD;
      a risk factor for major surgical complications following colorectal resection, with a trend&#xD;
      towards the occurrence of AL. Although NLR may be advantageous in the clinical setting given&#xD;
      that it has shown a faster kinetic pattern than CRP in response to surgical trauma, whether&#xD;
      postoperative NLR can early predict the occurrence of AL in after CRS remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study was to determine the value of postoperative NLR as an early&#xD;
      predictor of AL in patients who undergo CRS and compare its diagnostic performance with CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods Study design and population: The current report represents a&#xD;
      single-institution retrospective cohort analysis of a prospectively maintained database. Data&#xD;
      for consecutive patients submitted to colorectal surgery from June 2015 to April 2019 at a&#xD;
      General Surgery Service of a tertiary referral University Hospital was extracted. All&#xD;
      colorectal resections were included in the study analysis regardless on the approach used&#xD;
      (open or laparoscopic), the confection of a diverting loop ostomy or the timing of surgery&#xD;
      (urgent or scheduled). From a total 152 patients, 36 were excluded due to incomplete medical&#xD;
      records, hematological diseases, extra-abdominal infections, definitive colostomy (i.e. Miles&#xD;
      operation), or those who did not have a primary anastomosis (e.g. Hartmann's operation).&#xD;
      Informed consent was obtained for all patients before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Technique and follow-up: All the procedures were performed by staff surgeons,&#xD;
      including a colorectal surgery specialist. Regarding the techniques used for the anastomosis,&#xD;
      all colorectal or ileorectal anastomosis were performed used staplers and ileocolic&#xD;
      anastomosis were either performed using staplers or hand-sewn technique. After discharge, all&#xD;
      patients were controlled through clinical evaluation and routine laboratory tests in an&#xD;
      outpatient office at 2 weeks and 1 month after surgery, and every 4 months thereafter in&#xD;
      oncological patients. Data on each patient was recorded prospectively from the date of index&#xD;
      operation up to a minimum of 12 months after surgery or until death whichever occurred first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables and definitions: Patients demographics, indication for surgery, timing of the&#xD;
      operation (elective or emergency), surgical risk according to ASA (American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists), resection type, surgical approach (open or laparoscopic), need of&#xD;
      diverting ileostomy, hospital stay and postoperative complications were analyzed. The&#xD;
      Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) was used to grade postoperative morbidity, which&#xD;
      integrates in a single formula all the complications suffered by the patient according to the&#xD;
      Clavien-Dindo score, summarizing postoperative (POP) morbidity in a grading score that goes&#xD;
      from 1 to 100. Serum concentration of CRP and NLR during the first 5 postoperative days was&#xD;
      recorded. All patients had complete cytology every day up to day 5 in order to calculate the&#xD;
      ratio between the absolute value of neutrophils and the absolute value of lymphocytes. A CRP&#xD;
      level below 5 mg/dL was considered normal. We analyzed the relationship between the variables&#xD;
      and the development of AL. According to laboratory findings and clinical judgement,&#xD;
      additional imaging studies were employed to rule out AL. AL was defined as suture line&#xD;
      disruption with intestinal content leakage or abscess formation, associated to fever or&#xD;
      abdominal pain, and confirmed by a CT-scan or re-operation up to 3 months after CRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Continuous variables are expressed as means and standard deviation (SD)&#xD;
      for symmetrically distributed, and median (range) for non-symmetrically distributed data.&#xD;
      Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies (percentages). The Mann-Whitney test was&#xD;
      used for comparison of continuous variables and Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test was&#xD;
      used for comparisons of categorical variables between patients with and without AL. The&#xD;
      differences between variables were considered significant at a value of pâ‰¤0.05. Receiver&#xD;
      operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of CRP&#xD;
      and NLR as predictors of AL, determining sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive&#xD;
      predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). The diagnostic accuracy of the&#xD;
      plasmatic markers studied was based on the area under the ROC curve (AUC). We used the Youden&#xD;
      Index to find the cutoff point with the best diagnostic performance of CRP and NLR on the&#xD;
      first five postoperative days. SPSS versiÃ³n 24 and GraphPad version 7 were used for&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
