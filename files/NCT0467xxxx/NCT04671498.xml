  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates if a new type of test called Droplet-BC screening test can classify&#xD;
      breast cancer patients from non-cancer volunteers by circulating small-noncoding RNA in the&#xD;
      blood with a statistical validity. This study also investigates if this test can classify the&#xD;
      subgroup of breast cancer patients with a variety of conditions. Information from this study&#xD;
      may provide a new method of breast cancer screening/diagnosis&#xD;
    </textblock>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Droplet-BC screening test for&#xD;
      distinguishing breast cancer (BC) patients from non-cancer volunteers, using reference data&#xD;
      confirmed at sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the Droplet-BC screening&#xD;
      test for the classification of early-stage BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the Droplet-BC screening&#xD;
      test for classifying patients into non-cancer volunteer (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data&#xD;
      System [BI-RADS] Categories 1 and 2) and BC patient subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the Droplet-BC screening&#xD;
      test to classify different subgroups between non-cancer volunteers (BI-RADS category 1)&#xD;
      versus BC patients plus non-cancer volunteers (BI- RADS category 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the Droplet-BC screening&#xD;
      test for the classification of non-cancer volunteers into BI-RADS categories 0-5 (small&#xD;
      cohort study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the Droplet-BC screening&#xD;
      test for the multi-classification among cancer stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To compare the sensitivity of the Droplet-BC test with mammogram for detecting BC by&#xD;
      extracting a subgroup of BC patients that have mammogram results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To compare the sensitivity of the Droplet-BC test with ultrasound for detecting BC by&#xD;
      extracting a subgroup of BC patients that have ultrasound results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To compare the sensitivity of the Droplet-BC test with MRI for detecting BC by&#xD;
      extracting a subgroup of BC patients that have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To conduct all analyses described above with subgroups of participants matched as closely&#xD;
      as possible for age, race/ethnicity, cancer history, current medication, family history of&#xD;
      cancer, and/or breast cancer gene (BRCA) status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Droplet-BC test to detect cancer among&#xD;
      different age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Droplet-BC test to detect cancer among&#xD;
      individuals of differing ethnicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare expression levels of small ribonucleic acid (RNAs) among different age&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare expression levels of small RNAs among individuals of differing ethnicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo collection of blood sample for the Droplet-BC test. Breast cancer&#xD;
      patients' medical records are also reviewed.&#xD;
