  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PDE MAX is a single arm prospective, feasibility study in up to 15 participants aged one (1)&#xD;
      year and over of PDE MAX for the dietary management of Pyridoxine Dependent Epilepsy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PDE Max is a newly-developed product designed specifically to meet the nutritional&#xD;
      requirements of patients following a lysine-restricted diet for PDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study to evaluate PDE MAX, a food for special medical purposes (FSMP)&#xD;
      for use in the dietary management of Pyridoxine Dependent Epilepsy (PDE) with regards to&#xD;
      acceptability, tolerability, adherence and effect on metabolic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given an eight-week supply of PDE MAX and they will be asked to complete&#xD;
      a daily diary and short questionnaire to record information on: adherence, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tolerance, palatability and how the product is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples will be taken at the beginning and end of the study to measure&#xD;
      several biochemical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical and neurological assessments will be carried out by the local Metabolic Consultant&#xD;
      at the beginning and end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine monitoring of lysine levels will continue.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of Pyridoxine Dependent Epilepsy (PDE), biochemically and/or genetically&#xD;
             confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males or females aged one (1) year and above. Any participant aged 16 years and over&#xD;
             at screening must have the capacity to consent for themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently following a lysine-restricted diet for a minimum of four (4) weeks prior to&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to take the study product and follow advice given by the dietitian.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingly given, written, informed consent from patient or parent/guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingly given, written assent (if appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with the study protocol, in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of additional macro/micronutrient supplements during the study period, unless&#xD;
             clinically indicated and prescribed by the investigator, such as but not limited to&#xD;
             arginine and pyridoxine. In which case, supplementation must have started four (4)&#xD;
             weeks prior to screening with no anticipated changes to intakes during the study&#xD;
             duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are pregnant / breastfeeding at the start of the study or planning to&#xD;
             become pregnant during the study period. Participants of child-bearing potential will&#xD;
             be required to undergo pregnancy test prior to enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        N.B.: Participants who become pregnant unexpectedly during this study may, in consultation&#xD;
        with their doctor, continue on the study's dietary product if they wish but will not have&#xD;
        any investigations that would not normally be carried out during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to any ingredient present in the study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions, which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, would place the subject at increased risk, preclude obtaining voluntary&#xD;
             consent/assent or compliance with required study procedures, or would confound the&#xD;
             objectives of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is participating in any other interventional study and has received any other&#xD;
             investigational drug, product or device within 30 days prior to screening or are&#xD;
             taking part in a non-medication study which, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             interfere with study compliance or outcome assessments.&#xD;
