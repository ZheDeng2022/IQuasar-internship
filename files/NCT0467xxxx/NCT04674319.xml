  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Parkinson's disease use compensatory strategies to overcome typical gait&#xD;
      disturbances. These strategies rely on attentional mechanisms, however people with Parkinson&#xD;
      disease suffer of decline in cognitive function. Therefore, the current study aims at&#xD;
      exploring brain engagement and focus of attention process during walking with these&#xD;
      compensatory strategies, in people with Parkinson disease. Such exploration would assist in&#xD;
      understanding the feasibility of the compensatory strategies in daily lives of people with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      External cues and cognitive movement strategies are common compensatory modes that people&#xD;
      with Parkinson's disease can use to overcome typical gait disturbances. It is suggested that&#xD;
      these modes utilize alternative neural pathways, bypassing the impaired basal ganglia motor&#xD;
      circuits in the brain. In addition, both compensatory modes, in particular the movement&#xD;
      cognitive strategies, are suggested to rely on attentional mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive deficits are common in PwP and include among others, impairment of attention,&#xD;
      particularly in tasks requiring internal control of attention. Considering that gait&#xD;
      compensatory modes may rely on cognitive function, in particular the cognitive movement&#xD;
      strategies, it is not clear whether People with Parkinson's disease can engaged with these&#xD;
      strategies for a prolonged time or distance as in many cases required in daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the objectives of this study are 1) to test the effect of compensatory modes-&#xD;
      external cueing and cognitive movement strategy on gait in prolonged walking. 2) to test&#xD;
      whether people with Parkinson's disease can stay engaged and focus their attention to these&#xD;
      compensatory modes for prolonged time. 3) to test whether subject's cognitive function is&#xD;
      related to the ability to stay engaged with these compensatory modes. Subjects are recruited&#xD;
      from a community physical- therapy groups for people with Parkinson's disease. Healthy older&#xD;
      adults will be recruited from the community and will serve as a control group. Participants&#xD;
      are invited for two separate evaluation sessions that includes: 1. Assessment of background&#xD;
      characteristic: demographic details, severity of disease ( assessed by the Unified&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-UPDRS), Levodopa Equivalent Dose (LED), freezing of gait&#xD;
      questionnaire (FOG-Q) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Evaluation of gait while attending to external cues and cognitive movement strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Evaluation of brain engagement during gait 4. Computerized cognitive assessment&#xD;

    <description>During the walking, measure of attention recruitment during walking is applied by a single-channel EEG system (Brain-MARC LTD). The system simplifies EEG analysis to adjust the extraction of relevant attention-related markers from ongoing EEG. EEG is sampled using the MindWave dry electrode system [25], with one frontal electrode (∼Fpz) and one reference electrode on the earlobe. The sampled data are transferred through a wireless connection to the experiment computer, where the signal is processed. An algorithm is calaculating</description>

The Staged Information Processing Speed test measures information processing at increasing levels of complexity. The test is comprised of three levels of information processing load: single digits, two-digit arithmetic problems (e.g., 5-1), and three-digit arithmetic problems (e.g., 3+2-1). Participants are presented with a series of digits or arithmetic problems (as per the level) and are instructed to respond as quickly as possible by pressing the left mouse button if the digit or result is less than or equal to 4 and the right mouse button if it is greater than 4. Outcome parameters for each rate increment for each level include accuracy, response time and its</description>

    <description>NeuroTrax™ computerized tests assess brain wellness across an array of cognitive domains. Specifically, Finger Tapping tests motor skills. Participants are presented with a white rectangle, which fills with red from left to right over 12 sec. The task requires the participant to tap the left mouse button as many times as possible while the rectangle fills with red. The outcome parameters for this test include inter-tap interval and associated variance (in milliseconds) for the participant's dominant hand.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive function-'Catch' Game</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>NeuroTrax™ computerized tests assess brain wellness across an array of cognitive domains. Specifically, the 'Catch' Game tests abilities of Executive Function and Motor Skills. During the 'Catch' Game participants see a rectangular white object falling vertically from the top of the screen. Their task is to &quot;catch&quot; the object before it reaches the bottom of the screen by positioning the rectangular green paddle directly in the path of the falling object. Responses are made with the participant's best hand. The rate of the falling object increases incrementally as the test continues making it increasingly difficult to &quot;catch&quot; the object in time. Outcome parameters include response time and associated variance for the first move, number of direction changes per trial, error for missed catches, and a total performance score.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive function-Problem Solving</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>NeuroTrax™ computerized tests assess brain wellness across an array of cognitive domains. Specifically,the NeuroTrax Problem Solving test is a non-verbal IQ test that assesses the ability to appreciate the spatial relationships among geometric forms that constitute a pattern. Participants are presented with an incomplete pattern consisting of three squares containing simple geometric forms in a particular configuration. Six additional squares containing geometric forms are presented along the bottom of the screen. Responses with the keyboard number pad indicate which of the six forms best completes the pattern. The spatial relationships among the simple geometric forms become more complex as the test progresses, and the test is adaptive in that it terminates early when performance is poor. The outcome parameter for this test consists of a total accuracy score that incorporates performance at differing levels of difficulty.</description>

    <intervention_name>external cues and cogntive movement strategies</intervention_name>
    <description>external cueing are sensory stimuli such as auditory (e.g. rhythmic metronome beats) or or visual (e.g. spaced lines on the floor). Cognitive movement strategies refer to focusing attention on a specific parameter of gait (e.g. step length, arm swing).&#xD;
In the study participants walk under four walking conditions:1)usuall (baseline) walking 2)walking while attending to external cues wich will be applied via metronome beats. The number of beats per minute is adjusted to each participant's steps number per minute. 3)walking with movement cognitive strategy: participants are requested to focus on their step length- and focus on increasing their step length while walking 4) Dual tasking-walking while performing a cognitive task.&#xD;
During the four walking conditions Brain engegament will be measured, using the single-channel EEG system (Brain-MARC LTD) described in the follwing outcomes measures section.</description>
