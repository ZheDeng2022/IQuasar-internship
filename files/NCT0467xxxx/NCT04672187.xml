    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy of preoperative HRCT of the temporal bone&#xD;
      combined with the preoperative audiologic assessment compared with the intraoperative&#xD;
      endoscopic middle ear finding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The information of the preoperative HRCT scanning of the middle ear cavity in cholesteatoma&#xD;
      combined with the preoperative audiologic assessment could be informed the intraoperative&#xD;
      middle ear finding in the patients who were diagnosed with chronic otitis media with&#xD;
      cholesteatoma, which influence the plan of surgical management. Whether these preoperative&#xD;
      assessments can predict the intraoperative finding is unclear. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the accuracy of preoperative HRCT of the temporal bone combined with the preoperative&#xD;
      audiologic assessment compared with the intraoperative endoscopic middle ear finding.&#xD;

        We prospectively evaluated the preoperative HRCT scanning of the temporal bone and&#xD;
        preoperative audiologic assessment compared with an intraoperative endoscopic finding of&#xD;
        patients who were diagnosed with chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma and scheduled to a&#xD;
        primary surgery at Otolaryngology department, Songklanagarind hospital, Prince of Songkla&#xD;
        University between November 2017 to November 2019.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The patients included in this study had otorrhea, hearing loss, or aural fullness that&#xD;
             last more than 3 months. Otological examination revealed tympanic membrane perforation&#xD;
             or retraction, along with cholesteatoma.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had a previous temporal bone fracture, concomitant with congenital&#xD;
             craniofacial anomalies, or underwent previous otologic surgery were excluded.&#xD;
