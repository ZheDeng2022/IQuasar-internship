  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to evaluate if 12 or 24 weeks of treatment with GSK3228836 followed by&#xD;
      up to 24 weeks of pegylated interferon (PegIFN) can increase the rate of hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      surface antigen (HBsAg) loss in participants on stable nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) therapy,&#xD;
      and whether virologic response can be sustained once PegIFN treatment is discontinued.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive GSK3228836 for 12 or 24 weeks followed by up to 24&#xD;
      weeks of PegIFN.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma as evidenced by the following: Alpha-&#xD;
             fetoprotein concentration &gt;=200 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL); If the screening&#xD;
             alpha fetoprotein concentration is &gt;=50 ng/mL and &lt;200 ng/mL, the absence of liver&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Low complement 3 (C3) at screening and evidence of past history or current&#xD;
             manifestations of vasculitic/inflammatory/auto-immune conditions. All participants&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants requiring anti-coagulation therapies (for example warfarin, Factor Xa&#xD;
             inhibitors or anti-platelet agents like clopidogrel).&#xD;

             have a history of diabetes, hypertension or other risk factors that may affect renal&#xD;
             function and discuss with the Medical Monitor, or designee.&#xD;
