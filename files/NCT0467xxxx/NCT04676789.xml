    <textblock>
      Aim of the trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sintilimab and pegaspargase in&#xD;
      combination with pegaspargase for the initial treatment of previously untreated patients with&#xD;
      limited stage NK/T cell lymphoma.All eligible patients will be treated with sintilimab&#xD;
      combined with pegaspargase administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by standard&#xD;
      radiotherapy with or without concurrent sintilimab and pegaspargase administered every 3&#xD;
      weeks. After radiotherapy, patients with complete remission with positive plasma EBV-DNA or&#xD;
      partial response will continue with sintilimab maintenance up to 2 years.&#xD;

      This is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase II clinical study to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of sintilimab and pegaspargase in combination with pegaspargase for the initial&#xD;
      treatment of previously untreated patients with limited stage NK/T cell lymphoma.All eligible&#xD;
      patients will be firstly treated with sintilimab combined with pegaspargase administered&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. If the patient achieves complete remission（CR）, standard&#xD;
      radiotherapy will be performed, otherwise, they will receive concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy（CCRT）(radiation 50 Gy and two cycles of sintilimab and pegaspargase every 3&#xD;
      weeks). After radiotherapy or CCRT, patients achieving CR with positive plasma EBV-DNA or&#xD;
      partial response will continue with sintilimab maintenance up to 2 years.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
