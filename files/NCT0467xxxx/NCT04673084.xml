      :The investigators aim to provide trauma patient with the best and most efficient managment&#xD;
      options and long-term stability with the least complications by comparing the effect of under&#xD;
      water seal alone of chest tube in one groups of trauma patients and the effect of both under&#xD;
      water seal and suction in other group and the benefits of one versus the other in duration of&#xD;
      hospital stay and to assess short-term post-traumatic complications ,also to assess&#xD;
      effectiveness of adding suction and patient satisfaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumas are the leading cause of death in the first four decades of life and are mostly&#xD;
      caused by traffic accidents. Thoracic traumas might lead to severe consequences, even though&#xD;
      less than 50% of them required a surgical revision. Thoracic traumas can be divided in blunt&#xD;
      or penetrating, according to the presence of open wound in the chest. Blunt traumas are the&#xD;
      most frequent type of chest trauma with or without rib fractures that might be associated&#xD;
      with haemothorax, pneumothorax or haemopneumothorax that are the most typical lesions or&#xD;
      laceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pleural chest tubes are used to reestablish negative intrathoracic pressure after disruption&#xD;
      of the pleural space. Chest tube positioning is considered necessary in case of a pleural&#xD;
      disruption with pneumothorax; intrapleural bleeding causing haemothorax; or in case of&#xD;
      pneumo-haemothorax .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of pleural chest tubes with primarily under water seal or added suction is the&#xD;
      subject of debate, and the benefits of one versus the other in regards to duration of air&#xD;
      leak, amount of time the chest tube is in place, length of hospital stay and incidence of&#xD;
      complications are unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the previous made us interesting to examine the effect of under water seal alone of&#xD;
      chest tube in one groups of trauma patients and the effect of both under water seal and&#xD;
      suction in other group, the investigators think that power of suction will give the patient&#xD;
      better results with less complications and excellent immediate relief with good quality of&#xD;
      life, rapid return to normal life .&#xD;
