  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of resection of one or both slips&#xD;
      of the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon versus the A1 pulley division.&#xD;

      The preoperative visit occurred a number of weeks or months prior to surgery. Surgeons from&#xD;
      the Centre de la main at the CHUV in Lausanne recruited the subjects during their&#xD;
      consultations. During this initial visit, the patient was asked about his problem, his&#xD;
      general health and a clinical examination (including range of motion of finger joints,&#xD;
      pulp-to-palm distance, pain evaluated with a VAS) was performed. Once the diagnosis of&#xD;
      trigger finger was established, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were evaluated. If the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria were fulfilled, the patients were offered to be part of the study. They&#xD;
      received oral and written information about the study and the surgeons gave further&#xD;
      explanation if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the surgery day, the signed consent form was recovered. Participants were randomized in&#xD;
      two groups according to a computer-generated list ranging from 01 to 60&#xD;
      (www.randomization.com). Surgery was then performed according to the method chosen by&#xD;
      randomization. The possible occurrence of adverse effects during surgery was monitored. All&#xD;
      information was recorded on the case report forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first postoperative visit occurred 1 week ± 3 days after surgery. The surgeons evaluated&#xD;
      the wound to exclude the presence of postoperative complication (infection, hematoma, nerve&#xD;
      or tendon injury) and answer any question the patient could have. Range of motion and pain&#xD;
      were recorded. All information was recorded on the case report forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second postoperative visit occurred 4 weeks ± 5 days after surgery. The appointment was&#xD;
      conducted in the same way as the previous one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients could choose to be withdrawn from the study at any point. The follow-up was similar&#xD;
      to that of patients included in the study.&#xD;
