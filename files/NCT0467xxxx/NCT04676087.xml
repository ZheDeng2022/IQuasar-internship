  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial investigates the side effects of mogamulizumab and extracorporeal&#xD;
      photopheresis and to see how well they work in treating patients with Sezary syndrome or&#xD;
      mycosis fungoides. Mogamulizumab (a humanized antibody) binds to CCR4, a protein often found&#xD;
      in high amounts on T-cell lymphoma cells. Binding to these cells may slow their growth, as&#xD;
      well as mark them for attack by the immune system. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is a&#xD;
      standard treatment for cancers that affects the skin, and may work by killing some lymphoma&#xD;
      cells directly and by boosting the body's immune response against other lymphoma cells.&#xD;
      Giving mogamulizumab together with ECP may work better in treating patients with Sezary&#xD;
      syndrome or mycosis fungoides compared to either therapy alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of mogamulizumab and ECP in&#xD;
      Sezary syndrome (SS) and erythrodermic mycosis fungoides (MF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the efficacy of the combination of mogamulizumab and extra-corporeal&#xD;
      photopheresis in SS and erythrodermic MF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess response by disease compartment, time to response, duration of response,&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS), and change in quality of life in patients with Sezary&#xD;
      syndrome and erythrodermic MF treated with mogamulizumab and ECP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess biomarkers of response and changes in immunologic response on serial blood&#xD;
      samples and peripheral blood flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION (WEEKS 1-7): Patients receive mogamulizumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 36 in the absence of disease progression progression and unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients also undergo extracorporeal photopheresis on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT (CYCLES 1-12): Patients receive mogamulizumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15,&#xD;
      and undergo extracorporeal photopheresis on days 1 and 15 of cycles 1-6, then day 1 of&#xD;
      subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE (CYCLES 13+): Patients with clinical benefit may continue extracorporeal&#xD;
      photopheresis on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression and&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 90 days, then every 3&#xD;
      months for 3 years.&#xD;
