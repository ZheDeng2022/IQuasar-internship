    <textblock>
      With the combination of robotic and 5G network communication technology, telemedicine becomes&#xD;
      more and more feasible and efficient. Magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy (MCE) has&#xD;
      been confirmed to have comparable accuracy with conventional gastroscopy with the advantages&#xD;
      of comfort and convenience. 5G communication technology has been applied to several fields in&#xD;
      telemedicine, but its effectiveness, safety, and stability in remote magnetically controlled&#xD;
      capsule endoscopy for upper gastrointestinal tract examination have not been established. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic utility, safety, feasibility and patient's&#xD;
      acceptability of remote magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy system under 5G network.&#xD;

      With the combination of robotic and 5G network communication technology, telemedicine becomes&#xD;
      more and more feasible and efficient. On the one hand, telemedicine can conserve and optimize&#xD;
      medical resources, providing high-quality medical services to unbalanced areas, such as rural&#xD;
      areas, stricken areas and battlefields. On the other hand, telemedicine can reduce the time&#xD;
      spent by patients waiting for examination and treatment and thus prevent diseases from&#xD;
      worsening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy (MCE) has been confirmed to have comparable&#xD;
      accuracy with conventional gastroscopy with the advantages of comfort and convenience. 5G&#xD;
      communication technology has been applied to several fields in telemedicine, but its&#xD;
      effectiveness, safety, and stability in remote magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy for&#xD;
      upper gastrointestinal tract examination have not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5G-MCE system was provided by Ankon Technologies Co, Ltd (Shanghai, China), this system&#xD;
      consists of three parts: remote console, remote control software (NaviRemoteCtrl), and remote&#xD;
      connection software (NaviRemoteConn). The remote console (based in Shanghai), takes the&#xD;
      endoscopist's input and translates it into a control signal. After network transmission, the&#xD;
      patient side cart (based in Yinchuan) translates the control signal into actual instrument&#xD;
      manipulation. The images captured by the capsule are simultaneously sent back to the screen&#xD;
      of the remote console, and thus provide guidance for better control of the capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic utility, safety, feasibility and&#xD;
      patient's acceptability of remote magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy system under 5G&#xD;
      network.&#xD;

    <description>There will be 20 volunteers assigned to the 5G-MCE system group. These patients will accept the magnetically controlled capsule examination in Yinchuan. After an overnight fasting and drinking 800-1000 mL water and simethicone for gastric dilatation and preparation, the subjects put on the data recorder with the help of the assistant in Yinchuan. Then, the assistant activated the capsule with the capsule locator. The patient is instructed to swallow the capsule with a small amount of water to effectively observe the esophagus and dentate line. After the capsule entering into the stomach, the examination will be performed through the 5G-MCE system by the endoscopist (W.Z.), with experience of more than 1000 cases of MCE operation, in Shanghai.</description>

    <description>There will be 20 volunteers assigned to the MCE system group as comparator group. After an overnight fasting and drinking 800-1000 mL water and simethicone for gastric dilatation and preparation, the subjects put on the data recorder with the help of the endoscopist. Then, the endoscopist activated the capsule with the capsule locator. The patient is instructed to assume the left lateral decubitus position and to swallow the capsule with a small amount of water to effectively observe the esophagus and dentate line. Then, under the guidance of the endoscopist (W.Z.) face to face, subject continue the examination of stomach and duodenum.</description>

    <description>The endoscopist (W.Z.) manipulated the two joysticks on the remote console (based in Shanghai). Then the remote control software and remote connection software takes the endoscopist's input and translates it into a control signal. After network transmission, the patient side cart (based in Yinchuan) translates the control signal into actual instrument manipulation and mobilize the robotic magnetic arm, and simultaneously driving the precise movement and rotation of the capsule to perform the gastric and duodenum examination. Meanwhile, the images captured by the capsule are simultaneously sent back to the screen of the remote console, and thus provide guidance for better control of the capsule.</description>
