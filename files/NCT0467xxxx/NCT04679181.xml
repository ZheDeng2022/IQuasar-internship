      While depend elderly people needs are important in Nursing Home, the medical resources are&#xD;
      weak from both inside and outside residences located in a medical desert. The goal of this&#xD;
      project is to measure the acceptability of Artificial Intelligence and Telemedicine in&#xD;
      Nursing Home located in medical desert for patients, nurses, and medical doctor&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ageing of the population comes along with the problematic of chronic pathologies and&#xD;
      dependence, with sometimes serious consequences resulting in an admission in Nursing Home.&#xD;
      While the low require a medical doctor in each Nursing Home, one third of the Nursing Home&#xD;
      does not have. Some Nursing Homes can be in a tricky situation with no medical doctor&#xD;
      coordinator and the difficulty of access to a medical doctor who covered a wide territory. In&#xD;
      this context, the emergence of Artificial Intelligence coupled with Telemedicine is a new&#xD;
      opportunity to find solution in healthcare organization and to develop advanced geriatric&#xD;
      medical practice in medical desert territory. The goal of this study is to quantify and&#xD;
      characterize the acceptability of Artificial Intelligence and Telemedicine in Nursing Home&#xD;
      located in medical desert for patients, nurses, and medical doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients were examined by a nurse. The symptoms filled by the nurse in the Artificial&#xD;
      Intelligence/Telemedicine device are sent and then analyzed by a distant medical doctor to&#xD;
      purpose a care. The nurse also solicited the attending medical doctor as usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommendations of the both medical doctors could be (i) Vital emergency, (ii) non-vital&#xD;
      emergency necessitate medication or hospitalization, and (iii) non-emergency with medical&#xD;
      appointment.&#xD;
