  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR1459 in participants&#xD;
      with NMOSDs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Therefore, the investigators of this study are investigating whether SHR1459 could prevent&#xD;
      relapse of NMOSDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of SHR1459 in NMOSDs&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety profile of SHR 1459 in patients with NMOSDs. Whether SHR1459 reduce MRI lesions&#xD;
      and APQ4-Abs level.&#xD;
