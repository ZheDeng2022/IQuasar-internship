      The purpose of this preliminary study is to examine the effects of a guided online acceptance&#xD;

      This project will employ a one-group pretest-posttest design to investigate the effects of a&#xD;
      guided online acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) intervention combined with&#xD;
      psychoeducation on quality of life and mental health of people with spinal cord injury (SCI)&#xD;
      who experience psychological distress. After the pretest evaluation, eligible participants&#xD;
      will receive 8 weekly sessions, including 6 ACT sessions and 2 psychoeducation sessions,&#xD;
      delivered by trained coaches through Zoom videoconferencing. Each session lasts for one hour.&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures will be psychological distress measured by the Depression, Anxiety&#xD;
      and Stress Scale (DASS)- 21 and Spinal Cord Injury - Quality of Life (SCI-QOL). A one-time&#xD;
      interview at the completion of the 8 sessions will be conducted to explore participants'&#xD;
      experiences in the sessions.&#xD;
