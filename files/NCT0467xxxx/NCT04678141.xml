  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was aimed to evaluate the clinical performance of resin-hybrid composite and compomer&#xD;
      materials in primary molars over a 2-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children aged 5-6 years with at least two carious proximal surface primary molars were&#xD;
      screened for resin-hybrid composite (Kerr Herculite Classic) and compomer (Dyract XP and R&amp;D&#xD;
      Series Nova) restorations. The restorations were clinically evaluated after 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,&#xD;
      18 and 24 months using the modified United States Public Health Service criteria&#xD;

      All treatment stages were performed by an experienced pediatric dentist (E.O). When&#xD;
      necessary, patients were administered topical anesthesia with 2% Xylocaine® DENTAL, followed&#xD;
      by local anesthesia with epinephrine 1: 100.000 (lidocaine HCl and epinephrine Injection,&#xD;
      DENTSPLY Pharmaceutical, USA). Access to the proximal surfaces was provided with high-speed&#xD;
      diamond bur (FD.D.801, Frank Dental) under an air-water coolant.The proximal cavity was&#xD;
      opened at the occlusal level. Soft carious dentine was cleaned with a round low-speed steel&#xD;
      burs (SS.1A, Frank Dental). Bevelling was not applied to the cavity. Restorations were placed&#xD;
      under isolation with cotton rolls and saliva ejector. Ca(OH)2 cavity liner material (Hydrocal&#xD;
      LC, Medicept Dental, India) was used as base material ıf the distance from the pulp was not&#xD;
      safe. A metal matrix band (Matrix band, Hahnenkratt, Königsbach-Stein, Germany) with a&#xD;
      universal matrix system (Tofflemire, Hahnenkratt, Königsbach-Stein, Germany) and wooden&#xD;
      wedges (TDV, No 1) was applied to the tooth. ClearfilTM SE Bond was applied to the cavity&#xD;
      according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the polymerization, a LED curing light&#xD;
      (Eliapar Freelight, 3M ESPE Dental Products, America) with a light power density of 600&#xD;
      mW/cm2 was used. According to the manufacturer's instructions, A2 composite resin (Kerr&#xD;
      Herculite Classic) and two different compomer materials (Dyract/XP and R&amp;D Series NOVA) were&#xD;
      applied to the teeth with the incremental technique, each increment being light-polymerized&#xD;
      for 20 s with a LED curing light. Occlusal interferences were checked with carbon paper&#xD;
      (Accufilm II, Parkell, USA) and corrected using superﬁne diamond burs (Diatech, Heerbrugg,&#xD;
      Switzerland) and polishers (Polydentia). During the preparation, if the pulp tissue was&#xD;
      exposed, the treatment was performed and the teeth excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical evaluation, the patients were followed up for a total of 24 months. The&#xD;
      restorations were evaluated by an experienced pediatric dentist (E.O) according to modified&#xD;
      United States Public Health Service (USPHS) Ryge criteria in terms of anatomic form, marginal&#xD;
      discoloration, marginal integrity, surface texture, secondary caries, color match and&#xD;
      retention.In scoring the restorations; Alpha (A), Bravo (B) and Charlie (C) scores were used.&#xD;
      A and B scores were clinically acceptable/successful, C scores were unacceptable/unsuccessful&#xD;
      restorative treatment. The evaluations were carried out with a mirror and explorer. At&#xD;
      pre-treatment and follow-ups, dental caries experience was assessed by dft (decayed filled&#xD;
      primary teeth) index. For ethical reasons, before the treatment, the existing caries of each&#xD;
      patient were restored and topical fluoride was applied. Oral hygiene education was given to&#xD;
      all patients and their parents. If a patient needs any treatment at the follow-up visits, the&#xD;
      procedure will be performed by dentist.&#xD;
