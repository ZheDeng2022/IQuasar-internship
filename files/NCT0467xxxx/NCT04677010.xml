    <textblock>
      Wheelchair bound patients often have pain in lower back and glutes, constipation and reduced&#xD;
      quality of life - symptoms that exercise might ameliorate. However, in wheelchair bound&#xD;
      patients with muscular dystrophies and cerebral palsy only very little research is done on&#xD;
      exercise. We thus wish to investigate effects of cycle exercise in wheelchair bound patients&#xD;
      with muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wheelchair bound patients with MD or CP live a sedentary life, and probably because of this,&#xD;
      many experience pain in lower back and glutes, obstipation, reduced quality of life, reduced&#xD;
      activity of daily living and social withdrawal. Exercise is likely to reduce these symptoms.&#xD;
      However, research in exercising patients confined to a wheelchair lacks 3 things: 1) Most&#xD;
      research is done in patients that are wheelchair bound due to stroke, and these results are&#xD;
      not necessarily transferable to patients with MD or CP. Patients with stroke differ from&#xD;
      patients with MD and CP since they can potentially gain walking ability again, they have had&#xD;
      walking ability up to the stroke, they are only hemiparetic and thus have normal function in&#xD;
      the rest of the body, their muscles are atrophic but otherwise healthy and they have no&#xD;
      contractures. 2) Most research in exercise in patients with MD or CP focuses on preventing&#xD;
      patients from being wheelchair bound - only very little research is done in the most severely&#xD;
      affected patients that are wheelchair bound, although many of their symptoms can potentially&#xD;
      be ameliorated by exercise. 3) To date, research in exercise in wheelchair bound patients&#xD;
      with MD or CP has primarily consisted of arm cycling. It has been shown to reduce BMI and&#xD;
      improve cardiorespiratory status, endurance, muscle strength and activities of daily living,&#xD;
      but not without complications. The upper limbs consist of small muscle groups that are easily&#xD;
      fatigued and therefore proper cardiopulmonary fitness is difficult to obtain. The risk of&#xD;
      upper limb overuse injuries is high, reducing patients function and activities of daily&#xD;
      living. Presently, there is no feasible and acceptable way to exercise for this large patient&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have tested a cycle ergometer for the lower limbs that can be used while&#xD;
      the patients sit in their own wheelchair. It has a motor, since most patients are not able to&#xD;
      turn the pedals themselves, and a sensor that can measure how much patients contribute to&#xD;
      cycling. They have tested 3 wheelchair bound patients. After training, they all experienced&#xD;
      reduced pain in lower back and glutes, less obstipation and increased energy. Surprisingly,&#xD;
      the heart rate increased during exercise by up to 65 beats even in patients that could not&#xD;
      turn the pedals themselves, indicating cardiovascular fitness. To test this form of exercise&#xD;
      in a larger group of patients that are wheelchair bound due to MD or CP will be of great&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is thus:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to test a cycle ergometer for lower limbs in patients who are wheelchair bound due to MD&#xD;
           or CP to find a feasible and acceptable way to exercise in order to increase health and&#xD;
           quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to investigate if patients unable to move their legs will have effect of the training.&#xD;
