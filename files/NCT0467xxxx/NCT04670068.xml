      This is single center, open-label phase 1 dose escalation trial that uses modified 3+3 design&#xD;
      to identify a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CAR.B7-H3 T cell product. An expansion&#xD;
      cohort will enroll additional subjects at the RP2D for a total enrollment of up to 21&#xD;
      subjects on the protocol.&#xD;

      This study is intended for the patients who have been diagnosed with Epithelial Ovarian&#xD;
      Cancer that either came back or did not improve after previous treatments. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to test the safety of using a new treatment called autologous T lymphocyte&#xD;
      chimeric antigen receptor cells against the B7-H3 antigen (CAR.B7-H3 T cells) in patients&#xD;
      with ovarian cancer. This treatment has not been approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigator's goal is to calculate the Maximum tolerated dose of the CAR.B7-H3&#xD;
      cells There are two parts to this study. In part 1, subject's blood sample will be used to&#xD;
      manufacture the CAR.B7-H3 T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian cancer cells carry a substance called B7-H3 which is not found in other healthy&#xD;
      cells. the subject's T cells will be modified to make CAR.B7-H3 T cells so they may attack&#xD;
      and destroy ovarian cancer cells that carry the B7-H3 substance. The CAR.B7-H3 T cells are&#xD;
      given through a catheter in the abdomen, after completing three rounds of lymphodepletion&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy prepares the body to receive the CAR.B7-H3 T&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part 2 of the study, the subjects will receive the CAR.B7-H3 T cells. Eligible patients&#xD;
      will receive lymphodepletion chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine for three&#xD;
      consecutive days. If they continue to meet the eligibility criteria, the modified CAR.B7-H3 T&#xD;
      cells will be given to them 2-14 days after the last lymphodepletion chemotherapy session.&#xD;
      Three infusions of the CAR.B7-H3 T cells may be given to the subject through a catheter in&#xD;
      the abdomen. Infusions will be done once a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphodepletion chemotherapy and infusion of the CAR.B7-H3 T cells will happen at UNC Cancer&#xD;
      Hospital. On the days the subjects receive the CAR.B7-H3 T cells infusion- Blood, fluid, and&#xD;
      tumor samples will be collected from the subject for research purposes. Tumor biopsies are a&#xD;
      mandatory part of this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post infusion visits are - 3, 4, and 6 weeks. Additional visits will happen every 3 months&#xD;
      for one year after the last infusion. Similar follow-up clinic visits will be completed&#xD;
      annually, for a total of 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a research study to obtain new information that may help people in the future.&#xD;

    <description>Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessments will include toxicities that are at least possibly related to CAR.B7-H3 T cell product and that onset from day of initial cell product infusion through 4 weeks after the final cell product administration. DLTs are specified as ≥ Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) event that does not decrease to Grade ≤ 2 within 7 days, Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS), or any other ≥ Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity, including allergic reactions to T cell infusions.Toxicity will be classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (AEs) (CTCAE, version 5.0), with grading (severity) from grade 1 (mild) to grade 5 (death). ICANS will be graded according to the criteria outlined in the protocol on a scale from 1 (mild) to 4 (critical).

    <description>Up to 12 patients will receive three weekly CAR.B7-H3 T cell product infusions at the same dose. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), a modified 3+3 dose escalation design will be used to evaluate two dose levels: Dose Level 1 (7.5x10^7 cells/infusion), Dose Level 2 (2x10^8 cells/infusion). If this dose is not tolerated, then a lower dose of 3.75 × 10^6 cells/infusion will be explored. Up to 3 dose levels of CAR.B7-H3 cells will be tested with at least 3 patients enrolled at each dose cohort before dose escalation is considered based on the incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT). An expansion cohort will enroll up to 9 patients at the recommended phase 2 dose. Prior to receiving the infusions, patients will undergo lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.</description>
