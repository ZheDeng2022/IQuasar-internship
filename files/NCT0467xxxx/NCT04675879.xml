  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the investigators' prospective randomized study, the investigator will investigate the&#xD;
      effect of different bandage types on functional and radiological results of proximal humerus&#xD;
      fractures over 18 years of age, for whom conservative treatment is decided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent studies, it has been shown that surgical treatment in proximal humerus fractures&#xD;
      has a high complication rate and is also not superior to conservative treatments in terms of&#xD;
      functional results. Therefore, the importance of conservative treatment is increasing day by&#xD;
      day in this group of fractures, especially in elderly patients with high risk for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these studies in the literature, the method in conservative treatment is not clearly&#xD;
      specified, and the investigator will apply 3 different bandages to adjust the rotation of the&#xD;
      shoulder in 3 different ways during the investigators' conservative treatment. The&#xD;
      investigator will compare functional and radiological results between these groups.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proximal humerus fractures, who are admitted to the investigators' emergency department and&#xD;
      are decided to follow conservative follow-up criteria, will be given one of 3 different&#xD;
      bandages (velpau bandage, classical shoulder arm sling, 30 degree padded shoulder arm sling)&#xD;
      according to the previous randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routinely, at the 2nd week, 6th week, 12th week, 6th month and 12th month outpatient clinic&#xD;
      controls, the patients will be seen and their X-ray and clinical satisfaction status will be&#xD;
      checked. X-rays will be taken as classical ap / lateral and true ap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the second week, which is absolute immobilization, elbow and wrist movements&#xD;
      will begin. Afterwards, in the 6th week, according to the state of union with deltoid&#xD;
      strengthening, passive and active shoulder joint range of motion exercises will be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 12th month, the follow-up will be terminated, and in this control, the&#xD;
      existing joint movements will be recorded by measuring the degrees of anterior elevation,&#xD;
      abduction, external rotation in neutral, external rotation at 90 degrees and internal&#xD;
      rotation. In addition, in this control, the values will be noted by taking the Constant,&#xD;
      ASES, DASH and VAS Scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all these values are noted for all 3 groups, statistical analysis between groups will&#xD;
      be made for each variable and the result will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, if complications(non-union,mal-union,stiffness etc.) occur during conservative&#xD;
      follow-up in the investigators' patients, they will be recorded and whether there is a&#xD;
      statistically significant difference in complications between the groups will be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' aim in this study is to understand whether any of these 3 different&#xD;
      bandage types, which are routinely used as an immobilization method in proximal humerus&#xD;
      fractures, are superior to the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study comparing immobilization methods could not be found in the literature. These bandage&#xD;
      types, which have not been compared with their effectiveness, are used effectively all over&#xD;
      the world. With this study, the investigator set this on a scientific basis and set the&#xD;
      correct direction of the investigators' treatments as the investigators' main goal.&#xD;
