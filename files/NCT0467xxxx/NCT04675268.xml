  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to evaluate the variability of oxygen (and PPG) parameters&#xD;
      during 7 nights at home. Oxygen (and PPG) parameters will also be evaluated during 1 night at&#xD;
      the hospital (diagnostic polysomnography).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on currently developed algorithms, surrogate apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), cardiovascular&#xD;
      status and the variability of these parameters will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the variability in nocturnal oxygen (and PPG)&#xD;
      parameters during 7 consecutive nights at home and to identify clinical predictors of&#xD;
      variability in patients with suspected OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding sleep position, alcohol intake and sleep duration will be evaluated (these&#xD;
      parameters could be important to explain variability).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional objectives are to compare the parameters measured at home with the parameters&#xD;
      measured during an in-hospital polysomnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also evaluate variability in the surrogate AHI described by the group&#xD;
      based on the measurements at home and the impact of multi-night evaluation of oxygen (and&#xD;
      PPG) parameters on the recently developed mICS algorithm will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a first explorative approach for further (multi-site) work to define the burden&#xD;
      of OSA associated with cardiovascular or psychofunctional problems.&#xD;
