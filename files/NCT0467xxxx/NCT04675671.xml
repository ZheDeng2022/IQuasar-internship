  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective postoperative pain control after arthroscopic shoulder surgery optimizes&#xD;
      postoperative rehabilitation, reduces anxiety, and can increase patient satisfaction and&#xD;
      postoperative healing by providing amnesia and sedation. Few literature is available for&#xD;
      postoperative pain management, including intra-articular local anesthetic infiltration,&#xD;
      regional nerve blocks, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with intravenous opioid, and oral&#xD;
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and gabapentinoid drugs. Recently, gabapentinoides such as&#xD;
      pregabalin have also shown to have potential in the treatment of acute postoperative pain as&#xD;
      part of multimodal analgesia, due to their possible opioid consumption-reducing effects and&#xD;
      prevention of post-surgical chronic pain. Pregabalin is an anticonvulsant drug that reduces&#xD;
      calcium entry into the nerve terminals of the central nerve and also reduces levels of&#xD;
      substance P, glutamate and noradrenaline, all of which play a major role in creating a&#xD;
      feeling of pain. It is well known that pregabalin reduces central sensitization and&#xD;
      hyperalgesia after tissue injury by inhibiting calcium influx in voltage-gated calcium&#xD;
      channels. These theoretical advantages have led to clinical trials to confirm the analgesic&#xD;
      effectiveness of oral pregabalin for postoperative pain management in various surgical&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

      One day before the scheduled surgery, a staff who was not included in this study will assign&#xD;
      patients to the random Pregabalin group (n = 30) and the Control group (n = 30) according to&#xD;
      a will be computerized randomization table. The hospital pharmacy will prepare all&#xD;
      medications in same capsules, and all the medications of study drug will performe by a nurse,&#xD;
      who was not involved in other process of this study administered the capsules orally with&#xD;
      sips of water. Group pregabalin patients will receive 75 mg of pregabalin twice daily for 2&#xD;
      days before surgery. the Control group will receive plasebo capsule mg at the same point in&#xD;
      time. The last doses one hour before induction of anesthesia. The double-blind design in this&#xD;
      study included blinding of anesthesiologist, orthopedic surgeon, nurse giving the drugs, and&#xD;
      the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No other sedative premedication will be given to all patients. Anesthesia will induce with&#xD;
      propofol 2 mg.kg-1and remifentanil 0.5-1 µg.kg-1, and tracheal intubation will facilitate&#xD;
      with rocuronium 0.6 mg.kg-1. Anesthesia will maintaine with a continuous infusion of&#xD;
      remifentanil 0.05-0.2 µg.kg-1.min-1 and sevoflurane 2-2.5 vol% to maintain a bispectral index&#xD;
      scale (BIS) values of 40 to 60. All surgeries will be performed by an experienced orthopedic&#xD;
      surgeon. At the end of the surgery, sevoflurane and remifentanil will stop and residual&#xD;
      neuromuscular paralysis will antagonize, and extubation will performe when the patient had&#xD;
      sufficient expiration. Age, gender, body mass index, the duration of anesthesia surgery and&#xD;
      the type of surgery will record. In the preoperative period, and duration of operation will&#xD;
      be measured.&#xD;
