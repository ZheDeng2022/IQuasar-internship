    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this non-interventional study (NIS) is to evaluate changes within 3&#xD;
      months in quality of life according to health status evaluated with the COPD Assessment Test&#xD;
      (CAT) in COPD patients who have recently switched (within one week) from tiotropium&#xD;
      monotherapy (Spiriva® Handihaler®) to dual therapy with tiotropium bromide plus olodaterol&#xD;
      (Spiolto® Respimat®), in the Greek private and public sector pulmonary offices and clinics.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in patients' quality of life (QoL) according to the total score of COPD Assessment Test (CAT) at month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The CAT is a patient-completed questionnaire assessing globally the impact of COPD on health status. Range of CAT scores from 0-40. Higher scores denote a more severe impact of COPD on a patient's life. CAT scores &lt;10 correspond to mild impact on patients life are usually considered those representing patients without impaired health status.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is a well-established and commonly used tool for the measurement of a patient's QoL. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has five levels (no problems, slight problems, some problems, severe problems and unable) and is self-reported by the patient.</description>
