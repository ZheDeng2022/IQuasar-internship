  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conductive keratoplasty (CK) had shown to be a safe and effective procedure for the treatment&#xD;
      of low to moderate hypeopia. It had been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) to treat presbyope in early 2004. CK appeals to both surgeons and patients as it avoids&#xD;
      the need for flap creation, the use of high intraocular pressure (IOP), or tissue ablation.&#xD;
      It utilizes &quot;blended vision&quot; rather than the true monovision used with laser in situ&#xD;
      keratomileusis (LASIK), which patients tolerate more readily. There is very little reported&#xD;
      research about the induction of wavefront aberration by CK. The symptomatology of high order&#xD;
      aberrations (HOA) and the way individual Zernike functions were correlated with visual&#xD;
      acuity, contrast sensitivity, visual symptoms. This study measured the HOA created by&#xD;
      surgically induced myopic shift via CK and LASIK in an effort to better understand the&#xD;
      phenomena of regression, multifocality, pseudo-accommodation and monovision.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To investigate anterior corneal optical higher order aberration (HOA) induced by conductive&#xD;
      keratoplasty (CK) and laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). 69 eyes with hyperopia or&#xD;
      presbyopia were enrolled. 47 eyes of 47 patients underwent CK procedure, 22 eyes underwent&#xD;
      LASIK. Data were acquired preoperatively, and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. The total&#xD;
      Root Mean Square (RMS) of the HOA as well as the individual Zernike polynomials of coma,&#xD;
      trefoil, and spherical aberration were analyzed. In CK group, the high order RMS showed&#xD;
      significant elevation at 3 months, but it returned to near preoperative levels at 6 months&#xD;
      postoperatively. Trefoil (Z33) is the exclusive Zenike pattern to increase significantly&#xD;
      following CK, peaking at 3 months and then decreasing back to near preoperative level at 6&#xD;
      months after CK. In the hyperopic LASIK group, coma increased to a peak at 3 month&#xD;
      postoperatively, and persisted at sixth month after LASIK. Spherical aberration decreased&#xD;
      significantly at 3 months and persisted till the sixth postoperative month. There was&#xD;
      significant correlation between ΔSE and Δspherical aberration showed in both groups. The HOA&#xD;
      and main Zernike polynomials pattern and their natural changes induced by CK is significantly&#xD;
      different from that induced by LASIK in the hyperopic corrected treatment. The amount of&#xD;
      achieved hyperopic corrections induced by CK or LASIK is not correlated to the change of HOA&#xD;
      patterns such as coma and trefoil, but it is correlated to the change of spherical&#xD;
      aberration.&#xD;
