  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the safe and effective dose of intravenous&#xD;
      cipargamin in participants with moderately severe and severe malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also intends to evaluate clinical treatment success using a novel clinical endpoint&#xD;
      for drug development in severe malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe malaria is a medical emergency and is affecting primarily young children in Africa.&#xD;
      Injectable artesunate is the standard of care for the treatment of severe malaria and is&#xD;
      highly efficacious. However, the spread of artemisinin-resistance in Plasmodium falciparum in&#xD;
      Asian countries poses a threat for future treatment of patients with this life-threatening&#xD;
      disease. To mitigate this risk, there is a need of another drug in malaria endemic countries.&#xD;
      Cipargamin treatment results in rapid clearance of parasites including artemisinin resistant&#xD;
      parasites.&#xD;

In Cohorts 1-2, participants will get randomized to one of the three treatment arms (2 dose of intravenous cipargamin or intravenous artesunate - comparator ). After Cohort 2, interim analysis will be performed to take one best dose of intravenous cipargamin forward for Cohorts 3-5. Participants in Cohorts 3-5 with be randomized to one of two treatments arms ( intravenous cipargamin or intravenous artesunate - comparator).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Although the study is open label however in order to minimize the potential impact of treatment knowledge, treatment allocation, dose information, PK/AAG assessment schedule and concentration data, as well as other data that may result in systematic unblinding will not be available to the Clinical Trial Team (CTT) (particularly clinicians, trial statisticians, trial programmers) until the database is locked after IA of Cohorts 1-2. After interim database lock, the CTT would be unblinded with the results, however, the blinding will then be continued for Cohorts 3-5 until the final database is locked.</masking_description>
