  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Nurse AMIE platform has been modified for use as an Amazon Alexa skill for use on the&#xD;
      Echo Show device. The investigators will recruit women receiving treatment for metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer and randomize patients to receive standard treatment (control) or the Nurse&#xD;
      AMIE for Echo Show program. Nurse AMIE is a supportive care program for women undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy and helps manage symptoms. The investigators will test the feasibility of using&#xD;
      the Nurse AMIE program as well as its effectiveness at managing symptoms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 42 MBC patients and randomize them into a partial crossover&#xD;
      trial in which immediate treatment group participants receive the Nurse AMIE intervention in&#xD;
      full for 3 months, then continue Nurse AMIE (without navigation) for 3 months, while the&#xD;
      delayed intervention group will not receive an intervention for 3 months, followed by&#xD;
      receiving the Nurse AMIE full intervention with navigation for 3 months. The primary&#xD;
      comparisons will be between the immediate treatment and delayed treatment groups over the&#xD;
      first 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. Participants will all receive an Amazon Echo Show device, WiFi connection (if&#xD;
      patients do not already have one), pedometer, and resistance bands. Each day, the participant&#xD;
      will open the Nurse AMIE for Echo Show, which will result in the daily greeting. After the&#xD;
      greeting, participants will be asked to provide a verbal rating of their symptoms (e.g.,&#xD;
      pain, sleep, fatigue, and distress).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the symptom survey, Nurse AMIE will use an algorithm to discern which of the&#xD;
      intervention modules to offer as assistance for the reported symptoms. These interventions&#xD;
      include exercise, guided relaxation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and soothing music. These&#xD;
      guideline-based interventions are provided as audio files or YouTube-style videos. In&#xD;
      addition, Nurse AMIE provides a daily educational nutrition tip as well as recipes designed&#xD;
      to be of interest to people undergoing chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each week, the participant will receive a phone call from the study navigator. This navigator&#xD;
      will monitor symptom ratings daily and will discuss symptoms, interventions, and step goals&#xD;
      with the participant each week.&#xD;

    <description>The BPI gives two main scores: a pain severity score and a pain interference score. The pain severity score is calculated from the four items about pain intensity. Each item is rated from 0, no pain, to 10, pain as bad as you can imagine, and contributes with the same weight to the final score, ranging from 0 to 40. The pain interference score corresponds to the item on pain interference. The seven sub-items are rated from 0, does not interfere, to 10, completely interferes, and contributes with the same weight to the final score, ranging from 0 to 70.</description>

Further, there are two additional scores, the subjective quality and app-specific scores that are used to assess the participant's view of the quality of the app and the impact of the app on knowledge, attitudes, intentions, and change in target health behavior, respectively. The higher the score, the more favorable the app quality is.</description>
