  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to quantify the pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      interaction(s) between an anaesthetic drug (remimazolam) and an opioid (remifentanil).&#xD;
      Remimazolam is a new anaesthetic drug with a sedative effect, which, in combination with an&#xD;
      opioid can be used to achieve general anaesthesia. To date, however, no clinical trials have&#xD;
      been conducted to specifically assess the potential for drug-drug interactions between&#xD;
      remimazolam and remifentanil. Greater understanding of the potential for such interactions&#xD;
      will help define more appropriate dosing regimens with less over-sedation and associated side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
