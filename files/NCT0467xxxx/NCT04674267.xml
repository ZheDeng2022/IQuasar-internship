  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multi-phase research study is to understand how consultation of cancer&#xD;
      care with a geriatrician can best improve outcomes for older adults with gastrointestinal&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;

      This research study will be conducted in three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1 - Needs assessment and implementation plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 - Pilot Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 3 - Expanded Clinical Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Please note Phase 2 - Pilot Intervention and Phase 3 - Expanded Clinical Trial will&#xD;
                be added to the clinicaltrials.gov record once IRB approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 is composed of three aims and will inform the subsequent two phases:.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1: To evaluate the perceived needs of Older Adults diagnosed with gastrointestinal&#xD;
           malignancies, caregivers, staff, and faculty to characterize the implementation setting&#xD;
           for a geriatric consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2: To refine the proposed REACH program implementation plan based on qualitative&#xD;
           feedback provided by Older Adult (OA) patients, their identified caregivers, staff, and&#xD;
           faculty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3: Determine the patient, demographic, social determinants, clinical and disease&#xD;
           characteristics of Older Adults (OA) associated with ED visits/hospitalization following&#xD;
           initial oncology consultation at DF/BWCC in year 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The research study procedure includes one discussion on the needs of older adult&#xD;
                patients receiving cancer care, along with the needs of their caretakers and cancer&#xD;
                care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients and caregivers will participate in individual interviews, while staff and&#xD;
                faculty will participate in focus groups.&#xD;
