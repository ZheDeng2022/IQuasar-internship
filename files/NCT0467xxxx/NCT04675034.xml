    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2b randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study in&#xD;
      subjects with painful osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The study will assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of multiple doses of MEDI7352 compared to placebo, as well as the pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of MEDI7352 in subjects with moderate to severe chronic&#xD;
      pain persistent for 3 months or more not adequately controlled by standard of care&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a Phase IIb, multinational, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study of MEDI7352 in participants 18 to 80 years of age (inclusive) with moderate-to-severe chronic pain of the knee. The study consists of a screening period of up to 45 days, a 12-week treatment period, and a 20-week follow-up (FU) period.&#xD;
Daily pain scores (as measured on an 11-point numerical rating scale [NRS]) recorded at the first screening visit and from Day -7 to Day -1 will be used be used to determine eligibility.&#xD;
Participants will be randomised to one of 4 doses of MEDI7352 or placebo. Each participant will receive 6 doses of MEDI7352 or placebo during the treatment period.&#xD;
After the end-of-treatment (EOT) visit at Week 12, participants will enter the FU period, which comprises 3 clinic visits (Weeks 18, 28, and 32) and 3 FU phone calls (Weeks 15, 21, and 24). All participants who receive IP are expected to complete the FU period.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>All participants will be centrally assigned to randomised IP using an IRT/RTSM system. Before the study is initiated, the telephone number and call-in directions for the IRT and/or the log in information and directions for the RTSM will be provided to each site.&#xD;
The IRT/RTSM will provide the investigator(s) or appropriate study personnel with the kit identification number to be allocated to the participant at the IP dosing visit.&#xD;
Details for this will be described in the IRT/RTSM user manual that will be provided to each centre.&#xD;
All participants, investigators, and study personnel involved in the conduct of the study will be blinded to treatment assignment. The unblinded study personnel (eg, site pharmacist) will not participate in study procedures or data analysis prior to unblinding of the study data to all study-related personnel. Unblinded AstraZeneca personnel who are not otherwise involved in the study will prepare data for review and interim analyses.</masking_description>

    <description>Change in the weekly average of daily NRS pain scores from baseline to Week 12. Average daily pain scores in the target joint will be recorded from a scale of 0 = &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 = &quot;most severe pain imaginable over the previous 24 hours.</description>

The WOMAC pain subscale consists of 5 questions assessing the participant's pain due to OA in the target knee. Each question is scored on an NRS scale from 0 to 10, and the WOMAC pain subscale score is calculated as the mean score from all 5 questions, where higher scores represent higher pain</description>

The WOMAC physical function subscale consists of 17 questions assessing the participant's difficulty in performing activities of daily living due to OA in the target knee. Each question is scored on an NRS scale from 0 to 10, and the WOMAC pain subscale score is calculated as the mean score from all 17 questions, where higher scores represent worse function</description>

The PGA of OA is a 5-point scale used to assess symptoms and activity impairment due to OA of the knee. Participants are asked to identify a number from 1 = very good (asymptomatic and no limitation to normal activities) to 5 = very poor (very severe symptoms which are intolerable and inability to carry out all normal activities).</description>

&#xD;
          1. Participants must understand the nature of the study and must give signed and dated&#xD;
             written informed consent prior to the initiation of any study procedures, which&#xD;

             dated optional genetic research ICF must be provided prior to collection of samples&#xD;
             for optional genetic research that supports the Genomics Initiative. If a participant&#xD;
             declines to participate in the genetic research, this will have no influence on the&#xD;
             ability of a participant to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The participant should be willing and able to understand and comply with all&#xD;
             protocol-specified restrictions and procedures and be able to use an electronic&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. The participant must be considered likely to comply with the study protocol and to&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Currently receiving strong opioids for any indication&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participation in another clinical study with an IP or device within 60 days or 5&#xD;
             half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Plasma donation within 28 days of screening or any blood donation or blood loss &gt; 50&#xD;
             mL within 2 months of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Previous allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Received nonleukocyte-depleted whole blood transfusion within 120 days of the genetic&#xD;
             research sample collection, if participating in the optional genetic research&#xD;
