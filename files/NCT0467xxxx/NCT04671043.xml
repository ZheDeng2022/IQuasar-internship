    <textblock>
      This project will aim to investigate the clinical efficacy and metabolic effects of a&#xD;
      pre-exercise dose of caffeine with a low (10g) dose of carbohydrate (CAF+lowCHO) without&#xD;
      modification of insulin degludec on exercise metabolism in people with T1D.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D) involves lifelong use of exogenous insulin to manage blood&#xD;
      glucose concentration. As with the rest of the population, people living with T1D are&#xD;
      recommended to engage in regular exercise for a variety of health and fitness reasons .&#xD;
      However, glycaemic control during exercise remains a particular challenge for this population&#xD;
      due to rapid changes in insulin sensitivity and the impact of additional hormones which&#xD;
      increase the risk of exercise-related hypoglycaemia. Current guidelines to prevent&#xD;
      exercise-induced hypoglycaemia suggest insulin dose reduction and/or ingestion of&#xD;
      carbohydrates in the context of the exercise bout. However, these adaptations are often&#xD;
      difficult to apply, as insulin dose adjustments require knowledge of insulin pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      and advanced planning which is not always possible. None of these strategies provide complete&#xD;
      assurance that hypoglycaemia will not occur and high carbohydrate intake can be&#xD;
      counterproductive if weight management is the target. Furthermore, modern very long-acting&#xD;
      insulin analogues, which are favoured by many people with T1D, do not offer the option to&#xD;
      rapidly or transiently reduce insulin before exercise. When using such insulins, dose&#xD;
      reductions may take two to three days to achieve an adapted steady state, increasing the risk&#xD;
      of inadequate insulin following exercise. Collectively, these factors increase the risk of&#xD;
      further deterring patients from exercise. Simple, alternative strategies to reduce the risk&#xD;
      of hypoglycaemia, both during and after exercise are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is the most commonly consumed chemical stimulant in the&#xD;
      world that is naturally found in many foods and is frequently added to sports supplements due&#xD;
      to its ergogenic effects in a range of sporting events. Caffeine has numerous physiological&#xD;
      effects throughout the body including increased lipolysis in adipose tissues and hepatic&#xD;
      glucose production in the liver alongside a decrease in glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.&#xD;
      These responses have led to the suggestion that acute caffeine intake may attenuate&#xD;
      exercise-associated hypoglycaemia in people with T1D. Ingestion of modest amounts of caffeine&#xD;
      (200-250 mg, equivalent to 3-4 cups of coffee each day) has been shown to augment the&#xD;
      symptomatic and hormonal responses to hypoglycaemia in participants with and without T1D.&#xD;
      Caffeine has also been shown to reduce the frequency of moderate episodes of hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      occurring overnight. The paucity of data on caffeine and exercise in individuals with T1D, in&#xD;
      conjunction with caffeine's popularity both socially and as a sports supplement, suggests&#xD;
      this deserves further attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clear example whereby caffeine supplementation may be of use is in patients using an&#xD;
      ultra-long acting basal insulin analogue such as insulin degludec. The administration is via&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection once daily, and it has a duration of action that lasts up to 42 hours&#xD;
      (compared to 18 to 26 hours provided by other marketed long-acting insulins such as insulin&#xD;
      glargine and insulin detemir). On average, the half-life at steady state is approximately 25&#xD;
      hours independent of dose. Compared to the other basal insulin analogues, the risk of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia appears to be lower with insulin degludec, however, hypoglycaemia still occurs.&#xD;
      In the case of physical exercise, the inability of the patient using such long-acting&#xD;
      insulins to make rapid adjustments can translate to the occurrence of exercise-related&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia due to an inability to reduce insulin already onboard, hence the need for new&#xD;
      strategies to prevent this undesired phenomenon. When using such insulins, dose reductions&#xD;
      may take two to three days to achieve an adapted steady state, increasing the risk of&#xD;
      inadequate insulin following exercise. Applying a novel in-house developed lipid&#xD;
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) assay, members of our research group observed that a&#xD;
      single bout of aerobic exercise increases systemic insulin degludec concentrations in adults&#xD;
      on stable basal insulin degludec regimens. Therefore, if these individuals wish to engage in&#xD;
      regular exercise, as recommended in international guidelines, current treatment strategies&#xD;
      may not be sufficient. For patients treated with modern basal insulin analogues, it seems&#xD;
      more adequate not to modify the ultra-long acting insulin doses, as this can often result in&#xD;
      more confusion than improvement, but to apply alternative strategies for recreational&#xD;
      exercise. Caffeine ingestion pre or post exercise may offer a simple means to better manage&#xD;
      glycaemia in the context of exercise in patients using these insulins and have the added&#xD;
      benefit of reducing carbohydrate requirements in the context of exercise.&#xD;
