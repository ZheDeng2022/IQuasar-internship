      This study evaluates the effectiveness and safety of Polatuzumab vedotin plus infusional&#xD;
      chemoimmunotherapy containing rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      hydroxydaunorubicin. This is a single arm study. Enrolled patients will receive up to six&#xD;
      cycles (21-day cycles) of therapy. While on study, subjects will be monitored weekly until&#xD;
      end of treatment, then followed for 52 weeks or until disease progression or discontinuation&#xD;
      due to toxicity or death.&#xD;
