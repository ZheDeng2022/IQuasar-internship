    <textblock>
      The study focus on the elderly patient (older than 80 years of age) who had acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke and received mechanical thrombectomy. The investigators analyze different factors in&#xD;
      the stage of before, between, after procedure and trying to figure out if there is any&#xD;
      difference between the 30-day-mortality group versus non-30-day-mortality group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      With the constant improvements in health care, standard of living and the decrease birth&#xD;
      rate, the percentage of the elderly population ( above 80 years old) is expected to double in&#xD;
      Taiwan by the year 2044, according to data from the National Development Council.&#xD;
      Consequently with the increase in the proportion of senior citizens, there will be an surge&#xD;
      number of patient suffering from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, most&#xD;
      importantly acute ischemic stroke. In recent years, mechanical thrombectomy has become the&#xD;
      gold standard in the treatment for acute stroke patients, however, many studies have excluded&#xD;
      the patients above the age of 80 years old as the benefits of the procedure have been very&#xD;
      controversial and there is no clear evidence proving favorable a outcome. There are a few&#xD;
      studies which state that though elderly patients had higher risk of complications when&#xD;
      receiving mechanical thrombectomy as compared to younger patients, the prognosis was still&#xD;
      superior to those didn't receive any intervention. Previous studies put more emphasis on the&#xD;
      overall prognosis, morbidity and mortality rate, they didn't focused on the cause of&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study focuses on analyzing of the cause of mortality and whether there is a significant&#xD;
      difference between 30-day-mortality group versus non-30-day-mortality group.&#xD;
