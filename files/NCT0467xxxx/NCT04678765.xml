      By means of an observer-blinded, mono-center, prospective, randomized controlled superiority&#xD;
      trial, the total anesthesia-related time (sum of performance and onset times) of an&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided distal peripheral nerve block and an ultrasound-guided axillary nerve block&#xD;
      will be investigated in patients undergoing hand surgery. The hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      onset-time of the ultrasound-guided distal peripheral nerve block will be faster than&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided axillary nerve blocks, which is more suitable for hand surgery.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthesia (RA) has become an increasingly popular alternative for general&#xD;
      anesthesia in day-care hand surgery. It has been demonstrated to allow faster recovery and to&#xD;
      reduce time to discharge from the hospital (lower pain scores, less nausea, … ), resulting in&#xD;
      lower hospital costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ultrasound-guided distal peripheral nerve block of the n. medianus and n. ulnaris is&#xD;
      frequently used in locoregional anesthetic technique in superficial hand surgery. Distal&#xD;
      peripheral nerve blocks allow preservation of proximal muscle function of the upper limb,&#xD;
      which may also allow patients to move affected digits when instructed to do so during&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another frequently used locoregional technique in superficial hand surgery is the axillary&#xD;
      nerve block. An ultrasound-guided axillary nerve block anesthetizes the n. medianus, n.&#xD;
      ulnaris, n. radialis, and n. musculocutaneous at an early stage in their trajectory in the&#xD;
      arm, providing satisfactory anesthesia for elbow, forearm, and hand surgery and provides&#xD;
      reliable cutaneous anesthesia of the inner upper arm including the medial cutaneous nerve of&#xD;
      the arm and intercostobrachial nerve, areas often missed with other approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambulatory superficial hand surgery is frequently conducted in JESSA hospital and is most&#xD;
      frequently conducted using intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA) of the forearm, an&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided distal peripheral nerve block, or an ultrasound-guided axillary nerve&#xD;
      block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, these locoregional anesthesia techniques have been studied and compared with&#xD;
      respect to analgesic efficacy and safety. Block performance time and onset-time of sensory&#xD;
      block after locoregional anesthesia for hand-surgery is important in operating room turn-over&#xD;
      and efficiency. Also, patient satisfaction, which can be influenced by multiple factors and&#xD;
      not only by the chosen anesthetic technique, is important to evaluate. Even the inability to&#xD;
      use the affected limb due to the motor block of proximal and distal musculature has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is comparing the total anesthesia-related time (sum of&#xD;
      block performance time and onset time) of an ultrasound-guided distal peripheral nerve block&#xD;
      and an ultrasound-guided axillary nerve block. Block performance time is defined as the time&#xD;
      interval between the start of the block procedure and the end of the block procedure, thus&#xD;
      imaging + needling time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block performance time will be recorded with a stopwatch by the attending block room nurse.&#xD;
      Time for the sensory block to take effect is defined as the time required for the limb to&#xD;
      achieve a level of anesthesia deemed adequate for surgery (i.e., not necessarily a complete&#xD;
      block) after placement of the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After placement of the block, a single, blinded study nurse will enter the block room and&#xD;
      will carry out measurements of plexus blockade every 2 mins until 30 mins. Sensory blockade&#xD;
      of the median and ulnar nerves will be graded according to a 3-point scale using a cold test:&#xD;
      0 = no block, 1 = analgesia (patient can feel touch, not cold), 2 = anesthesia (patient&#xD;
      cannot feel touch). Sensory blockade of the median and ulnar nerves will be assessed on the&#xD;
      volar aspect of the thumb, and the volar aspect of the fifth finger, respectively. We&#xD;
      consider the patient ready for surgery when a minimal sensory block score of 3 out of 4&#xD;
      points is achieved, provided the sensory block score is equal or superior to 3 out of 4&#xD;
      points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical block success rate: (sensory) Block success, defined as the ability of the&#xD;
           surgeon to perform surgery without the use of any rescue block or supplemental general&#xD;
           anesthesia, evaluated at the end of surgery. 3 scores are available: 1. Complete sensory&#xD;
           block, 2. Incomplete block with IV rescue medication or extra local anesthetic and 3.&#xD;
           Unsuccessful block with need for general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction: Patient satisfaction was evaluated using the &quot;Evaluation du Vécu&#xD;
           de l' Anesthésie LocoRegional&quot; (EVAN-LR) questionnaire which was specially developed for&#xD;
           the evaluation of patient satisfaction after RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Different time intervals will be measured: needling time (defined as the time from&#xD;
           injection of the needle to the removal of the needle), surgical time (defined as the&#xD;
           time from incision to surgical completion and application of dressings), total OR stay&#xD;
           time (defined as departure time from the OR minus arrival time in the OR), and&#xD;
           tourniquet time (defined as the total time the tourniquet is inflated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraoperative need for supplemental analgesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The conversion rate to general analgesia (i.e., block failure rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's pre-, intra-, and postoperative pain scores at several time points, measured&#xD;
           via an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in which number 0 means &quot;no pain at all&quot;,&#xD;
           number 5 means &quot;moderate pain&quot;, and number 10 means &quot;worst possible pain&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tourniquet tolerance time (defined as the time required for the tourniquet pressure to&#xD;
           become painful (NRS &gt; 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Required doses of analgesics were measured (paracetamol, ibuprofen, tramadol).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical satisfaction, using a &quot;seven-point Likert scale&quot; (on a scale from 1 to 7, 1 on&#xD;
           7 is absolutely not satisfied, 4 on 7 neutral, and 7 on 7 being very satisfied) on&#xD;
           surgical conditions after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this observer-blinded, mono-center, prospective, randomized controlled superiority trial 2&#xD;
      anesthetic procedures will be compared in patients that undergo hand surgery (carpal tunnel&#xD;
      release, finger amputation, finger manipulation, hand foreign body removal, hand incision and&#xD;
      drainage, metacarpal fracture repair, trigger finger release, tendon repair, and Dupuytren's&#xD;
      contracture).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and will be approved by&#xD;
      the ethics committee of the JESSA Hospital, Hasselt, Belgium before the start of the study.&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained before participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed using a computer-generated random allocation sequence.&#xD;
      Allocation numbers will be sealed in opaque envelopes, which will be opened in sequence by an&#xD;
      independent anesthesiologist who is not involved in the assessment of outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon and the researcher will be blinded for the used type of anesthesia. To achieve&#xD;
      observer blinding, surgeons and study nurses are not allowed in the regional anesthesia block&#xD;
      room and are asked to leave the operation theatre at the end of each procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will first receive information about this study. Before the start of the study,&#xD;
      written informed consent will be obtained, after which the patient will be randomized to one&#xD;
      of the 2 treatment groups. All patients will receive an intravenous catheter in the&#xD;
      contralateral arm with IV. Infusion of NaCl 0.9% 500ml 60ml/h, supplementary oxygen, and&#xD;
      standard monitoring (non-invasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and saturation&#xD;
      measurements).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound-guided distal peripheral nerve block:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both ultrasound, pressure-monitoring, and neuro-stimulation (set at 0.5 mA) will be used to&#xD;
      detect the nerves and to avoid intra-neural puncture/injection. A Sono Site Xporte ultrasound&#xD;
      machine with a high-frequency linear transducer HFL38 (13-6MHz) and a 22G Stimuplex Ultra 50&#xD;
      mm (B. Braun Medical Inc, Melsungen, Germany) needle will be used to locate the median nerve&#xD;
      and ulnar nerve. An in-plane ultrasound-guided medial-to-lateral puncture will be made and&#xD;
      3ml of 2% lidocaine will be injected within the fascia that envelopes the median nerve. In&#xD;
      addition, depending on the available space, an in-plane ultrasound-guided medial-to-lateral&#xD;
      or proximal-to distal puncture will be made and 3 ml of 2% lidocaine will be infiltrated into&#xD;
      the fascial plane to block the ulnar nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound-guided quadruple-injection axillary nerve block:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Sono Site Xporte ultrasound machine with a high-frequency linear transducer HFL38 (13-6MHz)&#xD;
      and a 22G Stimuplex Ultra 50 mm (B. Braun Medical Inc, Melsungen, Germany) needle will be&#xD;
      used. The US probe will be applied in a sterile fashion in the axilla to obtain a short-axis&#xD;
      view of the axillary artery. The following 4 nerves will be identified as hyperechoic&#xD;
      structures: the median, ulnar, and radial nerve surrounding the axillary artery and the&#xD;
      musculocutaneous nerve in the fascial layers between the biceps and coracobrachialis muscles.&#xD;
      The needle is inserted in-plane from the anterior aspect of the axillary nerve and directed&#xD;
      toward the posterior aspect. Both ultrasound, pressure-monitoring, and neuro-stimulation (set&#xD;
      at 0.5 mA) will be used to detect the nerves and to avoid intra-neural puncture/injection. A&#xD;
      total volume of 20 mL lidocaine 2 % will be administered divided over four locations. The&#xD;
      needle is inserted in plane from the anterior aspect of the axillary artery and directed&#xD;
      toward the posterior aspect of the axillary artery to first anesthetize the radial nerve. The&#xD;
      posteriorly located radial nerve is surrounded with 8 mL of local anesthetic. Afterward, the&#xD;
      needle is withdrawn and redirected to the median and ulnar nerves, after which another 8 mL&#xD;
      of local anesthetic is deposited. In the end, the needle is withdrawn and redirected toward&#xD;
      the musculocutaneous nerve where another 4 mL of local anesthetic is deposited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the start of the surgery, the single tourniquet, 5cm in width, will be placed 5 cm&#xD;
      distal to the medial epicondyle of the humerus. A band-aid was already placed on the dorsal&#xD;
      side of the ipsilateral hand of patients enrolled in the peripheral nerve block group at the&#xD;
      regional anesthesia block room. If the block is insufficient [numeric rating scale (NRS) &gt;&#xD;
      4], patients will receive an injection of supplemental local anesthetic at the operation site&#xD;
      or an IV. bolus of 5μg sufentanil repeated once if necessary. If pain is persistent or the&#xD;
      block failed, general anesthesia will be induced with 2 mg/kg propofol. A laryngeal mask will&#xD;
      be inserted and anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane 1.5 to 2.0% in a 40% O2/air&#xD;
      mixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, peroperatively patients will receive intravenous paracetamol 15mg/kg (max&#xD;
      1gram), ketorolac 0.5mg/kg (max 30mg), and dexamethasone 0.1mg/kg (max 5mg) if no&#xD;
      contraindications are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of conversion to general anesthesia or adverse events (hypotension, bradycardia, or&#xD;
      symptoms of LAST), patients will be monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) until&#xD;
      the problem has resolved, otherwise, they are admitted directly postoperative to the day care&#xD;
      unit (DCU). At the PACU, postoperative pain (NRS &gt; 3) is treated with tramadol 50-100 mg PO.&#xD;
      Postoperative nausea or vomiting (PONV) is treated with ondansetron 4 mg IV. After hospital&#xD;
      discharge, patients' oral medication scheme consists of paracetamol (500mg for &lt; 60kg and&#xD;
      1gram for &gt; 60kg) 1x/6u and ibuprofen (400mg for &lt; 60kg and 600mg for &gt; 60kg LG and good&#xD;
      kidney functioning) 1x/8u if needed for a maximum of 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The necessary sample size was determined for the primary outcome, the anesthesia-related&#xD;
      time, with the aim to demonstrate the superiority of an ultrasound-guided distal peripheral&#xD;
      nerve block compared to an ultrasound-guided axillary nerve block. A 20% time difference&#xD;
      between groups is considered statistically significant. According to a previous trial, the&#xD;
      anesthesia-related time of the 4-injection ultrasound-guided axillary nerve block technique&#xD;
      is 25.5 +/- 7.7 min. Assuming α=0.05 and power=0.80 for a 20% time difference in the&#xD;
      anesthesia-related time using a two-sided Chi-Square test, the calculated sample size is 74.&#xD;
      To account for a possible 10% drop-out rate, the sample size was increased to 40 patients per&#xD;
      group, so 80 patients in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be performed with SPSS 25.0 (IBM® SPSS® Inc, Chicago, Illinois,&#xD;
      USA). Continuous variables will be summarized by their mean and standard deviation, or median&#xD;
      and interquartile range if severe deviations from normality would be observed. Comparisons&#xD;
      between randomized groups will be made using a Student t-Test, or Wilcoxon rank-sum test in&#xD;
      case of non-normality. Categorical data will be collected by observed frequencies and&#xD;
      percentages per category. Comparisons between randomized groups were made using a chi-square&#xD;
      test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Continuous repeated data were corrected for&#xD;
      multiple testing. A p-value &lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant.&#xD;

Afterward, the needle is withdrawn and redirected to the median and ulnar nerves, after which another 8 mL of local anesthetic is deposited. In the end, the needle is withdrawn and redirected toward the musculocutaneous nerve where another 4 mL of local anesthetic is deposited.</description>
