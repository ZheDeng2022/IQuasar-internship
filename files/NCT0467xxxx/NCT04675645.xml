  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project addresses three important research questions. First, adolescents and young&#xD;
      adults (AYA) with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their parents/caregivers will be engaged to&#xD;
      inform the (1) domains of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) most important to them, (2)&#xD;
      frequency at which they are willing to complete them, and (3) other procedures related to the&#xD;
      use, uptake and effect of the HU-Go app as a tool to improve hydroxyurea (HU) adherence.&#xD;
      Second, this study seeks to utilize novel modern mobile technology using a multi-functional&#xD;
      personalized platform to improve adherence to HU and measure HRQOL in youth with SCD, using&#xD;
      NIH-endorsed PROMIS® measures, based on a conceptual model with predefined behavioral targets&#xD;
      and mediators. Third, we plan to assess HRQOL changes and identify modifiable behavioral&#xD;
      strategies that could serve as surrogates or predictors for HU adherence. This real-time&#xD;
      feedback might empower self-directed changes in behavior that could improve adherence to HU.&#xD;

      Aim 1: Identify the needs, desires, concerns, and expectations of AYA patients with SCD and&#xD;
      their parents/caregivers that will guide implementation of a mHealth tool, HU-Go, designed to&#xD;
      improve adherence to HU. We will conduct semi-structured interviews with patients and their&#xD;
      parents/caregivers. Transcripts will be independently coded and thematic analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: AYA patients with SCD and their parents/caregivers will identify specific&#xD;
      features, content, and usability requirements of HU-Go.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess the longitudinal relationship of HU adherence to HRQoL domains, including&#xD;
      fatigue and depression. HU adherence will be measured using electronic pill bottles,&#xD;
      self-report measures, laboratory markers, and medication possession ratio (MPR). HRQOL will&#xD;
      be assessed using PROMIS® measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Low HU adherence is associated with impairment of HRQoL domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Conduct a single-arm, pilot study to determine the effect size associated with&#xD;
      improvement in HU adherence after using HU-Go for 12 weeks. Adherence will be measured using&#xD;
      self-report measures, laboratory markers and MPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: HU-Go will improve HU adherence by at least 20%.&#xD;
