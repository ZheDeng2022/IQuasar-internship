  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posterior cranial fossa craniectomy has been shown to improve patient survival. The level of&#xD;
      autonomy, disability and quality of life of survivors has been little studied and still&#xD;
      underresearched,.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, an assessment of the level of disability and of the quality of life after&#xD;
      performing a posterior craniectomy seems relevant.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Investigators are carrying out a retrospective observational, single-center study, in three&#xD;
      intensive care units in the Grenoble Hospital Center. Every patients who underwent a&#xD;
      posterior fossa craniectomy for a cerebellar hematoma at Grenoble University Hospital between&#xD;
      01/01/2010 and 01/01/2020 were enrolled in this study. The main objective is to assess the&#xD;
      level of disability and the quality of life of patients who have had a posterior cranial&#xD;
      fossa craniectomy. The primary outcome is the mRS(Modified Rankin score) measured at least&#xD;
      one year following the ICU discharge. Secondary outcomes are the mRS(Modified Rankin Score)&#xD;
      measured at discharge from the rehabilitation department, the GOS (Glasgow Outcome score)&#xD;
      measured at least one year following the discharge from intensive care, and the SF36 (The&#xD;
      Short Form 36)from the medical outcome study, score assessing the quality of life, collected&#xD;
      via phone call.&#xD;
