  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of a BRAFV600E mutation is a marker of poor prognosis in patients with mCRC and&#xD;
      associated with a median overall survival (mOS) of approximately 12 to 14 months compared to&#xD;
      20 to 25 months for patients with BRAF wild-type tumours. After 1st line therapy, treatment&#xD;
      outcomes with standard therapy are poor in patients with BRAF-mutated mCRC, with response&#xD;
      rates (ORR) of ≤ 11%, a median progression-free survival (mPFS) between 1.8 and 2.8 months,&#xD;
      and a mOS between 4.1 and 6.2 months. Failure to achieve adequate survival outcomes with&#xD;
      standard treatment regimens in patients with BRAF-mutated mCRC has encouraged efforts to&#xD;
      combine multiple targeted therapies: With 665 randomized patients, the BEACON CRC trial&#xD;
      represents the largest trial and is currently the only phase III study in patients with&#xD;
      BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BERING CRC - designed as a prospective (allowing initial retrospective documentation),&#xD;
      longitudinal, non-interventional study - will investigate the real-world effectiveness,&#xD;
      quality of life, safety and tolerability of encorafenib and cetuximab in BRAFV600E-mutant&#xD;
      mCRC patients, who have received prior systemic therapy. Data from this study will contribute&#xD;
      to a deeper understanding and characterization to the everyday use of encorafenib and&#xD;
      cetuximab in a broader patient population in the German and Austrian routine setting.&#xD;
