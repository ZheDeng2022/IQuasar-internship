  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of daily supplementation with&#xD;
      inulin before, during and after sanative therapy (ST), on clinical outcomes of periodontal&#xD;
      disease. The study design will allow the investigators to conclude if supplementation with&#xD;
      inulin can favourably modulate oral microbiota prior to ST and can result in better&#xD;
      periodontal health after ST.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease is a chronic state of inflammation that can destroy the supporting&#xD;
      tissues around the teeth, leading to a loss of connective tissue and the periodontal&#xD;
      ligament, the resorption of alveolar bone and eventual tooth loss. Periodontal disease can&#xD;
      also induce dysbiosis in the gut microbiome and contribute to low grade systemic&#xD;
      inflammation. Prebiotic fibres such as inulin can selectively alter the intestinal microbiota&#xD;
      to bring back a state of homeostasis by improving gut barrier functions and preventing&#xD;
      inflammation. Through this mechanism, supplementation with inulin may be able to indirectly&#xD;
      benefit periodontal health. The primary objective of this trial to determine if inulin&#xD;
      supplementation, provided pre-sanative therapy (ST) through the healing phase (post-ST) is&#xD;
      more effective than the placebo at improving clinical outcomes of periodontal health:&#xD;
      decreasing both the number of sites with probing depths greater than or equal to 4 mm and&#xD;
      increasing the absence of bleeding on probing (BOP). Secondary objectives include determining&#xD;
      the effects of inulin supplementation pre- and post-ST on salivary markers of inflammation&#xD;
      and periodontal-associated pathogens.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be randomized to receive one of the two treatments. They will be required to take one sachet per day (half in the morning; half in the evening) of the assigned intervention beginning 4 weeks before their scheduled sanative therapy appointment and remain on the intervention until 10 weeks after their sanative therapy appointment.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The intervention packages will be labelled with a unique code and there will be enough packages to account for the required number of participants. A member of the research team, not involved in providing the treatment, will be responsible for the randomization and labeling of the intervention packages, as well as creating a master list by matching the unique code to the treatment arm. The patient and care provider will be masked to the treatment arm.</masking_description>
