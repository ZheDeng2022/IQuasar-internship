  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Across the US, substance use is a significant public health concern, with juvenile justice&#xD;
      (JJ)-involved youth representing a particularly vulnerable population. The current study&#xD;
      proposes to adapt and test an intervention Trust-based Relational Intervention® (TBRI®) for&#xD;
      preventing initiation and/or escalation of opioid misuse among older adolescents involved in&#xD;
      the JJ system. Successful completion of study aims will provide information on TBRI's utility&#xD;
      for older JJ adolescents, barriers and facilitators of sustainment, and provide training and&#xD;
      implementation support for sustainment in participating facilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Across the US, substance use (SU) is a significant public health concern, with an estimated&#xD;
      11.1 million misusing prescription opioids. Rates of opioid use disorders (OUDs) have&#xD;
      increased exponentially, with 60% of overdoses attributed to heroin and illicit synthetics&#xD;
      (such as Fentanyl). Although opioid use among youth is low compared to adults,&#xD;
      experimentation and regular use increases later in adolescence as youth transition to&#xD;
      adulthood. Juvenile justice (JJ)-involved youth represent a particularly vulnerable&#xD;
      population, as they often experience mental health disorders, dysfunctional family/social&#xD;
      relationships, and complex trauma, placing them at greater risk for SU and substance use&#xD;
      disorders (SUDs). To ensure that these youth do not become another opioid statistic,&#xD;
      innovative and effective prevention interventions are needed. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      adapt and test an intervention for preventing initiation and/or escalation of opioid misuse&#xD;
      among older JJ-involved adolescents. The target enrollment group will be youth aging out of&#xD;
      JJ (15-18 years at study enrollment) who are transitioning to their communities after a&#xD;
      period of detainment in a secure treatment or correctional facility. Trust-based Relational&#xD;
      Intervention® (TBRI®; a relational, attachment-based intervention that promotes emotional&#xD;
      regulation through interaction with responsive adults) will be adapted as a prevention&#xD;
      intervention targeting youth at risk for SU (especially non-medical use of opioids). Safe&#xD;
      adults (e.g., parent/guardian, extended family member) will be trained in behavior management&#xD;
      techniques for empowering youth to appropriately express their needs, connecting them with&#xD;
      others in pro-social ways, and correcting or reshaping undesirable behavior. The proposed&#xD;
      Effectiveness/Implementation study will examine both the effectiveness of TBRI for preventing&#xD;
      opioid misuse and the comparative utility of three support formats: (1) TBRI Training only,&#xD;
      (2) TBRI Training + Structured Coaching, or (3) TBRI Training + Responsive Coaching&#xD;
      (triggered by the youth's need/risk). A total of 360 youth/safe adult dyads will be recruited&#xD;
      from 9 participating JJ facilities over a 3-year period, and followed for 18 months&#xD;
      post-release (15 youth-adult dyads/year per facility). This design enables a comparison of&#xD;
      TBRI versus Standard Reentry Practice (SRP; using a stepped-wedge design where each facility&#xD;
      serves as its own control) plus a randomized control trial comparing 3 TBRI support formats.&#xD;
      This study will also examine barriers and facilitators of TBRI sustainment. Ninety JJ staff&#xD;
      (10 from each agency) will provide input annually via focus groups and surveys. TCU will work&#xD;
      with administrators and staff at each JJ facility to implement a sustainment plan, which will&#xD;
      include developing in-house TBRI expertise (i.e., staff training and implementation&#xD;
      assistance). Successful completion of study aims will provide a test of the adapted&#xD;
      intervention and will facilitate sustainment by providing training and implementation support&#xD;
      to participating facilities.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>An effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid Design - Type 1; Randomized controlled trial and delayed-start study testing the effectiveness of Trust-based Relational Intervention and three different support formats (no coaching/structured coaching/adaptive coaching) among Juvenile Justice (JJ)-involved youth transitioning to their communities and a safe adult (e.g. parent/guardian, extended family member). In the delayed-start design, JJ agencies are randomly assigned to four different starting points with two months apart for starting the project. The last 18-months of the delayed-start design will provide a naturalistic investigation of sustainment of the intervention within the facilities after responsibility for intervention delivery has been transferred from TCU to the JJ agencies (TCU provide trainings to foster in-house TBRI expertise and assistance for implementation).</intervention_model_description>
