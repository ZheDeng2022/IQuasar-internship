  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Surgeons regularly educate patients on health promoting behaviours including&#xD;
      diet, sleep and exercise. No study thus far has explored surgeons' personal compliance with&#xD;
      these health-behaviours and their relationship with surgical performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes this study were self-reported health, health related behaviours,&#xD;
      wellbeing, fatigue and surgical performance. Methods: A survey of validated themes on&#xD;
      health-related behaviours, workplace variables and performance was distributed to surgical&#xD;
      trainees and consultants in the UK and Ireland through the Association for Surgeons in&#xD;
      Training (ASiT). Non-parametric analysis was used to determine inferential associations.&#xD;
      Results: Ninety five surgeons (median age 35-44, 51.5 % female, 39.9% registrars) completed&#xD;
      the survey. 94% reported having at least 'good' overall health. . A majority (54.7%) report&#xD;
      inconsistent sleep patterns, while less than a quarter engage in regular exercise. 74%&#xD;
      reported having at least 'good' overall mental and emotional well being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty two and 64.2% reported being regularly fatigued and bothered by feelings of anxiety&#xD;
      and/or depression respectively. Poor self-reported health and wellbeing were associated with&#xD;
      poorer reported off-call performance (p&amp;lt;.01). Higher levels of fatigue negatively impacted&#xD;
      self-reported surgical and non-surgical task proficiency (p&amp;lt;.01). Discussion and&#xD;
      Conclusion: Surgeons reported high levels of overall health. However, healthy behaviours&#xD;
      around sleep, diet and exercise were not consistently reported. Fatigue, anxiety and regular&#xD;
      rumination were reported by greater than half of respondents. When compared to overall health&#xD;
      numbers, 20% less surgeons reported overall mental health and emotional well-being that good&#xD;
      or better. Self-reported health behaviours including sleep and physical activity were&#xD;
      associated with surgical performance. Strategies to improve modifiable lifestyle factors,&#xD;
      which will optimise physical health, mental wellbeing and levels of fatigue may optimise&#xD;
      surgical performance. Further research should target these behaviours to elicit desired&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
