    <textblock>
      The BeliLES-GEAS project pretends to obtain an extensive data registry of patients with&#xD;
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to create a national SLE patients registry treated with belimumab to&#xD;
      describe effectiveness and safety of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) belimumab in&#xD;
      patients with active SLE treated in the Spanish departments of Internal Medicine in a&#xD;
      real-life setting. This research project aspires to cover the vast majority (if not the&#xD;
      whole) of SLE patients treated with belimumab in all of the Spanish Departments of Internal&#xD;
      Medicine.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of BeliLES-GEAS registry is to create an observational, non-randomized,&#xD;
      non-controlled, national multicenter prospective and retrospective cohort with the aim to&#xD;
      explore the real performance, with its lights and shadows, of Belimumab, either IV or SC, in&#xD;
      a real-world population of lupus patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intention is to perform a longer-term follow up, so that the measure of hard outcomes,&#xD;
      such as improvement in mortality, could be feasible, but also reliable data regarding the&#xD;
      safety profile could be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve that, the following variables will be included: individual criteria as&#xD;
      part of 2019 EULAR/ACR, SLICC or ACR 1997 classification criteria, gender, age at diagnosis,&#xD;
      age at symptoms onset, duration of the disease, age at first Belimumab administration, mean&#xD;
      time of follow-up prior to, and from Belimumab administration, complete medical history&#xD;
      including other systemic autoimmune diseases, type/s of organ/systems affected by SLE, prior&#xD;
      immunosuppressants received, number of flares 2 years prior Belimumab onset, number of&#xD;
      medical visits, number of days of sick leave, type of disease, treatment and laboratory data.&#xD;
      As a measure of damage, Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics-Damage Index&#xD;
      (SLICC-DI) score will be calculated at baseline and at 12, 18, 24 months and yearly of&#xD;
      follow-up. All centers will be requested to provide the SLICC-DI calculated annually of the&#xD;
      last five years before the initiation of belimumab, when available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy will be evaluated as time to reach any of the definition of remission included&#xD;
      in the DORIS (definitions of remission in SLE) consensus, or LLDAs (lupus low disease&#xD;
      activity state). Regarding the safety of Belimumab in real-world setting, it will be defined&#xD;
      and evaluated by documenting adverse events.&#xD;
