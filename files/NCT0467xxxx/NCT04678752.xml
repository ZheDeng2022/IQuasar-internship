  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study examines patient weight loss and maintenance, associated predictors (patient health&#xD;
      characteristics and demographics), and contextual factors in the practice environment that&#xD;
      influence the intervention's adoption, implementation, and sustainability. This will be&#xD;
      achieved through a mixed methods implementation study including collection and analysis of&#xD;
      de-identified clinical data, surveys, observations, and interviews.&#xD;

      This study will investigate how PATHWEIGH, a weight management tool built into the EPIC&#xD;
      electronic health record, in combination with clinician and staff training on the use of&#xD;
      PATHWEIGH as a tool, education on effective weight management practices, and practice&#xD;
      facilitation to support implementation can facilitate weight loss and maintenance for primary&#xD;
      care patients. The study examines patient weight loss and maintenance, associated predictors&#xD;
      (patient health characteristics and demographics), and contextual factors in the practice&#xD;
      environment that influence the intervention's adoption, implementation, and sustainability.&#xD;
      This will be achieved through a mixed methods implementation study including collection and&#xD;
      analysis of de-identified clinical data, surveys, observations, and interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted because despite obesity being the leading cause of preventable&#xD;
      death in the U.S. and a major risk factor for disease, people with any degree of overweight&#xD;
      or obesity are rarely offered anything other than lifestyle advice, rather than more rigorous&#xD;
      and evidence-based weight management strategies. Poor reimbursement for weight-related&#xD;
      visits, competing priorities, lack of appropriate tools, and limited time in visits also&#xD;
      prevent more widespread use of weight management interventions. PATHWEIGH helps primary care&#xD;
      clinicians and teams prioritize weight management with their patients when appropriate and&#xD;
      ensures that they have the tools and knowledge handy to do so effectively. As part of the&#xD;
      assessment of the PATHWEIGH intervention, the study will identify predictors of patient&#xD;
      weight loss and weight loss maintenance using mediator and moderator analysis. Relevant&#xD;
      factors (patient demographics, health metrics (e.g. vital signs, anthropometrics,&#xD;
      comorbidities), behaviors and goals, provider age, sex, years and % time practicing, and&#xD;
      clinic information (e.g. size, location, culture scale)) will be evaluated by including&#xD;
      interaction terms between the treatment variable and possible moderating variables in outcome&#xD;
      regression models .&#xD;

    <description>Within primary care the option to select &quot;Obesity brief HPI&quot;, this is a brief historical intake of a patient's weight - when either they or their clinician decides to have a weight-prioritized visit. It is intended to initiate a discussion regarding potential strategies for weight loss (often &quot;eat less, exercise more&quot;). The provider has the discretion to augment or add support as they see fit.</description>
