    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to determine the effects of breathing exercises on asthmatic&#xD;
      pregnant females. A randomized controlled trial will be done for which the calculated sample&#xD;
      size is 24. Non probability purposive sampling technique will be used and the subjects will&#xD;
      be randomly divided in two groups, with one group undergoing pharmacological management where&#xD;
      as breathing exercises will be provided to the other group. Lung volumes and capacities as&#xD;
      well as quality of life will be assessed through questionnaire in order to determine the&#xD;
      effect of breathing exercises in patients with asthma.&#xD;

      Asthma is defined as chronic inflammatory condition of airways, characterized by periodic&#xD;
      episodes of wheezing, cough, chest tightness, shortness of breath and which are often worse&#xD;
      at night. This causes hyper-responsiveness of airways and flow of air obstruction leading to&#xD;
      breathing difficulty. Asthma in pregnancy is a common risk factor for fetal and maternal&#xD;
      complications. Asthma also effects outcomes of pregnancy and pregnancy affects asthma&#xD;
      severity which has being currently being examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 50% of asthmatic pregnant females 25 percent experience a worsening of asthma&#xD;
      control at some stage during pregnancy, and most of them take corticosteroids for the&#xD;
      management of acute and chronic exacerbation. Pathogenesis of asthma during pregnancy is&#xD;
      entirely related to the physiological and pathological changes .Uterine enlargement causes&#xD;
      hormonal changes during pregnancy directly or indirectly Asthmatic women have an increased&#xD;
      ratio of associated co-morbidities which have direct effect on it where by increasing risk of&#xD;
      perinatal outcomes. Pregnancy associated with asthma affects women in many ways. Hormonal&#xD;
      imbalances occurring during pregnancy affects lungs as well as sinuses. Increased estrogen&#xD;
      causes nasal congestion during the 3rd trimester. A rise in progesterone may cause a feeling&#xD;
      of shortness of breath. Its important to identify or diagnose asthma being a major cause of&#xD;
      shortness of breath during pregnancy. Breathing exercises includes nasal breathing,&#xD;
      diaphragmatic breathing, deep pursed lip breathing. They have beneficial effects, such as&#xD;
      betterment in health related (QOL)quality of life ,decreasing anxiety ,depression, improving&#xD;
      asthma symptoms, the treatment using relief medication, occurrence of exacerbations, and&#xD;
      hyperresponsiveness of airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global Initiative for Asthma(GINA GUIDELINES 2019)illustrated that non pharmacological&#xD;
      management such as patient's education, breathing exercises and relaxation techniques can be&#xD;
      used as an adjunct to asthma pharmacotherapy. Breathing exercises includes nasal breathing,&#xD;
      diaphragmatic breathing, deep pursed lip breathing. They have beneficial effects, such as&#xD;
      betterment in health related (QOL)quality of life, decreasing anxiety ,depression, improving&#xD;
      asthma symptoms, the treatment using relief medication, occurrence of exacerbations, and&#xD;
      hyperresponsiveness of airways in patients with asthma. Literature reviewed from different&#xD;
      search engines shows that there are limited studies available regarding non pharmacological&#xD;
      management of asthma during pregnancy so Current study is planned to assess if non&#xD;
      pharmacological management such as breathing exercise techniques will help improve asthma&#xD;
      symptoms exacerbation as well as quality of life following regular plan of exercises and&#xD;
      relaxation techniques collectively.&#xD;

    <measure>Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) measured through digital spirometer. Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) measured through digital spirometer. Three zones of measurement are commonly used to interpret peak flow rates. Normal value of PEFR is (80-100%). Green zone indicates 80 to 100 percent of the usual or normal peak flow reading, yellow zone indicates 50 to 79 percent of the usual or normal peak flow readings, and red zone indicates less than 50 percent of the usual or normal peak flow readings.</description>

    <description>Asthma Control questionnaire is a self-reported subjective outcome measurement tool that is used to measure the sufficiency of asthma symptom control and changes in asthma symptoms. It is 5 point scale with scores ranging from 0 to 5 for each item. The greater the score of Asthma Control questionnaire, the better the prognosis and outcome.</description>
