    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate a technique to monitor blood pressure in women&#xD;
      undergoing cesarean delivery with suspected placenta accreta spectrum. To achieve this&#xD;
      objective, the investigators plan to conduct a prospective, observational study with the&#xD;
      following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Compare concordance between the systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean&#xD;
      arterial blood pressure (MAP) readings from the continuous non-invasive arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure (CNAP) and IABP at several discrete points throughout the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Determine the feasibility of using CNAP to aid in decision making by&#xD;
      examining the parameters of volume responsiveness and arterial elastance at several discrete&#xD;
      points throughout the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the investigators can obtain similar blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring using CNAP as compared to the gold standard IABP in women undergoing cesarean&#xD;
      delivery with suspected placenta accreta.&#xD;

      Study Overview This is a prospective, observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures Patients who meet inclusion criteria with no exclusions will be approached&#xD;
      to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will undergo the standard pre-operative evaluation and preparation for&#xD;
      cesarean section with possible hysterectomy including evaluation by nursing, obstetrics and&#xD;
      anesthesiology team, placement of 2 large bore IVs, arterial line placement and laboratory&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will then be transported to the OR. In the OR the CNAP device will be placed on&#xD;
      the patient's finger and be given a brief calibration period of 45 seconds. As per usual for&#xD;
      this procedure, each patient will undergo combined spinal epidural anesthesia with our&#xD;
      standard cesarean induction dose of hyperbaric intrathecal 0.75% bupivacaine 1.5ml,&#xD;
      intrathecal fentanyl 25 micrograms and intrathecal morphine 250 micrograms. The patient will&#xD;
      be moved to the supine position with left lateral uterine displacement. When a T6 sensory&#xD;
      level to pinprick is achieved, surgery will be allowed to proceed. Throughout the surgery,&#xD;
      the CNAP and IABP will take continuous reading of blood pressure and hemodynamic variable.&#xD;
      Labs and additional fluid or blood may be given to the patient as clinically indicated, as is&#xD;
      common for this procedure. Blood work will be obtained from the arterial line used for IABP,&#xD;
      as is standard practice when an AIBP is in place. Other than the addition of the CNAP cuff,&#xD;
      all other care will be per standard protocol for this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection In order to assess our primary and secondary outcomes, the investigators will&#xD;
      be collecting CNAP and AIBP. Additional baseline characteristics including, but not limited&#xD;
      to age, race, gender, BMI and comorbidities will be abstracted from the medical record.&#xD;
      REDCap will be utilized for data collection and storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes SBP, MAP, DBP reading from the CNAP and AIBP at several discrete points&#xD;
      throughout the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes Additional comparisons of SBP, MAP, DBP measurements using CNAP to AIBP&#xD;
      and NIBP, review of extrapolated data outputs including Stroke Volume, Systemic Vascular&#xD;
      Resistance, Cardiac Output and Stroke Volume Variation from CNAP compared pulse pressure&#xD;
      index from pulse oximetry and AIBP and their responsiveness to fluid bolus, subgroup analysis&#xD;
      of CNAP and AIBP during times significant intravascular volume depletion (blood loss) or&#xD;
      systemic vascular resistance change (after spinal anesthesia). Relevant clinical data will&#xD;
      also be collected, including; demographic data, total estimated blood lose, total&#xD;
      quantitative blood loss, length of hospital stay, routine lab results including; Hematocrit,&#xD;
      Fibrinogen, coagulation tests, lactic acid, pH, base excess.&#xD;
