  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schistosomiasis is classified as among the world's neglected tropical diseases (NTD).&#xD;
      Morbidity due to Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) is greatest among school-age children who&#xD;
      typically have the highest burden of infection. In 2001, World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      passed a resolution for large-scale mass drug administration (MDA) using chemotherapy to&#xD;
      deworm vulnerable children through school-based programs. While MDA has significantly&#xD;
      contributed to reducing the burden of these infections, several concerns still exist over the&#xD;
      large-scale use of chemotherapeutic drugs in deworming. The large population of children and&#xD;
      the high frequency of dosage may pose a challenge to the sustainability of these programs.&#xD;
      Further, the MDAs exert increasing drug pressure on parasite populations, a circumstance that&#xD;
      is likely to favor parasite genotypes that can resist chemotherapy. Additionally, the current&#xD;
      school-based MDA does not consider child malnutrition a very common malady in African&#xD;
      countries. The greatest shortcoming is that currently approved S. mansoni chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      treatment, Praziquantel is not recommended for children under six years of age due to its&#xD;
      perceived toxicity. This excludes a highly vulnerable group from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above has called for alternative management options for S. mansoni among school and&#xD;
      pre-school age children. The current study seeks to test the feasibility of the use of a&#xD;
      nutritional supplement (Ujiplus®), as a potential deworming strategy against S. mansoni.&#xD;
      Ujiplus® is a porridge flour fortified with papaya (Carica papaya) seeds extracts. In a&#xD;
      previous study (NCT 027-25255), the product was found to have an effect on soil-transmitted&#xD;
      helminths among a group of school children with no serious adverse events. We intend to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of Ujiplus® when given through school feeding programs and compare the&#xD;
      outcome with praziquantel- the recommended MDA agent for deworming school children. The&#xD;
      investigators will design and formulate the Ujiplus®, and test it among children in four&#xD;
      primary schools in Mbita, Homabay county, Kenya.&#xD;

      Background: Schistosomiasis is classified as among the world's neglected tropical diseases&#xD;
      (NTD). Morbidity due to Schistosoma mansoni (S.mansoni) is greatest among school-age children&#xD;
      who typically have the highest burden of infection. In 2001, World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      passed a resolution for large-scale mass drug administration (MDA) using chemotherapy to&#xD;
      deworm vulnerable children through school-based programs. While MDA has significantly&#xD;
      contributed to reducing the burden of these infections, several concerns still exist over the&#xD;
      large-scale use of chemotherapeutic drugs in deworming. The large population of children and&#xD;
      the high frequency of dosage may pose a challenge to the sustainability of these programs.&#xD;
      Further, the MDAs exert increasing drug pressure on parasite populations, a circumstance that&#xD;
      is likely to favor parasite genotypes that can resist chemotherapy. Moreover,&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic drugs are not recommended for children under the age of 6 years due to their&#xD;
      toxicity, despite the fact that this is the age group most infected with S. mansoni.&#xD;
      Additionally, the current school-based MDA does not consider child malnutrition a very common&#xD;
      malady in African countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above, we have designed a nutritional food supplement, Ujiplus®, with the&#xD;
      potential as a homegrown mass drug administration tool against intestinal parasites including&#xD;
      S.mansoni. Porridge (Uji) made from corn flour is one of the most prevalent traditional&#xD;
      school meal snacks in developing countries. Because of its low cost, and popularity in&#xD;
      schools, it has been adopted as a component in school meals, often prepared and given as a&#xD;
      snack at break time. To enhance its effect, we have fortified the Uji flour with&#xD;
      micronutrients and extracts from papaya (Carica papaya) seeds to form Ujiplus®. Carica papaya&#xD;
      seeds have been found in various studies to have an anthelminthic effect with benzyl&#xD;
      isothiocyanate (BITC) as the potential active ingredient. In a previous clinical trial,&#xD;
      Ujiplus® reduced the Ascaris lumbricoides egg count by 63.9% after the two month period as&#xD;
      compared to the albendazole arm, 78.8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, primary school children (ages 6-8) from four schools in Homabay County Kenya&#xD;
      will be randomized into two arms: Children from two schools will receive 300 ml Ujiplus®&#xD;
      porridge daily (test school), and the other two schools will receive a similar serving of&#xD;
      plain porridge (cornflour and micronutrients only) with Praziquantel. Prior to the&#xD;
      randomization, an initial baseline stool microscopy analysis will be done to determine the&#xD;
      presence and intensity of intestinal worms. Core indicators of nutrition-height, weight, and&#xD;
      hemoglobin counts-will also be assessed. The children will be monitored daily for three&#xD;
      months and final stool sample analysis and clinical monitoring done at the end of the study.&#xD;
      Baseline and follow-up data will be collected through Redcap software (Vanderbilt, Nashville,&#xD;
      Tenn) analyzed and compared through the latest software of SAS statistical package.&#xD;
