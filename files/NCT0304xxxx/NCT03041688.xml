  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of murine double minute chromosome&#xD;
      2 (MDM2) inhibitor KRT-232 (AMG-232) when given together with decitabine in treating patients&#xD;
      with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back (recurrent), does not respond to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory), or is newly diagnosed. KRT-232 (AMG-232) may stop the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving KRT-232&#xD;
      (AMG-232) and decitabine together may work better than decitabine alone in treating patients&#xD;
      with acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the toxicities of KRT-232 (AMG-232) in combination with decitabine (20 mg/m^2&#xD;
      for 10 days), and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) of KRT-232 (AMG-232) in combination with a standard dose of decitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of KRT-232 (AMG-232) and decitabine when&#xD;
      used in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53) signaling induced by KRT-232 (AMG-232) and&#xD;
      decitabine as measured by macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate KRT-232 (AMG-232) and decitabine exposure with pharmacodynamics endpoints&#xD;
      (efficacy, toxicity, changes in p53 signaling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the response rate (RR) and progression free survival (PFS) of KRT-232&#xD;
      (AMG-232) and decitabine in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate potential predictive biomarkers of response to KRT-232 (AMG-232) and&#xD;
      decitabine in AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of KRT-232 (AMG-232) and decitabine in AML&#xD;
      blasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the variability of decitabine incorporation into genomic deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA) and correlate with systemic pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MDM2 inhibitor KRT-232.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-10 and MDM2 inhibitor&#xD;
      KRT-232 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 4-10. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4&#xD;
      cycles in patients with evidence of persistent AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting cycle 2, patients with no morphologic evidence of AML receive decitabine IV over 1&#xD;
      hour on days 1-5 and KRT-232 PO QD on days 4-10. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

    <description>Will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined. Based on the toxicity observed, a derived variable, the occurrence of dose limiting toxicity, will be created. Will be correlated with MDM2 Inhibitor KRT-232 (KRT-232) (MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 [AMG-232]) and decitabine exposure. Toxicities will be tabulated and reported according to dose level, grade, type, cycle, and attribution- and, if numbers permit, by whether the patient had newly diagnosed or previously treated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Cumulative incidence curves will be used to estimate the proportion of patients who will discontinue therapy for reasons of toxicity or general inability to tolerate the regimen. The data from all patients treated at the RP2D, will be combined for a final summary and listing of toxicities observed.</description>

    <description>Will be measured using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric method. Standard descriptive methods (point estimates and confidence intervals, scatterplots) will be used to summarize the baseline levels and the changes from baseline (i.e. after treatment). The individual PK parameters from a single dose will be estimated maximum concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC), half-life (T1/2), apparent clearance, and apparent volume of distribution using non-compartmental or compartmental PK methods with the software WinNonlin. Cmax and AUC will be calculated for decitabine systemic exposure.</description>

             newly diagnosed AML patients will be eligible for the dose escalation part of the&#xD;
             study, but only newly diagnosed patients will be eligible for the dose expansion&#xD;
             cohort&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Eligible patient must show evidence of wild-type (WT) p53 as assessed by central DNA&#xD;
             sequencing; note, that since patients with AML have a rapidly proliferating disease,&#xD;
             patient can be enrolled and begin treatment prior to obtaining the results of this&#xD;
             test; patients who are found to the TP53 mutated will be removed from study and can&#xD;
             continue on single agent decitabine; however patients will continue to be followed for&#xD;
             toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;= 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on&#xD;
             the use of KRT-232 (AMG-232) in patients &lt; 18 years of age, children are excluded from&#xD;
             this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials&#xD;

             potential must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation through 5 weeks (women) after receiving the last dose&#xD;
             of KRT-232 (AMG-232); should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Men and women of reproductive potential who are unwilling to practice acceptable&#xD;
             methods of effective birth control while on study through 5 weeks (women) or 3 months&#xD;
             (men) after receiving the last dose of KRT-232 (AMG-232); acceptable methods of&#xD;
             effective birth control include sexual abstinence (men, women); vasectomy; or a condom&#xD;
             with spermicide (men) in combination with barrier methods, hormonal birth control or&#xD;
             IUD (women)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because KRT-232 (AMG-232) is an agent with&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with KRT-232 (AMG-232), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with KRT-232 (AMG-232); these potential risks may also apply to other agents&#xD;
             used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are lactating/breast feeding or who plan to breastfeed while on study&#xD;
             through 1 week after receiving the last dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a baseline QTc &gt; 500 msec and patients with a family history of&#xD;
             prolonged QT syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known TP53 mutations or chromosome 17 or 17p deletions&#xD;
