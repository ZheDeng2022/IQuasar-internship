  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether infraclavicular nerve block improves acute&#xD;
      postoperative pain after distal radial fracture surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single blinded randomized control trial will be performed to compare regional anaesthesia&#xD;
      with single shot infraclavicular nerve block versus general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was postoperative NRS pain score (0-10) with movement at 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery. No suitable references for postoperative NRS pain scores at 24 hours that could be&#xD;
      used for sample size calculation was found. Based on a previous study on RA versus GA for&#xD;
      hand surgery, the standard deviation estimate of the treatments for sample size calculation&#xD;
      was 2.86. To detect a difference in NRS pain score of 2.4/10 at a significance level of 0.05&#xD;
      and a power of 0.80, the minimum number of patients required per group was 23. A difference&#xD;
      of 2.4 in NRS pain score was chosen because this has been shown to correspond to 'much&#xD;
      improvement' in pain relief, which is clinically significant. To take into account for&#xD;
      possible dropouts, 26 patients were recruited into each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be approached in the general ward before operation. The aims of the study and&#xD;
      need for follow up assessment would be explained and patient will be recruited only if s/he&#xD;
      agrees. After agreeing to join the study, patients will be randomly allocated to one of two&#xD;
      groups: 1) General anaesthesia (GA) 2) Regional Anaesthesia with infraclavicular block (RA).&#xD;
      Outcomes of patients in receiving general anaesthesia (GA) will be compared with patients&#xD;
      receiving infraclavicular nerve block (RA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Intention-to-treat will be used. Patients will remain in their initial&#xD;
      designated groups for data analysis even if there is a change in surgical or&#xD;
      anaesthetic/analgesic management, as long as they are undergoing distal radial fracture&#xD;
      surgery not involving another operative site (eg bone graft). Patients in the RA group who&#xD;
      required conversion to general anaesthesia due to inadequate infraclavicular block would&#xD;
      remain in the RA group for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of chronic post surgical pain: Chi-Square test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NRS pain scores at 3 and 6 months after surgery: Mann-Whitney test to look at difference&#xD;
           in mean pain scores between two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  duration of anaesthetic, analgesic and surgical procedures, time to extubation,&#xD;
           cumulative opioid consumption, dose and frequency of rescue analgesic used, time to food&#xD;
           intake and ambulation, time to discharge, patient satisfaction: Kruskal-Wallis test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute NRS pain scores over 48 hours: Postoperative NRS pain scores were expressed in&#xD;
           median (interquartile range) and analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test with post-hoc&#xD;
           multiple comparisons using Bonferroni procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient demographic data: One way ANOVA and chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraoperative vital signs, HRQOL, HADS, DASH-HKPWH: Repeated measures ANOVA (with&#xD;
           Bonferroni correction when appropriate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects and postoperative complications: Chi Square test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When a significant result is obtained, t-test or Mann-Whitney test for numerical values&#xD;
           and Chi-square test for categorical data will be applied for post hoc pairwise&#xD;
           comparisons.&#xD;
