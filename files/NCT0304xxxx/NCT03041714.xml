      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Essential tremor is when a person has tremor, but no other neurological symptoms. Dystonic&#xD;
      tremor is when a person also has dystonia. Dystonia is a condition in which muscle&#xD;
      contraction causes changes in posture. Researchers do not fully know what areas of the brain&#xD;
      cause these tremors, or how the types differ. They also do not know what tests can identify&#xD;
      the differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To look at differences between essential tremor and dystonic tremor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with or without tremor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and urine tests. Those&#xD;
      with tremor will complete questionnaires about how tremor affects them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening and study visits can be done on the same day or on separate days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 or 2 study visits. These include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      and tremor testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For MRI, participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of a cylinder that takes&#xD;
      pictures. Sensors on the skin measure breathing, heart rate, and muscle activity. This takes&#xD;
      about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tremor testing will include transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electrical stimulation&#xD;
      of the fingers, doing a movement task, and recording of tremor movements. For TMS, two wire&#xD;
      coils will be held on the scalp and a brief magnetic field will be produced. A brief&#xD;
      electrical current will pass through the coils. For the other tests, small sticky pad&#xD;
      electrodes will be put on the skin. Participants will move their hand when they hear a sound.&#xD;
      They will get weak electrical shocks to their fingers. These tests will take 3-4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can take part in either or both parts of the study.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore a neurophysiological difference between patients with essential tremor (ET) and&#xD;
      dystonic tremor (DT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to recruit 26 healthy volunteers (HVs), 26 patients with ET, 26 patients with&#xD;
      dystonic tremor from the Movement Disorders and Botulinum Toxin (BoNT) clinics of HMCS. The&#xD;
      dystonic tremor group will be divided into 2 subgroups: pure dystonic tremor (pDT), patients&#xD;
      who have dystonia and tremor in the same limb, tremor associated with dystonia (TAWD),&#xD;
      patients who have isolated tremor with dystonia elsewhere. We plan to enroll 13 patients with&#xD;
      pDT and 13 with TAWD. We plan to recruit a total of 20 participants including patients with&#xD;
      ET, DT and HVs if the use of data from protocol 10-N-0009 is permitted. All neurophysiologic&#xD;
      results will be compared between patients and HVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will come to NIH for at least one study visit. All subjects will undergo a screening&#xD;
      visit including taking a medical history and physical examination. Then the patients will be&#xD;
      scored clinically for tremor in both ET and DT and dystonia only for DT. All subjects will&#xD;
      have a series of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies. TMS-induced&#xD;
      electromyographic (EMG) activity of hand and forearm muscles will be recorded as motor evoked&#xD;
      potentials (MEPs). Pyramidal threshold will be determined by inion stimulation. Then,&#xD;
      paired-pulse stimulation at the cerebellum followed by the motor cortex will be performed at&#xD;
      rest and at tonic activation of the hand muscle. Only patients will have recordings of tremor&#xD;
      at rest, postural holding, and with action and specific tasks such as writing by using&#xD;
      accelerometry and EMG. Additionally, a single TMS will be delivered to the motor cortex or&#xD;
      cerebellum while the patients elicit their tremor in order to explore the effect of TMS on&#xD;
      tremor. All subjects (both HVs and ET, DT) will be tested for their threshold to discriminate&#xD;
      somatosensory stimulation and for their performance of quick ballistic movements. All&#xD;
      subjects will also undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study which includes structural&#xD;
      MRI, resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), MR spectroscopy.&#xD;
      The subjects can either undergo the MRI study on the same visit as the other parts of&#xD;
      experiment or do it separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The various neurophysiological results include the data from the TMS experiment, tremor&#xD;
      analysis, threshold of temporal discrimination, ballistic movement and MRI experiment. These&#xD;
      results will be compared between HVs and patients group.&#xD;
