  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing clinical and molecular evidence for the role of hormones and specifically&#xD;
      estrogen and its receptor in schizophrenia. A selective estrogen receptor modulator,&#xD;
      raloxifene, stimulates estrogen-like activity in brain and can improve cognition in older&#xD;
      adults. The present study will test the extent to which adjunctive raloxifene treatment&#xD;
      improved cognition and reduced symptoms in young to middle-age men and women with&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      110 patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder will be recruited in a multicenter&#xD;
      twelve-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial of adjunctive 120mg&#xD;
      raloxifene treatment in addition to their usual antipsychotic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that daily treatment with raloxifene 120 milligrams (mg) in&#xD;
      addition to antipsychotic treatment improves cognition, reduces psychotic symptoms, increases&#xD;
      social and personal functioning and reduces health care costs, as compared to placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder experience substantial impairments in&#xD;
      multiple domains of everyday life, including the ability to maintain social relationships,&#xD;
      sustain employment, and live independently. These problems often persist, even after&#xD;
      successful treatment of psychosis. Currently, no consistent evidence exists for the efficacy&#xD;
      of interventions to reduce cognitive and negative symptoms, while in fact these are the&#xD;
      factors that determine functioning to a great extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premenopausal women with schizophrenia have less psychotic and negative symptoms, and better&#xD;
      cognitive and social functioning, in comparison to men and older women. This has been related&#xD;
      to protective effects of estrogens in the brain. Administering estrogens has positive effects&#xD;
      on psychotic symptoms, but exerts long-term side effects, especially in men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator, with a beneficial side effect profile&#xD;
      in women and in men. It has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms in postmenopausal&#xD;
      women with schizophrenia. Recently, positive results were found in premenopausal women and in&#xD;
      men. It is important to replicate these results in an independent sample and to investigate&#xD;
      the effects of raloxifene on functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Daily treatment with raloxifene 120 milligrams (mg) in addition to antipsychotic&#xD;
      treatment improves cognition, reduces psychotic symptoms, increases social and personal&#xD;
      functioning and reduces health care costs, as compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the hypothesized beneficial effect of&#xD;
      raloxifene as compared to placebo when given for twelve weeks in addition to antipsychotic&#xD;
      medication to patients with a psychotic disorder. The investigators expect lower symptom&#xD;
      severity as measured with the Positive And Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and improvements of&#xD;
      cognitive functioning as measured with the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia&#xD;
      (BACS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include reducement of negative symptoms as measured with the Brief&#xD;
      Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS), improvement of Personal and Social Performance (using the&#xD;
      PSP-scale), reduction of thought disorder symptoms measures with the Thought And Language&#xD;
      Disorder-scale (TALD), reduction use of health care recourses using the institute for Medical&#xD;
      Technology Assessment's Medical Consumption Questionnaire (iMTA-MCQ), productivity using the&#xD;
      institute for Medical Technology Assessment's Productivity Cost Questionnaire (iMTA-PCQ),&#xD;
      improvement of quality of life using the EuroQol-5 dimensions scale (EQ-5D), improvement in&#xD;
      both speed and error rates in the Stroop test, reduction of comorbid depression using Beck's&#xD;
      Depression Inventory (BDI), improvement of language production and various hormonal and&#xD;
      inflammatory parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized placebo-controlled multicenter double-blind trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      110 men and women diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorder,&#xD;
      or psychotic disorder not otherwise specified (DSM-IV 295.*)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either 120mg raloxifene or placebo daily for a period of&#xD;
      12 weeks. Identical tablets will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes are changes in symptom severity as measured with PANSS and changes in&#xD;
      cognition as measured with BACS. Secondary outcome are changes in negative symptoms (measured&#xD;
      with BNSS), changes in personal and social performance (measured with PSP), change in&#xD;
      severity of thought disorder (measured with TALD), quality of life (measured with EQ-5D), use&#xD;
      of healthcare and non-healthcare resources, comorbid depression (measured with BDI),&#xD;
      cognitive control (measured with a Stroop Test), language production (measured by analyzing&#xD;
      speech samples) and hormonal and inflammatory biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Use of raloxifene is associated with a small risk of side effects. The number of&#xD;
      patient visits will be limited and mainly requires time invested for physical examinations,&#xD;
      questionnaires and cognitive testing sessions (around 9 hours in total over the course of 9&#xD;
      months). Blood will be drawn at three occasions with negligible and known risks (e.g.&#xD;
      irritation). The burden and risks are acceptable while the benefits are expected to be&#xD;
      considerable.&#xD;
