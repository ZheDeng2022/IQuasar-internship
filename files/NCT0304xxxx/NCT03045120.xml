  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional, prospective study will characterize the impact of three approved&#xD;
      first and second generation BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors on cardiovascular and&#xD;
      metabolic risk factors in chronic phase CML (CP-CML) patients who are TKI naive and&#xD;
      initiating first-line TKIs in routine clinical practice in the US. All treatment decisions&#xD;
      will be determined at the discretion of the treating physician(s) and data identifying the&#xD;
      cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors will be collected. Additional fasting blood samples&#xD;
      (collected following 8 hours of fasting) will be collected during standard of care&#xD;
      (SOC)/routine office visits. Additional research imaging will be performed and will be&#xD;
      reviewed by core imaging laboratory. As the study is collecting data on management of CML,&#xD;
      this study will not influence the prescribing or management practices at participating sites.&#xD;
