  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective-observational, explorative single-centre cohort study aimed to&#xD;
      examine the influence of hemodynamic and geometric parameters on the progression of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic alterations in peripheral vessels (carotids, femoral artery). Atherosclerotic&#xD;
      alterations (IMT, plaque volume) will be measured with a ultrasound (IMT measurements and 3D&#xD;
      quantitative plaque volumetry) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Geometric parameters&#xD;
      (e.g. carotid/femoral bifurcation angle, carotid/femoral bifurcation area) are assessed with&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and also 3D ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 100 patients with an asymmetrical plaque distribution in carotid and femoral&#xD;
      arteries will be tested. Only patients who are already enrolled in the &quot;Correlation of&#xD;
      Artherosclerotic Plaque Volume and Intima Media Thickness With Soluble P-selectin&quot;&#xD;
      (NCT01895725) and who are tested prior for an asymmetrical plaque distribution will be&#xD;
      included in this study. MRI will be performed once whereas ultrasound imaging will be be&#xD;
      repeated once per year (up to five times) to assess changes in these parameters over time.&#xD;
      Also plasma samples will be collected once yearly and tested for traditional and novel&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the planned study will be the correlation between geometrical and&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters as stated above and the progression of atherosclerosis as measured by&#xD;
      plaque volume and IMT in the carotid and femoral arteries, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will include the correlation of geometrical and hemodynamic parameters&#xD;
      with established (hypertension, smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia) and novel risk factors&#xD;
      (hsCRP, P-selectin, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), intercellular adhesion&#xD;
      molecule-1 (ICAM-1), CETP TaqIb polymorphism), with cardiovascular event rate, plaque&#xD;
      localization, plaque morphology and the additional predictive value of geometrical parameters&#xD;
      compared to an established risk score (SCORE card).&#xD;

    <description>Haemodynamic/geometric parameters will be assessed with MRI and 3D-US. This includes carotid/femoral bifurcation angle, common carotid/femoral area, carotid/femoral bifurcation area, internal and external carotid area, femoral superficial artery area and carotid/femoral bifurcation length. Progression of atherosclerosis will be measured via 3D-US by plaque volume and IMT in the carotid and femoral arteries, respectively.</description>
