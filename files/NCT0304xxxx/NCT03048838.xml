  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies have attributed the source of many new HIV and STI infections among&#xD;
      MSM to primary partners. Despite recent emphasis on couples-based interventions, efficacious&#xD;
      interventions for Latino male couples have yet to be tested. The proposed study builds on the&#xD;
      PI's post-doctoral research in which he adapted evidence based intervention for Black MSM&#xD;
      couples, Connect 'n Unite, for Latino male couples using methodologically rigorous adaptation&#xD;
      procedures. The adapted intervention, Conectado Latinos en Parejas (CLP) expands the&#xD;
      prevention alternatives offered in previous interventions by incorporating biomedical&#xD;
      prevention methods such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), promoting engagement in care,&#xD;
      adherence to treatment regimens and viral suppression (TasP) and encouraging routine HIV&#xD;
      testing if appropriate given the couple's serostatus. The investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      randomized control trial (RCT) to examine whether participants assigned to CLP report an&#xD;
      increase in the proportion of HIV protected anal sex acts (operationalized as using condoms,&#xD;
      PrEP, TasP) compared to those assigned to a Wellness Promotion (WP) time matched attention&#xD;
      control. The investigators will recruit 150 Latino male couples from the Philadelphia MSA and&#xD;
      randomly assign them to CLP or WP. Participants will complete ACASIs to assess behavioral and&#xD;
      psychosocial factors and be tested for sexually transmitted infections (STI) at baseline, 3&#xD;
      and 6 month post intervention. The investigators will conduct optional HIV/STI testing at&#xD;
      baseline, 3, and 6 month post intervention. The primary study activities will be conducted at&#xD;
      a large Latino serving CBO in North Philadelphia. To our knowledge, this study will be the&#xD;
      first to examine the impact of a couple-based intervention to increase HIV protected anal sex&#xD;
      acts for Latino male couples capable of being scaled up and replicated in various communities&#xD;
      to provide continuous support and protection for this heavily impacted group.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV.&#xD;
      Experiences of stigma, discrimination, marginalization, sexual objectification, negative&#xD;
      cultural perceptions of homosexuality, and cultural values such as 'familismo' and 'machismo'&#xD;
      elevate their vulnerability to HIV infection. Many Latino MSM use substances as a way to cope&#xD;
      with or alleviate these stressors, further increasing their risk. Although efficacious&#xD;
      interventions for Latino MSM have been developed, not a single one has focused on Latino male&#xD;
      couples, despite strong evidence from White MSM that HIV infection often occurs within&#xD;
      primary couple relationships. Findings from the investigators formative study with Latino MSM&#xD;
      suggest that the factors driving HIV risk for White male couples also operate among Latino&#xD;
      male couples. For instance, Latino men in male couples were more likely to report condomless&#xD;
      anal sex and problematic alcohol use than those who were not in a relationship. Developing&#xD;
      and testing tailored interventions for Latino male couples, as the investigators are&#xD;
      proposing, is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study builds on the PI's post-doctoral research which adapted an evidence based&#xD;
      intervention for Black MSM couples, Connect 'n Unite (CNU), for Latino male couples using&#xD;
      methodologically rigorous adaptation procedures. The adapted intervention, Conectando Latinos&#xD;
      en Pareja (CLP), expands the prevention alternatives offered in previous interventions by&#xD;
      incorporating biomedical prevention methods such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP);&#xD;
      promoting engagement in care, adherence to treatment regimens and viral suppression (TasP)&#xD;
      for HIV-positive individuals and/or couples; and encouraging routine HIV testing, if&#xD;
      appropriate given the couple's serostatus. The investigators have proposed a two-phase study&#xD;
      to determine the preliminary efficacy of Conectando Latinos en Pareja to increase the&#xD;
      proportion of anal sex acts that are HIV protected (i.e. anal sex acts in which condoms,&#xD;
      PrEP, TasP, or combination thereof reduce risk of HIV transmission). During Phase 1, the&#xD;
      investigators will develop and finalize the intervention manuals and assessment instruments,&#xD;
      pilot test the intervention, and conduct the necessary preparatory activities for launching a&#xD;
      randomized control trial (RCT). During Phase 2, the investigators will conduct a RCT to&#xD;
      examine whether participants assigned to CLP report an increase in the proportion of&#xD;
      HIV-protected anal sex acts compared to those assigned to a Wellness Promotion (WP), a&#xD;
      time-matched attention control (the investigators will use an algorithm that incorporates use&#xD;
      of condoms, PrEP, and/or TasP, depending on the serostatus of the couple to compute the&#xD;
      dependent variable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 150 Latino male couples (where at least one member of the dyad&#xD;
      self-identifies as Latino) in the corridor between Philadelphia, PA and Trenton, NJ - an area&#xD;
      with porous borders where many diverse subgroups of Latinos live. The investigators will&#xD;
      randomly assign couples to CLP or WP. The investigators will assess sexual, alcohol and drug&#xD;
      use behaviors and other psychosocial factors (e.g., depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms) at&#xD;
      baseline, 3, and 6 months post-intervention. Participants who consent to optional HIV/STI&#xD;
      testing will be tested for HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea at baseline and at 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      post-intervention. The primary assessment and project management activities will be conducted&#xD;
      at GALAEI, a large Latino-serving CBO in North Philadelphia. Recruitment and screening will&#xD;
      be done at community and internet venues. Intervention activities will be conduct at GALAEI,&#xD;
      Temple University, and other safe spaces convenient to study participants.&#xD;
