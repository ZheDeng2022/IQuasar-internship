  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several epidemiologic studies reported that patients with renal insufficiency might have&#xD;
      increased cardiovascular disease-related mortality rates after Percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) . The increased risk in this population may be related to the less use of&#xD;
      standard guideline-based treatment and the resulting inability to perform PCI effectively.&#xD;
      Recently, with the technology improvement and the progress in clinical trials, Chinese&#xD;
      guidelines have made new recommendations about the patients with acute coronary syndrome(ACS)&#xD;
      in different states of renal function. However, scant epidemiologic information exists on the&#xD;
      prognosis of those patients, especially in Henan. And there is still some uncertainty whether&#xD;
      those patients are using the latest guideline recommended treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter, prospective, observational study is aimed to evaluate the long prognosis in&#xD;
      patients with acute coronary syndrome complicated with renal insufficiency, and to analysis&#xD;
      its related factors that influence the outcomes.&#xD;

      1. Henan institute of cardiology epidemiology is responsible for design, data quality&#xD;
           control and statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data were collected using a uniformed Case Report Form(CRF) by trained staff at each&#xD;
           hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample size estimation: Based on retrospective observational cohort of ACS patients,&#xD;
           1-year mortality in normal renal function and renal disfunction were 2.8% and 7.9%,&#xD;
           respectively. To achieve a precision of 15% with an α of 0.05, the loss ratio of&#xD;
           following-up is 10%.The investigators would need a sample of 2000.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical analysis plan: the investigators will report summary statistics for patient&#xD;
           characteristics, renal function status, comorbidities, treatment strategies and&#xD;
           outcomes. the investigators will also undertake the following prespecified subgroup&#xD;
           analyses: age, sex, STE-ACS or NSTE-ACS, history of diabetes, history of hypertension,&#xD;
           smoking and Syntax score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Quality assurance plan 1)Diagnosis of ACS is according to the third universal&#xD;
           definition.2)Before registry, a training program on study objectives, data collection,&#xD;
           and ACS management is given to the primary investigator and related staff at each&#xD;
           participating center.3)Henan institute of cardiology epidemiology will regularly&#xD;
           monitored at least 10% of CRFs for accuracy against medical records. If the CRFs are not&#xD;
           completed with 98% accuracy, all CRFs are considered unqualified and this staff will be&#xD;
           retrained.4)Before entering into the computer, data is queried for invalid and illogical&#xD;
           values by research staff in Henan institute of cardiology epidemiology. Participating&#xD;
           centres who has the high error rate of data, and no change in 6 months shall be deemed&#xD;
           abandoned automatically; participating centres who has the high quality of data will be&#xD;
           issued a certificate to reward.5)Investigator meeting will be annually held to conclude&#xD;
           the progress, solve existing problems and strengthen program training.&#xD;
