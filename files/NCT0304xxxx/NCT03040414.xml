    <textblock>
      Adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes often have a difficult time achieving good&#xD;
      glucose control, which is so important in reducing the risk for diabetes complications.&#xD;
      Despite the use of multiple daily injections or insulin pumps and glucose sensors, there is&#xD;
      still a need for many individuals to further improve glucose levels without causing low blood&#xD;
      glucose levels (hypoglycemia) or adding to the daily burden of living with diabetes. Today an&#xD;
      insulin pump can receive glucose readings from a continuous glucose monitor and adjust the&#xD;
      insulin delivery in an attempt to keep glucose levels in a more optimal range. These systems&#xD;
      are called hybrid closed loop (HCL). This means that much of the insulin delivery is&#xD;
      automated, yet the patient still interacts regularly with the system, particularly to help&#xD;
      determine the insulin dose to deliver to cover a meal. Results of early studies using HCL&#xD;
      systems in adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes are encouraging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of the automated insulin&#xD;
      delivery (AID) system with proportional integral-derivative (PID) algorithm (Minimed 670G 3.0&#xD;
      HCL) to an AID system with combined PID and Fuzzy Logic Algorithm (Minimed 670G 4.0 Advanced&#xD;
      Hybrid Closed-Loop (AHCL)). The trial will test the hypothesis that the Minimed AHCL can&#xD;
      reduce daytime hyperglycemia, currently the biggest challenge for AID systems, without&#xD;
      increasing hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 124 adolescents and young adults (ages 14-&lt;30) will be recruited to test each system&#xD;
      for three months in a randomized crossover trial. Investigators will compare how effective&#xD;
      each hybrid closed loop system is at preventing high blood glucose readings during the day.&#xD;
      The investigators will also evaluate the safety of each system and how participants adjust to&#xD;
      the daily use of the technology.&#xD;

      Purpose of the study: A randomized crossover trial involving up to four clinical sites in the&#xD;
      United States and three sites outside the US (Germany, Israel and Slovenia) will compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of an AID system with a PID algorithm versus an AID system with a PID&#xD;
      algorithm enhanced with a fuzzy logic algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EFFICACY: The co-primary outcomes are difference in continuous glucose monitoring&#xD;
           (CGM)-measured metrics between periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Superiority for percent of time &gt;180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) from 6 AM to 11:59 PM; and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Non-inferiority of percent of time &lt;54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) during the entire 24-hour&#xD;
                period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. KEY SAFETY OUTCOMES:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Percentage of sensor glucose readings &lt;54 mg/dL (overall is a co-primary outcomes)&#xD;
                and &lt;70 mg/dL (3.0 and 3.9 mmol/L, respectively)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) events&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Severe hypoglycemia events&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study design: Randomized crossover trial with two 12-week crossover periods in automode,&#xD;
           preceded by a run-in phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Population: A maximum of 124 individuals may be enrolled and start the run-in phase.&#xD;
           Approximately 112 are expected to enter the crossover trial, with a goal of at least 100&#xD;
           people completing the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Maximum duration of a study for a subject: Approximately 28-36 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment: Subjects will be recruited through the clinical sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Consent: Written consent/assent will be obtained for all subjects and/or guardians, in&#xD;
           accordance with human subjects and regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Informed consent will be signed and eligibility will be assessed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HbA1c measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urine pregnancy test (if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Surveys investigating participants' quality of life, psychosocial and cognitive&#xD;
                functioning, and response to their current treatment will be distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Training:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Run-In Period: (2-8 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
           * Eligible participants will use the study 670G 3.0 HCL pump during the run-in.&#xD;
           Participants who were pump users at screening may skip the Pump Run-In period (but must&#xD;
           participate in the Pump+CGM Run-In period) per investigator discretion. 670G auto mode&#xD;
           users may use the 670G pump in auto mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening and start of run-in training visits may occur on the same day or separate&#xD;
           days, but no more than 14 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standardized pump training will be provided to study participants and their diabetes&#xD;
           care partners (for participants &lt;18 years old). The study team will assist the&#xD;
           participant in study pump infusion site initiation and will start the participant on the&#xD;
           study pump. For current pump users, the study pump will be programmed with the&#xD;
           participants usual basal rates and pump parameters. The participants personal pump will&#xD;
           be removed. Participants may continue to use their personal CGM if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The pump will be used for at least two weeks during the Pump Run-In, with the option of&#xD;
           repeating Pump Run-In for an additional two weeks per investigator discretion. Contact&#xD;
           will be made each week with additional contacts as needed. Prior to each contact,&#xD;
           participants will be asked to upload device data for study staff to review.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After completion of Pump Run-In, participants will proceed to use the study CGM along&#xD;
           with the study 670G HCL pump during the Pump+CGM Run-In period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           * Pump+CGM Run-In (670G 3.0 HCL + Guardian Sensor (3)) All participants must complete a&#xD;
           two-week run-in period with the use of the study pump and CGM before being randomized&#xD;
           into the crossover trial. During Pump+CGM Run-In, the predictive low glucose suspend&#xD;
           feature will be turned on and auto mode will be off (i.e. manual mode). Participants who&#xD;
           were 670G auto mode users at screening may use the pump in auto mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standardized device training will be provided to study participants and their diabetes&#xD;
           care partners (for participants &lt;18 years old). Personal pumps and CGMs will be removed&#xD;
           during the Pump+CGM Run-In period as applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Contact will be made each week with additional contacts as needed. Prior to each&#xD;
           contact, participants will be asked to upload device data for study staff to review.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Run-In Assessment Successful completion of Pump Run-In is per investigator discretion.&#xD;
           Pump Run-In may be repeated once.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Successful completion of the Pump+CGM Run-In requires CGM data to be collected on at&#xD;
           least 80% of the possible time in the prior 14 days of use. An average of at least three&#xD;
           blood glucose meter (BGM) tests per day also will be required. If these are not&#xD;
           achieved, the Pump+CGM Run-In period may be repeated once.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization into the Crossover Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
           Eligible participants who successfully complete the Pump+CGM Run-In will be randomly&#xD;
           assigned to begin with one Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) system during Period 1 and&#xD;
           then crossover to the other AID system during Period 2. The two study AID systems&#xD;
           (treatments) are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  670G 3.0 Hybrid Closed-Loop (HCL) (PID) insulin pump + Guardian Sensor (3) CGM&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  670G 4.0 Advanced Hybrid Closed-Loop (AHCL) (PID + Fuzzy Logic) insulin pump +&#xD;
                Guardian Sensor (3) CGM&#xD;
&#xD;
           Home Use of AID System during the Crossover Trial Period 1 (~13 weeks) Participants and&#xD;
           their diabetes care partners (for participants &lt;18 years old) will be trained by&#xD;
           qualified personnel on the use of the assigned pump and on auto mode feature use&#xD;
           including meal announcement, meal bolusing, and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Training will also be provided in performing specific tasks including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Confirming pump parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  When not to use or rely on auto mode particularly during significant illness or&#xD;
                acetaminophen use&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CGM calibration instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Meal bolus procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  What to do when exercising while using the system&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  How to react to safety/alert notifications&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  How to perform fingerstick blood glucose measurements in accordance with the&#xD;
                labeling of the study CGM device&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  When and how to contact study staff to ask questions during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study staff will discuss the visit and contact schedule with the participant and will&#xD;
           make arrangements for follow-up appointments. Participants will be asked to upload data&#xD;
           before each contact and at least every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After auto mode training has been completed, participants will proceed with home use of&#xD;
           the AID system (meaning free-living use at work, home, etc.) during Period 1 with either&#xD;
           the 670G 3.0 HCL or 670G 4.0 AHCL pump. The predictive low glucose suspend feature will&#xD;
           be on.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The system will initially be used with auto mode deactivated (except for 670G auto mode&#xD;
           users at screening who may activate auto mode if using the 670G 3.0 HCL pump) until&#xD;
           participants are contacted 6-10 days into Period 1 with instructions to activate auto&#xD;
           mode. Participants will be instructed to obtain an overnight fingerstick blood glucose&#xD;
           measurement (between 2-3AM) for 2-3 nights following auto mode initiation and if&#xD;
           fingerstick blood glucose is &lt;70 mg/dL to treat with carbohydrate. Participants will&#xD;
           then continue using the AID system for 12 weeks after auto mode is initialized.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be expected to use auto mode at all times at home with some exceptions&#xD;
           (e.g. times of illness, acetaminophen use).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants on the 670G 4.0 AHCL will begin with an auto mode target glucose set point&#xD;
           of 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) that may be lowered to 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) if participant&#xD;
           meets the safety criteria per protocol and investigator discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           HbA1c, C-peptide, and glucose levels will be collected for central lab analysis at the&#xD;
           beginning of Study Period 1. Human Factors and Diabetes Technology Attitude Surveys will&#xD;
           be administered at the end of Study Period 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Period 2 (~13 weeks) At the beginning of Period 2, a urine pregnancy test will be&#xD;
           completed as applicable. Eligible participants will then use the other AID system during&#xD;
           Period 2. The procedures in Period 1 will be repeated in Period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the end of the 12-weeks of AID use in auto mode at home, the participant will&#xD;
           complete a final study visit. That visit may be completed in-person in clinic or in an&#xD;
           alternate location such as the participant's home. The study visit may occur remotely&#xD;
           via phone or videoconferencing. Certain procedures, such as the measurement of height,&#xD;
           weight, vitals, and collection of the central HbA1c sample, may be missed if the visit&#xD;
           is not completed in-person. Participants requiring a remote final visit will be&#xD;
           transitioned off of the study device during the remote contact and an arrangement will&#xD;
           be made between site staff and the participant to return all required study devices&#xD;
           either in-person or via mail.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (as diagnosed clinically) for at least one year&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 14-&lt;30 years at enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For females, not currently known to be pregnant, be breast-feeding or planning to&#xD;
             become pregnant within the study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Using an insulin pump or multiple daily injections of insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Participant must be able to obtain U-100 rapid acting insulin analogues, Aspart&#xD;
                  or Lispro, for use during the study (since these are the only insulins approved&#xD;
                  for the study pump and the study is not supplying insulin)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. MDI users must be on a basal/bolus regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Participants must have a minimum total daily dose (TDD) of at least eight units&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. HbA1c from an approved HbA1c point of care analyzer with a value 7.0%-11.0%&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willingness or ability to do carbohydrate counting&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. In the investigator's judgment, able to understand and likely to be adherent to the&#xD;
             protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For subjects &lt;18 years old, living with one or more diabetes care partners (eg.g.&#xD;
             parent/legal guardian), of whom at least one is committed to participating in study&#xD;
             training for emergency procedures for severe hypoglycemia and able to contact the&#xD;
             participant in case of an emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Have adequate internet access and a computer system that meets requirements for&#xD;
             uploading data.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. For participants currently using CGM or insulin pump, willingness to discontinue&#xD;
             personal CGM and pump when using the study CGM and pumps (note: including implantable&#xD;
             CGMs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals meeting any of the following exclusion criteria at screening will be excluded&#xD;
        from study participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Concomitant disease that influences metabolic control or HbA1c interpretation (e.g.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Current eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Currently abusing illicit drugs, marijuana, prescription drugs, or alcohol&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Visual impairment or hearing loss, which may compromise the participant's ability to&#xD;
             perform all study procedures safely, as determined by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. One or more episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) requiring hospitalization within&#xD;
             six months prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Working night shifts&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Untreated celiac disease, hyperthyroidism, or hypothyroidism&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Clinically significant nephropathy (eGFR &lt;45 mL/min) or on dialysis. Creatinine to&#xD;
             determine eGFR must have been obtained as part of usual care within 12 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment (if not available, at time of enrollment, screening can proceed but it must&#xD;
