  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a simple effectiveness trial to determine if the Lully Sleep Guardian has any&#xD;
      effect on benign nocturnal enuresis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (PMNE) is defined by the Diagnostic &amp; Statistical&#xD;
      Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM- IV) as an involuntary voiding of urine during sleep, with a&#xD;
      severity of at least twice a week, in children aged &gt;5 years in the absence of congenital or&#xD;
      acquired defects of the central nervous system(1-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PMNE affects 10-20% kids at 5 years old (1, 4, 5). It does resolve spontaneously so that 5%&#xD;
      of 10 year olds and 1% of 15 year olds are still affected (2-4). Is more common in boys.&#xD;
      While the disease its self is benign, and improves without intervention, it does pose a&#xD;
      significant social and emotional burden on the child and their family. These include parental&#xD;
      disapproval, sibling teasing, and inability to attend sleep overs with peers, all of which&#xD;
      lead to families seeking treatment options (3, 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatments start with conservative management. This includes appropriate fluid&#xD;
      intake, scheduled toileting during the day, avoidance of bladder irritants and constipation&#xD;
      (4, 5). If these fail to improve symptoms or families are looking for a more active form of&#xD;
      treatment, first line therapy is either a bed wetting alarms or desmopressin (1, 4, 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Lully Sleep Guardian was initially developed for use in night terrors. The device works&#xD;
      by programing a vibrating disk that is placed under the child's bed to alter sleep patterns&#xD;
      and prevent the onset of sleep terrors. The child is not woken up for the treatment of sleep&#xD;
      terrors. The device has also been shown to anecdotally improve users' nocturnal enuresis.&#xD;
      There have been no reports of safety concerns or hazards with the device (7, 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of scheduled awakenings, with the&#xD;
      Lully Sleep Guardian, in patients with PMNE, at reducing the frequency of bed-wetting.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Quantity of Wetness When Bedwetting Occurred While Using the Scheduled Awakening Protocol With the Lully</measure>
    <time_frame>Not measured.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to enter responses daily into a Lully Study app. In a free text box the family was asked to add additional information to describe how wet the child was using the following 1-5 scale: 1- wet underwear; 2-wet underwear and damp pajamas; 3- soaked underwear, pajamas; 4-soaked pajamas, damp mattress; 5- soaked mattress.</description>

    <measure>QOL Measures Using the KIDS Screen Questionnaire at 10 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to complete QOL survey (KIDSCREEN 27) at baseline, before starting therapeutic phase, and after completing therapeutic phase. KIDSCREEN is a standardized questionnaire for children and adolescents to assess their health related quality of life (HRQoL). Each items scored on a 5-point scale. There is the KIDSCREEN 54 (long version) KIDSCREEN 27 (short version) KIDSCREEN 10 Index. For analysis, decision made to analyze questions in the KIDSCREEN 10 Index questions only. For KIDSCREEN 10, it is a 5 point Likert Scale with a score range of 10 to 50 with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

    <description>In the initial phase, participant baseline is established. In the Therapeutic Phase, each participant will complete the study phases (S1 and S2) in the order determined by their assigned treatment arm. During the scheduled awakening protocol using Lully Sleep Guardian, a scheduled awakening will be performed each night with the Lully pod.&#xD;
During the initial and therapeutic phases of this study, participants are asked to enter responses daily into a Lully Study app. The app will send a prompt each morning. The questions the participant is prompted to answer serve to document occurrence of bedwetting and the degree of wetness.&#xD;
In addition, the family will complete the KIDSCREEN 27 and the Vancouver questionnaire at defined intervals throughout the study.</description>

          <description>The Vancouver is a 14 item questionnaire for diagnosing Dysfunctional Elimination Syndrome (DES). There is a 5-point Likert scale used for all questions. Item score range from 0 (no complaint) to 4 (severe symptoms). Question 1-13 probe for a single symptom. Question 14 speaks to ease of completing the questions. For this study, subjects with a Vancouver score less &lt; or = to 11 (for questions 1-13) met the criteria for benign nocturnal enuresis and were determined eligible to participate. Score &gt; 11 met criteria for DES. Total score range (for 1-13): min score of 0 to max of 52.</description>

        <description>Participants were asked to complete QOL survey (KIDSCREEN 27) at baseline, before starting therapeutic phase, and after completing therapeutic phase. KIDSCREEN is a standardized questionnaire for children and adolescents to assess their health related quality of life (HRQoL). Each items scored on a 5-point scale. There is the KIDSCREEN 54 (long version) KIDSCREEN 27 (short version) KIDSCREEN 10 Index. For analysis, decision made to analyze questions in the KIDSCREEN 10 Index questions only. For KIDSCREEN 10, it is a 5 point Likert Scale with a score range of 10 to 50 with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

The family received counseling on behavioral modifications during initial baseline phase to follow throughout S1.&#xD;
During this phase, a scheduled awakening was performed each night with the Lully pod following the scheduled awakening protocol using Lully Sleep Guardian. This was used to reliably produce a brief awakening by titrating the device to a minimal awakening stimulus during the first night of use. If the brief awakening could not be produced using the Lully pod, the parent was to gently awaken the child&#xD;
Participants were asked to enter responses daily into a Lully Study app. The questions the participant was prompted to answer were to serve to document occurrence of bedwetting and the degree of wetness.&#xD;
In addition, the family were asked to complete the KIDSCREEN 27 and the Vancouver questionnaire at defined intervals</description>
