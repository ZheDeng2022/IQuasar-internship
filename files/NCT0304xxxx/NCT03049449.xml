      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved treatments for a variety of treatment-resistant, CD30-expressing malignancies&#xD;
           including Hodgkin lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and other CD30- expressing&#xD;
           lymphomas are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T cells can be genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that&#xD;
           specifically target malignancy-associated antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autologous T cells genetically modified to express CARs targeting the B-cell antigen&#xD;
           CD19 have caused complete remissions in a small number of patients with lymphoma. These&#xD;
           results demonstrate that CAR-expressing T cells can have anti-lymphoma activity in&#xD;
           humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD30 expression can be easily detected by immunohistochemistry on lymphoma cells, which&#xD;
           allows selection of CD30-expressing malignancies for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD30 is not known to be expressed by normal cells except for a small number of activated&#xD;
           lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We have constructed a novel fully-human anti-CD30 CAR that can specifically recognize&#xD;
           CD30-expressing target cells in vitro and eradicate CD30-expressing tumors in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This particular CAR has not been tested before in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible toxicities include cytokine-associated toxicities such as fever, hypotension,&#xD;
           and neurological toxicities. Elimination of a small number of normal activated&#xD;
           lymphocytes is possible, and unknown toxicities are also possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Determine the safety and feasibility of administering T-cells expressing a novel fullyhuman&#xD;
      anti-CD30 CAR to patients with advanced CD30-expresssing lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have anaplastic large cell lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma not&#xD;
           otherwise specified, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, primary&#xD;
           mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, grey zone lymphoma, enteropathyassociated T-cell lymphoma,&#xD;
           or extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have malignancy that is both measurable on a CT scan with a largest&#xD;
           diameter of at least 1.5 cm and possessing increased metabolic activity detectable by&#xD;
           PET scan. Alternatively patients with lymphoma detected by flow cytometry of bone marrow&#xD;
&#xD;
      are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL or less and a normal cardiac ejection&#xD;
           fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An ECOG performance status of 0-2 is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No active infections are allowed including evidence of active HIV, hepatitis B, or&#xD;
           hepatitis C. At the time of protocol enrollment patients must be seronegative for CMV by&#xD;
           antibody testing or must have a negative blood CMV PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1000/micro L, platelet count greater&#xD;
           than or equal to 55,000/micro L, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum ALT and AST less or equal to 3 times the upper limit of the institutional normal&#xD;
           unless liver involvement by malignancy is demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 14 days must elapse between the time of any prior systemic treatment (including&#xD;
           corticosteroids above 5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent corticosteroid dose) and&#xD;
           initiation of required leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clear CD30 expression must be detected on 75% or more of malignant cells from either&#xD;
           bone marrow or lymphoma mass by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry. The patient s&#xD;
           malignancy will need to be assessed for CD30 expression by flow cytometry or&#xD;
           immunohistochemistry performed at the NIH. If unstained, paraffin-embedded bone marrow&#xD;
           or lymphoma sections are available from prior biopsies, these can be used to determine&#xD;
           CD30 expression by immunohistochemistry; otherwise, patients will need to come to the&#xD;
           NIH for a biopsy to determine CD30 expression. The sample for CD30 expression can come&#xD;
           from a biopsy obtained at any time before enrollment, unless the patient has received a&#xD;
           prior anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody, in which case the sample must come from a biopsy&#xD;
           following completion of the most recent anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or primary mediastinal B-cell&#xD;
           lymphoma must have received 2 prior treatment regimens at least 1 of which included an&#xD;
           anthracycline and an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have never had an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant as well as&#xD;
           patients who have had a 9/10 or 10/10 HLA-matched sibling or a 9/10 or 10/10 HLA-&#xD;
           matched unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant are potentially eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase I dose-escalation trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T cells obtained by leukapheresis will be genetically modified to express an anti-CD30&#xD;
           CAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive a lymphocyte-depleting chemotherapy conditioning regimen with the&#xD;
           intent of enhancing the activity of the infused anti-CD30 CAR-expressing T cells.&#xD;

             biopsy following completion of the most recent anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or primary mediastinal B-cell&#xD;
             lymphoma must have received 2 prior treatment regimens at least 1 of which included an&#xD;
             anthracycline and an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable malignancy as defined by at least one of the criteria&#xD;
             below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lymphoma mass that is measurable (minimum 1.5 cm in largest diameter) by CT scan is&#xD;
             required unless bone marrow lymphoma is detectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For a lymphoma mass to count as measurable malignancy, it must have abnormally&#xD;
             increased metabolic activity when assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For lymphoma with only bone marrow involvement, no mass is necessary, but if a mass is&#xD;
             not present, bone marrow malignancy must be detectable by flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to age 73.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical performance status of ECOG 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Room air oxygen saturation of 92% or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients and must be willing to practice birth control from the time of&#xD;
             enrollment on this study and for four months following the final CAR T-cell infusion.&#xD;
             Pre-menopausal patients (female patients who have had a menstrual period within the&#xD;
             last year) must be willing to practice birth control from the time of enrollment and&#xD;
             for one year following the final CAR T cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this&#xD;
             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can&#xD;
             have decreased immune -competence and thus are less responsive to the experimental&#xD;
             treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for HTLV-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative for hepatitis B surface antigen. Positive hepatitis B tests can be further&#xD;
             evaluated by confirmatory tests; and if confirmatory tests are negative, the patient&#xD;
             can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for hepatitis C antibody unless antigen negative. If hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
             test is positive, then patients must be tested for the presence of RNA by RT-PCR and&#xD;
             be HCV RNA negative to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient with a prior history of hepatits B or a prior history of hepatitis C may&#xD;
             participate, as long as the patient s viral hepatitis has been treated, and the&#xD;
             patient has no detectable HBV DNA or HCV RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At time of protocol enrollment, the patient should be negative for CMV by antibody&#xD;
             testing or by PCR. In case of disagreement between these 2 CMV tests, the tests will&#xD;
             be repeated and Dept. of Laboratory Medicine consulted.&#xD;
&#xD;

             doses greater than prednisone 5 mg/day or the equivalent corticosteroid doses).&#xD;
             Because this protocol requires collection of autologous blood cells by leukapheresis&#xD;
             in order to prepare CAR T cells, systemic anti-malignancy therapy including systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroid therapy at doses greater than prednisone 5 mg/day or the equivalent&#xD;
             corticosteroid doses is not allowed within 14 days prior to the required&#xD;
             leukapheresis. NOTE: Because of the long half-life and potential to affect CAR&#xD;
             T-cells, 30 days must elapse from the time of administration of anti-PD-1 or&#xD;
             anti-PD-L1 antibodies or other agents that in the opinion of the PI can stimulate&#xD;
             immune activity and infusion of CAR T-cells.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must not take corticosteroids at doses higher than 5 mg/day of prednisone or&#xD;
             the equivalent for 14 days before apheresis, and for 14 days prior to the conditioning&#xD;

          -  Patients must be willing to undergo endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
             dialysis, CPR, and electrical defibrillation. Patients must be willing to receive&#xD;
             vasopressor drugs and all other standard intensive care unit interventions. Any living&#xD;

                  that the patient received and there is no evidence of replication-competent&#xD;
                  retroviruses (evidence must be provided from prior NIH gene-therapy protocol&#xD;
