    <textblock>
      Prostate Cancer (PC) is the most frequent cancer in men, accounting for 21% of new cases of&#xD;
      cancer in men in the United States. Among the four most incident tumors (breast, lung and&#xD;
      colorectal cancer); prostate cancer is the only that does not have any predictive biomarker&#xD;
      to guide the treatment. Even though the molecular heterogeneity of PC is well-documented,&#xD;
      treatment has not been molecularly stratified and the need for genetic prognostic and&#xD;
      predictive markers is critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA repair defects (DRD), mainly in the Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway (such as BRCA1,&#xD;
      BRCA2, ATM and CHEK2) are emerging as potential biomarkers in prostate cancer. It is well&#xD;
      known BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers have better Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall&#xD;
      Survival (OS) than non-carriers in ovarian cancer. Differently than ovarian tumors that BRCA&#xD;
      mutations provides a good prognosis, PC patients who harbor HR defects have a higher Gleason&#xD;
      score 6, an increased risk of recurrence and poor prognosis. The predictive role of DRD in PC&#xD;
      was demonstrated in a recent trial using Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, in DRD carriers. This&#xD;
      trial showed 88% of response rate with Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor that acts in HR pathway by&#xD;
      synthetic lethality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data demonstrated important association between HR deficient high-grade serous ovarian&#xD;
      cancer (HGSOC), high neoantigen load and high expression of PD-1/PD-L1 compared with HR&#xD;
      proficient HGSOCs 10. This study showed that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations increase the number of&#xD;
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and confer a better prognosis. The unprecedented&#xD;
      success of immunotherapy in malignant disorders has provided evidence that the patient's&#xD;
      immune system can be improved to attack established tumors, mainly melanoma, non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer and kidney cancer. A high mutational burden increases the likelihood of the&#xD;
      development of specific neoepitopes that would confer clinical benefit from CTLA-4 and PD-1&#xD;
      blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data showed that specific DNA repair defects increase the mutational burden, the&#xD;
      expression of PD-1/PD-L1 and TILs; and could improve the response to immunotherapy in cancer.&#xD;
      This rationale was already tested in a trial that evaluated the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab in mismatch-repair deficient patients, a kind of DNA repair defect by&#xD;
      definition. This important trial showed that this DRD predicted clinical benefit of immune&#xD;
      checkpoint blockade in many types of cancer, especially colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      This is a Phase II, two-stage, multi-center, single-arm, and open-label trial of Nivolumab&#xD;
      (BMS-936558) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who&#xD;
      have progressed to a taxane-based chemotherapy regimen previously. Eligible patients must&#xD;
      have ECOG 0-2 and material for biomarker analysis. Prior enzalutamide, abiraterone and&#xD;
      cabazitaxel are permitted but not necessary to enrollment. The germline and somatic DRD&#xD;
      (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PTEN, CHEK2, RAD51C, RAD51D, PALB2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2.) will be&#xD;
      assessed by T-NGS of metastatic sites or by liquid biopsy. The primary endpoint is PSA 50&#xD;
      response rate (PSA50, following the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria). The trial will&#xD;
      meet its endpoint if ≥ 3/29 men achieve a PSA50 response. The secondary endpoints will&#xD;
      include progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, radiologic PFS, PSA response rate&#xD;
      at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate with tumor tissue available&#xD;
             for molecular analyses. If archival tissue for biomarker analysis is not available&#xD;
             then the patient must be willing to have a further biopsy to obtain tumor tissue for&#xD;
             histological diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Metastatic Castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Disease progression despite androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and may present as&#xD;
                  either a continuous rise in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, the&#xD;
                  progression of pre-existing disease, and/or the appearance of new metastases.&#xD;

                  50% and ≥ 2 ng/mL above the nadir, and which is confirmed by a second value ≥ 3&#xD;
                  weeks later (confirmed the rising trend).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiographic progression of visceral lesions or soft tissue disease by modified&#xD;
