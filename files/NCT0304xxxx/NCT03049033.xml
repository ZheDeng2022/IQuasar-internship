  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is defined by characteristic motor symptoms including slow&#xD;
      movements, small movements, difficulty with movement initiation and disruptions in timing.&#xD;
      Besides gross motor symptoms, fine motor impairments in PD cause difficulties with everyday&#xD;
      tasks such as writing, self-care, and fine object manipulation. These activity limitations&#xD;
      can lead to disability, social isolation, and a reduced quality of life. In a series of&#xD;
      breakthrough studies Michael Thaut and colleagues developed Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT)&#xD;
      and found it can address many gross motor impairments and improve gait and balance. Other&#xD;
      music therapies such as Music-supported Therapy (MST) have proven motor benefits in stroke&#xD;
      patients through movement exercises with musical instruments. However, the pathological basal&#xD;
      ganglia (BG) in PD brains leads to a reduced supply of those internally generated movements.&#xD;
      In contrast, externally cued movements (eg. via a beat or a rhythm) during NMT sessions are&#xD;
      instantaneously entrained to the period of a rhythmic stimulus possibly without involvement&#xD;
      of the BG. The underlying idea is that rhythm is the essential component relating music&#xD;
      specifically to motor behavior. The mechanism of action is called &quot;rhythmic entrainment&quot;&#xD;
      where one system's motion or signal frequency entrains the frequency of another system. The&#xD;
      effect of NMT on fine motor function has not been investigated yet. Music activities are&#xD;
      important in the lives of many older adults. Notably, the use of music has been associated&#xD;
      with increased well-being for older adults, as it fosters social connection and mood&#xD;
      regulation. Furthermore, many musical activities have limited physical demands, making them&#xD;
      attainable for individuals who are living with mobility impairments or other physical&#xD;
      restrictions. Based on the literature and the investigators preliminary studies, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to test the efficacy of Neurologic Music Therapy in comparison to Music&#xD;
      Supported Therapy and Occupational Therapy (OT) as standard of care on adults in the&#xD;
      Parkinson's spectrum. The investigators have defined a working plan using different musical&#xD;
      instruments and growing tempo to specifically improve fine motor movements.&#xD;
