  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform longitudinal high-resolution 7T MRI and Prisma 3T MRI&#xD;
      in participants with first-episode psychosis (FEP) enrolled in our ongoing randomized&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial (RCT) of cognitive training. The investigators seek to determine&#xD;
      whether a 12-week course of intensive cognitive training of auditory processing in young FEP&#xD;
      patients delivered remotely as a stand-alone treatment is neuroprotective against neural&#xD;
      tissue loss in auditory cortex (superior temporal gyrus, STG), and possibly in other cortical&#xD;
      regions. The investigators will also observe the effects of training on white matter&#xD;
      integrity in the brain.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current protocol seeks to examine whether cognitive training can prevent accelerated gray&#xD;
      matter loss and promote changes in the functional connectome in first-episode psychosis&#xD;
      patients. Specifically, we aim to use Prisma 3T and 7T imaging to examine functional,&#xD;
      structural, and diffusion weighted images to determine whether these treatments can influence&#xD;
      neural plasticity. Scanning will be done at the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR)&#xD;
      at the University of Minnesota. Participants will complete three approximately one-hour&#xD;
      scanning sessions on the 3T Siemens Prisma scanner and three approximately one-hour scanning&#xD;
      sessions on the 7T-AS scanner. We aim to use scan sequences compatible with the Human&#xD;
      Connectome Project both for purposes of cross collaboration and data sharing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will seek to enroll 80 participants. 60 participants will be considered First&#xD;
      Episode Psychosis (FEP) patients, meaning that they have been diagnosed with a psychotic&#xD;
      illness and have started receiving treatment at a First Episode Psychosis clinic (following&#xD;
      the NAVIGATE model) within the last two years prior to enrollment. These participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from a separate study protocol conducted by Dr. Sophia Vinogradov which examines&#xD;
      remote cognitive training in FEP subjects (Minnesota Community-Based Cognitive Training in&#xD;
      Early Psychosis, NCT03079024). 20 of these participants will receive treatment as usual&#xD;
      (TAU), 20 will be assigned to Targeted Cognitive Training (TCT), and 20 will be assigned to&#xD;
      Generalized Cognitive Exercises (GCE). Additionally, the investigators will enroll 20&#xD;
      healthy, age and gender matched controls (HC). All participants will undergo one 7T MRI and&#xD;
      one Prisma scan at three time points: Baseline; Post-Intervention/12-weeks; and 6 month&#xD;
      follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three 3T scan sessions will be matched as closely as possible, given hardware&#xD;
      limitations, to the HCP 3T imaging protocol described here:&#xD;
      http://protocols.humanconnectome.org/HCP/3T/imaging-protocols.html. This will include ~16&#xD;
      minutes of 3D structural imaging using MP-RAGE and T2-weighted scans, ~14 minutes of resting&#xD;
      state fMRI relying on a gradient-echo EPI sequence, and 18 minutes of diffusion weighted MRI&#xD;
      relying on a spin-echo EPI sequence. Scan parameters for acquisitions will seek to match the&#xD;
      HCP Lifespan data acquired to date on the CMRR Prisma 3T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 7T scans, we will collect a standard T1-weighted MP2-RAGE structural scan, 12 minutes of&#xD;
      resting fMRI using standard gradient-echo EPI sequences, and a diffusion-weighted DTI&#xD;
      sequence compatible both with HCP and 7T-AS hardware. To maximize use of high-resolution&#xD;
      imaging techniques while balancing ease of access and use, we aim to use the Siemens 7T-AS&#xD;
      scanner with the NOVA 32-Channel head coil optimized for both structural and functional&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use the Siemens Prisma 3T MRI system and 7T MRIs to investigate longitudinal changes in&#xD;
           brain gray matter volume in left Heschl gyrus (HG) and left planum temporale (PT)&#xD;
           between baseline, post-training (approximately 12 weeks), and 12 months, within 20 FEP&#xD;
           subjects who have undergone targeted cognitive training of auditory processing and 20&#xD;
           FEP subjects who have undergone general cognitive exercises, as compared to 20&#xD;
           treatment-as-usual FEP subjects and 20 age and gender matched healthy controls.&#xD;
           Secondarily, we will also examine gray matter volume changes in prefrontal, parietal,&#xD;
           and left hippocampual cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use the Siemens Prisma 3T MRI system and 7T MRI to investigate longitudinal changes in&#xD;
           left temporal lobe white matter integrity between baseline, post-training (approximately&#xD;
           12 weeks), and 12 months, within 20 FEP subjects who have undergone targeted cognitive&#xD;
           training of auditory processing and 20 FEP subjects who have undergone general cognitive&#xD;
           exercises, as compared to 20 treatment-as-usual FEP subjects and 20 age and gender&#xD;
           matched healthy controls. Secondarily, we will also examine changes in left superior&#xD;
           longitudinal fasiculus, left arcuate fasciculus, left uncinated fasciculus, left&#xD;
           uncinated fasciculus, cingulum bundle, and corpus callosum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate the association of changes in brain gray matter volume and white matter&#xD;
           integrity with changes in clinical, cognitive and functional outcome measures in the FEP&#xD;
           subjects who have undergone training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use Prisma 3T and 7T MRI to explore longitudinal changes between baseline, post-training&#xD;
           (approximately 12 weeks), and at 6 month follow-up, in a novel putative MRI diffusion&#xD;
           imaging biomarker that may represent neuroinflammation (extracellular volume fraction)&#xD;
           in 20 FEP subjects who have undergone targeted cognitive training and 20 FEP subjects&#xD;
           who have undergone general cognitive exercises, as compared to 20 treatment-as-usual FEP&#xD;
           subjects and 20 age and gender matched healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate the association of these changes with clinical, cognitive, and functional&#xD;
           outcomes in the subject groups.&#xD;

        FEP participants will be currently enrolled in &quot;Minnesota Community Based Cognitive&#xD;
        Training in Early Schizophrenia,&quot; NCT03079024. This study examines cognitive training&#xD;
        delivered remotely to patients who receive treatment for FEP at a NAVIGATE-model clinic.&#xD;
        There are three groups in this study: one receives targeted cognitive training (TCT); one&#xD;
        receives general cognitive exercises (GCE); and the third receives treatment-as-usual&#xD;
        (TAU). Cognitive training groups complete up to 30 hours of training over 6-12 weeks. 20&#xD;
        participants in each arm will be recruited for a total of 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control subjects who are matched to the FEP participants in age and gender will be&#xD;
        recruited from the community. We will recruit a total of 20 psychologically and physically&#xD;
        healthy adults for this study.&#xD;
