  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke, which is due to the occlusion of a cerebral blood vessel, comprises nearly&#xD;
      80-90% of all strokes. Currently, reperfusion of the salvageable tissue via thrombolytic drug&#xD;
      or endovascular treatment is the most effective strategy to reduce brain damage. However,&#xD;
      after recanalizing the occluded vessels, subsequent reperfusion injury is inevitable. It may&#xD;
      not only weaken the therapeutic effects of timely reperfusion but also impede patients'&#xD;
      recovery. Moreover, thousands of neuroprotective drugs effective in experimental models have&#xD;
      been proved to be unsuccessful in clinical trials. Therefore, effective strategies are&#xD;
      urgently needed to prevent and treat cerebral reperfusion injury and further improve the&#xD;
      prognosis of acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers applied remote ischemic conditioning to mouse model of focal cerebral reperfusion&#xD;
      injury and found that it could reduce cerebral infarct size. And clinical researches&#xD;
      demonstrated that remote ischemic conditioning was an effective strategy to improve cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion and prevent recurrent stroke in patients with ischemic stroke. However, whether&#xD;
      remote ischemic conditioning is safe and effective in protecting patients with large-vessel&#xD;
      ischemic stroke and undergoing endovascular treatment is still unclear. The investigators'&#xD;
      hypothesis is that RIC is a safe and effective strategy to reduce brain injuries in stroke&#xD;
      patients undergoing endovascular treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The RIC procedure consists of four cycles of unilateral arm ischemia for 5 minutes, which was followed by reperfusion for another 5 minutes. The procedure is performed with an electric, autocontrol device with a cuff that inflated to a pressure of 200 mmHg during the ischemia period. RIC is performed before recanalization of the occluded artery, immediately following successful recanalization, and once daily for the subsequent 7 days.</description>
