    <textblock>
      The AVAIL-T trial is designed to find out how effective avelumab is at treating patients with&#xD;
      primary T-cell lymphoma that is refratory to or has relapsed following initial treatment. Up&#xD;
      to 36 people will be taking part in the AVAIL-T trial at hospitals across the United Kingdom.&#xD;
      All patients on the trial will be recruited over 2 years and recieve up to 8 cycles of&#xD;
      avelumab treatment. Avelumab is an anti-PD-L1 antibody that will be given as an infusion once&#xD;
      every 2 weeks in cycles lasting 28 days. The trial will be looking at the response to&#xD;
      aveulumab, by mesuring the change in the tumour size using CT scans, and seeing how long that&#xD;
      response is maintained. The trial will also look at toxicity, overall survival, and&#xD;
      progression free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition we will analyse blood samples and samples of the cancer to understand better how&#xD;
      the cancer behaves. This may guide the investigators in developing better treatments in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
