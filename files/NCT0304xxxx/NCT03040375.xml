    <textblock>
      Undernutrition and poor cognitive development affect many children under 5 in developing&#xD;
      countries, who are exposed to multiple risk factors including poverty, malnutrition, poor&#xD;
      health, and unstimulating home environments. The optimum development and growth of young&#xD;
      children requires affection and responsiveness from the mother/caregiver, cognitive&#xD;
      stimulation, good nutrition and infection control. In Bangladesh, stimulation at home is&#xD;
      generally poor and contributes to children's poorer development. It is important to show that&#xD;
      psychosocial stimulation programmes through home visits integrated into the feeding&#xD;
      programmes can benefit children's growth and development. This study will help to fill this&#xD;
      evidence gap about effective interventions to improve infant and young child growth and&#xD;
      development in Bangladesh. Considering the high prevalence of undernutrition and low&#xD;
      prevalence of stimulating environments in Bangladesh, it is important to show evidence that&#xD;
      integrating infant feeding counselling and psychosocial stimulation activities result in&#xD;
      optimum child growth &amp; development. To determine if combined infant feeding counselling and&#xD;
      psychosocial stimulation programme (promoting mothers positive parenting) starting in the 3rd&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy, further improves: children's cognitive, motor and language&#xD;
      development along with growth and mothers' child rearing and child-feeding knowledge and&#xD;
      practices compared to peer counselling alone or usual health messages only. We used a&#xD;
      community-based CRCT to examine the impact of a peer counselling infant feeding education&#xD;
      program with psychosocial stimulation starting in the third trimester of pregnancy to one&#xD;
      year after delivery, to improve child growth and cognition, language, behaviour and&#xD;
      psychomotor development compared to a control group receiving usual health messages. The&#xD;
      outcome assessments were made on a cohort of infant-mother dyads measured at baseline and at&#xD;
      follow up visits. Outcome assessments were conducted with all the mother-infant pairs&#xD;
      recruited in the community clusters in the study, with an expected total of 334 mother-infant&#xD;
      dyads (167 in each treatment group).The main outcomes are children's growth, cognition,&#xD;
      language, behaviour and psychomotor development&#xD;

      Study design It was a randomized controlled trial of integrating infant feeding counselling&#xD;
      and psychosocial stimulation in slums of Mirpur, Dhaka. The trial was conducted in slum&#xD;
      communities on the edge of Dhaka with 10 clusters of city blocks for each of the 2 study&#xD;
      groups (167 mothers/infant pairs in each group). The two groups 1) Psychosocial stimulation +&#xD;
      feeding counselling group and 2) Control group. The peer counselling education and&#xD;
      psychosocial stimulation intervention will be delivered to the mothers, by locally recruited&#xD;
      and trained peer counsellors, starting in the third trimester of pregnancy until the child is&#xD;
      one year of age. The peer counselling education was offered to eligible pregnant women&#xD;
      identified by household survey over 2 months in each community cluster in the intervention&#xD;
      groups. Using a similar approach to recruitment, a cohort of mother-infant dyads, who&#xD;
      received standard maternal and child health care programmes,were identified in the control&#xD;
      clusters. Outcome assessments conducted with all the mother-infant pairs recruited in the&#xD;
      community clusters in the study, with an expected total of 334 mother-infant dyads. There was&#xD;
      a baseline assessment of demographic information and further assessments of growth every 3&#xD;
      months from birth until the children are 12 months of age. The developmental assessments in&#xD;
      children will be conducted at 12 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling scheme A community based randomized controlled trial namely &quot;Mirpur Shishu Pushti&#xD;
      Trial&quot; is ongoing in 36 clusters within 4 wards of Mirpur municipality. The average&#xD;
      population of a &quot;Ward&quot; is 350,000 people. There are approximately five &quot;Mahallas&quot; per &quot;Ward&quot;&#xD;
      with an average population of 70,000 people. The unit of randomization for this trial was&#xD;
      city block clusters (CBC) with a population of about 6,000. A list of 36 CBC has already been&#xD;
      prepared using established GIS methods to map and census the households. These CBC are being&#xD;
      used in the ongoing community trial (Shishu Pusti trial). This ongoing study includes two&#xD;
      arms; a peer-counselling (Infant and Young Child Feeding) arm and a control arm and the aims&#xD;
      are to assess if the peer-counselling program improves children's growth through an&#xD;
      improvement in child-feeding program. In this present study, two stage cluster sampling will&#xD;
      be used, at the first stage 10 cluster will be randomly selected from 36 pre-defined clusters&#xD;
      under this study area, on the second stage, 5 clusters will be randomly allocated for each of&#xD;
      the treatment group. As the duration of the present study is only 18 months, utilization of&#xD;
      the same study field along with GIS mapping and population census will allow us to minimize&#xD;
      time as well as cost for the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trained field assistants identified women who were in their third trimester of pregnancy by&#xD;
      systematic door-to-door surveys across the &quot;clusters&quot; over two months period. Pregnant women&#xD;
      aged 16 to 49 years were included. Women who plan to migrate from the Mirpur area after&#xD;
      delivery was excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two types of intervention: one providing breast-feeding and complementary&#xD;
      feeding counselling and the other breast-feeding and complementary feeding counselling +&#xD;
      psychosocial stimulation interventions. The proposed individual peer counselling education&#xD;
      will be of sufficient intensity to alter infant and young child feeding practices and to&#xD;
      improve the growth and development of the young children, hence prevent malnutrition and&#xD;
      developmental delay. The interventions will be delivered to the women starting in last&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy and until their child is one year of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Description of intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approach to promoting appropriate infant and young child feeding was through a programme&#xD;
      of home-based peer counselling by trained, local women from the mothers' community. The peer&#xD;
      counselling education and psychosocial stimulation intervention delivered to the mothers, by&#xD;
      Peer Counsellors. The stimulation intervention included age-appropriate developmental&#xD;
      messages and handmade toys provided by the Counsellors during home visits at regular&#xD;
      intervals along with feeding counselling. The mothers were shown age appropriate stimulation&#xD;
      activities for their child. There was at least 13 visits by the Counsellors: 2 visits before&#xD;
      delivery; 2 visits during the 1st month; 7 monthly visits between age 2 to 8 months; and 2&#xD;
      visits at age 10 and 12 months and bi-weekly group meetings. The integrated programme&#xD;
      included social mobilization activities to help families adapt improved child care practices&#xD;
      to achieve optimum child growth and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Selection and training of peer counsellors Women with personal breastfeeding experience,&#xD;
      at least 6 years of schooling, residing in the same area, and motivated to work were selected&#xD;
      to become peer counsellors. The WHO/UNICEF Breastfeeding Counselling Course adapted to the&#xD;
      local language and culture, which has already been validated in a previous study, was used&#xD;
      for training of peer counsellors. The training was given for 40-h (4-h daily for 10 days).&#xD;
      Counselling skills was taught mainly by demonstrations and role play and included: listening&#xD;
      to mothers, learning about their difficulties, assessing the position and attachment of&#xD;
      babies during breastfeeding, building mother's confidence, giving support and providing&#xD;
      relevant information and practical help when required. During the training course antenatal&#xD;
      and postpartum counselling wase practiced with pregnant women, mothers with newborns and&#xD;
      infants aged 1-12 months in the field site. The counsellors were also be taught how to use&#xD;
      locally available foods for complementary feeding of infants and young children, and how best&#xD;
      to demonstrate these food preparation skills to mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stimulation intervention included age-appropriate developmental messages, flip charts and&#xD;
      handmade toys that will be provided by the Peer Counsellors during home visited at regular&#xD;
      intervals along with feeding counselling. The mothers were shown three to four age&#xD;
      appropriate stimulation activities with child and how to make toys using recycled materials.&#xD;
      As children grow up, mothers were also be taught how to make simple one page books, suitable&#xD;
      for use by less literate mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short version of the Stimulation Curriculum will take 30-40 minutes and included the&#xD;
      following activities during home visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explaining 2-3 stimulation messages (e.g. how to show love, how to respond, how to&#xD;
           facilitate communication etc) along with their benefits on child-development&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explaining 1 Pictorial Stimulation Calendar containing 3 to 4 age appropriate activities&#xD;
           with the child until next visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Teaching mothers and other family members how to make toys from recycled materials The&#xD;
           performance of the counsellors was monitored at least four times during the course of&#xD;
           the study by the Senior Infant Feeding Counsellors and stimulation supervisors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Counseling schedules: There was a schedule of at least 13 visits by the peer counsellors:&#xD;
      two before delivery; two during the first month; seven monthly visits between age 2 to 8&#xD;
      months; and two visits at age 10 and 12 months. The counselling took place at home to ensure&#xD;
      key family members (e.g. mother-in-law and fathers) can also be included in the counselling&#xD;
      sessions. The duration of each visit was from 30 to 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antenatal visits: The peer counsellors during the two antenatal contactswould prepare the&#xD;
      mothers, and other members of the family who would support her at delivery, about the&#xD;
      importance of holding the baby within a few minutes of delivery and how to initiate&#xD;
      breastfeeding within one hour of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, they would provide some guidelines on the importance of feeling well and happy&#xD;
      during pregnancy, singing to the baby in the womb, avoiding any harmful practices like use of&#xD;
      tobacco. Fathers and other household members was be briefed on the importance of keeping the&#xD;
      mother happy and joyful and avoiding subjecting her to violence or any harsh treatment. ECD&#xD;
      messages like playing, chatting and singing to the newborn will be provided in the&#xD;
      psychosocial stimulation arm along with feeding messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits in the first month of life: The mothers were contacted twice by the peer counsellors&#xD;
      (within 48 hours of delivery and at 10-14 days). At these visits exclusive breastfeeding was&#xD;
      encouraged and the mother's specific needs addressed. Issues that could be covered include&#xD;
      sore nipples, problems with attachment to the breast, the baby's position during feeds,&#xD;
      family pressure to start other foods and mothers' doubts about the adequacy of their breast&#xD;
      milk. I Age-appropriate ECD messages was provided and mothers will be prepared for child's&#xD;
      developmental requirements as s/he grows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2 to 8 months of life: The mothers were contacted monthly by the peer counsellors.&#xD;
      Specific problems will be addressed and continued support for breastfeeding provided&#xD;
      especially how to deal with pressures to introduce other foods and concerns about the&#xD;
      adequacy of the growth of the infant. From 6 months of age, specific messages that include,&#xD;
      the importance of complementary feeding, demonstration and preparation of complementary foods&#xD;
      introduction. Mothers will be given measuring cups and spoons and appropriate complementary&#xD;
      foods were demonstrated and use of usual foods in the home will be encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly other age-appropriate ECD messages was provided and PCs will try to include other&#xD;
      family members in these sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits at 10 and 12 months of life: The mothers contacted at 10 and 12 months by the peer&#xD;
      counsellors. The mothers were encouraged to continue breastfeeding and support will be given&#xD;
      for adequate frequency of complementary feeds and appropriate diversity foods.&#xD;
