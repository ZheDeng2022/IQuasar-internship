      Assess the safety and effectiveness of stem cell application with regard to improvement in&#xD;
      regional myocardial function in patients receiving Trans-Myocardial Laser Revascularization&#xD;
      (TMR) and stem cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple case experiences and studies have been published reviewing clinical experiences with&#xD;
      Carbon Dioxide Trans-Myocardial Laser Revascularization (TMR) and autologous bone marrow&#xD;
      derived cell application. These experiences have demonstrated perfusion improvements,&#xD;
      ejection fraction improvements and improvements in angina or heart failure symptoms. The&#xD;
      investigators elected to examine the use of CD133 positive (CD133+) BM-derived stem cells&#xD;
      because of their pluripotent nature and the fact that during the CD133 selection process&#xD;
      inflammatory cells present in the bone marrow are being discarded. CD133+ is a recently&#xD;
      discovered marker for more primitive bone marrow derived multipotent stem and endothelial&#xD;
      progenitor cells and is of particular interest in studies directed to therapeutic&#xD;
      angiogenesis, as these cells have been shown to differentiate into endothelial and myogenic&#xD;
      cell lines. Multiple studies have utilized BM derived cells for myocardial regeneration.&#xD;
      Patients who received CD133+ cells showed improved perfusion at injection sites of stem cells&#xD;
      leading to a significant increase in volume of left ventricular ejection fraction, regional&#xD;
      wall motion in the infarct zone, and a reduction in end systolic left ventricular volume.&#xD;
