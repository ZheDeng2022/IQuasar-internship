  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of practice for the maintenance of epidural analgesia is through use of&#xD;
      a continuous infusion pump. Enhanced technology now supports the use of programmed&#xD;
      intermittent bolus (PIEB) administration. This novel drug delivery system provides small&#xD;
      boluses of local anesthetic and opioid at programmed intervals. Several studies suggest that&#xD;
      administration of PIEB allows a more extensive spread of local anesthetic in the epidural&#xD;
      space and provides superior labour analgesia compared to traditional continuous epidural&#xD;
      infusions. PIEB is associated with lower anesthetic consumption, a shorter second stage of&#xD;
      labour and greater patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors are focusing on a PIEB setting known as the &quot;Next Bolus&quot;. &quot;Next Bolus&quot; (NB)&#xD;
      determines when the first PIEB bolus is given after the initiation of the epidural and&#xD;
      starting the PIEB pump. Currently we set this to be 15-45 minutes. In an attempt to optimize&#xD;
      resources, authors hope to determine the optimal NB interval that will provide adequate&#xD;
      analgesia but limit overall drug consumption. An optimally timed next bolus should minimize&#xD;
      drug costs and limit nurse and physician intervention by decreasing the need for manual&#xD;
      boluses.Increased local anesthetic consumption can cause undesirable side effects such as&#xD;
      itchiness, decreased blood pressure and motor blockade. By assigning patients to receive the&#xD;
      NB at 15, 30 or 45 minutes the authors hope to find the interval that provides analgesia&#xD;
      while minimizing side effects, improving patient safety. If the bolus is given too late then&#xD;
      there may be increased pain, less patient satisfaction, and the need for more analgesia in&#xD;
      the form of Patient Controlled Epidural Anesthesia or a manual bolus.The authors hope that&#xD;
      determining the NB will result in an institutional change to improve patient outcomes and&#xD;
      facilitate knowledge transfer. This information will be the first available research to help&#xD;
      guide other obstetrical centres using PIEB technology in determining the optimal NB interval.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced epidural pump technology now supports the use of automated or programmed&#xD;
      intermittent bolus (PIB) administration. Anesthesiologists can now program pumps to deliver&#xD;
      small, regularly timed intermittent boluses for maintenance of labour analgesia and specify&#xD;
      &quot;lockout&quot; intervals to ensure patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies suggest that administration of PIB may result in a more extensive spread of&#xD;
      local anesthetic in the epidural space and provide superior labour analgesia compared to CEI.&#xD;
      In a recently published systematic review by George et al. (1), PIB was associated with lower&#xD;
      anesthetic consumption, a shorter second stage of labour and greater patient satisfaction&#xD;
      compared to CEI (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal PIB volume and dosing interval for programmed intermittent bolus has not been&#xD;
      determined. A small volume with a short bolus interval may be associated with similar&#xD;
      drawbacks as continuous infusion, while a large volume bolus interval may be associated with&#xD;
      increased breakthrough pain and reduced patient satisfaction. Wong et al. showed that&#xD;
      extending the PIB interval from 15 min to 60 min with a larger PIB volume (10 mL vs. 2.5 mL)&#xD;
      results in decreased anesthetic consumption without affecting patient satisfaction (3). Until&#xD;
      recently, there was not a pump that could provide PIB along with PCEA. Smith Medical now&#xD;
      produces the CADD pump with this feature. It ensures that that there are specific limits set&#xD;
      to not allow &quot;stacking&quot; of boluses and potentially unsafe administration of local&#xD;
      anesthetics. This pump now has more variables to program and determine the quality of labour&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variable that has not received any research attention is the &quot;Next Bolus&quot; (Figure 5). &quot;Next&#xD;
      Bolus&quot; (NB) determines when the first PIB bolus is given after the initiation of the epidural&#xD;
      and starting of the pump. Currently we set this to be 15-45 minutes depending on the&#xD;
      clinician. Determining the optimal timing of the NB is important because if the bolus is&#xD;
      given too late there may be increased pain and less patient satisfaction. This could lead to&#xD;
      earlier initiation of PCEA, more frequent PCEA attempts and possibly the need for physician&#xD;
      intervention for a manual bolus. As more local anesthetic is delivered, the patient may have&#xD;
      a decrease in blood pressure or greater motor blockade (i.e. leg weakness) than desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design &amp; Procedure Potential participants will be identified by research personnel by&#xD;
      communicating with the attending anesthesiologist on the Birth Unit and the Clinical Leader&#xD;
      of Operations for the Birth Unit at the IWK Health Centre. Birth Unit nurses will receive an&#xD;
      educational session and training provided by the research coordinator prior to study&#xD;
      commencement. Birth unit nurses will be notified by the Clinical Leader of Operations if&#xD;
      their patient meets study inclusion criteria. The patient's nurse will review options for&#xD;
      labour pain relief with the patient. These options include non-pharmacological measures&#xD;
      (baths, massage, hypnosis etc.), inhaled nitrous oxide, opioid injections, or an epidural.&#xD;
      When labour pain management options are introduced, the nurse will provide the patient with a&#xD;
      brochure that includes basic study information. If an epidural is requested for labour&#xD;
      analgesia, nurses who have received education regarding the study, will ask the patient if&#xD;
      they would be willing to speak with research staff. With their consent, participants will be&#xD;
      approached by study personnel and informed, written consent will be obtained. As standard&#xD;
      care in the birth unit, upon request of labour analgesia, the cervix will be measured and a&#xD;
      baseline pain score and blood pressure will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A staff anesthesiologist will use a combined spinal-epidural (CSE) technique to initiate&#xD;
      labour analgesia. As per standard practice at the IWK, an IV catheter will be in place before&#xD;
      initiation of the technique. With the patient in the sitting position, the epidural space&#xD;
      will be identified at the L3-4 or L2-3 interspace with a 17G, 9 cm Tuohy epidural needle&#xD;
      using a loss of resistance to air or saline (&lt; 1 mL) technique. A 27G, 12 cm Whitacre spinal&#xD;
      needle will be placed into the shaft of the epidural needle and the presence of cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid in the hub of the spinal needle will confirm dural puncture. Bupivicaine 0.25% 0.8 mL&#xD;
      (2 mg) + Fentanyl 10 mcg (total 1 mL) will be injected into the intrathecal space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be randomly allocated (using a computer generated randomization table)&#xD;
      to one of three groups. Group assignments will be sealed in sequentially numbered envelopes&#xD;
      that will be opened by study personnel following the consent process. The pump will be&#xD;
      programmed by an unblinded member of the anesthesia team (anesthesiologist or anaesthesia&#xD;
      assistant) and maintenance epidural analgesia will be initiated in accordance with IWK&#xD;
      policies when the epidural procedure is complete. The individual programming the pump will&#xD;
      not be collecting data. The start time of the pump will be recorded on the envelope and the&#xD;
      sealed envelope will be given to the study personnel. The pump will be connected and&#xD;
      initiated once the epidural procedure is complete and will start the infusion exactly 5&#xD;
      minutes after the intrathecal injection. Each participant will have the same PIB settings&#xD;
      (PIB bolus 8 mL, PIB interval 45 minutes). Group A will be assigned a NB of 15 minutes, group&#xD;
      B 30 minutes and group C 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will take place in the patient's assigned labour room in the IWK Birth&#xD;
      Unit. The CADD Solis Ambulatory Infusion System (Smiths Medical ASD, Inc., St Paul MN) will&#xD;
      be used to administer the programmed intermittent epidural bolus doses and patient-controlled&#xD;
      epidural analgesia (PCEA). The current IWK labour analgesia standard ensures each labour room&#xD;
      is equipped with a Smith Medical CADD pump, epidural infusion tubing and an epidural&#xD;
      procedure tray. No new or additional supplies or personnel will be required for the study.&#xD;
      Prior to study commencement, the research assistant will be trained by one of the&#xD;
      investigators (anesthesiologist) on how to complete a dermatome sensory evaluation and&#xD;
      Bromage score. In addition, the research assistant will receive training from the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist regarding how to instruct patients to use the PCEA device. For all groups&#xD;
      the PCEA will remain standardized. If after two confirmed PCEA doses that participant's pain&#xD;
      is not suitably controlled the anesthesiologist will be consulted to provide a manual bolus&#xD;
      (0.1% ropivacaine 10 mL). The patient and research personnel recording data will be blinded&#xD;
      to the group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected Demographic data and health history Medical record number, maternal age,&#xD;
      height, weight, BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Labour Information Gestational age, cervical dilation at initiation of CSE analgesia,&#xD;
      duration of labour (initiation of analgesia to delivery), maximum oxytocin infusion rate&#xD;
      during labour, mode of delivery, time from initiation of analgesia to delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesia Data Maintenance epidural solution volume administered from programmed intermittent&#xD;
      bolus pump, time of first administered PCEA bolus request, number of PCEA bolus requests and&#xD;
      delivered doses, PCEA ropivacaine dose, time to first request for manual bolus, number of&#xD;
      manual bolus doses, manual bolus ropivacaine dose, total ropivacaine dose, highest thoracic&#xD;
      dermatome sensory level to pin prick at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360&#xD;
      minutes, along with a modified Bromage score, hypotension, need for vasopressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satisfaction Scores Overall maternal satisfaction scores (NRS) will be sought within one day&#xD;
      of delivery. Patients will be asked &quot;On a scale from 0 to 100, how satisfied were you with&#xD;
      the pain control provided by the epidural during your labour?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection In keeping with CONSORT guidelines all participants enrolled will be included&#xD;
      in an intention to treat analysis. Descriptive statistics will be expressed as mean +/-&#xD;
      standard deviation. The Student's t-test will be used for comparison of the means of&#xD;
      continuous, normally distributed data. Two-way ANOVA or Friedman test will be used for&#xD;
      variable differences in groups, and Bonferroni or Tukey HSD test will be used for multiple&#xD;
      comparisons. Categorical data are to be analyzed using χ2 test or Fisher's exact test, as&#xD;
      appropriate. The investigators will perform the statistical analysis, with the assistance of&#xD;
      collaborating statistician. An interim analysis will not be conducted and α set at 0.05 for&#xD;
      significance. A sample size of 26 per group will have an 80 % power to detect a reduction in&#xD;
      the time to first administered PCEA request by 20 minutes at alpha=0.05. To account for any&#xD;
      dropouts, we will aim to recruit 35 patients per group.&#xD;
