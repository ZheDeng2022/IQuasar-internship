      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dilutional thrombocytopenia after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is universal and&#xD;
      administration of donor apheresis platelets just prior to termination of bypass will assist&#xD;
      in early correction of coagulopathy, early hemostasis and lesser donor exposure of blood&#xD;
      products after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the Problem? - Bleeding, Transfusion and Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Excessive bleeding after neonatal cardiac surgery has been independently associated with&#xD;
           increased adverse events, morbidity and mortality.1,2 Bleeding after neonatal open-heart&#xD;
           surgery has multiple etiologies such as immaturity of the building blocks of&#xD;
           coagulation, effects of deep hypothermia, longer CPB times, altered flow states and&#xD;
           dilutional state induced by being on CPB leading to low platelet count, low platelet&#xD;
           function, low fibrinogen levels, altered fibrinogen polymerization, complement&#xD;
           activation, etc.2,3 The strongest predictor of transfusion after cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
           in children was deemed to be the CPB circuit volume and the effect of hemodilution.4&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The dilutional coagulopathy after neonatal CPB requires intense damage control&#xD;
           resuscitation with massive transfusion of platelets, packed red blood cells (PRBC),&#xD;
           cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and supplemental factor concentrates. In a&#xD;
           previous study at this institution (IRB# HSC-MS-13-0647), we have shown that in neonates&#xD;
           undergoing open-heart surgery there was a significant drop in platelet counts after&#xD;
           bypass (71% change, baseline= 268 ± 90, Post CPB= 76 ± 27, 109/L). Associated with this&#xD;
           drop , the average intraoperative transfusion load in neonates undergoing cardiac&#xD;
           surgery with CPB at our institution constitutes of PRBC= 63± 43 ml/kg, FFP=51± 21 ml/kg,&#xD;
           cryoprecipitate =12+6 ml/kg, platelets = 28 +16 ml/kg and cell-saver =27± 10 ml/kg. In&#xD;
           addition 72% of these patients were exposed to a 3-factor prothrombin complex&#xD;
           concentrate (Bebulin®). Although this &quot;throw the kitchen sink&quot; approach is effective in&#xD;
           achieving hemostasis, it comes with significant effects on post CPB hemodynamics,&#xD;
           constantly changing hematocrit, variable blood volume with inability to achieve steady&#xD;
           state inotropic state affecting cardiac output, oxygen delivery and adding to pulmonary&#xD;
           hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, having higher platelet counts at the time of weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass has&#xD;
      distinct advantages of reducing transfusions and improving outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      What do we do at our institution? The vast majority of centers including ours continue to&#xD;
      utilize a regimen for neonatal CPB prime that constitutes of PRBCs ( 20-30 ml/kg) added to&#xD;
      achieve a hematocrit &gt; 25 on CPB and FFP (20-30 ml/kg) to assist the lower antithrombin&#xD;
      levels, improve heparin efficiency and improved suppression of the thrombin generation on&#xD;
      CPB. Platelets are not added in the CPB prime at our institution. This regimen of avoiding&#xD;
      donor apheresis platelets transfusion during early CPB is because of the known effects of CPB&#xD;
      on native platelets resulting in decreases in count from hemodilution and mechanical damage.&#xD;
      Donor apheresis platelets administered as an initial constituent of CPB prime also carry the&#xD;
      risk of platelet activation during hypothermia and CPB with potential activation of the&#xD;
      coagulation cascade. Fresh whole blood is also not used secondary to the difficulty and&#xD;
      logistics pertaining to availability fresh whole blood makes this approach unattractive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the advantage of adding platelet apheresis just prior to separation from CPB? We know&#xD;
      that native platelets are significantly reduced in count and function with increasing&#xD;
      duration of CPB and function diminishes independently of platelet count with hypothermia.11&#xD;
      The advantages of adding donor apheresis platelets just prior to separating from CPB are that&#xD;
      the donor platelets don't get spalliated and deformed by the roller pumps for long durations,&#xD;
      they are not subjected to the intense cooling and rewarming process and spared of the early&#xD;
      reperfusion injury/inflammation. Furthermore, addition of 10 ml/kg of platelets would raise&#xD;
      the platelet counts by at least 50% based on a previous study at this institution (IRB#&#xD;
      HSC-MS-13-0647; post-CPB platelet transfusion of 28 ± 16 ml/kg resulted in elevation of&#xD;
      platelet counts from 76 ± 27 to 223 ± 60 (109/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of modified ultrafiltration (MUF): MUF is routinely performed immediately on&#xD;
      termination of CPB and prior to protamine administration. During this stage, after successful&#xD;
      weaning from CPB, 10-15% of the cardiac output from the arterial cannula along with residual&#xD;
      volume from the venous reservoir of the CPB pump is pumped through a hemofilter placed under&#xD;
      vacuum to allow rapid hemofiltration with the effluent returned via a single atrial venous&#xD;
      cannula to the patient. This 15-minute rapid hemofiltration allows for removal of excess&#xD;
      water, improvement in hematocrit with improved oxygen delivery, faster achievement of steady&#xD;
      state inotrope levels with improved hemodynamics and removal of inflammatory mediators.12-14&#xD;
      While MUF improves hematocrit, it does not increase platelet count significantly, MUF has no&#xD;
      effect on native platelet function.3 The biggest advantage of transfusion of apheresis&#xD;
      platelets prior to termination of bypass versus standard practice of their transfusion after&#xD;
      protamine is that the transfused fluid load of 10-15 ml/kg of platelets volume that would&#xD;
      have diluted the red cell fraction (hematocrit) and impacted oxygen delivery and pulmonary&#xD;
      dysfunction would now take the full benefit of modified ultrafiltration with excess fluid&#xD;
      removal even prior to protamine administration with overall improved hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institutional Blood transfusion Management for Neonatal CPB For the CPB prime: PRBCs&#xD;
      (50ml/kg) are added to allow for a hematocrit &gt;30 for the estimated blood volumes. FFP is&#xD;
      added to the pump prime for all patients weighing less than 5 kilograms and in those who&#xD;
      demonstrate heparin resistance on initial heparin dose response assays. Heparin is added in&#xD;
      the CPB prime. Other constituents of the CPB prime are epsilon aminocaproic acid (50 mg/kg),&#xD;
      cefazolin (30 mg/kg) and methylprednisolone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post CPB: Current practice in neonates is to administer a combination of cryoprecipitate,&#xD;
      platelet and PRBC in a 1:1:1 ratio till hemostasis is achieved. 3PCC factor administration is&#xD;
      based on diffuse clinical bleeding suggestive of coagulopathy that persists despite one round&#xD;
      of cryoprecipitate and platelet transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective Randomized trial in neonates comparing platelet apheresis transfusion prior to&#xD;
      termination of CPB versus standard transfusion of platelet apheresis after modified&#xD;
      ultrafiltration and protamine administration. Primary outcomes and secondary outcomes are&#xD;
      detailed below.&#xD;
