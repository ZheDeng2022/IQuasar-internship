    <textblock>
      Pregnancy and vaginal delivery are considered as the main risk factors for damage to the&#xD;
      pelvic floor. There are various ways to measure the strength of the pelvic floor and to&#xD;
      evaluate functional problems. Manual mobilization of the pelvic floor is a well-known&#xD;
      treatment modality, however, ample knowledge exists on the efficacy of physiotherapy and&#xD;
      exercise for improvement of pelvic floor function and strength. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      analyze the influence of pelvic floor fascial mobilization (PFFM) technique on the function&#xD;
      and strength of the pelvic floor muscles as well as parameters presumed to be influenced by&#xD;
      the strength of the pelvic floor in pregnant women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pregnancy and vaginal delivery are considered as the main risk factors for damage to the&#xD;
      pelvic floor at various degrees, starting at mild stress incontinence and up to fool fecal&#xD;
      incontinence as well as pelvic pains or urination difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are various ways to measure the strength of the pelvic floor and to evaluate functional&#xD;
      problems. Measured the strength of the pelvic floor muscles by physical examination according&#xD;
      to Oxford Grading Scale (scale of 0-5) as well as by using Perineometer device, were equally&#xD;
      efficient and well correlated. Other modalities such as the use of surface electro myography&#xD;
      (EMG), that presents the level of the muscle electrical activity and expiration volumes and&#xD;
      the strength of the pelvic floor muscles were also positively correlated to the strength of&#xD;
      the pelvic floor. Recent studies presented dysfunction of pelvic floor during pregnancy as&#xD;
      well as in the postpartum period by the use of pelvic floor disability index 20 (PFDI20)&#xD;
      questionnaire validated in Hebrew.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ample knowledge exists on the efficacy of physiotherapy and exercise for improvement of&#xD;
      pelvic floor function and strength, however, prolonged and continuous exercise is needed to&#xD;
      achieve good results as well as compliance and perseverance. The long-term effect is&#xD;
      unwieldly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manual mobilization of the pelvic floor is a well-known treatment modality. However the&#xD;
      literature regarding the effect of this technique is sparse. A recent series of case reports&#xD;
      presented immediate and major improvement of pelvic floor dysfunction after manual&#xD;
      mobilization. The peripartum period is critical for the function of the pelvic floor however&#xD;
      the yield of manual therapy on function and strength of the pelvic floor was not evaluated in&#xD;
      pregnant women. We hypothesize that manual therapy can improve the strength and the function&#xD;
      of the pelvic floor within a short time span and this can be objectively measured by common&#xD;
      and well used parameters The aim of this study is to analyze the influence of pelvic floor&#xD;
      fascial mobilization (PFFM) on the function and strength of the pelvic floor muscles as well&#xD;
      as parameters presumed to be influenced by the strength of the pelvic floor in pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve number of phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase one: Screening and enrollment of patients Women followed at the high risk pregnancy&#xD;
      clinic at the Sheba medical center, who carry singleton pregnancy at the ages of 20-45 years&#xD;
      old and about to have their 2nd to 4th delivery (primiparous and multiparous women) will be&#xD;
      examined for the following parameters: demographic and medical data, focused interview for&#xD;
      symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction including urination and fecal function as well as pelvic&#xD;
      floor pain, manual assessment according the Oxford grading scale will be performed, and the&#xD;
      strength of the pelvic floor measured by the use of Perineometer (Peritron 'AV' Combined Anal&#xD;
      &amp; Vaginal Perineometer NEW MODEL). Other parameters that will be measured include:&#xD;
      mobilization of the pelvic-femoral joint, Forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV1) (a connection was&#xD;
      shown between FEV1, intraabdominal pressure and the strength of the pelvic floor, assessment&#xD;
      of vocal quality ( analyzed by communication clinician, repeat assessment will be performed&#xD;
      after two weeks and after 4 weeks, estimated assessment time - 20 Min) 80 women are expected&#xD;
      to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Two Women who will fulfill one or more of the following parameters will be enrolled to&#xD;
      the second phase of the study . (n=40)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Oxford grading scale ≤3/5&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pelvic floor strength assessed by perineometer≤ 30 cm/h20&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical symptoms of urine, flatus or fecal incontinence&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pelvic floor, hip joint or pelvic joints pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed to one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A-Control group (n=20) Group B-Study group (n=20) Guidance towards exercise for&#xD;
      strengthening of the pelvic floor will be provided for both groups. Study group will be&#xD;
      treated manually for the pelvic floor in two sessions two weeks apart. The manual&#xD;
      manipulation of the pelvic floor will involve intra vaginal superficial as well as pelvic&#xD;
      skin area pressure points. The manipulation will not involve the cervix uterus or rectum.&#xD;
      Each session will lasts one hour&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be assessed by ultrasound for blood flow in the middle cerebral artery,&#xD;
      umbilical artery and uterine artery as part of the parameters that may show benefit to the&#xD;
      fetus due to pelvic floor mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reassessment of all the women and repeat treatment for the study group will be performed&#xD;
      after two and four weeks from the primary assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed at a high risk pregnancy clinic at the Sheba medical center.&#xD;
      Women will be enrolled voluntarily with no financial benefit.&#xD;
