  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schnitzler's Syndrome (SchS) is a late-onset multifactorial autoinflammatory disease&#xD;
      characterized by chronic urticarial skin lesions and a monoclonal gammopathy usually&#xD;
      belonging to the immunoglobulin M (IgM) or IgG class. Symptoms associated with SchS are&#xD;
      recurrent fever attacks, bone and muscle pain, arthralgia or arthritis, fatigue and&#xD;
      lymphadenopathy. SchS is a rare disease with approximately 300 cases reported in the&#xD;
      literature. The nature of SchS is chronic without known reports about spontaneous remissions.&#xD;
      Disease onset occurs around the age of 50. About 15% of patients eventually develop a&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative disorder, most often Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. The pathogenesis of&#xD;
      SchS is still not well defined. Functional ex vivo studies showed excessive cytokine&#xD;
      production (IL-1ß, IL-6 and IL-18) of peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) in SchS as compared&#xD;
      to healthy controls. In addition to excessive IL-6 secretion from PBMCs IL-6 has repeatedly&#xD;
      been reported to be elevated in the serum of SchS patients too. As IL-6 plays a major role in&#xD;
      the development of multiple myeloma, IL-6 may also be associated with the formation of&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative disorders in SchS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, there is no approved standard therapy available for the treatment of SchS.&#xD;
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and other immunosuppressive&#xD;
      agents have been reported to provide variable relief from symptoms of bone pain and&#xD;
      arthralgia. Case reports and small studies about successful treatment of SchS with anti-IL-1&#xD;
      blockers (anakinra, rilonacept and canakinumab) accumulate. However, there have been complete&#xD;
      and partial treatment failures to anti-IL-1 blockade in SchS. In these patients, anti-IL-6&#xD;
      treatment (tocilizumab [TCZ]) demonstrated to be very effective in reducing the clinical&#xD;
      symptoms and inflammation markers in SchS. TCZ treatment has proved to be very effective,&#xD;
      well-tolerated and safe in other acquired autoinflammatory disorders, systemic juvenile&#xD;
      idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) and adult-onset Still's disease that share many clinical features&#xD;
      (rash, fever, joint involvement, lymphadenopathy, fatigue) and excessive cytokine production&#xD;
      with SchS. The study consists of a run-in baseline period of 1-4 weeks followed by an&#xD;
      open-label 20-week TCZ treatment phase with weekly s.c. injections (TCZ 162mg), followed by&#xD;
      an optional study extension up to a total of 1 year with ongoing once weekly TCZ 162mg&#xD;
      injections and a 4 week period of follow-up.&#xD;
