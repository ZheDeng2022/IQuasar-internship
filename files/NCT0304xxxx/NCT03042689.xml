  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug as a possible treatment for advanced myeloid&#xD;
      malignancies including AML (acute myeloid leukemia), MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome) and MPN&#xD;
      (myeloproliferative neoplasms)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Regorafenib (Stivarga)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for&#xD;
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Regorafenib for this&#xD;
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking for the best dose of Regorafenib to&#xD;
      treat the participant's disease with. Researchers will also look at how effective the study&#xD;
      drug is in treating the participant's disease and if any side effects occur.&#xD;
