  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2330811 is a humanized monoclonal antibody which is in development for systemic sclerosis&#xD;
      (SSc), a rare autoimmune disease with high morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are no&#xD;
      approved disease modifying therapies and it is an area of high unmet medical need. GSK2330811&#xD;
      has been shown to bind and neutralize Oncostatin M (OSM) that has been associated with&#xD;
      fibrosis, vasculopathy and inflammation in a number of diseases. This multi-center,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind (sponsor open), placebo controlled, proof of mechanism study will be&#xD;
      the first study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of repeat subcutaneous (SC) doses of GSK2330811 in male and female&#xD;
      participants with diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc). Participants with active disease and a&#xD;
      disease duration of &lt;= 60 months will be enrolled. Approximately 24 to 40 participants will&#xD;
      be randomized across two sequential cohorts. Cohort 1 will evaluate a repeat-dose predicted&#xD;
      to provide sub-maximal inhibition of OSM, leading to a dose escalation decision. Cohort 1 is&#xD;
      planned to consist of at least 4 participants, randomized such that 3 participants will&#xD;
      receive GSK2330811 100 milligram (mg) and 1 will receive placebo. Cohort 2 is planned to&#xD;
      consist of at least 20 participants, randomized such that participants will receive&#xD;
      GSK2330811 300 mg and placebo in a 3:1 ratio respectively. The duration of the study is up to&#xD;
      34 weeks including a screening period of up to 6 weeks, treatment period of 12 weeks and&#xD;
      follow-up period of 16 weeks.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to Day 197, but protocol allowed for additional events to be collected; up to Day 603 post first dose</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, other situations judged by physician. SAEs were collected up to Day 197, but the protocol also allowed investigators to report SAEs occurring after participants had completed the study. This outcome measure includes two SAEs reported after participants had completed the study, occurring on Day 306 and Day 603 following first dose. Safety Population consisted of all randomized participants who have taken at least 1 dose of study treatment.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Non-serious Adverse Events (Non-SAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, other situations judged by physician. SAEs were collected up to Day 197, but the protocol also allowed investigators to report SAEs occurring after participants had completed the study. This outcome measure includes two SAEs reported after participants had completed the study, occurring on Day 306 and Day 603 following first dose. Safety Population consisted of all randomized participants who have taken at least 1 dose of study treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hematology Parameter: Hematocrit</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the hematology parameter: hematocrit. Baseline was defined as the pre-dose Day 1 assessment, unless unavailable, in which case it was the latest pre-dose assessment. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the hematology parameters: MCV and MPV. Baseline was defined as the pre-dose Day 1 assessment, unless unavailable, in which case it was the latest pre-dose assessment. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the hematology parameter: Reticulocyte Production Index. Baseline was defined as the pre-dose Day 1 assessment, unless unavailable, in which case it was the latest pre-dose assessment. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-dose visit value. Reticulocyte Production Index (RPI) was calculated as 'Reticulocyte Production Index = Reticulocyte Count (percent [%]) multiply by (x) (hematocrit [%] divided by [/] 45) x 1/ reticulocyte maturation time'.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Reticulocyte Production Index</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the hematology parameter: Reticulocyte Production Index. Baseline was defined as the pre-dose Day 1 assessment, unless unavailable, in which case it was the latest pre-dose assessment. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-dose visit value. Reticulocyte Production Index (RPI) was calculated as 'Reticulocyte Production Index = Reticulocyte Count (percent [%]) multiply by (x) (hematocrit [%] divided by [/] 45) x 1/ reticulocyte maturation time'.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worst-Case Chemistry Results Relative to Potential Clinical Importance (PCI) Criteria Post-Baseline Relative to Baseline</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for analysis of clinical chemistry parameters. PCI ranges were low: &lt;30 grams per liter (g/L) (albumin), high: &gt;44.2 micromoles per liter (µmol/L) increase from Baseline (creatinine), low: &lt;3 or high: &gt;9 mmol/L (glucose), low: &lt;3 or high: &gt;5.5 mmol/L (potassium), and low: &lt;130 or high: &gt;150 mmol/L (sodium). Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (low, within range or no change, or high), unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose laboratory value category was unchanged (e.g. High to High), or whose value became within range, were recorded in the &quot;To within Range or No Change&quot; category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add up to 100%.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze chemistry parameters: ALP, ALT, AST and LDH. Baseline was defined as the pre-dose Day 1 assessment, unless unavailable, in which case it was the latest pre-dose assessment. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Chemistry Parameters: Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze chemistry parameters: total bilirubin and direct bilirubin. Baseline was defined as the pre-dose Day 1 assessment, unless unavailable, in which case it was the latest pre-dose assessment. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze chemistry parameter: estimated glomerular filtration rate. Baseline was defined as the pre-dose Day 1 assessment, unless unavailable, in which case it was the latest pre-dose assessment. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Emergent Worst Case Urinalysis Results by Dipstick</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected for the assessment of potential of hydrogen, specific gravity, glucose, ketones, occult blood and protein by dipstick method. The dipstick test gave results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters: potential of hydrogen, specific gravity, glucose, ketones, occult blood and protein were categorized as 'any increase from Baseline', which imply any increase in their concentrations in the urine sample. Only participants with emergent worst case any increase from Baseline values are presented.</description>

        <description>Serum samples were collected for the determination of anti-GSK2330811 antibodies (ADA) using a binding antibody detection assay. The assay involved screening, confirmation and titration steps. If serum samples tested positive in the screening assay, they were considered 'potentially positive' and were further analyzed for the specificity using the confirmation assay. Samples that were confirmed positive in the confirmation assay were reported as 'positive'.</description>
