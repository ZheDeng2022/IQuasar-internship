  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), as a percentage of calories consumed, of&#xD;
      triheptanoin (C7 oil; C7) in a pediatric and adult patient population genetically diagnosed&#xD;
      with glucose transporter type 1 deficiency disorder (G1D).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will use an open-label, standard 3+3 phase I design for determining the MTD of&#xD;
      orally-administered C7 in G1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triheptanoin: a triglyceride oil containing three odd-carbon chain-length fatty acids (i.e.,&#xD;
      a triglyceride of 7-carbon heptanoic acid). Triheptanoin will be taken 4 times per day&#xD;
      (approximately every 6 hours) by mouth. it is dosed 4 times per day, divided evenly, and the&#xD;
      total C7 daily dose will re-place 40% or 45% (depending on group) of the daily caloric intake&#xD;
      from fat in the usual diet, based on current protocol guidelines. The oil should be taken&#xD;
      approximately one hour before meals, and will be mixed with fat-free, sugar-free yogurt or&#xD;
      pudding for administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to thirty-six subjects will be enrolled in a 10-day maximum tolerable dose trial of C7.&#xD;
      Initiation of C7 dosing will be conducted in the Children's Medical Center Dallas ambulatory&#xD;
      Care Pavilion neurology Clinic. Subjects will be provided with C7 oil to take over the 7 days&#xD;
      of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will not be required to stop other medications. Subjects will be directed to&#xD;
      maintain their usual medications, including rescue seizure medications, as necessary for the&#xD;
      course of the study. Subjects may have any clinical medical records transferred back to their&#xD;
      referring physician at completion of the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of glucose transporter type I deficiency (G1D) confirmed by genotyping or&#xD;
             PET scan of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable on no dietary therapy other than Modified Atkins diet (i.e., on no dietary&#xD;
             therapy for 1 month, including, but not limited to, medium chain triglyceride&#xD;
             therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females 2 years 6 months to 35 years 11 months old, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             changes, in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
