    <textblock>
      This study is retrospective. It focuses on hazelnut allergic patients with a clinical history&#xD;
      and a positive specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) against hazelnut and its recombinants that&#xD;
      have followed a hazelnut oral tolerance induction at the allergy Unit of Saint Vincent&#xD;
      Hospital of Lille (France) since 2011.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of food allergy is in perpetual progression since several years. It has been&#xD;
      multiply by three in 10 to 15 years. Hazelnut allergy can lead to severe anaphylactic shock,&#xD;
      particularly in children. It is a long lasting condition with less than 10% of natural&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing the threshold reactive dose of hazelnut of the patients, i.e. the minimal dose of&#xD;
      hazelnut that trigger an allergic reaction, is of primary importance because it allows to&#xD;
      avoid severe anaphylactic reaction that can happen even with the consumption of low allergen&#xD;
      doses. Those reactions can occur even with an elimination diet. This increase also allows the&#xD;
      reintegration of the patients in the community, and has a beneficial impact on their quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increase of the threshold reactive dose is possible by the introduction of an oral&#xD;
      tolerance induction (OTI) protocol. It consists in a regular consumption of low controlled&#xD;
      doses of hazelnuts that are progressively increased. Thus a protocol is conducted at the&#xD;
      allergy Unit of Saint Vincent Hospital of Lille (France) in standard care since 2006, but&#xD;
      there are very few data published on tree nuts, especially in France. Most of the data are on&#xD;
      peanut, although the consumption of tree nuts is high in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this OTI protocol, an oral food challenge (OFC) is performed. This OFC allows the&#xD;
      determination of the threshold reactive dose, i.e. the minimum dose of allergen that induces&#xD;
      an allergic reaction. A safe dose of hazelnut that will be regularly eaten by the patient is&#xD;
      then determined. Every 6 months, a new OFC is performed and thus a new threshold reactive&#xD;
      dose is measured, and the dose to be eaten by the patient updated. The protocol is followed&#xD;
      until the patient reaches an ideal dose of 11766 mg of hazelnut proteins. Of course, the&#xD;
      protocol can also be ended if the patient decided so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to study the clinical efficiency of hazelnut OTI by&#xD;
      measuring the evolution of the patient threshold reactive dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to study the biological efficiency of hazelnut OTI by measuring&#xD;
      the evolution of the dosage of sIgE against hazelnut proteins and the evolution of the size&#xD;
      of the prick tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the OFC and the IgE dosage are a standard part of the OTI protocol, all the data are&#xD;
      obtained from the medical records. The study is retrospective and thus observational.&#xD;
