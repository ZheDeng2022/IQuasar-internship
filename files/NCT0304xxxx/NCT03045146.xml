      FRench Acute cerebral multimodal imaging to select patient for MEchanical thrombectomy is a&#xD;
      prospective multi-center study to determine if multimodal imaging could identify patients who&#xD;
      may and those who may not benefit from an endovascular clot removal procedure within 6 hours&#xD;
      after stroke onset.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Emergent cerebral artery recanalization by thrombectomy within 6 hours after symptom onset is&#xD;
      n the standard of care of an acute hemispheric infarction with a documented proximal internal&#xD;
      carotid artery and/middle cerebral artery occlusion. The success of vessel revascularization&#xD;
      is mostly related to the emergent reperfusion of the ischemic penumbra. Multimodal brain&#xD;
      imaging can identify the amount of salvageable penumbra. The indirect comparison of the&#xD;
      recently published randomized trials suggests that despite common baseline clinical&#xD;
      characteristics, (vessel site occlusion, delay and type of treatment), the success of&#xD;
      thrombectomy was higher in studies enrolling exclusively patients exhibiting a significant&#xD;
      amount of penumbra defined by a target mismatch (TMM) on CTP or MRI by comparison with those&#xD;
      enrolling patients based on non contrast CT scan without specific imaging criteria. As the&#xD;
      prevalence of TMM has not been systematically evaluated in those trials, as TMM definition&#xD;
      differs according to the studies and as there has been no prospective estimation of the&#xD;
      impact of the prevalence of TMM on baseline imaging assessed blindly of clinical outcome,&#xD;
      there is currently no demonstration that mechanical thrombectomy has to be limited to the&#xD;
      subgroup of patients based on imaging criteria. With this as a background, we aim to&#xD;
      investigate in a prospective cohort of patients treated by thrombectomy according to the&#xD;
      current recommendations, the relationship between the prevalence of TMM on pretreatment brain&#xD;
      imaging with the rate of clinical recovery after thrombectomy. MR DWI, perfusion and CTP maps&#xD;
      processed by RAPID software will not be as usual pushed back to the PACS but anonymized and&#xD;
      saved on a remote software leaving the investigator blinded at the time of treatment&#xD;
      decision. We hope to learn whether MR or CTP can help to define an imaging profile to select&#xD;
      the subgroup of patients that will benefit from thrombectomy.&#xD;
