  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, single-center, split body and split face, multiple&#xD;
      natural sunlight exposure evaluation of two marketed sunscreens under actual use conditions&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers. Eligible subjects will be randomized to two treatment randomization&#xD;
      groups: Left SPF (Sun Protection Factor) 100+/Right SPF 50+ or Left SPF 50+/Right SPF 100+.&#xD;
      Assessment of erythema and pigmentation will be performed at baseline and after all natural&#xD;
      sunlight exposure periods which will occur on at the same beach location over the course of 5&#xD;
      consecutive days. Subjects will be suspended from further natural light exposure periods&#xD;
      following the observation of sunburn at any exposed body site.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blinded, single-center, split body and split face, in use study under&#xD;
      multiple exposures to natural sunlight conditions in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be instructed to self-apply the test products to the designated exposure&#xD;
      body/face sites as they normally would for sunburn protection while at the beach. Exposure&#xD;
      sites will be limited through the duration of the study to the face, neck, arms including&#xD;
      shoulders and legs from the top of the knee down. Each of the two products will be applied&#xD;
      exclusively to the exposure sites on the designated side of the body for the duration of the&#xD;
      study. Product labeling will include a color coded indicator of application side and a&#xD;
      standard sunscreen drug facts label containing usage directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference in the level of sunburn (erythema) protection afforded and the level of UV&#xD;
      (Ultraviolet) induced pigmentation (melanogenesis) response mediated by the typical usage of&#xD;
      SPF 50+ and SPF 100+ sunscreens will be assessed by clinical evaluation. Erythema and&#xD;
      melanogenic response will also be evaluated at fixed body site locations by diffuse&#xD;
      reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and chromameter assessment. Subject product usage will be&#xD;
      tracked by recording tube weight before and after product use. Sunlight exposure behavior&#xD;
      will be tracked by subject activity diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solar ultraviolet radiation conditions will be recorded on a centralized stationary&#xD;
      radiometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erythema protection afforded by the two products will be based on the bilateral sunburn&#xD;
      comparison of matched exposure sites and the erythema score for each exposure area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success criteria will be demonstration of superior sunburn protection of SPF 100+ as compared&#xD;
      to SPF 50+ as indicated by less sunburn on the SPF 100+ side than the SPF 50+ side (based on&#xD;
      bilateral sunburn comparison).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mediation of the UV induced pigmentation response afforded by the two products will be based&#xD;
      on the bilateral pigmentation comparison of matched exposure sites and chromameter and DRS&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be evaluated at baseline and at the beginning of each day.&#xD;
