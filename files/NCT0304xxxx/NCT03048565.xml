      This is a pilot feasibility study testing a mindfulness based intervention with caregivers of&#xD;
      people with chronic illnesses&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the project is to pilot test the delivery of an online Mindfulness Based&#xD;
      Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme to informal caregivers of people with chronic illnesses in&#xD;
      one region in Ireland so as to determine the feasibility of delivering the intervention to&#xD;
      caregivers in Ireland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-group randomised pilot-feasibility trial comparing the online MBSR programme&#xD;
      (intervention) with no programme (control). The MBSR programme is delivered online over 8&#xD;
      weeks. Weekly email and telephone contact will be maintained with participants in the&#xD;
      intervention group for the duration of the delivery of the intervention. Participants are&#xD;
      encouraged to practice mindfulness exercises and homework between sessions. The online&#xD;
      programme was developed by a trained mindfulness teacher and a mindfulness teacher will&#xD;
      conduct the weekly email and telephone call to participants in the intervention group. The&#xD;
      study sample are caregivers in the Dublin region who are members of Family Carers' Ireland. A&#xD;
      total of 80 caregivers will be recruited to the study, 40 per group, based on 1:1&#xD;
      randomisation using a computer-randomised number generator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (pre-intervention) and post intervention participant outcome data (stress,&#xD;
      mindfulness and QoL) will be collected using self-reported validated scales administered to&#xD;
      participants by post, with stamped-addressed envelopes provided for return. Other pilot&#xD;
      measures (i.e. study processes) will be monitored and assessed by the research team to&#xD;
      determine potential refinement needs. Feasibility outcome data will be collected by the&#xD;
      research team (including time to recruit, attendance at classes, willingness of participants&#xD;
      to be randomised) and by the participants (expenses diary) during the study period, using&#xD;
      predesigned data collection forms. Mean differences with 95% confidence intervals will be&#xD;
      calculated to determine any significant differences between the groups on the outcomes of&#xD;
      stress, mindfulness and QoL.&#xD;
