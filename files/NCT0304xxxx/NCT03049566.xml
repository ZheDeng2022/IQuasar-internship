      This study aims to assess independent factors associated with the clinical decision to&#xD;
      discontinue ASA preoperatively in patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is widely used for primary and secondary prevention of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases. A prothrombotic rebound phenomenon after aspirin cessation has been&#xD;
      reported. ASA withdrawal is associated with an increased incidence of adverse cardiac events.&#xD;
      In individuals with previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), cessation of ASA may&#xD;
      cause stent thrombosis or myocardial infarction. However, many patients undergo non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgery within the first two years after PCI. Perioperatively, two counteracting risks have&#xD;
      to be taken into account, first, the risk of thromboembolic complications, if ASA medication&#xD;
      is discontinued and second, the risk of surgical bleeding, if ASA therapy is continued.&#xD;
      However, factors contributing to preoperative decision-making for ASA-withdrawal are still&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess independent factors associated with the clinical decision to&#xD;
      discontinue ASA preoperatively in patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery. In&#xD;
      particular this study aims to determine if the presence of coronary stents is independently&#xD;
      associated with ASA discontinuation. Furthermore this study assesses, if&#xD;
      benefit-risk-estimates (numerical rating scales) of the patients and the supervising&#xD;
      physicians are associated with the decision to withdraw ASA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on long-term ASA undergoing non-cardiac surgery as well as their supervising&#xD;
      anesthesiologist participate in a preoperative survey. Detailed information about ASA&#xD;
      medication, perioperative ASA use, comorbidities, factors that might be associated with the&#xD;
      decision to discontinue ASA preoperatively and benefit-risk-estimates (numerical rating&#xD;
      scales) are sampled by questionnaires.&#xD;
