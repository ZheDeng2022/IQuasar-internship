      Brief summary :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is an optic neuropathy due to acute&#xD;
      or subacute ischemic event of anterior optic nerve axons retrolaminar part that was&#xD;
      vascularized by posterior ciliary brevis artery. The incidence of ischemia will be followed&#xD;
      by axonal edema and causing compartment syndrome and heighten the incidence of ischemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In NAION, the main pathology occurs at the level of the optical nerve, the axons of retinal&#xD;
      ganglion cells. Initial damage is on the optic disc ischemia resulting hypoxic injury of&#xD;
      axons and manifest as disc edema. Axonal edema cause disturbances of retrograde axonal&#xD;
      transport of neurotrophic factors, especially brain derived neurotrophic factor, to the&#xD;
      retinal ganglion cells. This will trigger a secondary toxicity and apoptosis. In addition,&#xD;
      the presence of oxidative stress, calcium influx and mitochondrial damage will also triggers&#xD;
      apoptosis. After the apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells, there was a thinning of the retinal&#xD;
      nerve fiber layer (RNFL) through Wallerian degeneration. Thinning of the RNFL will manifest&#xD;
      as visual field defects and the decline in visual acuity in patients with chronic phase&#xD;
      NAION.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though NAION include disease entity that has long existed, but until now, there has been no&#xD;
      evidence-based study on medical or surgical procedures that is effective enough to overcome&#xD;
      NAION. The main treatment is to manage the risk factor such as hypertension, dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, hypercoagulable state. In general, if the patient is in the acute phase&#xD;
      (edema of optic nerve head), methylprednisolone administration may be considered, but if the&#xD;
      patient is already on chronic phase (atrophy disc) which generally occurs 6-11 weeks after&#xD;
      the onset, then steroids are no longer indicated. Neuroprotective agent was considered as&#xD;
      treatment in NAION given primary pathology NAION is the retinal ganglion cell axons. Among&#xD;
      the various neuroprotective substance, Citidine diphosphocoline (CDP-choline&#xD;
      5'-diphosphocholine or Citicoline) is a therapeutic option NAION.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Citicoline is an endogenous mononucleotide consisting of ribose, cytosine, pyrophosphate, and&#xD;
      choline. Citicoline is a component intermediates in the synthesis of phospholipids in cell&#xD;
      membranes, ie phosphatidylcholine. Exogenous citicoline administered orally or intravenously,&#xD;
      will be split into citidine and choline. Citicoline via oral administration can be absorbed&#xD;
      completely and have a similar bioavailability in the blood compared to parenteral&#xD;
      administration such as intravenous. Once absorbed, citicoline will be distributed throughout&#xD;
      the body and enter the blood-brain barrier and the blood retinal barrier penetrate into the&#xD;
      central nervous system. If there is damage to neurons, exogenous citicoline will participate&#xD;
      in the synthesis of phospholipids in the neuronal cell membrane. Some studies show that&#xD;
      citicoline may have a neuroprotective effect on retinal ganglion cells and supporting&#xD;
      regeneration of damaged neurons in vitro. Previous research on the citicoline effect in&#xD;
      chronic phase NAION give satisfactory results. Dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems known to&#xD;
      occur in vast numbers in the retina and post-retinal visual pathway. Retinal ganglion cells&#xD;
      using certain subtypes of dopamine as a means of communication with the visual cortex. Rejdak&#xD;
      et al in animal models showed that citicoline administration could improve and strengthen the&#xD;
      dopamine transmission in the retina. Citicoline also a safe medicine, without serious adverse&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroretinogram (ERG) is a tool to measure the function of the retina. ERG examination can&#xD;
      measure electrical changes in the retina after light stimulus. ERG examination that can&#xD;
      detect changes in the activity of retinal ganglion cell is a pattern ERG. Spectral-domain&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography is a tool that can measure the thickness of retinal ganglion&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thinning of the RNFL will manifest as visual field defects in patients with NAION. The&#xD;
      typical visual field defects of NAION is altitudinal defects associated with segmental edema&#xD;
      optic nerve head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these descriptions question arises whether the citicoline supplementation can repair&#xD;
      damage to the neurons of the retina, especially the retinal ganglion cells, in NAION&#xD;
      resulting in improved retinal function which can be judged from the improvement of the value&#xD;
      of the amplitude of the wave of P50 and N95 in the examination pattern ERG (PERG) when&#xD;
      compared with placebo ? In addition whether citicoline supplementation can increase the&#xD;
      thickness of retinal ganglion cells assessed using SD-OCT? Does citicoline supplementation&#xD;
      give the effect of improving visual field defects in patients with NAION?&#xD;

      Research Ethics Once the proposal is approved by research supervisor and research coordinator&#xD;
      and Head of the Department of Ophthalmology Faculty of medicine Universitas Indonesia-RSCM&#xD;
      Kirana, then the proposal will be submitted to the Health Research Ethics Committee of the&#xD;
      Faculty of medicine Universitas Indonesia-RSCM for review. The study will begin after the&#xD;
      study passed the test of ethics and obtained a number of research protocols to meet the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki and will be registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Data from the study will be recorded and incorporated into the primary table,&#xD;
      then be processed with SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Science) version 17.0. The&#xD;
      analysis is intention to treat. If there is a violation of protocols such as the incidence of&#xD;
      severe side-effects that provide interventions should be stopped or are lost to follow-up at&#xD;
      least once a second measurement is done (after 30 days), the subject will be considered a&#xD;
      failure but still included in the analysis. Patients were also said to drop out when during&#xD;
      the administration of the intervention patients had symptoms of NAION in the contralateral&#xD;
      eye and require steroid therapy but still included in the analysis had been carried out when&#xD;
      at least a second measurement is done (after 30 days). Data will be presented in the form of&#xD;
      tables and graphs. Data will be tested whether the distribution is spread evenly with&#xD;
      normality test. Data were analyzed to compare the two averages in pairs using unpaired t-test&#xD;
      or Mann Whitney test. Categorical data are presented in the form of proportions. Statistical&#xD;
      test for difference in proportions between the two independent groups using chi-square test.&#xD;
      Statistical tests to determine the correlation using Pearson or Spearman test.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The allocation of the subject is done by using block randomization. Randomization will be performed by a third party before the study began. Number randomization results will be incorporated into the white envelope sealed and classified into group A (got citcoline) or group B (placebo) in accordance with the results of randomization. Neither the participant, investigator nor the outcome assessor know whether the patient is classified into group A or B.</masking_description>

False positive ≤ 15%&#xD;
False negative ≤ 20-30%&#xD;
The parameters assessed are:&#xD;
The mean deviation (MD): the result of the average sensitivity of the retina of patients compared with the normal population. This figure is obtained from the total deviation.&#xD;
Pattern standard deviation (PSD): the result of the average sensitivity of the retina of patients who have adapted and showed a localized area index. This figure is obtained from the pattern deviation.</description>
