      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that by provision of care at household level in a community through&#xD;
      lady health workers will as effective (recovery rate, burden of SAM, cost effective,&#xD;
      coverage) as through health care providers at facility level. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effectiveness (rate of recovery, burden &amp; coverage), of SAM standard&#xD;
           management of children 06-59 months delivered at household level by first level health&#xD;
           care providers (Lady health workers) compared with the standard CMAM program delivered&#xD;
           at health facility by Govt./ACF staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the cost effectiveness of treatment of SAM provided by LHWs at community&#xD;
           level versus treatment delivered at health facility by Govt/ACF staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cluster randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE &amp; RANDOMIZATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators took 6% prevalence to calculate the sample size with an expected reduction of&#xD;
      20%. A sample size of 3 clusters per group with 150 individuals per cluster is needed. STUDY&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY Intervention (Group A): LHWs will identify and treat all cases of severe acute&#xD;
      malnutrition (SAM) as per the study eligibility criteria (MUAC &lt; 11.5 cm) and manage all&#xD;
      cases of SAM without complications at home following the national CMAM guidelines. Control&#xD;
      (Group B): LHWs will identify SAM as per the CMAM guidelines (MUAC &lt; 11.5 cm) and will refer&#xD;
      all cases to the health facility (ACF) for further management and counselling by health&#xD;
      workers at facility.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION &amp; RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is good evidence of the success of CMAM programs for treating SAM in emergencies and&#xD;
      humanitarian crises [1], but little regarding the most cost effective mechanisms to deliver&#xD;
      it or of the added value of integrating treatment of acute malnutrition with treatment of&#xD;
      common childhood illness and/or extensive communitybased nutritional program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provision of SAM treatment at household level in a community through lady health workers will&#xD;
      be as effective (recovery rate, survival, cost effectiveness, coverage) as treatment provided&#xD;
      at facility level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will SAM treatment delivered through LHW at household level be as effective as SAM treatment&#xD;
      delivered at facility level by health center staff?&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effectiveness (rate of recovery, relapse &amp; coverage), of SAM treatment of&#xD;
      children 6-59 months delivered at household level by first level health care providers (Lady&#xD;
      health workers) compared with the standard CMAM program delivered at health facility by&#xD;
      Government and ACF staff. To evaluate the cost effectiveness of treatment of SAM provided by&#xD;
      LHWs at community level versus treatment delivered at health facility by Government and ACF&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the characterization of the breast feeding and complementary feeding practices in&#xD;
      both study arms. To identify the main socio-economic characteristics of the households in&#xD;
      both study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a 2-armed cluster randomized controlled trial targeting children 60-59&#xD;
      months and their mothers for the treatment and prevention of acute severe malnutrition in&#xD;
      children. Each cluster will be allocated to intervention group A, or control group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost effectiveness will be calculated to reflect the full range of resources required by&#xD;
      service providers and households. A societal perspective will be taken with data collected on&#xD;
      household costs incurred for participation in community and facility based activities. The&#xD;
      approach will capture all resources used regardless of who incurs them, as used for cost&#xD;
      analysis of other similar programs. Costs will be calculated with a combination of accounting&#xD;
      records and estimates derived with an &quot;ingredients&quot; approach, using unit costs and quantities&#xD;
      of inputs. Institutional costs will be estimated via accounting records. Costs which are&#xD;
      known to be incurred by the program but which are not reflected in the accounting records&#xD;
      (e.g. staff whose salaries are on different budgets, storage space which was not planned for&#xD;
      in the original budget, etc.) will be estimated after identifying these costs through&#xD;
      discussion with staff and document review. This data will be supplemented with costs&#xD;
      calculated via an ingredients approach. Key informant interviews will be held with all key&#xD;
      implementing staff to estimate their time allocation to project activities, in order to&#xD;
      perform an activity based cost analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coverage assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coverage Assessments will be implemented in the two areas at the start the study, at six&#xD;
      months of the study beginning and at the end of the study. SQUEAC methodology will be used.&#xD;
      Coverage assessments are of particular interest in order to access the population that is not&#xD;
      accessing treatment and understand its barriers to access. These assessments will be carried&#xD;
      out by trained ACF staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN STUDY OUTCOMES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key indicators to be captured are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Effectiveness - recovery rate (proportion of cured children among SAM enrolled),&#xD;
           supplement compliance rate, defaulter rate, relapse rate, Length of stay, average weight&#xD;
           gain, hospital admission, and complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Coverage rates and barriers to access (estimated using the SQUEAC methodology)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Health &amp; Nutrition status of children (prevalence of malnutrition etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cost-effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Descriptive analysis to assess the distribution of various factors within and between&#xD;
           groups, cluster-adjusted analyses will compare SAM rates (recovery, survival, relapse,&#xD;
           default) observed in the different arms. Kaplan Meier statistics will be used for the&#xD;
           comparison of post-treatment survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE &amp; RANDOMIZATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have calculated the sample size on the basis of SAM as the primary indicator;&#xD;
      Investigators took 6% prevalence to calculate the sample size with an expected reduction of&#xD;
      20%. A sample size of 3 clusters per group with 150 individuals per cluster achieves 98%&#xD;
      power to detect a difference of 0.200 between the group means when the standard deviation is&#xD;
      0.500 and the intracluster correlation is 0.00100 using a Two-Sided T-test with a&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of cluster:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A union council has been defined as the CLUSTER for the trial, a union council is the&#xD;
      smallest administrative unit in the district which usually have a population of about 25000&#xD;
      to 30000, and this population has about 2500-3000 under five children, if Investigators&#xD;
      consider the national rates of SAM in Pakistan which is about 6% Investigators will find more&#xD;
      than 150 cases of SAM from each union council during the study period which will be enough&#xD;
      sample to achieve the objectives of the trial. One union council has usually one health&#xD;
      facility Basic health Unit (BHU) or Rural Health Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SITE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in Dadu district, a rural district of Sindh province of&#xD;
      Pakistan. This district has been selected due to the high global acute malnutrition (GAM)&#xD;
      rates, being affected by emergencies. Currently in Sindh, SAM treatment is delivered at&#xD;
      health facility level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BENEFICIARIES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main target beneficiaries would be children 6- 59 months of age fulfilling the case&#xD;
      definition of severe malnutrition and their mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DELIVERY OF INTERVENTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Arm (A): Lady Health Workers operating at field level in study arm A will be&#xD;
      trained at the start of the study. The same training package will be delivered to all LHWs&#xD;
      involved in the study regardless of their previous training and the trainings will be&#xD;
      delivered by the Department of Health (once officially agreed), by ACF &amp; AKU. All eligible&#xD;
      children in the LHW´s catchment area will be identified and registered by the LHWs as part of&#xD;
      their routine activities. In Pakistan national guidelines, SAM treatment admission criteria&#xD;
      is MUAC &lt;11.5 cm. Children 6- 59 months, with MUAC less than 11.5 cm and meeting eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be enrolled after obtaining consent and provide treatment of SAM at home and&#xD;
      IYCF counseling and follow up till recovery. Children 60-59 months in the criteria for&#xD;
      stabilization care will also be referred by the LHW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LHW will visit fortnightly to follow up all recruited children with SAM and receiving&#xD;
      RUTF in their catchment population. If the child gets severely ill or having any complication&#xD;
      the LHW will immediately refer that child to the nearest health facility for hospital based&#xD;
      care. The LHW will record MUAC measurements on fortnightly follow up visits and weight and&#xD;
      height will be recorded by the data collectors. Control Arm (B): Lady Health Workers&#xD;
      operating at field level in study arm B will perform monthly home visit and will recruit and&#xD;
      register all eligible children in their catchment area as part of their routine activities.&#xD;
      The LHW will identify cases of SAM as per national CMAM guidelines through MUAC measurements&#xD;
      and refer them to the nearest health facility where ACF staff will provide treatment in the&#xD;
      facility as per standard CMAM guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected by an independent team, and not by LHWs. Data collection team will&#xD;
      consist of 2 data collectors and a team leader. Data collectors and team leaders will be&#xD;
      hired and trained to collect data by the study team.The team will visit identified households&#xD;
      and the data will cross validate the LHW activities. The study team will collect information&#xD;
      regarding children with SAM at baseline survey and during the study from LHWs and health&#xD;
      facilities staff. A trained community health worker will visit the household having child&#xD;
      with SAM and will take informed consent and recruit the child in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Cross Sectional Survey :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross sectional survey will be conducted at household level in both arms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fortnightly follow-up visits :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fortnightly follow up of children will be carried out by the community health worker until&#xD;
      the recovery of child this may takes up to 3-6 months during the first 3 months of the study&#xD;
      , the purpose of this follow up is to collect the information regarding, acceptability,&#xD;
      compliance, concurrent morbidities if any and record anthropometry (only weight &amp; MUAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monthly follow-up visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monthly follow ups will be done by data collectors to capture the information on recovery,&#xD;
      feeding practices, child's nutritional status morbidities &amp; mortality. These follow ups will&#xD;
      be continued for 6 months from the time of recruitment. Complete anthropometry (MUAC, Height&#xD;
      and Weight) will be carried out during monthly follow ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Household cost survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Towards the end of the intervention, a household survey will be implemented on a random&#xD;
      sample of program beneficiaries in both study areas to collect information on the direct and&#xD;
      indirect costs they incurred in participating in the program. This will include information&#xD;
      on cost of transportation, foods and medicines purchased, and time spent in accessing care.&#xD;
