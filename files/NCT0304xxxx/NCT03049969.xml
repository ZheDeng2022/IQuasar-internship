  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will test the feasibility and tolerability of transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) added to a cognitive remediation program in n=100 adults. For 60 cognitive&#xD;
      remediation sessions, participants will receive 20 minutes of active tDCS stimulation (up to&#xD;
      4.0 mA, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or montage dependent on specific area of deficit)&#xD;
      while they complete the cognitive training tasks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a novel, safe, well-tolerated, and low-cost&#xD;
      treatment approach that may enhance the benefits of cognitive remediation. The application of&#xD;
      tDCS is a relatively recent therapeutic development that utilizes low amplitude direct&#xD;
      currents to induce changes in cortical excitability. To meet this study's objectives,&#xD;
      investigators will focus specifically on working memory (WM) in both training and outcome.&#xD;
      Limiting training to WM exercises will provide the opportunity to test proof of concept for&#xD;
      the combined therapies within this shorter two-week time frame, and maximize the synergistic&#xD;
      effect by engaging the same regions as targeted by the tDCS.&#xD;
