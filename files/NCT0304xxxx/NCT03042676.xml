  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is capable of definitive cure of&#xD;
      acute leukemias. The most important post-transplant complication is graft vs host disease&#xD;
      (GVHD) which can be substantially decreased by the addition of anti-T lymphocyte globulin&#xD;
      (ATG-Grafalon) to the standard GVHD prophylaxis (cyclosporin and methotrexate) without any&#xD;
      increase in relapses and infections (Kroger et al NEJM 2016, ClinicalTrials.gov number,&#xD;
      NCT00678275). In the ATG_familystudy (prospective, randomised, multicenter study) a decrease&#xD;
      in the incidence of chronic GVHD (from 67.8% to 32.2%) was observed after the addition of ATG&#xD;
      (10 mg/kg for three days ,from day -3 to -1) to the standard GVHD prophylaxis in the setting&#xD;
      of acute leukemias in any remission, receiving peripheral blood stem cells from an HLA&#xD;
      identical sibling donor after myeloablative preparative regimen. In particular, the GVHD&#xD;
      extensive form was reduced from 52.4% to 7.6%. The study has been closed in 2014 with a&#xD;
      minimum follow up of 2 years from transplant. The investigators would like to evaluate the&#xD;
      longer term follow up of this study.&#xD;

      In the ATG_familystudy (prospective, randomised, multicenter study) a decrease in the&#xD;
      incidence of chronic GVHD (from 67.8% to 32.2%) was observed after the addition of ATG (10&#xD;
      mg/kg for three days from day -3 to -1) to the standard GVHD prophylaxis in the setting of&#xD;
      acute leukemias in any remission, receiving peripheral blood stem cells from an HLA identical&#xD;
      sibling donor after myeloablative preparative regimen. In particular, the GVHD extensive form&#xD;
      was reduced from 52.4% to 7.6%. The study has been closed in 2014 with a minimum follow up of&#xD;
      2 years from transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the creation of a multicenter electronic database with data of the&#xD;
      patients previously enrolled in the ATG_family study, NCT00678275; the data collection will&#xD;
      last ten years. Schedule of the follow-up will have be until death and will be stopped any&#xD;
      time if patient will retire the consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database will allow to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long term mortality of enrolled patients, with and without GVHD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long term relapse after allogeneic HSCT in acute leukemia patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prognostic factors in the overall population and according to the randomization arm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recovery of working activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicenter, observational, prospective cohorting study (electronic database) with a&#xD;
      retrospective phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      the electronic database will include patients enrolled in the ATG_familystudy and routinely&#xD;
      followed up at the Hematological Institutions participating to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      data collection will review all patients enrolled in the ATG familystudy (medical chart&#xD;
      review) and already dead or lost at follow up after the end of the ATG_familystudy by medical&#xD;
      chart review (Feb 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electronic database will include all patients enrolled in the ATG_familystudy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients included in the ATG_familystudy (NCT00678275)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  informed consent given&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: none&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: no treatment is envisaged; patients are followed up according to standard clinical&#xD;
      practice and international guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit and evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective phase: patients will be followed with visits (mainly as outpatients), laboratory&#xD;
      and instrumental tests, phone contacts as provided for the clinic route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective phase: medical chart review&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent: patients will be asked to sign the written consent during a visit as an&#xD;
      outpatient or inpatient, if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality of collected information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      the principal investigator is the responsible of data treatment. Collected data will be&#xD;
      analyzed by statistical methods in anonymous way in order to obtain the information&#xD;
      representing the aim of the study. The electronic database will be accessible only by&#xD;
      authorized persons. The principal investigator and the coworkers will have the access to&#xD;
      data: everyone will be obliged to data confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic database&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The electronic database will include all patients enrolled in the ATG_familystudy. The&#xD;
           data collection about hospital admittance and medical evaluations performed as&#xD;
           outpatient will be done by medical records/charts analysis. In this way, biographical&#xD;
           data, anamnestic data and any information about signs and symptoms at the onset of&#xD;
           disease, diagnostic roadmap and treatment will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients unreachable by phone details given by the patients or for patients already&#xD;
           dead, data will be taken by the analysis of the medical charts or by the Office of vital&#xD;
           statistics, after EC approval. Patients lost at follow up are patients unreachable in&#xD;
           anyway by the details given by the patient him/herself.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the electronic database data on patients enrolled in the ATGfamilystudy will be&#xD;
           included from the date of EC approval. For dead and lost at follow up patients data will&#xD;
           be recorded retrospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use cumulative incidence analysis to assess chronic GVHD-free survival&#xD;
      and relapse-free survival and labeled death before the event of interest as a competing risk.&#xD;
      Death from relapse will be used as a competing risk for the cumulative incidence analysis of&#xD;
      death without relapse. Overall survival will be assessed with the use of Kaplan- Meier&#xD;
      analysis. Further treatment- group comparisons were performed with the use of chi-square&#xD;
      tests for nominal data, Mann-Whitney U-tests for ordinal data, and analyses of variance for&#xD;
      interval or ratio-scale data. Exploratory, post hoc, Cox multiple regression analysis was&#xD;
      used for subgroup analyses and for the purpose of determining the effect on the incidence of&#xD;
      chronic GVHD and on overall survival of recipient age, first versus second remission, acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic versus acute myeloid leukemia, cytogenetic risk, risk of underlying disease,&#xD;
      difference between the sex of the donor and the sex of the recipient, cytomegalovirus&#xD;
      positivity in the recipient, type of conditioning, CD34+ cells transplanted, grade of acute&#xD;
      GVHD and chronic GVHD (time dependent [i.e., the corresponding event can occur at different&#xD;
      points in time after transplantation]) in addition to treatment assignment (ATG vs. non-ATG)&#xD;
      in the original ATG_familystudy. Confidence intervals for the differences in risk according&#xD;
      to treatment group will be determined with the use of Wilson's method. Cumulative incidence&#xD;
      analyses will be performed with the use of NCSS statistical software, version 9, and R&#xD;
      statistical software, version 2.10.1 (cmprsk package). IBM SPSS Statistics software, version&#xD;
      22.0, will be used for all other analysis.&#xD;
