    <textblock>
      When infection strikes, the body's immune system reacts by producing chemicals in the&#xD;
      bloodstream and changes in white blood cells to attack the infecting organism (bacteria,&#xD;
      viruses or other organisms) and prevent it spreading. This is termed the 'inflammatory&#xD;
      response'. Though beneficial in fighting infection, this response can sometimes be excessive,&#xD;
      causing harmful effects on body organs. This is termed the 'systemic inflammatory response&#xD;
      syndrome' and when linked to infection is termed 'sepsis'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has shown that in patients who have sepsis, the small blood vessels&#xD;
      supplying oxygen and nutrients to muscles and other organs (the microcirculation) become&#xD;
      abnormal and do not function as they would in health. However, it is difficult to assess the&#xD;
      function of microcirculation in clinical practice, and we want to find new, easier ways of&#xD;
      doing so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test a new method for assessing the function of these small blood&#xD;
      vessels, by directly visualising them using a highly sensitive microscope, the size of a pen,&#xD;
      placed under the tongue. By understanding the flow of blood in these vessels in healthy&#xD;
      individuals, we will gain a better understanding of how these vessels are affected in&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis is a highly heterogeneous disease state brought about by a dysregulated host response&#xD;
      to systemic infection, with uncontrolled pro- and anti-inflammatory processes leading to&#xD;
      collateral tissue injury and immune suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis poses a significant health burden worldwide, with deaths attributed in the UK&#xD;
      estimated at approximately 44,000 per annum. Prompt treatment directed by internationally&#xD;
      agreed management guidelines improves outcomes in sepsis. However early diagnosis of sepsis&#xD;
      remains difficult, with current diagnostic criteria relying on the presence of organ&#xD;
      dysfunction and derangement of macro haemodynamic variables. At the point of diagnosis,&#xD;
      mortality is in excess of 10%. At present there are no specific criteria in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      sepsis based on the underlying pathophysiological abnormalities, specifically on assessment&#xD;
      of the microcirculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microcirculation in sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microcirculation consists of a dense network of arterioles, capillaries and venules,&#xD;
      whose diameter is less than 150 um. Its functions are to supply nutrients and oxygen for&#xD;
      aerobic metabolism and to reduce cellular waste products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis affects all elements of the microcirculation, with microcirculatory dysfunction&#xD;
      playing an important role in the pathophysiology of severe sepsis and septic shock. Sepsis is&#xD;
      associated with decreased capillary density and increased perfusion heterogeneity leading to&#xD;
      decreased oxygen delivery, tissue hypoxia and subsequently organ dysfunction. Changes in&#xD;
      microcirculatory function may precede the traditional diagnostic features of sepsis,&#xD;
      providing earlier information on patients who will go on to develop severe sepsis and&#xD;
      multi-organ failure. Recognition of sepsis at this early stage would allow prompt treatment,&#xD;
      aimed at restoring homeostasis of the microcirculation, therefore altering disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have demonstrated that improvements in microcirculatory function&#xD;
      following early resuscitation are associated with decreasing organ dysfunction, and those&#xD;
      patients whose microcirculations fails to improve following resuscitation have poorer&#xD;
      outcomes. Despite recognition of the importance of the microcirculation in sepsis, current&#xD;
      goal-directed end points rely on the monitoring and restoration of global measures of&#xD;
      cardiovascular/organ function (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, urine output, lactate),&#xD;
      partly because the microcirculation is difficult to monitor in clinical practice. However,&#xD;
      improvement in macro haemodynamic variables does not guarantee restoration of&#xD;
      microcirculatory homeostasis. Clinical assessment of microcirculatory function is presently&#xD;
      inferred from the measurement of by-products generated due to impaired oxygenation/metabolism&#xD;
      such as lactate and carbon dioxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video microscopic techniques for assessment of the microcirculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video microscopic techniques provide in-vivo visualisation of the microcirculation, allowing&#xD;
      direct measurement of capillary density, perfusion and flow dynamics. Until recently, these&#xD;
      techniques which have included Orthogonal Polarization Spectral (OPS) imaging and Sidestream&#xD;
      Dark Field (SDF) imaging, have been clinically inaccessible owing to their bulky nature,&#xD;
      operator dependant output and time-consuming offline analysis requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third-generation handheld microscope has recently been developed (CytoCam-IDF, Braedius&#xD;
      Medical, NL), utilising Incident Dark Field (IDF) illumination. The device incorporates&#xD;
      real-time automated digital image analysis, combined with high resolution lenses and a&#xD;
      computer controlled image sensor for improved resolution. The CytoCam also features a novel&#xD;
      quantitative focusing mechanism with an integrated distance measuring system, whereby once&#xD;
      the focus depth has been established for a specific patient, serial measurements can be made&#xD;
      without having to manually readjust the focus, improving speed and ease of measurements. This&#xD;
      new device performs well when compared to previous devices, providing improved contrast and&#xD;
      image sharpness allowing an increased number of microvessels to be visualised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crucially, the CytoCam is equipped with bespoke software allowing images to be stored and&#xD;
      analysed automatically at the point of acquisition. Microcirculatory monitoring is a not a&#xD;
      new technique, but the combination of user friendly ergonomics, accurate image acquisition&#xD;
      and automated analysis opens up this potentially useful direct measurement of&#xD;
      microcirculatory function to bedside clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the sublingual microcirculation A round table discussion in 2006 by experts in&#xD;
      the field, sought to clarify the features that should be included in microcirculatory&#xD;
      analysis, concluding that assessment of the microcirculation should include measures of&#xD;
      vascular density, assessment of capillary perfusion and a heterogeneity index (in vessels of&#xD;
      &lt;20 micrometres in diameter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These measured variables are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microvascular Flow Index (MFI) - Perfusion quality Image divided in to quadrants. A number is&#xD;
      assigned to each quadrant according to predominant flow type (0 = no flow, 1 = intermittent,&#xD;
      2 = sluggish, 3 = continuous). The MFI results from the mean of the 4 values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Vessel Density (TVD) Vessel density - The total length of the vessels divided by the&#xD;
      total surface area of the analysed area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perfused Vessel Density (PVD) - Functional vessel density Total length of perfused vessels&#xD;
      (MFI score 2/3) divided by the analysed area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proportional of Perfused Vessels (PPV) - Perfusion quality 100 x number of perfused vessels&#xD;
      divided by the total number of vessels Heterogeneity Index (HI) Measure of the heterogeneity&#xD;
      of flow between vessels. Highest MFI - lowest MFI divided by mean MFI across all sites&#xD;
      analysed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to healthy volunteers, patients with sepsis display lower values for PVD, PPV and&#xD;
      MFI, along with increased heterogeneity index, irrespective of macro haemodynamic condition.&#xD;
      Total capillary density appears to be unaffected by sepsis. These findings were corroborated&#xD;
      by the International Study on Microcirculatory Shock Occurrence in Acutely Ill Patients&#xD;
      (microSOAP) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microSOAP study is to date the largest trial investigating the significance of&#xD;
      microcirculatory alterations in a heterogeneous ICU population (i.e. not just those with&#xD;
      sepsis). Using the previous generation of similar technology, the investigators found that of&#xD;
      the 501 patients included for analysis, 86 (17%) had an abnormal MFI (defined a priori as&#xD;
      &lt;2.6). Of those with an abnormal MFI, the HI was increased with decreased PPV and PVD. Total&#xD;
      vessel density was not affected. Abnormal MFI in conjunction with tachycardia was associated&#xD;
      with an increased mortality (OR 3.24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CytoCam Tools automated analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      CytoCam Tools is the proprietary software supplied with the aforementioned microcirculatory&#xD;
      monitor. It utilises a new analysis technique termed Capillary Network Analysis (CNA) whereby&#xD;
      the microcirculation is analysed automatically and in a user-independent nature by a&#xD;
      two-stage process which includes automatic vessel detection (depending on the diameter of&#xD;
      visualised vessels), followed by an assessment of speed of red blood cells in the vessels&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following microcirculatory variables are then automatically determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total Vessel Density (TVD) - Total length of all detected vessels divided by the&#xD;
           processed area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Speed Index (SI) - Relative number derived from the intensity variation along the&#xD;
           centreline of a vessel, which describes the speed detected in the vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perfused Speed Index (PSI) - SI in a vessel where the SI is higher than the perfusion&#xD;
           threshold (PT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Average Perfused Speed Indicator (APSI) - Sum of all PSI values divided by the total&#xD;
           number of perfused vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of perfused vessels (PPV) - Total length of all vessels with an SI higher&#xD;
           than the PT, divided by the total length of all detected vessels x 100,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perfused Vessel Density (PVD) - Total length of all vessels with an SI higher than the&#xD;
           PT divided by the processed area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Average Perfused Speed Indicator Heterogeneity Index (APSI HI) - Image divided in to&#xD;
           quadrants and APSI derived for each quadrant. APSI highest minus the lowest APSI divided&#xD;
           by the mean APSI of all quadrants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of PPV and PVD relies on the automated analysis of red blood cell speed in&#xD;
      identified vessels. In order to achieve this a predetermined Perfusion Threshold (PT) is set.&#xD;
      The PT describes the state of flow within identified vessels and can range from 0 to&#xD;
      infinite. Manufacture assessment has determined that a PT of over 1 is consistent with a&#xD;
      &quot;perfused condition&quot; and this can be subdivided further as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perfusion threshold&#xD;
&#xD;
      State of flow 0 - 1 = No flow 1 - 5 = Sluggish 5 or greater = Good flow Normal ranges for&#xD;
      these automatically measured variables in health are currently unknown. Understanding the&#xD;
      normal ranges would allow us to utilise this technique in future studies concerning the early&#xD;
      diagnosis of septic illness. Identification of patients at an early stage in the&#xD;
      pathophysiological process of sepsis before the development of traditionally diagnostic&#xD;
      macro-circulatory abnormalities may allow earlier implementation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CytoCam system may represent a step towards a more user-friendly, reproducible,&#xD;
      clinically applicable approach to measuring, and acting upon changes in microvascular&#xD;
      function to improve clinical outcomes. However, the normal ranges for these measurements are&#xD;
      not known, without which further studies cannot take place. This study will identify the&#xD;
      normal ranges for the automatically determined measurements derived by the CytoCam system in&#xD;
      healthy subjects, and open new opportunities for studies, which we anticipate will be aimed&#xD;
      at the early identification of patients with microcirculatory dysfunction (as is found in&#xD;
      sepsis); whose microcirculatory parameters fall outside of these newly defined ranges. This&#xD;
      will be the first step in moving towards routine bedside microcirculatory monitoring in our&#xD;
      intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work builds on projects currently in progress within the Diagnostic Development Unit&#xD;
      (DDU) based at Leicester Royal Infirmary. The DDU is a University of Leicester&#xD;
      inter-collegiate project between Medicine, Space Science and Atmospheric Chemistry, exploring&#xD;
      the use of novel non-invasive monitors in Emergency Medicine and Critical Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population to be studied&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the normal ranges for automatically measured microcirculatory variables as&#xD;
      determined by the CytoCam system in different adult age groups.&#xD;
