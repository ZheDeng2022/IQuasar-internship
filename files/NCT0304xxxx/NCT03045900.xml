      There is a deficiency in literature which compares the blending effect and color matching of&#xD;
      translucent shade bulk-fill resin composite with shaded bulk-fill resin composite. So in this&#xD;
      research color matching and blending effect will be instrumentally measured the by a&#xD;
      spectrophotometer. A visual assessment also will be done in-vivo and ex-vivo.&#xD;

      Color matching may be the only parameter of treatment with which the patient is concerned.&#xD;
      Failure to match the proper color of the teeth may lead to failure of mechanically and&#xD;
      biologically successful restoration. Up to 80% of the patients expressed their&#xD;
      dissatisfaction with the perceived color of their dental restorations. Thus, proper color&#xD;
      reproduction is considered to be one of the most complex and frustrating problems in&#xD;
      restorative dentistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polymerisation shrinkage is another serious problem that causes entrapment of stresses that&#xD;
      may shorten the clinical life of the restoration. In an effort to reduce this, resin&#xD;
      composite is placed in increments as each increment compensate for the previous one. These&#xD;
      increments are usually 2 mm each to allow the penetration of curing light. As the resin shade&#xD;
      is darker and the filler size is larger, the curing depth will be more limited. So no doubt&#xD;
      that the more translucent is the shade of the resin, the higher is the depth of cure. It is&#xD;
      noted that, incremental placement is a tedious, time consuming and a very sensitive&#xD;
      technique. Improper placement may result in air bubble entrapment or porosity that may result&#xD;
      in a weak restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bulk-fill resin composites specifically designed for large posterior restorations. They&#xD;
      represent a new era in direct filling technology and a paradigm shift away from the&#xD;
      traditional 2 mm increment system. Bulk-fill resin composite are possible to be cured in a&#xD;
      depth of 3.5 to 5.5 mm. This reduces effort and time of the procedure and guarantees a&#xD;
      solution for the polymerization shrinkage problem. It is important to note that bulk-fill&#xD;
      materials do not constitute a uniform class of materials, they have different consistencies&#xD;
      sculptable and flowable. Also some companies produce a translucent shade that should match&#xD;
      almost all teeth color as they claim. This is called blending effect where the material can&#xD;
      take the shade of the surrounding tooth structure and thus guarantee a solution for color&#xD;
      matching problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also there is a deficiency in literature that compares the blending effect and color matching&#xD;
      of translucent shade bulk-fill resin composite with shaded bulk-fill resin composite. So in&#xD;
      this research we will assess the effect of shaded bulk-fill resin composites against the&#xD;
      translucent shade bulk-fill resin composite in-vivo and ex-vivo by spectrophotometer and&#xD;
      visual inspection.&#xD;
