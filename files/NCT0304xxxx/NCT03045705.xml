  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current study the investigators wish to evaluate the effect the doctors and midwives&#xD;
      in the delivery room have on the timing and modality of analgesia chosen by the participants.&#xD;
      The participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups. Both groups will be advised of the&#xD;
      different modalities of analgesia available during labor. One group will be managed in the&#xD;
      delivery room the same as if not part of the study, meaning the doctors and midwives will&#xD;
      treat the participants the way they usually do regarding analgesia. The second group of&#xD;
      participants will not be asked by the doctors and midwives about analgesia at all but will be&#xD;
      able to receive analgesia by a modality of choice at the timing of choice.&#xD;

      After explaining to the participants the study and having signed a confirmed consent,&#xD;
      participants will receive an extensive explanation regarding the different modalities of&#xD;
      analgesia available during labor. After the explanations the participants will be randomly&#xD;
      divided into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Routine management-doctors and midwives will treat the participants the way they usually&#xD;
           do regarding analgesia including frequent inquiries about wishes for analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Interventional management-participants will not be asked by the doctors and midwives&#xD;
           about analgesia at all during labor but will be able to receive analgesia by a modality&#xD;
           of choice at the timing of choice after being advised by the medical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After delivery, participants will fill a questionnaire regarding the experience of labor in&#xD;
      general and the relevance of analgesia during labor including the effect the medical team may&#xD;
      have had on decision making during labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical information regarding visual analogue scale (VAS), analgesia modality, cervical&#xD;
      conditions, parity etc. will be extracted from patients' electronic files.&#xD;
