      This is a safety and tolerability study looking at the addition of avelumab, an immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor, to standard therapy of temozolomide and radiotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be receiving active therapy. Patients will begin the avelumab within 3&#xD;
      weeks of finishing their radiotherapy. Avelumab will be given at a dose of 10mg/kg IV every 2&#xD;
      weeks concomitantly with the monthly temozolomide. Avelumab will be continued for a total of&#xD;
      52 weeks.&#xD;

      Protocol Title: Avelumab in patients with newly diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication: Patients with newly diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Type: Single center, phase 2, open ended, open label addition of avelumab to standard&#xD;
      therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and tolerability of avelumab administered as 10mg/kg IV q2weeks in&#xD;
      patients receiving standard therapy for newly diagnosed GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the impact of the addition of avelumab at a dose of 10mg/kg IV Q2weeks in&#xD;
      patients receiving standard therapy for newly diagnosed GBM on overall survival (OS),&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) and other antitumor activity parameters according to the&#xD;
      immunotherapy Response Assessment for Neuro-Oncology (iRANO) (1) at 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore biomarkers that could predict treatment response to avelumab such as: the tumor&#xD;
      immunoscore, presence and extent of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and microglia/macrophages&#xD;
      within the tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
      To correlate the OS and PFS in relation to the change between baseline and end of study&#xD;
      neurocognitive function as measured by the evoked potential P300 (normal), the baseline&#xD;
      corticosteroid dose, the average daily corticosteroid dose over the whole study duration,&#xD;
      those who for tolerability reasons do not complete the temozolomide standard 6 monthly pulses&#xD;
      of therapy and the presence and severity of immune related adverse events (irAE's).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess and compare above mentioned biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with second&#xD;
      surgical resection ie treatment failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess in this GBM population the duration of pseudoprogression and the lagtime needed for&#xD;
      immunotherapy to become effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a single center, phase 2, open label, add-on, single dose study in&#xD;
      patients receiving standard therapy for newly diagnosed GBM. In total 30 patients who meet&#xD;
      the entry criteria will be entered into the study within 3 weeks of finishing their last day&#xD;
      of combined radiotherapy/temozolamide. Avelumab will be initiated concurrently with the&#xD;
      initiation of the first 5 day, monthly cycle of temozolamide and continued for a total of 260&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A local pathology report will constitute adequate documentation of histology for study&#xD;
      inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumor block used for diagnosis of GBM must be collected for each patient and sent for&#xD;
      MGMT assessment (if not already done), biomarker and immunoscore analysis. The availability&#xD;
      of these samples is mandatory for randomization into the study, and they must be sent within&#xD;
      2 months after patient's entry into the study for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paraffin embedded blocks containing formalin-fixed tumor tissue representative of the&#xD;
      glioblastoma diagnosis is the preferred sample (if available, and of sufficient quality),&#xD;
      otherwise, a partial tumor block, or pathology material should be sent. If surgery was not&#xD;
      performed but biopsy was performed (or if it is not possible to send FFPE tumor tissue&#xD;
      blocks) at least 10 unstained, uncovered slides must be sent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 3 different phases: a Combination Phase, a Monotherapy Phase and an&#xD;
      Extended Safety Follow-up Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination Phase: Upon completion of the standard combination therapy of radiotherapy (total&#xD;
      dose 60 Gy, administered as daily 2Gy fractions, 5 days/week) and temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day&#xD;
      p.o. qd) and a treatment break of no more than 21 days, the combination phase will start.&#xD;
      Patients will receive temozolomide and avelumab for 6 cycles of 28 days each. During the 1st&#xD;
      cycle Temozolomide will be given the first 5 days at a dose of 150mg/m2/day p.o. In the next&#xD;
      cycle, the temozolomide dose should be escalated to 200/mg/m2 if permitted by the patient's&#xD;
      hematological and non-hematological toxicity profile (as per NCI-CTC AE version 3). The&#xD;
      temozolomide dose will be adjusted according to hematological and non-hematological toxicity&#xD;
      as per temozolomide's product monograph (appendix 4). Avelumab will be administered on day 1&#xD;
      and day 15 of each cycle at a dose of 10mg/kg IV. Avelumab therapy will be withheld according&#xD;
      to the occurrence and severity of avelumab related adverse events as per table 3. Patients&#xD;
      will continue the combination of temozolomide (150-200mg/m2 per day PO X5 days Q28days) and&#xD;
      avelumab (at 10mg/kg dose, IV on days 1 and 15 per cycle) until 6 cycles are completed or&#xD;
      until confirmed disease progression or unacceptable (grade 3 or higher) avelumab related&#xD;
      toxicity occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monotherapy Phase: Upon completion of the Combination Phase or upon stopping temozolomide&#xD;
      because of temozolomide related toxicity the patient will continue into the avelumab&#xD;
      Monotherapy Phase. Avelumab 10mg/kg IV Q2weeks will be continued as monotherapy until a total&#xD;
      of 260 weeks of avelumab has been received or evidence of confirmed disease progression as&#xD;
      per the iRANO definition or unacceptable (grade 3 or higher) avelumab related toxicity has&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who experience irAE's may according to table 3 directives have their avelumab&#xD;
      therapy suspended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Bevacizumab, second surgical resection or re-irradiation will not be allowed in&#xD;
      the study and will be considered as evidence of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be promptly informed upon confirmation of disease progression as per the new&#xD;
      iRANO criteria. They will be offered to pursue with the avelumab therapy as per protocol or&#xD;
      to withdraw from therapy and enter the extended safety follow up phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the Monotherapy Phase at week 260 patients will be then be offered the&#xD;
      option of being rolled over into an open label extension study or receive commercial avelumab&#xD;
      via a special access program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended Safety Follow-up Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who discontinue avelumab therapy for any reason at any point in the study will be&#xD;
      entered into an extended safety follow-up period of 90 days. Treatment will then be at the&#xD;
      investigator or local oncologist's discretion. All subjects will be observed for the possible&#xD;
      occurrence of delayed irAE's. Survival data and information about subsequent therapies will&#xD;
      be collected. Tissue samples in patients undergoing second surgical resections will be&#xD;
      obtained for further biomarker analysis.&#xD;

         10. Adequate hepatic function defined by a total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 × the upper limit&#xD;
             of normal (ULN) range and AST and ALT levels ≤ 2.5 × ULN for all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Adequate renal function defined by an estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min&#xD;

             of less than 1 % per year. Highly effective contraception is required at least 28 days&#xD;
