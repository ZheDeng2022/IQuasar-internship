      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a virus that infects the lungs and breathing passages.&#xD;
      Healthy adults who are infected generally have mild cold symptoms for a week or two. But it&#xD;
      can also be serious, especially for infants and older adults. It can be spread by direct or&#xD;
      indirect contact with respiratory secretions. Researchers want to study a new vaccine to&#xD;
      prevent RSV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if a vaccine for RSV is safe and if it causes side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults 18-50 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers were screened in a separate screening protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects had 13 visits over 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some subjects received just vaccine. Some received vaccine mixed with alum adjuvant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects received their dose by injection in the upper arm. They received up to two&#xD;
      doses, one at the beginning of the study and another 12 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were monitored for 1 hour after injection and called to check on their safety 1 day&#xD;
      after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects recorded their temperature and side effects for 7 days after each vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were provided with a thermometer to measure their temperature and a ruler to measure&#xD;
      any changes if these occurred on their skin at the injection site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all visits, subjects were checked for health changes or problems. They may have had blood&#xD;
      drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At some visits, subjects had samples collected from their nose and mouth.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the dose, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of VRC-RSVRGP084-00-VP vaccine alone or with alum adjuvant&#xD;
      in a 2-injection regimen. The hypotheses are that the vaccine will be safe and tolerable for&#xD;
      human administration, and will induce detectable immune response. The primary objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational vaccine at 3 dose levels&#xD;
      administered alone or with alum adjuvant in healthy adults. Secondary objectives relate to&#xD;
      humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the investigational vaccine regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRC-RSVRGP084-00-VP (DS-Cav1) was developed by VRC, NIAID and is composed of the respiratory&#xD;
      syncytial virus (RSV) fusion (F) glycoprotein ectodomain assembled as a trimer stabilized in&#xD;
      its prefusion native conformation with a foldon trimerization domain at the C-terminus and 4&#xD;
      internal mutations designated DS-Cav1 (4.1DHFR_RSVAF). The sequence is based on the RSV A2&#xD;
      strain from subtype A. The product was provided at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL in 3 mL glass&#xD;
      vials filled to 1.2 mL. Adjuvant was an aluminum hydroxide suspension (alum) provided in a&#xD;
      sterile, pyrogen-free suspension at a concentration of 5 mg/mL in 3 mL glass vials filled to&#xD;
      0.7 mL. The alum dose was 500 mcg and was field mixed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult subjects ages 18-50 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were randomized into DS-Cav1 or DS-Cav1 plus alum in each dose during the study.&#xD;
      Dose continuation and dose escalation evaluations occurred to ensure the safety data support&#xD;
      proceeding to the higher doses. Subjects were evaluated for safety and immune responses&#xD;
      through blood and mucosal sample collection at specified timepoints throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

        <title>Number of Subjects Reporting Local Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms Within 7 Days of the First Product Administration of DS-Cav1 Alone or With Alum Adjuvant</title>
        <description>Subjects recorded the occurrence of solicited symptoms on a diary card for 7 days after the first study product administration and reviewed the diary card with clinic staff at a follow up visit. Subjects were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom more than one time at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Local Symptom&quot; is the number of subjects reporting any local symptom at the worst severity. Reactogenicity grading (Mild, Moderate, Severe) was done using the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (FDA Guidance - September 2007).</description>

        <description>Subjects recorded the occurrence of solicited symptoms on a diary card for 7 days after the first study product administration and reviewed the diary card with clinic staff at a follow up visit. Subjects were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom more than one time at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Systemic Symptom&quot; is the number of subjects reporting any systemic symptom at the worst severity. Reactogenicity grading (Mild, Moderate, Severe) was done using the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (FDA Guidance - September 2007).</description>

The number reported for &quot;Any Systemic Symptom&quot; is the number of subjects reporting any systemic symptom at the worst severity. Reactogenicity grading (Mild, Moderate, Severe) was done using the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (FDA Guidance - September 2007).</description>
          <population>Population included all enrolled subjects who received at least one study injection of DS-Cav1 alone or with alum adjuvant and provided safety data (via diary card and/or laboratory results) following the injection (N=95).</population>

        <title>Number of Subjects Reporting Systemic Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms Within 7 Days of the Second Product Administration of DS-Cav1 Alone or With Alum Adjuvant</title>
        <description>Subjects recorded the occurrence of solicited symptoms on a diary card for 7 days after the second study product administration and reviewed the diary card with clinic staff at a follow up visit. Subjects were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom more than one time at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Systemic Symptom&quot; is the number of subjects reporting any systemic symptom at the worst severity. Reactogenicity grading (Mild, Moderate, Severe) was done using the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (FDA Guidance - September 2007).</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Abnormal Laboratory Measures of Safety</title>
        <description>Any abnormal laboratory results recorded as unsolicited AEs are summarized. Safety laboratory parameters included hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelets, white blood cell (WBC) and red blood cell (RBC) counts, and neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil and basophil percents and counts) and chemistry (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine). Complete blood count (CBC) differential, platelet, creatinine and ALT results were collected at screening (≤ 56 days before enrollment), Day 0 prior to study product administration (baseline), and at Days 7, 28, 84, 91 and 112. Institutional laboratory normals as well as the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine Clinical Trials FDA Guidance, September 2007 were used.</description>
