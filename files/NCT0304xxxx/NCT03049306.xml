  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective in this study is to test whether propranolol lowers glucose and free&#xD;
      fatty acid levels during sleep in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and preserves vascular&#xD;
      function (EndoPAT) versus placebo. The secondary objective is to test whether propranolol&#xD;
      influences sleep quality, architecture, and hemodynamics in OSA. OSA will be elicited by&#xD;
      temporarily discontinuing CPAP therapy in patients with a history OSA accustomed to CPAP&#xD;
      therapy (CPAP withdrawal).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Free fatty acids and glucose elevations occur during the night in obstructive sleep apnea&#xD;
      (OSA) patients, and these elevations may be responsible for adverse cardio-metabolic&#xD;
      consequences of OSA. The sympathetic nervous system is well known to mediate adipose tissue&#xD;
      lipolysis as well as &quot;stress hyperglycemia&quot;. Thus, investigators may be able to mitigate&#xD;
      these nocturnal metabolic changes with beta adrenergic blockade. Propranolol is a&#xD;
      non-selective beta blocker that is used for a variety of indications including hypertension&#xD;
      and anxiety. In this study investigators will administer propranolol or placebo to patients&#xD;
      with OSA before sleep. Investigators will compare nocturnal metabolic profiles and&#xD;
      hemodynamics on/off propranolol in the setting of CPAP withdrawal.&#xD;
