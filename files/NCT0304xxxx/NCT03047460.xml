      Study Objectives and Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and test-retest reliability&#xD;
      of MEP's and (SSEP's) in a multicenter clinical trial in healthy subjects and subjects with&#xD;
      MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary reliability endpoint will be the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the&#xD;
      following evoked potential parameters&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The establishment of a biomarker(s) that can predict a clinical response to therapy over the&#xD;
      course of a 1-2 year clinical trial is critical for the expeditious development of treatments&#xD;
      for Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Identification of this biomarker would enable shorter and&#xD;
      smaller clinical trials resulting in the faster development of much needed treatments for MS,&#xD;
      specifically neuro-reparative therapies. The etiology of disease progression is conduction&#xD;
      block, demyelination and axonal degeneration. Evoked potentials provide a direct assessment&#xD;
      of the underlying etiologies of disease progression in MS. They are a functional assessment&#xD;
      of multiple pathways, including visual, motor and sensory, evaluating the integrity of myelin&#xD;
      and axons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variability of motor evoked potentials (MEP) measures has limited multimodal evoked&#xD;
      potential (mmEP) use in international, multicenter clinical trials. MEP evaluation does&#xD;
      significantly contribute to the predictive value of mmEP's. Recent advances in technology and&#xD;
      establishment of standardized protocols for MEP reduces the variability associated with this&#xD;
      procedure. The objective of this study is to evaluate the reliability and feasibility of MEP&#xD;
      and SSEP in an international, multicenter trial so that mmEP can be further evaluated as a&#xD;
      biomarker for disease progression. The rationale for this study is to explore the feasibility&#xD;
      and reliability of MEP's and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP's) in a multicenter&#xD;
      clinical trial for potential use as a biomarker that can predict clinical&#xD;
      progression/improvement in international clinical trials evaluating remyelinating therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives and Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and test-retest reliability&#xD;
      of MEP's and (SSEP's) in a multicenter clinical trial in healthy subjects and subjects with&#xD;
      MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary reliability endpoint will be the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the&#xD;
      following evoked potential parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor Evoked parameters that will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MEP latency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central motor conduction time (CMCT) root latency methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MEP amplitude&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MEP amplitude to compound motor amplitude ratio (MEP-M ratio) for the right and left&#xD;
           abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and the right and left tibialis anterior (TA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Somatosensory evoked potential parameters will include Evoked potential latencies for&#xD;
           both upper and lower limbs bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multinational, multicenter study will be conducted in healthy adult volunteers and MS&#xD;
      patients to establish the feasibility and reliability of mmEP's. A total of 40 subjects, 10&#xD;
      (5 healthy and 5 MS) from each of the 4 sites will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of two visits, 1-30 days apart, during which subjects will be screened&#xD;
      to confirm eligibility and will complete all specified study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Locations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canada, Germany, Switzerland and Italy, with 1 site in each country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Planned Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 40 subjects are planned for this study. Subjects who withdraw from the study&#xD;
      prior to completion of the second visit may be replaced at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in subjects 25 to 58 years of age, inclusive, who are either&#xD;
      healthy volunteers (HV) or have been diagnosed with clinically definite MS who have a&#xD;
      detectable lesion by MEP or SSEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups, healthy volunteers and clinically definite MS will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration for each subject will be two visits, the second visit schedule &gt;24 hours-30&#xD;
      days from the first visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Study Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrophysiological. MEP's and SSEPs will be measured in both upper and lower limbs&#xD;
      bilaterally. All studies will be read locally and reviewed by a blinded reader at another&#xD;
      center. The ICC of every measured evoked potential parameter will be determined on both the&#xD;
      central and local reads.&#xD;
