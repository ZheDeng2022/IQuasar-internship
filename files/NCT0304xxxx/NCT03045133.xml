      Introduction. Despite the advantages associated with the use of remifentanil during total&#xD;
      intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), it has been observed a frequent difficulty in the control of&#xD;
      postoperative pain due to the risk of developing hyperalgesia and acute tolerance associated&#xD;
      with the administration of this opioid. There is evidence that NMDA receptors are involved in&#xD;
      the development of these changes. Methadone is an opioid that exhibits analgesic potency&#xD;
      similar to that of morphine but has NMDA antagonist activity and longer duration of action as&#xD;
      additional features. The objective of the study was to evaluate the quality of recovery&#xD;
      (QoR40) of patients undergoing TIVA for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and who received&#xD;
      morphine or methadone to control postoperative pain. Methods. Patients aged 18 to 65 years,&#xD;
      physical status ASA I and II, submitted to total venous anesthesia (propofol and&#xD;
      remifentanil) for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and eligible to participate in this&#xD;
      prospective and randomized clinical study will be evaluated. After induction of anesthesia,&#xD;
      patients will receive a solution containing 0.1 mg.kg-1 morphine (MF group) or 0.1 mg.kg-1&#xD;
      methadone (MT group). Data on the presence of pain, nausea, vomiting, tremor, drowsiness,&#xD;
      presence of SpO2 &lt;92%, even with O2 face mask (5 L.min-1) and length of stay will be recorded&#xD;
      at PACU. The pain will be evaluated every 15 minutes on a verbal numerical scale (ENV) from 0&#xD;
      to 10. E.v. morphine 0.1 mg.kg-1 (MF group) or methadone 0.1 mg.kg-1 (MT group) will be&#xD;
      administered every 15 minutes to obtain the score below 3. After discharge from the PACU, all&#xD;
      patients will receive intravenous ketoprofen every 12 hours and dipyrone every 6 hours. For&#xD;
      cases where the patient considers the analgesic regimen insufficient, tramadol (100 mg) will&#xD;
      be administered intravenously at 8-hour intervals. The consumption of analgesics, the&#xD;
      intensity of pain, the occurrence of nausea, vomiting and other complications in the ward&#xD;
      will be recorded. The application of the questionnaire (QoR40) will be performed in the ward&#xD;
      the morning after the surgery by a medical student.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesized that methadone treatment would beneficially affect patient-perceived quality&#xD;
      of recovery after laparoscopic cholecystectomy under total intravenous anesthesia. The&#xD;
      primary outcome was assessed using the Quality of Recovery Questionnaire (QoR-40), a 40-item&#xD;
      quality of recovery scoring system, on postoperative day (POD) 1. In addition, the effects of&#xD;
      both opioids on early clinical recovery variables, such as the time to eye opening, the&#xD;
      occurrence of nausea and vomiting, pain score, use of analgesics, and length of PACU stay,&#xD;
      were determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. This randomised trial was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the School of&#xD;
      Medical and Health Sciences, Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sequence No premedication will be applied to the patients. Patients´ preoperative data&#xD;
      including age, gender, physical status and, BMI will be collected. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized using a computer-generated (www.random.org) table of random numbers into 2 groups:&#xD;
      MT (methadone 0.1 mg.kg-1) or MF (morphine 0.1 mg.kg-1). Group assignments were sealed in&#xD;
      sequentially numbered opaque envelopes that were opened after patient inclusion in the study.&#xD;
      All care providers, researchers, and patients were blinded to group assignments. Two study&#xD;
      10-mL syringes will be prepared by an anesthesiologist independent of the study. Syringe 1 to&#xD;
      be used during intraoperative phase and syringe 2 as a rescue for postoperative pain.&#xD;
      Methadone 0.1 mg.kg-1 (made up to 10 mL with normal saline) or morphine 0.1 mg.kg-1 (made up&#xD;
      to 10 mL with normal saline) will be drawn into each syringe which will be offered to the&#xD;
      anesthesia provider after the opaque envelope is opened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic and Surgical Management After arrival in the operating room, standard ASA monitors&#xD;
      will be applied. Lidocaine (30 mg) will be administered intravenously immediately after&#xD;
      venoclysis. After anesthesia induction, capnographic monitoring will be added. Anesthesia&#xD;
      will be induced with remifentanil 0.5 µg.kg-1.min-1 over three minutes followed by propofol&#xD;
      2.0 mg. kg-1. Rocuronium 0.6 mg.kg-1 will be administered to facilitate tracheal intubation.&#xD;
      Anesthetic maintenance will be achieved with a continuous infusion of remifentanil 0.3&#xD;
      µg.kg-1.min-1 and propofol 4 to 6 mg. kg-1. h-1. Ventilation will be controlled mechanically&#xD;
      to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration of 30-40 mmHg using a 50% oxygen-air&#xD;
      gas mixture. Immediately after the induction of anesthesia, patients will receive&#xD;
      intravenously: MT group - Methadone 0.1 mg/kg or MF group - morphine 0.1 mg/kg. Patients who&#xD;
      exhibit reductions in systolic arterial pressure (SAP) greater than 30% or heart rate (HR)&#xD;
      reductions to less than 50 bpm will be given ephedrine (10 mg) and atropine (0.5 mg),&#xD;
      respectively. Normal saline will be used for fluid replacement therapy at a rate of 500 ml&#xD;
      throughout the first 30 minutes, and, then, 2 ml/kg/h until the end of the surgical&#xD;
      procedure. All of the participants will receive dexamethasone (8 mg) and ketoprofen (100 mg)&#xD;
      at the onset of surgery and ondansetron (4 mg) and dipyrone (1 g). Residual neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockade will be antagonized by atropine (0.01 mg/ kg) and neostigmine (0.015 mg/kg).&#xD;
      Extubation will be performed after awakening. The time elapsed from discontinuation of the&#xD;
      anesthetics until the eye opening will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When stable vital signs and respiration are confirmed, all patients will be transferred to&#xD;
      the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Early recovery times includes time to eye opening (time&#xD;
      from the discontinuation of anaesthetics to eye opening) and time to Aldrete score ≥ 9. Data&#xD;
      related to the occurrence of pain, nausea and vomiting at the PACU will be recorded. Pain&#xD;
      will be assessed while at rest and after asking the subjects to cough, every 15 minutes using&#xD;
      a 0-10 numeric pain rating scale (NRS), where zero meant no pain and 10 the worst imaginable&#xD;
      pain. When stable vital signs and respiration are confirmed, all patients will be transferred&#xD;
      to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Early recovery times includes time to eye opening&#xD;
      (time from the discontinuation of anaesthetics to eye opening) and time to Aldrete score ≥ 9.&#xD;
      Data related to the occurrence of pain, nausea and vomiting at the PACU will be recorded.&#xD;
      Pain will be assessed while at rest and after asking the subjects to cough, every 15 minutes&#xD;
      using a 0-10 numeric pain rating scale (NRS), where zero meant no pain and 10 the worst&#xD;
      imaginable pain. One or two mL from the solution previously prepared (Syringe 2) will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously every 15 minutes to maintain the pain score below 3 (1 mg when the&#xD;
      pain score is &lt;7 and 2 mg when it is ≥7). Following discharge from the PACU (minimum stay 60&#xD;
      minutes and Aldrete score ≥ 9), all of the participants will receive ketoprofen (100 mg)&#xD;
      every 12 hours and dipyrone (30 mg.kg-1, maximum 1 g) every six hours intravenously. Whenever&#xD;
      patients judge that their analgesia is insufficient, tramadol (100 mg) will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously at eight-hour minimum intervals. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) will&#xD;
      be treated with ondansetron (4 mg) intravenously. An investigator who will be blinded to&#xD;
      group assignment will collect all postoperative outcome data 24 hours after surgical&#xD;
      procedure. Subjects will rate the higher score of pain (NRS) during the hospital ward stay.&#xD;
      Tramadol consumption and the number of nausea and vomiting episodes will also be recorded.&#xD;
      These findings will be confirmed with the ward nursing staff. All subjects will stay at&#xD;
      hospital for at least 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection The baseline QoR-40 questionnaire will be provided to subjects after informed&#xD;
      consent is obtained in the preoperative holding area and 24 hours after surgery by a blinded&#xD;
      investigator. The QoR-40 questionnaire assesses five dimensions of recovery (physical comfort&#xD;
      - 12 items; emotional state - 7 items; physical independence - 5 items; physiological support&#xD;
      - 7 items; and pain - 7 items). Each item is rated on a five-point Likert scale: none of the&#xD;
      time, some of the time, usually, most of the time, and all the time. The total score on the&#xD;
      QoR-40 ranges from 40 (poorest quality of recovery) to 200 (best quality of recovery). The&#xD;
      primary outcome of interest will be the QoR-40 score, however the following data will also be&#xD;
      recorded: age, gender, physical status, BMI, and length of PACU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The sample size was calculated considering 90% power to detect a&#xD;
      10-point difference in QoR-40, which indicated the need to include 31 participants in each&#xD;
      group. Taking possible losses into consideration, the final sample included 70 patients.&#xD;
