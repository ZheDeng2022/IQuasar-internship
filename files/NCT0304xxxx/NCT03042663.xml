  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the value of US-guided Stellate ganglion block for improving radial arterial&#xD;
      blood flow and peripheral perfusion in Septic shock patients on vasopressor support with an&#xD;
      indwelling radial arterial cannula, which can result in reduced incidence premature failure&#xD;
      of the catheter (due to vasospasm or thrombosis) and incidence of ischemic complications in&#xD;
      the cannulated arm.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radial artery cannulation is a well-established procedure in the ICU, especially in&#xD;
      critically ill hemodynamically unstable patients. The first description of arterial&#xD;
      cannulation in humans dates back to 1856, when the blood pressure was measured int the&#xD;
      femoral artery. It can be used for continuous blood pressure monitoring, obtaining&#xD;
      func¬tional hemodynamic parameters derived from the arterial waveform, to predict the&#xD;
      physiologic response to fluid resuscitation and also for blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common complications for the procedure are temporary radial artery occlusion&#xD;
      (19.7%), in addition to hematoma (14.4%), infection at the arterial site (0.72%), hemorrhage&#xD;
      (0.53%) or bacteremia (0.13%), pseudoaneurysm (0.09%) and finally ischemic damage (0.09%).&#xD;
      Larger catheter diameter, presence of vasospasm, female sex (probably related to smaller&#xD;
      vessel diameter) increase the risk of ischemic complications. Inadequate experience (high&#xD;
      number of attempts, multiple arterial sticks and hematoma formation) can also increase the&#xD;
      complication rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study by Numaguchi et al, they found that radial artery cannulation decreases the&#xD;
      distal arterial blood flow measured by power Doppler ultrasound. In another study by Kim et&#xD;
      al, they found that after radial artery cannulation ulnar artery diameters were significantly&#xD;
      increased (compensatory) and radial artery diameters were decreased after cannulation&#xD;
      compared with pre-cannulation values, then returned to pre-cannulation values 5 min after&#xD;
      cannulation. They detected radial artery vasospasm in 12 patients with 20-G cannulas used&#xD;
      (31.5%) and in 2 patients with 22-G cannulas used (5.3%) (p &lt; 0.05), which was observed&#xD;
      immediately after cannulation, and had mostly disappeared after 5 min. There was no data&#xD;
      regarding the follow up of the patients afterwards. In both studies the subjects were not&#xD;
      critically ill patients (and not on vasopressors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral limb ischemia in ICU patients can be the result of iatrogenic injury, thrombotic&#xD;
      complications or hypoperfusion related to the underlying disease state. The patients at&#xD;
      greatest risk for acute ischemia are those with underlying peripheral artery disease (PAD),&#xD;
      but limb ischemia can also be the consequence of embolism, injury, dissection, or severe&#xD;
      vasoconstriction, even in the absence of preexisting occlusive disease. Repeated arterial&#xD;
      punctures may result in extensive hematoma formation and arterial spasm, The thick muscular&#xD;
      coat and abundance of alpha adrenoreceptors make it prone to develop spasm when traumatized.&#xD;
      Attempts to control bleeding following cannulation through local hemostasis only complicate&#xD;
      matters. While, normally, the likelihood of serious ischemia is minimized by the presence of&#xD;
      the palmar arterial arch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of vasopressors especially nor-epinephrine with its potent α1-adrenergic receptor&#xD;
      agonist activity can aggravate the condition more. We didn't find in the literature any&#xD;
      reliable data regarding the effect of using vasopressors (particularly nor-epinephrine) in&#xD;
      any dosage on the incidence of peripheral arterial vasospasm or ischemic complications&#xD;
      following arterial cannulation. But there were mixed case reports linking both or one of&#xD;
      them: high dose vasopressors and arterial cannulation, to ischemic complications. Such as&#xD;
      developing peripheral gangrene after starting high dose vasopressors, or developing complex&#xD;
      regional pain syndrome (CRPS) following radial artery cannulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that blocking the Stellate ganglion with Local anesthetics can interfere with&#xD;
      the sympathetic out flow to the upper limb resulting in abolishing its vasoconstrictor action&#xD;
      on the arteries thus decreasing arterial spasm and promoting better blood flow in the&#xD;
      peripheral circulation.&#xD;
