  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK following single and&#xD;
      multiple ascending dose administration of VS-105 in healthy subjects and patients with&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease stage 5D (CKD-5D) on hemodialysis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human, 3 part, single and multiple ascending dose study in healthy&#xD;
      subjects and subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD). A&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will evaluate safety data from each dose cohort before&#xD;
      proceeding with the subsequent cohort. The SMC will also review data from each Part of the&#xD;
      study before proceeding to the next scheduled Part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, single ascending doses (SAD) of VS 105 will be administered to approximately 5&#xD;
      dose cohorts of 8 healthy subjects each. In Part 2, multiple ascending doses (MAD) of VS 105&#xD;
      will be administered to approximately 3 dose cohorts of 8 healthy subjects each. VS 105 doses&#xD;
      for MAD cohorts in Part 2 will be determined by the SMC and based on results from Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 3, MAD of VS 105 will be administered to approximately 3 successive dose cohorts that&#xD;
      will each include 4 subjects with ESRD requiring HD. VS 105 doses used in Part 3 will be&#xD;
      selected by the SMC based on review of safety and/or pharmacokinetic (PK) results from Part 1&#xD;
      and Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parts 1 &amp; 2 of the study will assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of ascending doses of&#xD;
      VS 105 to determine the dose range that is safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3 of the study will assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of various doses of VS 105&#xD;
      in subjects with ESRD requiring HD (ie, HD subjects), who represent the target population&#xD;
      with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT).&#xD;

&#xD;
        Hemodialysis Subjects (Part 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible subjects with ESRD requiring HD must meet all of the following criteria to qualify&#xD;
        for enrollment in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has end stage renal disease and is on a stable (defined as Kt/V â‰¥ 1.2 on two&#xD;

          4. Subjects who have been receiving other vitamin D receptor analogs (eg, calcitriol,&#xD;
             paricalcitol [Zemplar], doxercalciferol [Hectorol]) must allow for a washout period of&#xD;
             3 weeks prior to study drug administration on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: (1) If washout of VDRA therapy and/or cinacalcet is required, a check in visit&#xD;
             should be performed 1 week into the washout period to monitor for safety (at a&#xD;
             minimum, this visit will include laboratory testing for albumin corrected calcium;&#xD;
             additional assessments may be performed at the investigator's discretion). (2) The 3&#xD;

             childbearing potential (including perimenopausal women who have had menstrual bleeding&#xD;
             within 1 year) must be using a method of birth control considered to be appropriate by&#xD;
             the investigator (eg, abstinence, double barrier methods, hormonal contraceptives, or&#xD;
             partner with vasectomy) for the entire duration of the trial. Female subjects of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must agree to use appropriate birth control from the time of&#xD;
             Screening until 1 month after their last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women are considered to be not of childbearing potential if they are postmenopausal&#xD;
             (defined as amenorrheic for â‰¥12 months with a confirmed FSH â‰¥ 40 mIU/mL) or if they&#xD;
             have been surgically sterilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Male subjects must either: remain abstinent from intercourse, be sterile, or agree to&#xD;
             use a method of birth control considered to be appropriate by the investigator (eg,&#xD;

             determined by investigator, and based upon a medical evaluation that includes a&#xD;
             medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who need concurrent medications must have a medication regimen considered to&#xD;
             be stable by the investigator (eg, no new drugs or significant changes to dosage[s]&#xD;
             within 14 days prior to study drug administration on Day 1; no changes expected during&#xD;
             study conduct). Changes of medications in HD subjects are subject to dialysis site&#xD;
             protocols such that erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron can be changed&#xD;
             based on the current subject status, the dialysis unit's standard of practice, and&#xD;
             subject safety. Changes to medications may be allowed at the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects must have satisfactory control of blood pressure (as determined by the&#xD;
