      Background to the research Patients present to Emergency Departments (ED) with a spectrum of&#xD;
      illness, many of which are life- threatening. The body has the ability to compensate in the&#xD;
      early stages when things go wrong so that on the surface patients do not appear as sick as&#xD;
      they really are. Under-diagnosis of severity of illness leads to under-treatment, unnecessary&#xD;
      mortality, and unnecessary hospital costs. Earlier diagnosis and consequent treatment will&#xD;
      result in prudent healthcare, cost-benefit and better patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating the true underlying patient haemodynamics such as cardiac output, cardiac power&#xD;
      and peripheral pressures gives vital clues to the hidden seriousness of illness and is a&#xD;
      guide to better management. Few EDs in the world assess such haemodynamics. After evaluating&#xD;
      a haemodynamic protocol one centre in Australia was able to reduce its death rate for septic&#xD;
      shock at 30 days from 38% to 7%. We would like to evaluate whether the same would occur if&#xD;
      applied across EDs in Wales. However, before we can do that we need to strengthen our&#xD;
      understanding of haemodynamics, and of relevant protocols and non-invasive devices that help&#xD;
      us to acquire such information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design After ethics and institutional approval is obtained from we will conduct a&#xD;
      prospective, single-centre, cohort study on 354 adult patients with possible shock associated&#xD;
      with an acute illness or injury who present to the Emergency Department of the University&#xD;
      Hospital of Wales, and follow them up for 7 days. 354 is a credible number to confirm that&#xD;
      the strategy works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent will be obtained either from the patient or a relative wherever possible but&#xD;
      a waiver of consent apply to patients who, because of confusion, unconsciousness or severe&#xD;
      disability, may be unable to give consent. In these cases, consent will first be sought from&#xD;
      a second doctor and/or nurse. Thereafter, consent will be obtained from the patient or a&#xD;
      relative as soon as practically possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What you hope to discover&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to discover that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uscom variables predict 7-day survival and ICU admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uscom variables improve the detection and classification of shock&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The LiPS definition can be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The objective definition is better than doctors experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have a good experience and are satisfied with care&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients frequently present to emergency departments (EDs) with critical illness and injury.&#xD;
      Shock is a life-threatening emergency, which requires urgent and rapid assessment, diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment, and can be classified into distributive-septic (62%), distributive-non-septic&#xD;
      (4%), hypovolaemic (16%), cardiogenic (16%) and obstructive (2%). Sepsis is the leading cause&#xD;
      of in-hospital death, and approximately 80% of these patients are admitted through the ED. In&#xD;
      Chinese patients presenting to an ED in Hong Kong we have previously derived and validated a&#xD;
      simple, a priori, pragmatic, quantitative method for recognising and classifying shock - Li's&#xD;
      Practical Shock (LiPS) tool. This method has been validated against ICU admission and early&#xD;
      mortality. However, it was derived in a single population in a single centre, and requires&#xD;
      further validation and refined in other settings. Further, it does not sub-classify patients&#xD;
      beyond 'normal, cold and warm shock', does not guide next steps in treatment, and the&#xD;
      assessment of the peripheries is very subjective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating the true underlying patient haemodynamics such as cardiac output, cardiac power&#xD;
      and peripheral pressures gives vital clues to the hidden seriousness of illness and is a&#xD;
      guide to better management. Few EDs in the world assess such haemodynamics. After evaluating&#xD;
      a haemodynamic protocol one centre in Australia was able to reduce its death rate for septic&#xD;
      shock at 30 days from 38% to 7%. We would like to evaluate whether the same would occur if&#xD;
      applied across EDs in Wales. However, before we can do that we need to strengthen our&#xD;
      understanding of haemodynamics, and of relevant protocols and non-invasive devices that help&#xD;
      us to acquire such information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many unanswered questions such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do Uscom-derived haemodynamic variables measured in the ED predict patients who at high&#xD;
           risk of death, admission to ICU, and have shock?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does a refined LiPS definition better predict mortality and ICU admission?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do advanced haemodynamic predictors and/or refined LiPS predict better than experienced&#xD;
           physicians the presence and classification of patients with shock, mortality and ICU&#xD;
           admission?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will answer two main questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the probability that a patient has shock?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What type of shock does the patient have?&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate whether advanced haemodynamic variables using USCOM predict 7-day&#xD;
           mortality and ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate whether advanced haemodynamic variables using USCOM improve the detection&#xD;
           and classification of shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To validate and refine Li's a priori Pragmatic Shock (LiPS) method for detecting and&#xD;
           classifying shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate clinical experience for shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To inform on the feasibility of future studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ethics and institutional approval is obtained from we will conduct a prospective,&#xD;
      single-centre, cohort study on 354 adult patients with possible shock associated with an&#xD;
      acute illness or injury who present to the Emergency Department of the University Hospital of&#xD;
      Wales, and follow them up for 7 days. 354 is a credible number to confirm that the strategy&#xD;
      works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent will be obtained either from the patient or a relative wherever possible but&#xD;
      a waiver of consent apply to patients who, because of confusion, unconsciousness or severe&#xD;
      disability, may be unable to give consent. In these cases, consent will first be sought from&#xD;
      a second doctor and/or nurse. Thereafter, consent will be obtained from the patient or a&#xD;
      relative as soon as practically possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenge is to discover a strategy that has a sensitivity &gt;67% and specificity &gt;72% for&#xD;
      determining in-hospital mortality in clinically deteriorating or potentially shocked&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
