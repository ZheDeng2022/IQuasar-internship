  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, there is a growing burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Approaches to implement&#xD;
      nutrition recommendations and promote sustainable eating behaviours are required. The&#xD;
      investigating research team developed an educational curriculum that includes practical&#xD;
      information about Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide, portion control and food label&#xD;
      reading. The research team also developed a cookbook, &quot;Pure Prairie Eating Plan&quot; which&#xD;
      translates the Canadian Diabetes Association Clinical Practice Guidelines into a practical&#xD;
      menu plan with recipes, grocery lists and cooking tips. These resources promote behaviour&#xD;
      change and skill development to independently manage diabetes. These resources have been&#xD;
      successfully employed in a clinical study trial conducted at the University of Alberta and in&#xD;
      a pilot project at the community (Pure Prairie Living Program -PPLP), and showed beneficial&#xD;
      effects in management of diabetes among participants. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      implement and evaluate the PPLP in a community level, to promote healthy lifestyle among&#xD;
      people with T2D in the general community. To meet the study objective, 60 adult participants&#xD;
      with diagnosed T2D will be recruited from three different primary care networks (total of 180&#xD;
      participants) and at each site 30 participants will be randomized into the education&#xD;
      intervention (PPLP) and 30 will be the wait-listed controls (CON) receiving usual care. PPLP&#xD;
      participants will attend 5, biweekly education sessions and a grocery store tour scheduled&#xD;
      over a period of 3 months.The benefits of the lifestyle intervention on physiological&#xD;
      indicators (BMI, Haemoglobin A1C, blood lipids, blood pressure) and lifestyle choices&#xD;
      (adherence to dietary recommendations, self-efficacy and participation in physical activity)&#xD;
      will be examined.&#xD;

      Overall Goal: To implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention (LI)&#xD;
      tailored to Albertans' environment called the Pure Prairie Living Program (PPLP) in primary&#xD;
      care network (PCN) settings. The PPLP delivers innovation in the concept (based on the 4-A&#xD;
      Framework), the setting (PCNs) and nutrition evaluation tools (for Dietary Adherence - PDAQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: In Canada, there is a growing burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D). One in four&#xD;
      Canadians has diabetes or pre-diabetes and this number is projected to be 1 in 3 by 2020. The&#xD;
      associated economic burden is estimated to be $16.9 billion in 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adopting a healthy lifestyle can prevent and also help effectively manage T2D. Several&#xD;
      dietary LI in the recent decades have targeted achieving a healthy body weight, participation&#xD;
      in physical activity, and healthy eating as primary goals of their intervention trials to&#xD;
      delay the progression of the disease or to minimize co-morbidities associated with T2D.&#xD;
      Although some of the programs have achieved success in improving health outcomes and delaying&#xD;
      the risk of co-morbidities, sustaining long-term changes by the participants after completion&#xD;
      of intervention trials is challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many interventions attempt to personalize treatment based on an individual's preferences and&#xD;
      circumstances but fewer consider individual factors within a broader framework of health&#xD;
      determinants that includes local food Availability, financially/physically Accessibility,&#xD;
      culturally Acceptability and nutritionally Adequacy (4A Framework). Failure to achieve&#xD;
      long-term adherence may be influenced by these social and environmental health determinants.&#xD;
      Further, Healthcare Professionals (HCP) are designated with the primary responsibility of&#xD;
      educating patients to prevent, treat and manage chronic diseases. However HCPs often lack the&#xD;
      training, skills, confidence, and time required to implement effective LI and primary care&#xD;
      delivery models often lack the required structure and organization for such LI. Few studies&#xD;
      consider the health care system-level changes that are required to offer sustainable, high&#xD;
      quality LI or programs. Hence to achieve sustained adoption and maintenance of the effects of&#xD;
      a LI at a system level requires careful planning (considering the barriers for change,&#xD;
      ongoing support to personnel and participants, adopting a framework for behaviour change,&#xD;
      improving self-efficacy), implementation and evaluation of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Alberta, Primary Care Networks (PCNs) were implemented to provide citizens access to a&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary care team of clinicians, including dietitians. One of the goals of PCNs is&#xD;
      to increase the emphasis on health promotion, disease and injury prevention, and care of&#xD;
      patients with complex problems or chronic disease. Therefore, the PCN setting is ideal for&#xD;
      implementation of LI. The investigators will use the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,&#xD;
      Implementation and Maintenance) framework in planning and evaluating the PPLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous Work by the Research Team: The investigating research team (1) created and validated&#xD;
      a simple, practical instrument for assessing dietary adherence to Canadian Diabetes&#xD;
      Association (CDA) guidelines called Perceived Dietary Adherence Questionnaire (PDAQ). 2)&#xD;
      created and published a 4-week menu plan and recipe book (Pure Prairie Eating Plan, PPEP) to&#xD;
      promote healthy eating in the general population and in those with diabetes&#xD;
      (www.pureprairie.ca). The menus provide 28 days of suggestions for meeting recommendations of&#xD;
      Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide (EWCFG) and CDA nutrition therapy guidelines and&#xD;
      incorporate the principles of the 4-A Framework; 3)Pilot tested the menu plan/recipes in 15&#xD;
      participants with T2D and observed a 1.0% reduction in haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) (p&lt;0.05) after&#xD;
      3 months, along with significant reduction in weight and increase in PDAQ score; 4) In a&#xD;
      research setting conducted a single-arm phase 2 trial with 73 volunteer participants with&#xD;
      T2D. HbA1c was reduced by 0.7% (p&lt;0.05). Improvements in PDAQ score, serum lipids, blood&#xD;
      pressure and self-efficacy were also observed. 5) Based on the successful phase 2 trial, the&#xD;
      investigators collaborated with the Southside PCN in Edmonton to pilot an education program&#xD;
      centered around PPEP in a patient population. At the system level to ensure suitability of&#xD;
      the program, PCN and research personnel refined the education program incorporating&#xD;
      information and resources that the PCN was using in existing programming while highlighting&#xD;
      the key messages of the education program developed from the phase 2 trial. The program was&#xD;
      called PPLP and was piloted in 26 individuals. At an individual level, preliminary results&#xD;
      from 17 participants show significantly increased PDAQ score and diabetes self-efficacy along&#xD;
      with weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives: (1) To evaluate the efficacy of PPLP in promoting better nutrition&#xD;
      choices (as recommended by EWCFG and CDA Nutrition Therapy Guidelines), improved diabetes&#xD;
      self-efficacy, participation in physical activity and improved health outcomes (improved&#xD;
      glucose control, lipid panel and blood pressure); (2) To describe the perceived strengths,&#xD;
      limitations, effectiveness and satisfaction of the PPLP by HCP and study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of two arms [intervention (PPLP)&#xD;
      and wait-listed controls (CON)]. Evaluation will utilize the RE-AIM Framework using mixed&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Sites: Study will be implemented at 3 PCNs in Edmonton. Site personnel will be&#xD;
      co-investigators in the research to facilitate maximal buy-in and integrated knowledge&#xD;
      translation (KT). Prior to implementation of the study, the research personnel will offer&#xD;
      support to PCN team to develop site specific PPLP protocol and provide necessary training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Recruitment: A convenience sampling procedure will be employed to recruit&#xD;
      study participants through advertisement and posters at the participating PCNs. Investigators&#xD;
      aim to recruit a total of 180 participants, 60 participants from each site (30 participants&#xD;
      in each RCT arm). Inclusion criteria are: adults (aged 30-80 years) with T2D and able to read&#xD;
      and write in English. Exclusion criteria are: having severe gastrointestinal issues or&#xD;
      diabetes complications requiring specialized diet or type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1) To evaluate the efficacy of PPLP: This intervention study will span 6 months&#xD;
      from recruitment to the final participant visit. Details of each visit are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline Assessment (Clinic Visit 1): Weight and height will be measured to calculate&#xD;
           body mass index (BMI). Body composition will be assessed using Bio-impedance analyser.&#xD;
           Questionnaires to assess demographic information, diabetes management, diabetes&#xD;
           self-efficacy, dietary intake pattern (PDAQ), quality of life and physical activity will&#xD;
           be completed by participants. Blood pressure (BP) will be assessed and blood sampled for&#xD;
           Hb A1C and lipid profile tests. Physical activity will be quantitatively assessed by&#xD;
           using pedometers for 3 days. All the data will be collected by a Registered&#xD;
           nurse/Dietitian at the PCN. Patients will then be randomized to PPLP or CON groups who&#xD;
           will receive usual care prior to enrolment in the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implementation of the Intervention (Clinic Visit 2-7): PPLP participants will attend and&#xD;
           participate in 5, biweekly nutrition and physical activity education sessions (~ 90 min&#xD;
           each) that will be conducted at the PCNs' facilities and facilitated by the PCN&#xD;
           dietitian. Participants will also be taken for a grocery store tour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 3 Month Assessment (Visit 8): All PPLP and CON participants will visit the PCN, and&#xD;
           complete all the questionnaires, blood tests and measurements that were done at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow-up: All participants will be contacted via phone follow-up on 2 occasions (once a&#xD;
           month) to answer any questions related to nutrition and physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 6 Month Assessment (Clinic Visit 9): All PPLP and CON participants will return to the&#xD;
           PCN for the final study visit, which will collect the same measures as Visit 8.&#xD;
           Wait-list controls will then be offered the PPLP (Intervention, 3 month Assessment,&#xD;
           Follow-up and 6 Month Assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Chart review: Participant health care records will be accessed to obtain information on&#xD;
           HgA1C and lipid panel tests done during the period of study (Baseline to 6 month&#xD;
           assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Entry and Analysis: Changes (pre to post-intervention) in dietary adherence, diabetes&#xD;
      self-efficacy, quality of life, weight, BMI, Body composition, BP, HgA1C, high density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol will be&#xD;
      assessed and compared within and between PPLP and CON groups. Patient feedback of&#xD;
      health/behaviour outcomes will be provided at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2) Qualitative study to assess strengths, limitations and satisfaction with&#xD;
      approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 3 month clinic visit, the participants from the PPLP group will participate in a focus&#xD;
      group discussion to understand adoption of information gained during intervention and to&#xD;
      evaluate the barriers/facilitators to adoption. The investigators will also collect copies of&#xD;
      the workbooks from participants for process evaluation, to understand factors influencing&#xD;
      program retention, success in meeting goals etc. The HCP will participate in a one-on-one&#xD;
      interview sessions at this period. Questions will focus on core RE-AIM domains. Responses&#xD;
      will help understand adoption of the program at a system level, implementation relative to&#xD;
      efficacy and economic constraints, suggestions for improvement and maintenance of PPLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Outcomes and Impact of the Proposed Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide important information about the efficacy and suitability of the PPLP&#xD;
      for a PCN-based implementation to manage T2D in people from Alberta. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that PPLP participants will have improved nutrition and physical activity-related&#xD;
      knowledge and skills to manage T2D resulting in better health. Results from this study will&#xD;
      inform the success of the program at an individual and system level. This can be used as&#xD;
      evidence to justify further scale and spread of the LI to other PCNs and through programs&#xD;
      offered by the Alberta Health Services. Furthermore, PPLP being based on 4-A Framework is&#xD;
      adaptable, using PPLP as a template; other jurisdictions may be supported to develop similar&#xD;
      programming adapted to their local environment. The PI is currently Scientific Director of&#xD;
      the Diabetes, Obesity and Nutrition Strategic Clinical Network of Alberta Health Services&#xD;
      (AHS), part of whose mission is to advance evidence-based interventions into care. KT&#xD;
      materials, in the form of written, oral and e-briefs will be provided regularly to each PCN&#xD;
      site and AHS, to provide early evidence of outcomes in each of the RE-AIM domains. PCN&#xD;
      personnel from both sites will share their experiences and learn from each other through&#xD;
      ongoing e-meetings. Widespread access to all the tools developed will be made through&#xD;
      electronic means (PPEP website), and patient-oriented dissemination through CDA, Alberta&#xD;
      Diabetes Institute and other venues&#xD;
