      Combination therapy is becoming more and more general in the treatment of oncological&#xD;
      diseases. In this clinical trial combination the standard immunotherapeutic treatment; the&#xD;
      programmed death 1 (PD-1) regulatory antibody Nivolumab and a peptide vaccine consisting of&#xD;
      programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) peptides will be&#xD;
      tested in patients with metastatic melanoma. Patients will be treated with Nivolumab every&#xD;
      second week as long as there is clinical benefit. The PD-L1/IDO peptide vaccine is given from&#xD;
      start of Nivolumab and every second week for the first 6 vaccines and thereafter every fourth&#xD;
      week up to 1 year.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Huge advances have been made in the treatment of metastatic melanoma (MM) the past 5 years.&#xD;
      Especially immunotherapy has shown promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer cells are naturally attacked by cells of the immune system, but can induce a state of&#xD;
      tolerance whereby they escape from immune attack. This escape is brought about by many&#xD;
      mechanisms. An important one is the programmed death pathway (PD-1/PD-L1). PD-L1 is commonly&#xD;
      overexpressed on cancer cells. Interaction of PD-1 on activated T cells and PD-L1 on cancer&#xD;
      cells lead to inhibition of the cytotoxic T cells. Another important mechanism is through&#xD;
      overexpression of the metabolic enzyme IDO on cancer cells. Activation of IDO also inhibits&#xD;
      cytotoxic T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have recently identified spontaneous T cell reactivity against PD-L1 and IDO in&#xD;
      the tumor microenvironment and in the peripheral blood of patients with MM and healthy&#xD;
      donors. Both IDO and PD-L1 reactive CD8 T cells are cytotoxic and can kill cancer cells and&#xD;
      immune regulatory cells in vitro.. Thus boosting specific T cells that recognize immune&#xD;
      regulatory proteins such as IDO and PD-L1 may directly modulate immune regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to distinct mechanisms of action, the combination of treatment with a monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      targeting PD-1 (Nivolumab) and a vaccine with peptides against PD-L1 and IDO may have a&#xD;
      synergistic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have previously reported a phase I trial where, the IDO peptide was tested in&#xD;
      15 patients with MM in combination with Ipilimumab, and no grade 3-4 toxicity was seen. The&#xD;
      PD-L1 peptide is currently being tested in a first-in-man study in patients with multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-step clinical phase I/II trial design will be used, starting out with a pilot study&#xD;
      including 6 patients with MM to test feasibility and tolerability. If the treatment is found&#xD;
      feasible the study will be extended to a phase II study with 24 patients. The objective is to&#xD;
      describe anti-tumor immune responses and objective responses using RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with Nivolumab in accordance with standard regimen, which involves&#xD;
      outpatient IV infusions every second week as long as there is clinical benefit. The PD-L1/IDO&#xD;
      peptide vaccine is given from start of Nivolumab and every second week for the first 6&#xD;
      vaccines and thereafter every fourth week up to 1 year. 15 vaccines will be administered in&#xD;
      total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed with clinical controls and diagnostic imaging every 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients who receive all vaccines will have follow up after 3 and 6 months in parallel with&#xD;
      standard of care treatment for Nivolumab.&#xD;
