      &lt;Research Hypothesis&gt; The dynamics of immune systems by cytotoxic chemotherapy and its&#xD;
      changes by combination with immuno-oncology agents will be uncovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of Durvalumab/Tremelimumab with gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy is&#xD;
      feasible and efficacious in chemo-na誰ve biliary tract cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Purpose of the study&gt; To assess the effect of Durvalumab/Tremelimumab in combination with&#xD;
      gemcitabine/cisplatin on response rate (RR) in chemo-na誰ve advanced biliary tract cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      &lt;Rationale for conducting this study&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rational #1. The incidence of biliary tract cancer (BTC) is higher in Korea than the&#xD;
           West. (Korea: 10 new cases/100,000 population every year, the West:1-2 cases/100,100&#xD;
           population every year). Therefore, to conduct clinical study of BTC in Korea is very&#xD;
           feasible and efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rational #2 The Gemcitabine/cisplatin is the current standard of care in 1st-line&#xD;
           treatment for advanced BTC ((N Engl J Med 2010; 362 (14): 1273-81). No one-targeted&#xD;
           therapy has been approved in BTC, yet. The overall survival of advanced BTC with&#xD;
           cytotoxic chemotherapy is only 8-10 months, in general. Therefore, there is a huge unmet&#xD;
           medical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rational #3 In recent sequencing data of BTC showed the BTC patients with the worse&#xD;
           prognosis had significant enrichment of hypermutated tumors and a characteristic&#xD;
           elevation in the expression of immune checkpoint molecules. According, immune-modulating&#xD;
           therapies also be potentially promising options for these patients (Nat Genet. 2015&#xD;
           Sep;47(9):1003-10.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Rational #4 In PDL1 (+) BTC, anti-PD1 Ab shows promising activity as a monotherapy (Bang&#xD;
           YJ, et al. ECC/ESMO 2015) In one clinical study of pembrolizumab, 37 out of 89 BTC&#xD;
           patients (41.6%) showed the PDL1 (+) tumor. Among 24 PDL1 (+) patients who were enrolled&#xD;
           and treated with pembrolizumab, 50% were Asian, 62.5% had ECOG 1, 16.7% had gallbladder&#xD;
           cancer, 80% were at the 3rd-line or later setting. Four patients showed PR (3 from Seoul&#xD;
           National University Hospital), 4 patients SD, which led the overall response rate of&#xD;
           17.4%. A total 40% of patients showed tumor shrinkage. The decreases in tumor size were&#xD;
           generally maintained over time. This study gives us the evidence that immune checkpoint&#xD;
           inhibitor is working on BTC likewise other solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Rational #5 In recent studies have shown the combination of CTLA4 inhibitor with&#xD;
           anti-PD1/PDL1 agents shows the enhanced clinical activities, especially, regardless of&#xD;
           PDL1 status. This combination strategy is being actively under test in many solid&#xD;
           tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Rational #6 Certain chemotherapeutic drugs stimulate cancer-specific immune responses by&#xD;
           inducing immunogenic cell death and other effector mechanisms (Immunity 2013, Annu Rev&#xD;
           Immunol 2013) With the cytotoxic chemotherapy, the PDL-1 is induced and this increased&#xD;
           expression of PDL1 contributes the resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Successful&#xD;
           eradication of tumors by immunogenic chemotherapy requires removal of immunosuppressive&#xD;
           IgA+, PDL1+plasmocytes (Nature 2015). More importantly, still vast majorities of dynamic&#xD;
           changes of immune system by cytotoxic chemotherapy are unanswered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These support that the combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy with immuno-oncology agents&#xD;
           including immune checkpoint inhibitors might be efficacious and needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Rational #7 The advantages of &quot;Immunotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy&quot; combination&#xD;
           are; 1) can explore science on the dynamic immunologic changes by cytotoxic chemotherapy&#xD;
           and its overcome by immunotherapy 2) easy way to be incorporated in the current clinical&#xD;
           practice 3) can be applied to variety of tumor types such as NSCLC, urothelial cancer.&#xD;
           4) relatively affordable than &quot;immunotherapy and targeted agent&quot; combination.&#xD;
           Durvalumab/Tremelimumab in combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy has not been tested,&#xD;
           especially in BTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Sample Size Determination&gt; Primary efficacy endpoint is response rate. In BTC, the response&#xD;
      rate of 1st-line gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy is about 20% (20% in BT22 clinical trial,&#xD;
      25% in ABC-02 clinical trial). Therefore, we set H0 as 20%, and H1 as 40%. Using 75% of power&#xD;
      and a-error of 0.05, a total 28 patients will be needed. When we assume the drop-out rate of&#xD;
      10%, a total of 31 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
