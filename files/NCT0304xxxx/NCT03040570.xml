  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A feasibility study to determine if it is possible to perform a safe, adequately powered, and&#xD;
      affordable multi-centre study in critically ill children comparing current practice of&#xD;
      liberal targets for systemic oxygen levels with more conservative targets.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Around 19,000 critically ill children are admitted to paediatric intensive care units (PICU)&#xD;
      each year in the UK. A large number of these children need breathing support, and this is&#xD;
      usually provided through an invasive machine called a 'ventilator'. Clinicians make decisions&#xD;
      for treatment based on how much oxygen their patient has in their blood (this is called&#xD;
      oxygen saturation or oxygenation) and currently the amount of oxygen critically ill children&#xD;
      need is not fully understood. This means that some clinicians use a lower oxygen saturation&#xD;
      target, and others, a higher target. This may be problematic as research in neonates (babies)&#xD;
      and adults has shown that oxygen saturation levels can influence a patient's chance of&#xD;
      survival, how long they stay in hospital and healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response to oxygen is different in babies, children and adults. This means that the results&#xD;
      from the neonatal and adult research are unlikely to be valid or applicable in children due&#xD;
      to age-related differences. Urgent high quality clinical evidence is therefore needed to&#xD;
      inform on the best targets of oxygenation during critical illness in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As large clinical trials are expensive to conduct, it is important to demonstrate that a&#xD;
      large-scale trial can be done and that the different components of a trial can all work&#xD;
      together. Therefore, the Oxy-PICU study is a 'pilot randomised clinical trial' (a smaller&#xD;
      version of the trial we would like to conduct) and will test the feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      conducting a large scale trial comparing a restrictive oxygen saturation target (88-92%) with&#xD;
      a more liberal oxygen saturation target (&gt;94%). Oxy-PICU will also collect blood and urine&#xD;
      samples to allow for in depth study of the biology of the different oxygenation targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot trial will take place at three PICUs (two in London and one in Southampton) and&#xD;
      aims to include between 115-125 eligible children over six months. Given the emergency nature&#xD;
      of these children and the need to provide immediate care, informed consent will be sought&#xD;
      after the children are entered into the study (this is known as deferred consent).&#xD;
