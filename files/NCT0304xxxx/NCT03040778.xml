    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this project is to answer the following clinical question: Among&#xD;
      Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (MRONJ) patients, do those who are treated with&#xD;
      the Pentoxifylline and Tocopherol (PENTO) regimen and standard of care, when compared to&#xD;
      those treated with standard of care alone, have decreased areas of exposed bone after one&#xD;
      year of treatment?&#xD;

      HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      HA: Among patients with MRONJ, after 12 months of treatment with PENTO, the area of exposed&#xD;
      bone in the PENTO group will be different than the area of exposed bone in the standard&#xD;
      therapy group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Among patients with MRONJ, after 12 months of treatment with PENTO, the area of exposed&#xD;
      bone in the PENTO group will equal the area of exposed bone in the standard therapy group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if the PENTO regimen in addition to the standard of care treatment for MRONJ&#xD;
      significantly reduces the area of exposed bone compared to standard of care alone. Standard&#xD;
      of care is defined as the clinical guidelines of the 2014 AAOMS Position Paper on&#xD;
      Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (MRONJ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Challenges: Identifying patients with Stage 1, 2, 3 MRONJ who will be compliant with&#xD;
           therapy and available for follow-up. Measuring greatest anterior-posterior and&#xD;
           superior-inferior dimensions to calculate area. Ensuring patient safety with interim&#xD;
           analyses and an appropriate stopping protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Approach: The investigators will treat patients with Stage 1, 2, 3 MRONJ with either&#xD;
           PENTO as an adjunct to the standard of care or standard of care alone with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: &gt;6 million patients in the US are at risk for MRONJ. If proven to successfully treat&#xD;
      MRONJ, the trial would establish a non-operative treatment option for successful management&#xD;
      of MRONJ with potential for significant decreased morbidity for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will be derived from the population of patients who present to a participating&#xD;
      trial site for management of MRONJ during the trial's enrollment period. To be included in&#xD;
      the trial a patient must meet the criteria listed below. If a patient is excluded from the&#xD;
      trial the reason will be documented for the study's record as well as basic demographic data,&#xD;
      MRONJ staging, risk medications, indication for and use of antiresorptive and antiangiogenic&#xD;
      medications and area of exposed bone will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stratified permuted-block randomization will be used to allocate patients to treatment.&#xD;
      This method ensures balanced allocations to achieve approximately the preset treatment&#xD;
      allocation ratio of 1:1 and avoids predictability of future assignments. Strata will be&#xD;
      constructed for the prognostic variables of initial MRONJ stage (1,2,3) and antiresorptive&#xD;
      therapy (bisphosphonate vs. denosumab/RANK-L inhibitor). Within each strata, block sizes of 2&#xD;
      and 4 will be used to randomize patients to PENTO + standard of care or to standard of care&#xD;
      with placebo alone with randomization of treatment sequence to meet the 1:1 allocation ratio&#xD;
      within each block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer-generated list of random allocations will be prepared for each strata. The&#xD;
      allocation sequence will be concealed from the researcher enrolling and assessing&#xD;
      participants in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed and stapled envelopes. Corresponding&#xD;
      envelopes will be opened only after the enrolled participants complete&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis of interest is the association between treatment group and area of&#xD;
      exposed bone. The primary analysis will be a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)&#xD;
      with one within subject (time) factor and one between subject (treatment) factor will be&#xD;
      completed for A = area based upon Dap and Dsi and geometric shape of the lesion. If outcomes&#xD;
      do not meet assumptions then non-parametric analogues will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATE&#xD;
&#xD;
      alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.10, Anticipated drop-out rate = 30%&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stratified permuted- block randomization will be used to allocate patients to treatment.&#xD;
      Intention to treat to include all subjects as randomized to treatment (detailed on page 3 of&#xD;
      the application). If a patient drops out or is withdrawn prior to 12-month treatment&#xD;
      endpoint, the last observation carried forward (LOCF) will be included in analysis. In&#xD;
      addition, patients &quot;as treated&quot; (patient received incorrect treatment) or &quot;as protocol&quot;&#xD;
      (doesn't include patient dropouts or withdrawals) will be analyzed to evaluate effectiveness&#xD;
      of the treatment. To detect a relative change in primary outcome ≥20% with the above&#xD;
      parameters, a minimum sample of 44 patients in each study arm is required (total n=88).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators deemed that an improvement of ≥20% by the intervention group compared to&#xD;
      the control group in decreased bone exposure to be clinically significant. There is no&#xD;
      consensus in the current literature on a clinically significant difference between the&#xD;
      control and treatment arms. However, if the study is powered for the outcomes expected based&#xD;
      on current literature, a difference of 50% between arms would only require 7 patients per&#xD;
      arm. Therefore the investigators believe the study to be overpowered to ensure the&#xD;
      statistical analysis would remain significant if the suspected success of the PENTO regimen&#xD;
      is not true.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STOPPING RULES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because this is an investigational use of pentoxifylline and the benefits of PENTO in MRONJ&#xD;
      are not presently established, interim analyses (p=.001) will be performed at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
      If the trial is stopped after an interim analysis for proven benefit, the trial will be&#xD;
      converted to an open trial and the patients will be followed for the entire 12-month&#xD;
      treatment period, or until they achieve complete mucosal coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient withdrawal from study criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A serious adverse event related to the trial medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient becomes pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any relevant deterioration in the health of the subject (AEs, vital signs, ECG,&#xD;
           laboratory parameters).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinically relevant change in vital signs if technical failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oversight of the trial is provided by the Principal Investigator (PI) Dr. Dillon and Co-&#xD;
      Investigators (Co-I) Dr. Ruggiero, Dr. Morlandt, and Dr. Ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MONITORING PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drs. Dillon, Ruggiero, Morlandt, and Ward assure that informed consent is obtained prior to&#xD;
      performing any research procedures, that all subjects meet eligibility criteria, and that the&#xD;
      study is conducted according to the IRB-approved research plan. Blinded study data are&#xD;
      accessible at all times for the PI and Co-investigators to review. All four investigators&#xD;
      will review study conduct including accrual, drop-outs, and protocol deviations on a&#xD;
      quarterly basis. In addition, the investigators will review adverse events (AEs) individually&#xD;
      real-time and in aggregate on a monthly basis. Last, the investigators will review serious&#xD;
      adverse events (SAEs), dose limiting toxicities, and any other specific intervention&#xD;
      complications in real-time. The PI ensures all protocol deviations, AEs, and SAEs are&#xD;
      reported to the FDA, DSMB and IRB according to the applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COLLECTION AND REPORTING OF SAEs AND AEs&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the following standard AE definitions are used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event (AE): Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory&#xD;
      finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or&#xD;
      procedure, regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Event: Any AE that results in any of the following outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Life-threatening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Event requiring inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persistent or significant disability/incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
      AEs are graded according to the following scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild: An experience that is transient &amp; requires no special treatment or intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate: An experience that is alleviated with simple therapeutic treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe: An experience that requires therapeutic intervention. The experience interrupts&#xD;
           usual daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses the following AE attribution scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not related: The AE is clearly not related to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possibly related: An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the&#xD;
           initiation of study procedures, but that could readily have been produced by a number of&#xD;
           other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Related: The AE is clearly related to the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAEs and specific procedure-associated AEs are reported to the University of Washington IRB&#xD;
      and DSMB within 24 hours. In addition, all AEs are reported according to the University of&#xD;
      Washington IRB AE reporting guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MANAGEMENT OF RISKS TO SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected AEs associated with the Pentoxifylline and Tocopherol include: Dizziness, headache,&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, indigestion, flushing, angina, palpitations, hypersensitivity, itchiness,&#xD;
      rash, hives, bleeding, hallucinations, arrhythmias, aseptic meningitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      AE Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others&#xD;
      happen during the course of this study (including SAEs) these will be reported to the IRB in&#xD;
      accordance with University of Washington Human Subjects Division (HSD) protocols and the&#xD;
      DSMB. AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will&#xD;
      be summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB and DSMB at the time of&#xD;
      continuing review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING (DSMB) ANALYSIS PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Analysis for safety (AEs) will be conducted at a minimum of 3 and 6 months. However,&#xD;
      depending upon recruitment the analysis of safety will be as follows when:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100 patients have completed 3 months of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient withdrawal criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A serious adverse event related to the trial medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient becomes pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any relevant deterioration in the health of the subject (AEs, vital signs, ECG,&#xD;
           laboratory parameters).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinically relevant change in vital signs if technical failure can be excluded and&#xD;
           result is confirmed by at least 1 additional measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLAN FOR DATA MANAGEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance of regulatory documents and study data accuracy and completeness will be&#xD;
      maintained through an internal study team quality assurance process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality throughout the trial is maintained by the previously described study-specific&#xD;
      confidentiality procedures. DATA will be stored as de-identified on a REDCap database which&#xD;
      will be password protected and only accessible by study members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT/ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality and integrity of the research will be ensured through data safety monitoring and&#xD;
      informed patient consent for participation. Enrollment will be done by the study coordinator&#xD;
      at each site not the participating surgeon. Other than the UW study coordinator the other&#xD;
      coordinators will be research students participating in the trial. The research will be&#xD;
      independent and impartial, and key study personnel directly involved in patient care will be&#xD;
      blinded to the treatment. Informed consents to be obtained from patients will state the&#xD;
      overall purpose of the study, alternatives to participation, and any direct and indirect&#xD;
      risks/benefits from participation. All patient literature and consents will be written at an&#xD;
      8th grade reading level. The confidentiality and anonymity of the research respondents and&#xD;
      patient health information will be respected. IRB approvals will be obtained at all study&#xD;
      sites prior to beginning any research activities. The individual study site IRBs will&#xD;
      determine if it is appropriate to pursue an expanded access Investigational&#xD;
