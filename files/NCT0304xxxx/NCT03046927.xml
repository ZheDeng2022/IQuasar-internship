      This project is designed to study the role of vitamin D supplementation on the honeymoon&#xD;
      phase of type 1 diabetes in children who are on standardized insulin treatment. The results&#xD;
      could lead to significant changes in the approach to the early phase of type 1 diabetes with&#xD;
      a strong emphasis on prolonging the honeymoon phase by using vitamin D and maintaining these&#xD;
      patients on a standardized insulin regimen. The overall goal is to reduce the long-term&#xD;
      complications of type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prolonging the duration of the partial clinical remission (PCR), or 'honeymoon' phase, of&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes (T1D) improves glycemic control and reduces long-term complications. Recent&#xD;
      studies suggest the exciting possibility that vitamin D supplementation, a safe and&#xD;
      easy-to-implement therapy in children, may lengthen PCR and increase residual beta cell&#xD;
      function (RBCF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, existing studies employed a suboptimal vitamin D dose or lacked a standardized&#xD;
      insulin treatment protocol, precluding solid conclusions and preventing the field from moving&#xD;
      forward with translation to clinical practice. This trial's rationale is to securely&#xD;
      establish the effect of an adequate dose of vitamin D on PCR and RBCF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that vitamin D will increase RBCF and prolong PCR. The primary aim is to&#xD;
      determine the effect of adjunctive vitamin D on RBCF and PCR in youth with T1D maintained on&#xD;
      a standardized insulin protocol. We propose a 12-month randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel design trial of ergocalciferol vs. placebo in 40 subjects of&#xD;
      10-21 years with newly-diagnosed T1D. The primary outcome is the change over time in&#xD;
      stimulated C-peptide (a measure of RBCF). Secondary outcomes include change over time in&#xD;
      insulin-dose-adjusted-hemoglobin-A1c (HbA1c) (IDAA1C; a measure of PCR), HbA1c, and total&#xD;
      daily dose of insulin. Mechanistic studies will explore whether beneficial effects of vitamin&#xD;
      D are associated with increased GLP-1 levels or decreased inflammatory markers, and whether&#xD;
      response to vitamin D is impacted by T1D-risk polymorphisms. If our hypotheses are true,&#xD;
      these findings may completely alter the approach to the early management of T1D, with strong&#xD;
      emphasis on prolonging the honeymoon phase using a readily available and easily affordable&#xD;
      vitamin D while maintaining these patients on a standardized insulin treatment regimen.&#xD;
