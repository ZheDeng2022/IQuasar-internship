  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a multifactorial clinical condition, it may not cause symptoms and its&#xD;
      diagnosis is often delayed. And even when it is diagnosed early, some patients cannot manage&#xD;
      an adequate blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several hypotheses for the non-control of blood pressure, among them the difficulty&#xD;
      of lifestyle change, irregular treatment with antihypertensive drugs, non-individualized&#xD;
      treatment. Studies haven shown that tools such as multiprofessional team and hypertension&#xD;
      leagues are important strategies to obtain a better outcome in the hypertension treatment,&#xD;
      but new approaches are still necessary. Health Coaching is an individualized form of&#xD;
      follow-up, promoting better adherence, better nutrition, smoking cessation, regular physical&#xD;
      exercise and regular use of drugs, thus reducing cardiovascular mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drug adherence and lifestyle changes are tools for chronic disease control. The relationship&#xD;
      between nutrients, alcohol intake, and weight change in blood pressure was demonstraded in&#xD;
      one study, demonstrating the importance of lifestyle change. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      multiprofessional team and hypertension leagues are important strategies to obtain a better&#xD;
      outcome, but new approaches to the patient are still necessary. Health coaching is an&#xD;
      individualized follow-up, promoting better adherence to the hypertension treatment. Health&#xD;
      coaching is a new model based on the support of the individual, for a better autonomy in&#xD;
      personal care. The process engages de patient with the conditions of the disease itself by&#xD;
      increasing knowledge, skill and confidence so that the patient become informed, active in the&#xD;
      participation of its own care. Among health care, training is characterized by the&#xD;
      expression. Of concerns, answering questions, providing information on home-based follow-up,&#xD;
      and collaborative development of health care plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motivated patients are more likely to treatment adherence and more committed to making&#xD;
      lifestyle changes and thus effectively managing their illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is a randomized clinical trial comparing treatment based on health coaching and&#xD;
      the usual treatment based in the treatment of hypertension and comorbidities in uncontrolled&#xD;
      hypertensive patients.&#xD;
