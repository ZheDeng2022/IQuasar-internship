      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal research and clinical practice has been hampered by a lack of suitable investigational&#xD;
      techniques. Currently, ultrasound is the only widely used method of studying fetal anatomy&#xD;
      and physiology, but it has significant limitations for assessment of cardiac rhythm. The&#xD;
      purpose of the proposed study is to utilize fMCG, the magnetic analog of fetal ECG, to&#xD;
      characterize the heart rate and rhythm patterns of fetuses with fetal arrhythmia or at risk&#xD;
      of fetal arrhythmia. The study is not intended to be a pivotal study. The subject device is&#xD;
      already cleared for clinical use for recording of fetal rhythm; however, FDA has determined&#xD;
      that an IDE is required for the proposed study. The study is expected to last approximately 6&#xD;
      years&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Tristan 624 is housed within the magnetically shielded room in the Biomagnetism&#xD;
      Laboratory located within the Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research on the University of&#xD;
      Wisconsin-Madison campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facilities&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UW Biomagnetism Lab is located within the Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, a&#xD;
      state-of-the-art translational research facility adjacent to UW Hospitals and Clinics. The&#xD;
      study sponsor, Ronald Wakai, PhD, Professor of Medical Physics, is the Laboratory Director.&#xD;
      Within the laboratory, medical supervision is provided by Janette Strasburger, MD. The&#xD;
      facility is directly adjacent to UW Hospital. An emergency response plan is in place for the&#xD;
      facility and for the Biomagnetism Lab. In the study of over 700 pregnancies thus far, the&#xD;
      emergency response plan has not been needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to study a total of 300 subjects: 75 will be pregnant women with&#xD;
      uncomplicated pregnancies and 225 will be pregnant women with pregnancies complicated by&#xD;
      fetal arrhythmia or a condition that puts the fetus at risk of fetal arrhythmia. These cases&#xD;
      are considered &quot;high-risk&quot; due to the presence of or risk of serious arrhythmia to the fetus.&#xD;
      It will take approximately 5 years from the start of data collection to recruit the subjects&#xD;
      and collect and analyze the data. The pregnant mothers will be age 18 or older. They will be&#xD;
      studied as early as 15 weeks' gestation and may be asked to return about once every 4 weeks,&#xD;
      if their physician determines that additional fMCG studies are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for normal subjects. The pregnant women subjects must be at least 12 weeks&#xD;
      pregnant and at least 18 years old. They must have uncomplicated pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria for normal subjects. The pregnant women subjects will be excluded if they&#xD;
      are earlier than 12 weeks pregnant or younger than age 18. The 510(k) summary lists no&#xD;
      exclusions for the use of the subject device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for high-risk subjects. The pregnant women subjects must be at least 15&#xD;
      weeks pregnant and at least 18 years old. The primary inclusion criterion is diagnosis of&#xD;
      serious fetal arrhythmia, which is defined as sustained low or high heart rate. Low heart&#xD;
      rate, or bradycardia, and high heart rate, or tachycardia, are based on normative values for&#xD;
      gestation (usually below 110 -120 beats/min, or above 160-180 beats/min). Intermittent&#xD;
      bradycardia or tachycardia and frequent and/or complex ectopy (irregular rhythm) are also&#xD;
      important to detect because these arrhythmias may become incessant over the course of&#xD;
      pregnancy and have implications for patient management. Abnormal repolarization, such as long&#xD;
      QT syndrome (LQTS), is another important class of arrhythmia. Fetuses with a family history&#xD;
      of LQTS or a suspicious rhythm (low heart rate, intermittent AV block, or ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia) will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria for high-risk subjects. The pregnant women subjects will be excluded if&#xD;
      they are earlier than 15 weeks pregnant or younger than age 18. High-risk subjects cannot&#xD;
      participate if their physician does not grant permission for them to participate in the&#xD;
      study. Again, the 510(k) summary lists no exclusions for the use of the subject device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women age 18 or older with uncomplicated pregnancies will be recruited by placing&#xD;
           posters in local perinatal clinics. When prospective subjects call, the study is&#xD;
           described to them and they are asked if they have any high-risk conditions that might&#xD;
           affect their participation. If any issues arise, Dr. Wakai in consultation with Dr.&#xD;
           Strasburger determines whether they are appropriate to study. Informed consent will be&#xD;
           obtained at the time of study by Dr. Wakai or one of his associates. Normal subjects&#xD;
           will be invited to return for follow up sessions up to 5 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancies complicated by fetal arrhythmia and or at risk of fetal arrhythmia will be&#xD;
           recruited by Dr. Janette Strasburger, Medical College of Wisconsin. She will screen the&#xD;
           subjects, explain the procedure, counsel them, and recruit them for the study prior to&#xD;
           referring them on to Dr. Wakai. These patients are already being clinically evaluated&#xD;
           and it is not anticipated that advertising for participants or posting of flyers will be&#xD;
           required. In addition to patients from Madison, Milwaukee and Chicago, high-risk&#xD;
           patients from across the country may be enrolled in the study. In these cases the&#xD;
           patient's physician has contacted the investigators because he/she believes fMCG may be&#xD;
           beneficial for clinical care. These high-risk subjects are screened for appropriateness&#xD;
           by Dr. Strasburger, who will consult with the patient's physician in order to determine&#xD;
           whether the risk of travel to Madison is reasonable. Informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
           at the time of study at the Biomagnetism Lab by Dr. Wakai or one of his associates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are no inclusion or exclusion criteria based on race or ethnicity. Informed&#xD;
           Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent requirements and regulations relating to informed consent will be&#xD;
           followed. Informed consent will be obtained prior to performing any study-related&#xD;
           activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to signing a consent form, subjects are given a tour of the lab, the experimental&#xD;
           procedures are described to them, and their questions are answered. For all subjects,&#xD;
           consent and HIPAA authorization will be obtained by the PI or one of his representatives&#xD;
           at the time of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject is asked to remove all metal and magnetic objects (e.g. watches, glasses,&#xD;
      jewelry, coins) from her person and change into a patient gown. The subject lies on a patient&#xD;
      table in a magnetically shielded room throughout the study. An intercom system allows verbal&#xD;
      communication at all times and the subject can be observed through an aperture in the room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Acquisition&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound. An ultrasound exam will be performed by Dr. Strasburger to assess the heart&#xD;
      rhythm of the fetus. The exam will be performed according American Society of&#xD;
      Echocardiography (ASE) standards for fetal arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMCG recording. The SQUID detector is placed over the maternal abdomen near the location of&#xD;
      the fetal heart. Several 10-minute recordings are made, repositioning the detector between&#xD;
      recordings,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMCG&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the recordings are digitally filtered to band-limit the signal, signal processing&#xD;
      techniques are applied to remove maternal interference. Maternal heart rate is evaluated. The&#xD;
      fetal QRS complexes are detected using autocorrelation. Fetal heart rate tracings are&#xD;
      calculated from the RR intervals, and actogram tracings are derived from the instantaneous&#xD;
      amplitude of the QRS complex, which changes in response to fetal trunk movement. Averaged&#xD;
      fMCG waveforms are computed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The data are organized&#xD;
      into a report. The reports consist of 1) fetal heart rate and actogram tracings, 2) averaged&#xD;
      fMCG waveforms, and 3) fMCG rhythm strips. Rhythm interpretation and clinical diagnosis is&#xD;
      based on assessment of these data. The fetal heart rate tracings are used to identify periods&#xD;
      of abnormal heart rate, corresponding to bradycardia, tachycardia, or ectopy. The fetal heart&#xD;
      rate tracings and actograms can be used to assess heart rate reactivity, which is an&#xD;
      association between fetal heart rate acceleration and fetal movement. The fetal heart rate&#xD;
      tracings can also be used to assess fetal heart rate variability with high precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The averaged waveforms are used to measure waveform intervals-PR, QRS, QTc-which can be used&#xD;
      to detect abnormalities in AV conduction, ventricular conduction, and repolarization. The&#xD;
      intervals are defined the same way as for the ECG: PR interval is measured from the onset of&#xD;
      the P-wave to the onset of the QRS complex; QRS interval measures the duration of the QRS&#xD;
      complex; QT interval is measured from the onset of the QRS complex to the termination of the&#xD;
      T-wave; and the corrected QT interval, QTc, corrects the QT interval for heart rate by&#xD;
      dividing by the square root of the RR interval, measured in seconds. The intervals are&#xD;
      compared with historical norms. The rhythm strips are used to diagnose rhythm abnormalities&#xD;
      in a similar way as an ECG, based on the timing and morphology of the waveform components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For fetal arrhythmia and other high-risk subjects, the results will be interpreted by Dr.&#xD;
      Strasburger, who sends the report to and discusses the results with the referring physician.&#xD;
      In order to protect the confidentiality of the subject, the data will be sent in electronic&#xD;
      files labeled with an identification number, but the referring physician and Drs. Strasburger&#xD;
      will be made aware of the identity of the subject (patient).&#xD;
