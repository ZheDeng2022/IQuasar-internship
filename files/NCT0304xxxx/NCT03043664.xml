    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with non-resectable, recurrent, or metastatic well or moderately&#xD;
      differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two stages: 1) Safety Run-In and 2) Expanded Cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety run-in: The first stage will include a safety run-in of 6 patients treated with&#xD;
           pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous (IV) every 3 weeks and lanreotide depot 90mg&#xD;
           subcutaneous (SQ) every 3 weeks. Up to 6 patients at the Duke Cancer Institute will be&#xD;
           accrued at the starting dose level. If one or less subject meets treatment-related&#xD;
           discontinuation criteria (as specified in the protocol) during Cycle 1, then the study&#xD;
           will proceed to the second stage, Expanded Cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Expanded Cohort: Patients will be treated with pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3 weeks and&#xD;
           lanreotide depot 90mg SQ every 3 weeks as determined by the Safety Run-In Cohort.&#xD;

             (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;

             participate, in the opinion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation&#xD;

             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;
             through 120 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;

             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study drug regimen. Seasonal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however&#xD;
