  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      YH25448 is an oral, highly potent, mutant-selective and irreversible EGFR Tyrosine-kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors (TKIs) targets both the T790M mutation and activating EGFR mutations while sparing&#xD;
      wild type-EGFR. YH25448 is expected to beneficial for the NSCLC patients with brain&#xD;
      metastasis due to good blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration property as well as for the&#xD;
      treatment of primary lung lesion and extracranial lesions. This study will be conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of YH25448 in locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first time in patient study primarily designed to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and efficacy of YH25448 in in patients with EGFR mutation positive (EGFRm+)&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC with or without asymptomatic brain metastasis who progressed following prior&#xD;
      therapy with an EGFR TKIs agent. This study is composed of 3 parts; part A is a dose&#xD;
      escalation phase, part B is a dose expansion phase and part C is a dose extension phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In dose escalation phase, YH25448 will be escalated to reach either a maximum tolerated or&#xD;
      absorbable dose in patients as defined by dose-limiting toxicity in NSCLC patients who&#xD;
      progressed following prior EGFR TKIs treatment to evaluate the safety and tolerability. In&#xD;
      dose expansion phase, further safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic(PK) and efficacy will be&#xD;
      evaluated at each dose level(s) of dose escalation phase in NSCLC patients who progressed&#xD;
      following prior EGFR TKIs treatment and harbouring confirmed T790M mutation. In dose&#xD;
      extension phase, additional 2 cohorts (2nd line therapy cohort, 1st line therapy cohort) will&#xD;
      be enrolled to further assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of YH25448 at the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended dose (RD) defined through dose escalation phase&#xD;
      and dose expansion phase. Results of these studies will serve as the evidence for further&#xD;
      clinical development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also characterize the metabolite(s) profile of YH25448 and determine PK of&#xD;
      its metabolite(s) in biological samples if necessary. Also, exploratory correlation between&#xD;
      biomarker profiles and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics will be analyzed.&#xD;
