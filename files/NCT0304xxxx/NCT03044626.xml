      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Written informed consent and any locally-required authorization (EU Data Privacy&#xD;
        Directive in the EU) obtained from the subject prior to performing any protocol-related&#xD;
        procedures, including screening evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study&#xD;
        including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age ≥ 18 years at time of study entry. 4. ECOG performance status 0-1. 5. Patients with&#xD;
        measurable disease (at least one uni-dimensionally measurable target lesion by CT-scan or&#xD;
        MRI) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) are eligible.&#xD;
        For patients in group A, non-measurable and measurable lesions may be chosen for&#xD;
        irradiation. However, in order to allow for evaluation of abscopal effects, patients in&#xD;
        group A must have at least one measurable lesion beside the lesion planned to be&#xD;
        irradiated. Lesions planned to be irradiated may not be defined as a measurable target&#xD;
        lesion. Radiographic tumor assessment must be performed within 28 days before initiation of&#xD;
        study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Target Lesions may be located in a previously irradiated field if there is documented&#xD;
        (radiographic) disease progression in that site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in 2nd-line and&#xD;
        3rd-line treatment and&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. no necessity of radiotherapy or&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. the necessity of radiotherapy of a metastatic bone lesion or soft tissue lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with intrathoracic metastases or intrathoracic progressive disease will&#xD;
                  be included if radiotherapy of the lung parenchyma is NOT required&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with symptomatic brain metastases are eligible if metastases have been&#xD;
                  treated and treatment has been completed at least 12 weeks before inclusion in&#xD;
                  this study for group B and 2 weeks for group A. Moreover, there must be no&#xD;
                  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression within 28 days prior to&#xD;
                  the first dose of nivolumab administration. There must also be no requirement for&#xD;
                  immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone&#xD;
                  equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration. Patients&#xD;
                  with stable/asymptomatic brain metastases that do not require local therapy with&#xD;
                  irradiation (whole brain irradiation or stereotactic brain irradiation) can be&#xD;
                  included. In ambiguous cases, consultation with the LKP or his/her delegate is&#xD;
                  advised.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  8. Patients who will receive study therapy after acceptable prior therapy as&#xD;
                  specified below are eligible: i. Patients who will receive study therapy as&#xD;
                  2nd-line or 3rd-line of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Patients must have experienced disease recurrence or progression during or&#xD;
                       after one prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy regimen for advanced or&#xD;
                       metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       First line therapy is defined as therapy used to treat advanced disease.&#xD;
                       Each subsequent line of therapy is preceded by disease progression. A switch&#xD;
                       of an agent within a regimen in order to manage toxicity does not define the&#xD;
                       start of a new line of therapy. Subjects must have received at least 2&#xD;
                       cycles of platinum doublet based chemotherapy before discontinuation for&#xD;
                       toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       Experimental therapies when given as separate regimen are considered as&#xD;
                       separate line of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       Maintenance therapy following platinum doublet-based chemotherapy is not&#xD;
                       considered as a separate regimen of therapy and could comprise continuation&#xD;
                       of one or more of the agents used in the first-line therapy regimen or&#xD;
                       switch to another non cross-resistant agent. The initiation of maintenance&#xD;
                       therapy requires the lack of progressive disease with front-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       Treatment given for locally advanced disease is not considered as a line of&#xD;
                       therapy for advanced disease. Subjects with recurrent disease &gt; 6 months&#xD;
                       after platinum-containing adjuvant, neoadjuvant or definitive chemoradiation&#xD;
                       therapy given for locally advanced disease, who also subsequently progressed&#xD;
                       during or after a platinum doublet-based regimen given to treat the&#xD;
                       recurrence, are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Patients who received platinum-containing adjuvant, neoadjuvant or&#xD;
                       definitive chemoradiation therapy given for locally advanced disease, and&#xD;
                       developed recurrent (local or metastatic) disease within 6 months of&#xD;
                       completing therapy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       Adjuvant or neoadjuvant platinum-doublet chemotherapy (after surgery and/or&#xD;
                       radiation therapy) followed by recurrent or metastatic disease within 6&#xD;
                       months of completing therapy is considered as first line therapy for&#xD;
                       advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  9. A formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block (archival or&#xD;
                  recent) or a minimum of 15 unstained slides of tumor sample (2-3 µm sections,&#xD;
                  slices must be recent and collected on slides provided by the sponsor) must be&#xD;
                  available for biomarker (PD-L1) evaluation. Biopsy should be excisional,&#xD;
                  incisional or core needle. Fine needle aspiration is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  10. Prior therapies and surgeries are allowed if completed 2 weeks for minor&#xD;
                  surgery (group A and B) or 12 weeks for any previous radiotherapy for group B,&#xD;
                  respectively prior to start of treatment and patient recovered from toxic&#xD;
                  effects. For group A, any prior radiotherapy not involving the lungs must be&#xD;
                  completed 2 weeks prior to start of treatment. A prior radiotherapy involving the&#xD;
                  lungs must be completed 12 weeks prior to start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  11. Subjects must have recovered from the effects of major surgery or significant&#xD;
                  traumatic injury at least 14 days before the first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  12. Adequate blood count, liver-enzymes, and renal function (obtained no later&#xD;
                  than 14 days prior to start of treatment): WBC ≥ 2000/μL Neutrophils ≥ 1500/μL&#xD;
                  Platelets ≥ 100 x103/μL Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
             Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 40 mL/min (if using the&#xD;
             Cockcroft-Gault formula below):&#xD;
&#xD;

             mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
             Male CrCl = ((140 - age in years) x weight in kg x 1.00) / (72 x serum creatinine in&#xD;
             mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
             AST/ALT ≤ 3 x ULN Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome,&#xD;
             who can have total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
             13. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of&#xD;
             contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30&#xD;
             days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last&#xD;
             dose of nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
             14. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test (minimum&#xD;
             sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of&#xD;
             nivolumab.&#xD;

             15. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a&#xD;
             failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually&#xD;
             active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31&#xD;
             weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Women who are not of&#xD;
             childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as&#xD;
             azoospermic men do not require contraception).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Previous malignancy (other than NSCLC), which either progresses or requires&#xD;
                  active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Subjects with previous malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers, and the&#xD;
                  following in situ cancers: bladder, gastric, colon, cervical/dysplasia,&#xD;
