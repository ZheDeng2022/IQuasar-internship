  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced rectal or rectosigmoid cancer staged cT3 CRM-negative with MRI&#xD;
      will receive 6 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment with mFOLFOX6 (Arm A) vs. mFOLFOX6 +&#xD;
      aflibercept (Arm B) followed by surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer are generally recommended to receive&#xD;
      preoperative radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy. The advantage of combined-modality therapy in&#xD;
      rectal cancer is that it has reduced local pelvic recurrence - a dreaded and morbid event -&#xD;
      to rates of about 10%. There is good quality evidence that preoperative radiotherapy reduces&#xD;
      local recurrence but there is little if any impact on overall survival. One strategy to&#xD;
      reduce the distant recurrence rate, and thereby increase the cure rate, would be to introduce&#xD;
      systemic treatment earlier to prevent dissemination of micrometastases. The present trial is&#xD;
      designed to compare two neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens in patients with non-metastatic T3&#xD;
      CRM-negative rectal cancers using quality-controlled MRI of the pelvis as a main inclusion&#xD;
      criterion. This strategy is believed to reduce acute and long-term toxicity caused by&#xD;
      preoperative radiotherapy and to administer effective systemic chemotherapy early in the&#xD;
      course of disease as neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
