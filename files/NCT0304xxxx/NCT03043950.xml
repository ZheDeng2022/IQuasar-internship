      A safety and efficacy study of first line therapy with Vectibix® in combination with FOLFIRI&#xD;
      or FOLFOX to validate a prognostic score in adult patients with RAS wild-type metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer in a real world setting (VALIDATE)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, prospective, open-label, single-arm, 3-cohort, multicenter&#xD;
      study in Germany and Austria. In total, 606 patients will be enrolled in approx. 120&#xD;
      oncological sites (office-based medical oncologists, oncology outpatient-centers, and&#xD;
      university hospitals) in a time period of 48 months. Of these, 202 patients with high risk,&#xD;
      202 patients with intermediate risk, and 202 patients with low risk, as a priori assessed by&#xD;
      the metastatic colorectal cancer prognostic score (mCCS), will be included. Overall survival&#xD;
      of the pre-defined prognostic groups will be analyzed as primary endpoint to validate the&#xD;
      mCCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have been scheduled to receive first line combination therapy with panitumumab and&#xD;
      FOLFIRI or FOLFOX according to the current SmPC valid for Germany and Austria, respectively.&#xD;
      Data on efficacy in terms of tumor response evaluation / survival and safety (ADRs) will be&#xD;
      collected during first line therapy. A subset of patients participating in the 'VALIDATE-PRO'&#xD;
      project (n=303) will be assessed for general and health-related quality of life with patient&#xD;
      questionnaires. Biomarker status beyond RAS will be collected at baseline. The documentation&#xD;
      of defined patient data including survival will continue until the end of the individual&#xD;
      study participation which is latest 36 months after last patient in. The end of study will be&#xD;
      at latest at 36 months after last patient in (LPI).&#xD;
