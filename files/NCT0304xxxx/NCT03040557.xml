  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The plantar fasciitis (PF), most frequent injury of the musculoskeletal system, is the main&#xD;
      cause of heel pain and functional disability. The mechanical stress, stretching of plantar&#xD;
      fascia consequently the overload on the feet, is a major intrinsic causes the onset of FP,&#xD;
      especially when exposed to repetitive activities, such as walking. Another extrinsic&#xD;
      etiologic factor of great influence is inadequate shoes that can lead to a deterioration and&#xD;
      progression of the disease. One of the great difficulties of their conservative treatment is&#xD;
      long rehabilitation period, lasting on average 10 to 18 months. Among them, the insoles stand&#xD;
      out as one of the effective mechanical treatments to improve the immediate pain symptoms, in&#xD;
      the short term. Other literary evidence, not specific to FP, has shown the benefits, the&#xD;
      short and long term, a flexible footwear promotes more flexible feet and overload reduction.&#xD;
      Objective: Verify therapeutic effect in the long term, a flexible footwear and low cost and&#xD;
      orthopedic insole on the clinical aspect, functional and biomechanics of the gait of women&#xD;
      with acute FP and chronic with presence of heel spur. It will be conducted a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with blinded evaluator, in which 79 women with plantar fasciitis will be&#xD;
      randomized and allocated to the intervention group with minimalist flexible footwear (MFG,&#xD;
      acute n=12 and chronic=15) or the intervention group with orthopedic insole (COIG, acute n=14&#xD;
      and chronic n=14) or control group (CG, n=24). The intervention will have duration six&#xD;
      months, six hours a day, seven days a week (42 hours/week). For all groups will be allowed to&#xD;
      use pain medication support (paracetamol 500 mg) with a maximum dose of two grams daily. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be the symptom of pain verified by visual analogue scale (VAS), the&#xD;
      inability to areas of the feet by the total score of the FFI (Foot Function Index), health&#xD;
      feet by FHSQ-Br questionnaire (Foot Health Questionnaire Status) and the distance traveled by&#xD;
      the six-minute walk test (6MWT). The secondary: plantar pressure and ground reaction force&#xD;
      during gait, paracetamol consumption and the joint angles of the lower limbs. The effects of&#xD;
      time (Start, 3 and 6 months), group (GIC and GIP CG) and interaction (time and group) are&#xD;
      calculated by means of ANOVA case-wise two factors. A 5% alpha to significant differences and&#xD;
      Cohen coefficient for describing the size effect of the intervention is assumed.&#xD;

      A prospective controlled study with random allocation. The independent variable (group) has&#xD;
      three levels: intervention with flexible footwear, intervention with custom orthopedic&#xD;
      insoles and control without intervention, only with medical conservative treatment. This&#xD;
      independent variable is related to the set of dependent variables stemmed from clinical,&#xD;
      functional and biomechanical data. All groups, both will use the intervention minimalist&#xD;
      flexible footwear (MFG), as the intervention group insole (COIG) and the group that did not&#xD;
      receive intervention (GC) shall consist of patients with PF (plantar fasciitis) in different&#xD;
      stages of the disease.These will be required to fit in all the pre-established criteria for&#xD;
      diagnosis of the disease confirmed by physical examination, X-ray and ultrasound. Patients in&#xD;
      the group with chronic fasciitis plantar associated with heel spur should necessarily present&#xD;
      themselves diagnosed radiographically by the doctor that came in the Rheumatology Clinic of&#xD;
      the University. All participants will be informed of the procedures in this research through&#xD;
      a free and informed consent form, prepared in accordance with Resolution 466/12 of the&#xD;
      National Health Board. The eligibility criteria for this study will be: female volunteers&#xD;
      aged between 30 and 50 years, body mass index (BMI) less than 35 kg / m2, no history of any&#xD;
      surgical procedure on knees, ankles and hips or muscle injury in the last 6 months and no&#xD;
      neurological and rheumatologic disease diagnosed. Furthermore, they may not show difference&#xD;
      in length of the lower limbs greater than 1 cm and rigid hallux and performing some kind of&#xD;
      conservative treatment for PF, except drug. Patients should be able to walk independently for&#xD;
      at least 6 hours a day without the aid of orthotics / canes to perform their activities of&#xD;
      daily living. There may also have prostheses and / or orthoses in the lower limbs. Patients&#xD;
      may not have received corticosteroid injection in the heel in previous periods of three and&#xD;
      six months, respectively. In addition to these criteria, patients may not present: joint&#xD;
      instability ankle (positive test results of the medial ligament and lateral), dementia or&#xD;
      inability to provide information consistent.It will be conducted a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial with blinded evaluator, in which 75 women with plantar fasciitis will be randomized and&#xD;
      allocated to the intervention group with flexible footwear (MFG, acute n=15 and chronic=15)&#xD;
      or the intervention group with orthopedic insole (COIG, acute n=15 and chronic n=15) or&#xD;
      control group (CG, n=15). The intervention will have duration six months, six hours a day,&#xD;
      seven days a week (42 hours/week). For all groups will be allowed to use pain medication&#xD;
      support (paracetamol 500 mg) with a maximum dose of two grams daily. The primary outcome will&#xD;
      be the symptom of pain verified by visual analogue scale (VAS), the inability to areas of the&#xD;
      feet by the total score of the FFI (Foot Function Index), health feet by FHSQ-Br&#xD;
      questionnaire (Foot Health Questionnaire Status) and the distance traveled by the six-minute&#xD;
      walk test (6MWT). The secondary: plantar pressure and ground reaction force during gait,&#xD;
      paracetamol consumption and the joint angles of the lower limbs. The effects of time (Start,&#xD;
      3 and 6 months), group (GIC and GIP CG) and interaction (time and group) are calculated by&#xD;
      means of ANOVA case-wise two factors. A 5% alpha to significant differences and Cohen&#xD;
      coefficient for describing the size effect of the intervention is assumed.&#xD;
