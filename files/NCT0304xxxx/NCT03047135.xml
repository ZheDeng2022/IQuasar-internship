  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Olaparib has demonstrated preliminary efficacy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate&#xD;
      cancer. In a trial of 49 evaluable patients treated with olaparib, 11 / 49 experienced a PSA&#xD;
      response, and every patient with a radiographic response also had a PSA5 response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten of 11 responders had mutations in DNA repair genes. While PARP inhibition is showing&#xD;
      promise in these initial studies, reserving its use for end-stage patients may not be the&#xD;
      optimal timing for olaparib therapy in some patients. In addition, PARP enzymes function in&#xD;
      roles beyond DNA repair, and specifically for prostate cancer are involved transcriptional&#xD;
      regulation of the androgen receptor. PARP inhibition has not been tested in earlier disease&#xD;
      states for prostate cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is an open-label single-arm phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are those with non-metastatic biochemically-recurrent prostate cancer and a&#xD;
      PSADT of ≤6 months and a minimum PSA of 1.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, patients will be treated with olaparib at the established dose of 300mg&#xD;
      tablets by mouth twice daily. Patients will be followed monthly with clinic visits, safety&#xD;
      labs (including CBC w/diff, Comp), PSA, and toxicity assessments. Treatment [with a minimum&#xD;
      drug exposure of 12 weeks] will be continued until PSA doubling from study entry (confirmed&#xD;
      with another measurement at least 4 weeks later), development of radiographic metastatic&#xD;
      disease, or toxicity requiring drug cessation. CT scans and NM bone scans will be performed&#xD;
      every 6 months for patients remaining on olaparib treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll up to 50 subjects. The study design will employ a stepwise adaptive&#xD;
      statistical plan, derived in part from Biankin et al, Nature 2015 Oct 15;526(7573):361-70.&#xD;
      The design is adapted from a multi-stage design, with interim stopping rules to determine&#xD;
      futility or need for enrichment of the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will initiate with a two-stage design in an unselected population. The assumptions&#xD;
      for the trial of the unselected population are: null hypothesis of 0.1 PSA response rate and&#xD;
      alternative hypothesis of 0.3 for the unselected population. The first stage is 20 subjects.&#xD;
      If ≤2 subjects responds in the first stage, then unselected population study is halted for&#xD;
      futility and an assessment of DNA mutations present in the initial cohort will be undertaken.&#xD;
      If less than 3 subjects with a known/suspected deleterious mutation in the following genes&#xD;
      (ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51C,&#xD;
      RAD51D, or other DNA repair genes) have been accrued in the first stage, then the trial will&#xD;
      proceed with enrichment. If 3 or more subjects with known/suspected deleterious mutation in&#xD;
      the genes of interest have been accrued, then the trial will proceed with enrichment, as long&#xD;
      as the response rate in that subset of subjects is ≥20%. In the case that 3 or more subjects&#xD;
      have been accrued, yet the response rate in that subset is &lt;20%, then the trial is halted for&#xD;
      futility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, if ≥3 subjects among the first 20 respond, then additional 10 unselected subjects&#xD;
      are accrued. If ≥6 subjects respond out of 30 in the unselected population after the second&#xD;
      stage, then the null hypothesis is rejected in the unselected population and broad efficacy&#xD;
      will be concluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial proceeds to complete accrual of 50 subjects in order to better estimate PSA&#xD;
      response rate and strengthen data for correlative studies. If &lt;6 respond, then the null&#xD;
      hypothesis is not rejected. Again, if less than 3 subjects with a known/suspected deleterious&#xD;
      mutation in the following genes (ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL,&#xD;
      PALB2, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, or other DNA repair genes) have been accrued in the&#xD;
      first and second stage combined, then the trial will proceed with enrichment. If 3 or more&#xD;
      subjects with those mutations have been accrued, then enrichment will again proceed as long&#xD;
      as the response rate in that subject of subjects is ≥20%.&#xD;
