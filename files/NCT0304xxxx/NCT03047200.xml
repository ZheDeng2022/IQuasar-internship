      The purpose of this study is to further test islet cell transplant in patients who have had a&#xD;
      kidney transplant. This study will also evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      anti-rejection medications used to prevent rejection after your islet cell transplant.&#xD;

      Diabetes mellitus (DM) type 1 is a disease with significant social and economic impact. The&#xD;
      prevalence of the disease in the United States is about 120,000 in individuals aged 19 or&#xD;
      less and 300,000 to 500,000 at all ages and 150 million worldwide. There are 30,000 new cases&#xD;
      diagnosed each year in the United States. DM is one of the most frequent chronic diseases in&#xD;
      children in the United States 1. The cost of treatment and complications of this disease in&#xD;
      the United States is 90 billion dollars a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date there are no mechanical devices able to effectively adjust the dose of insulin&#xD;
      injected according to the serum glucose levels in patients with DM. This leads to&#xD;
      less-than-perfect sugar control, with episodes of hypoglycemia which can be dangerous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emerging alternative to whole organ pancreas transplantation is pancreatic islet cell&#xD;
      transplantation (ICT). The process is based on the enzymatic isolation of the pancreatic&#xD;
      islets of Langerhans from an organ procured from a cadaveric donor 13-15; the islets obtained&#xD;
      are injected into the liver of the recipient via percutaneous catheterization of the portal&#xD;
      venous system 16. This procedure allows the selective transplantation of the&#xD;
      insulin-producing cell population avoiding open surgery as well as the transplantation of the&#xD;
      duodenum and the exocrine pancreas and their related morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial efforts with ICT had only modest results. The immunosuppression regimen was&#xD;
      similar to the one used in solid organ transplantation, based on high dose steroids and&#xD;
      calcineurin inhibitors - both agents with diabetogenic effects. The results improved markedly&#xD;
      with the changes in the manipulations of the islets, and the change in immunosuppression thus&#xD;
      avoiding the higher doses of steroids and using sirolimus, tacrolimus and daclizumab&#xD;
      initiated by the investigators group at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. Their&#xD;
      protocol requires in general two islet cell infusions in order to attain the critical cell&#xD;
      mass necessary to achieve insulin-independency. The changes in treatment were adopted as the&#xD;
      Edmonton Protocol, which is used in several transplant centers, worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isolation of the islets from donor pancreata will occur in the Baylor University Medical&#xD;
      Center Islet Cell Processing Laboratory (ICPL). The islet cell infusion is performed in the&#xD;
      Interventional Radiology Suite at Baylor University Medical Center or Baylor All Saints&#xD;
      Medical Center by an interventional radiologist. The procedure takes place in a suite&#xD;
      designed for invasive procedures using sterile technique with access to general anesthesia if&#xD;
      necessary. Following the procedure the patient is observed in the Interventional Radiology&#xD;
      recovery area for as long as necessary as determined by a Physician and then transferred to&#xD;
      the Transplant Service for an overnight stay. After recovery, the patient is admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital on the Transplant Service for a 1-2 day observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of the research in the ICT is centered on the development of a safe and effective&#xD;
      procedure that will eventually replace surgical pancreas transplantation together with an&#xD;
      ideal immunosuppressive regimen that provides safe and effective prevention against&#xD;
      rejection, while minimizing the adverse events associated that negatively impact transplant&#xD;
      recipient's quality of life.&#xD;
