  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is a common disease that causes joint pain, stiffness, and movement&#xD;
      limitation. Nearly 50% in those 75 years and above are affected. In Taiwan, the reported&#xD;
      prevalence was more than 6000 per year. The cause of pain is joint instability and structure&#xD;
      changed, including hyaline articular cartilage lost, bony remodeling, capsular stretching and&#xD;
      periartcular muscle weakness. Current guidelines for treatment of symptomatic knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis include exercise, anti-inflammatory drugs, transcutaneous electrical&#xD;
      stimulation(TENS) and magnetic fields(MF) which reduce pain and improve the patient's quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, conservative therapies and oral supplements have been evaluated but are without&#xD;
      clear efficacy. Prolotherapy is an injection therapy for chronic musculoskeletal pain. One of&#xD;
      the hypotheses is stimulating local healing and current study demonstrated clinical benefit&#xD;
      for pain and improvement of function. The effects of multi-point injections were more&#xD;
      pronounced in several studies than single-point injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracorporeal shock wave is common treatment for kidney stones, has been widely used in soft&#xD;
      tissue diseases, such as calcified tendon lesions and plantar fasciitis. The theory of&#xD;
      extracorporeal shock wave is energy of high-frequency vibration caused destruction of stones&#xD;
      and other hard material and by increasing the rate of vascular regeneration in the injured&#xD;
      area and increasing the rate of autologous tissue repair, possible biological processes&#xD;
      include increased mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and differentiation, slowing the&#xD;
      inflammatory response and antimicrobial efficacy. Current studies have shown equivalent&#xD;
      clinical outcomes on calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy among extracorporeal shock wave&#xD;
      therapy, sono-guided acupuncture and arthroscopic surgery and the extracorporeal shock wave&#xD;
      has the advantage of non-invasive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking the advantages of non-invasive treatment of extracorporeal shockwave. We want to&#xD;
      design a randomized control trial by multi-point shockwave therapy and physical therapy&#xD;
      compared with placebo shockwave therapy and physical therapy. Two randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) reported improvement in outcomes in response to shockwave therapy but were not&#xD;
      methodologically rigorous. The investigators therefore conducted a two-arm RCT to assess the&#xD;
      hypothesis that adults with symptomatic knee pain receiving shockwave therapy will report&#xD;
      greater improvement in knee-related quality-of-life than sham shockwave therapy.&#xD;
