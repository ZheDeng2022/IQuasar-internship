  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is expected to provide novel data regarding potential structural and functional&#xD;
      changes of the thyroid gland in morbidly obese adults following significant weight loss&#xD;
      through bariatric surgery. These data will complement evidence from epidemiological studies&#xD;
      regarding the association of obesity and alterations in thyroid function. Potentially this&#xD;
      study may justify further longer-term studies regarding the effects of weight gain and/or&#xD;
      weight loss on the morphology of the thyroid gland and could help to form recommendations&#xD;
      regarding follow-up investigations for the thyroid in morbidly obese patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alterations in thyroid function are reported in obesity. Thyroid hormones and&#xD;
      thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations have been variously described as normal,&#xD;
      elevated, or low in morbidly obese patients compared with normal weight controls. However, it&#xD;
      is a common observation that a significant proportion of patients with morbid obesity display&#xD;
      slightly increased serum levels of TSH, while even relatively mild elevations of serum TSH&#xD;
      are associated with an increase in the occurrence of obesity. Of note, abnormalities in&#xD;
      thyroid function and TSH mostly normalize after weight loss, suggesting that these&#xD;
      biochemical alterations are reversible. Despite uncertainty regarding the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms, it has been suggested that neither autoimmunity nor iodine deficiency seems to&#xD;
      play a critical role. Several alternative mechanisms leading to hyperthyrotropinemia have&#xD;
      been hypothesized, which include impaired feedback due to decreased number of&#xD;
      triiodothyronine (T3) receptors in the hypothalamus, and variations in peripheral deiodinase&#xD;
      activity. Leptin, in addition to regulating body weight and satiation, has also been shown to&#xD;
      mediate the production of pro-TRH in cultured fetal rat hypothalamic neurons. Partial&#xD;
      regulation of TSH by leptin has been also reported in humans. In addition, peripheral thyroid&#xD;
      hormone metabolism appears to be reflected by the ratio of T3 to reverse T3 (rT3)&#xD;
      (T3/rT3-ratio). We have shown that the T3/rT3-ratio is significantly increased in insulin&#xD;
      resistant patients compared to their insulin sensitive partners despite comparable TSH&#xD;
      values. Given that obesity is strongly associated with insulin resistance, and thyroid&#xD;
      hormones are known to modulate carbohydrate metabolism, e.g. by affecting cellular glucose&#xD;
      uptake, possible changes in the T3/fT3 ratio following weight loss after bariatric surgery&#xD;
      could be of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from cross-sectional studies further indicate that the thyroid structure of obese&#xD;
      patients can be also affected, independent of the existence of autoimmune thyroiditis as&#xD;
      indicated by the presence of auto-antibodies such as TPO. Ultrasound (US) scans are able to&#xD;
      accurately characterize the echographic structure of thyroid tissue, in addition to&#xD;
      estimation of thyroid volume and identification of non-palpable thyroid nodules. The typical&#xD;
      normal thyroid parenchyma has a distinct high echo density due to the follicle structure,&#xD;
      which contrasts well with tissue of the collar muscles. The interface between thyroid cells&#xD;
      and the colloid exhibits elevated acoustic impedance, causing high-frequency acoustic waves&#xD;
      to be reflected back to the US probe. However, in autoimmune thyroid diseases both&#xD;
      lymphocytic infiltration and disruption of normal tissue architecture cause a reduction in&#xD;
      thyroid echogenicity, whereas other tissues close by such as muscle tissue appear to remain&#xD;
      unaffected. Only few previous studies reported on the morphology of the thyroid gland in&#xD;
      adults with morbid obesity. Given that thyroid function has been reported to return to normal&#xD;
      after weight loss, research questions are also raised about the potential reversibility of&#xD;
      thyroid structural abnormalities following substantial weight loss in previously morbidly&#xD;
      obese patients.&#xD;
