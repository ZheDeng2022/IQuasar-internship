    <textblock>
      This study is designed to identify the best tolerated doses of [131]Iodine-MIBG and&#xD;
      [90]Yttrium-DOTATOC when co-administered to treat midgut neuroendocrine tumors. These drugs&#xD;
      (131I-MIBG, 90Y-DOTATOC) are radioactive drugs, known as radionuclide therapy. Currently, the&#xD;
      safest and best tolerated doses of these drugs (when combined together) is unknown.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      [131]Iodine-MIBG and [90]Yttrium-DOTATOC are radioactive drugs designed to treat specific&#xD;
      tumor cells. These drugs are a combination of the radiation (131-Iodine, 90-Yttrium) and a&#xD;
      protein that targets the tumor cell (MIBG or DOTATOC). Because these proteins are attracted&#xD;
      to, and stick to, the tumor, the radiation is centered in the tumors. This kills more tumor&#xD;
      cells and minimizes radiation-damage to healthy tissues, like the heart and lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two organs still absorb some of the radiation, though: bone marrow and the kidney. These&#xD;
      organs limit how much radiation can be given to tumors, but we don't know how much radiation&#xD;
      is too much. Too much radiation to bone marrow can result in anemia. Too much radiation to&#xD;
      the kidneys can result in kidney failure. From prior radiation therapies, we have a general&#xD;
      idea of how much radiation we can give safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      131I-MIBG and 90Y-DOTATOC have never been given together. We want to give them together&#xD;
      because many times, tumors are actually groups of different types of cells. This means, not&#xD;
      all the cells respond to therapy the same way. If some tumor cells survive therapy, the tumor&#xD;
      will continue to grow and eventually come back. We know some mid-gut neuroendocrine tumors&#xD;
      (NETs) have targets for DOTATOC and some other mid-gut NETs have targets for MIBG. We also&#xD;
      have now identified that some people with mid-gut NETs have different tumors: some with&#xD;
      targets for MIBG and some with targets for DOTATOC. For these people, this means treating&#xD;
      only with 131I-MIBG or 90Y-DOTATOC will not be enough to treat their cancer. They need both&#xD;
      radioactive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because we are combining these radioactive drugs, this study is known as a first-in-man&#xD;
      study. We are also using a special imaging to help us estimate the radiation dose to the bone&#xD;
      marrow and to the kidneys. This is what decides the final dose of 131I-MIBG and 90Y-DOTATOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before receiving therapy, participants will be asked to undergo imaging to verify they have&#xD;
      both MIBG and DOTATOC tumor types:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  participants are given very small doses of radioactive drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a special camera (SPECT/CT) collects images (scans)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  imaging (scans) are done over 3 calendar days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood samples are taken at that time, too, to measure the circulating amount of tracer&#xD;
           doses&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the scans show a participant has both MIBG and DOTATOC tumors, therapy is given:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a customized dose of 90Y-DOTATOC is given on day 1 of a treatment cycle. This is given&#xD;
           outpatient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a customized dose of 131I-MIBG is given on day 2 of a treatment cycle. This is given&#xD;
           inpatient (admitted to the hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  participants are monitored through blood tests to identify the side effects of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant can have up to 2 cycles of therapy. The cycles are 12 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doses for 90Y-DOTATOC and 131I-MIBG are decided based on radiation to the bone marrow and&#xD;
      radiation to the kidney. Doses are decided by how well other participants have done on this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have life long follow-up for this study. This is very important, because a study&#xD;
      like this has not been done.&#xD;
