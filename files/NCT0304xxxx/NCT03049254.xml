    <textblock>
      Arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy (AVC) is a genetic condition which affects the&#xD;
      heart and can lead to heart failure and rhythm problems, of which, sudden cardiac arrest or&#xD;
      death is the most tragic and dangerous. Diagnosis and screening of blood-relatives is very&#xD;
      difficult as the disease process can be subtle, but sufficient enough, so that the first&#xD;
      event is sudden death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mayo Clinic AVC Registry is a collaboration between Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA and&#xD;
      Papworth Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals, Cambridge, UK. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      enroll patients with a history of AVC or sudden cardiac death which may be due to AVC, from&#xD;
      the US and UK. Family members who are blood-relatives will also be invited, including those&#xD;
      who do not have the condition. Data collected include symptoms, ECG, echocardiographic, MRI,&#xD;
      Holter, loop recorder, biopsies, exercise stress testing, blood, buccal and saliva samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Discover new genes or altered genes (variants) which cause AVC&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify biomarkers which predict (2a) disease onset, (2b) disease progression, (2c) and&#xD;
           the likelihood of arrhythmia (ventricular, supra-ventricular and atrial fibrillation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlate genotype with phenotype in confirmed cases of AVC followed longitudinally&#xD;
           using clinical, electrocardiographic and imaging data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Characterize desmosomal changes in buccal mucosal cells with genotype and validate with&#xD;
           gold-standard endomyocardial biopsies&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) accounts for over 360,000 deaths in the US and 400,000 in Europe&#xD;
      per annum, including thousands under the age of 40 who die unexpectedly and without warning.&#xD;
      Whilst the majority of SCAs are triggered by heart attacks, in those under the age of 40&#xD;
      years this tends to be due to genetic heart disease, which if identified early may save lives&#xD;
      of other family members. Epidemiological and post-mortem studies have shown arrhythmogenic&#xD;
      ventricular cardiomyopathy (AVC) as a leading cause of SCA, responsible for up to 25% of&#xD;
      deaths in this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AVC is a highly clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition, which results in&#xD;
      fibro-fatty replacement of myocardium which may lead to ventricular dysfunction, heart&#xD;
      failure, electrical rhythm disturbances and SCD. Although AVC predominantly affects the right&#xD;
      ventricle (ARVC), it can affect both the right and left ventricle, or the LV in isolation&#xD;
      (ALVC) and result in a type of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with a propensity for arrhythmia&#xD;
      (aDCM). Recent reports of aDCM with a familial distribution suggests this is undiagnosed AVC,&#xD;
      reflecting heterogeneity and limited understanding. AVC is considered a disease of the&#xD;
      desmosome (cell-adhesion proteins) and this has led to identification of desmosomal mutations&#xD;
      (plakoglobin, plakophilin-2, desmoplakin, desmoglein-2 and desmocollin), mostly inherited in&#xD;
      an autosomal dominant manner with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.&#xD;
      Non-desmosomal genes have also been discovered (desmin, titin, RYR2, transforming growth&#xD;
      factor -3, transmembrane protein 43 and phospholamban). Together, these only account for&#xD;
      50-60% of known AVc-related mutations, with the remainder being genetically undetermined.&#xD;
      Additionally, multiple mutations also exist within families and within individuals further&#xD;
      compounding the complexity of AVC. Inter and intra-familial variability is inexplicable with&#xD;
      current knowledge, and suggests epigenetic and environmental factors contributing to&#xD;
      phenotype. Disease expression is highly variable even amongst members of the same family with&#xD;
      the same mutation making clinical detection and cascade screening a challenge. Finally,&#xD;
      predicting which patients are at risk of SCD who have AVC or may have AVC is difficult and&#xD;
      potentially lethal. Since SCD can be the first lethal and tragic manifestation of the&#xD;
      disease, optimizing screening strategies is of paramount importance. The long-term goals of&#xD;
      this program are to leverage our well-phenotyped cohort of patients with AVC at Mayo Clinic&#xD;
      and Papworth Hospital, University of Cambridge, , enroll others and to discover novel&#xD;
      pathogenic variants, correlate genotype with phenotype, and develop robust screening tools&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of AVC and preventing SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall hypothesis: that the onset of AVC can be reliably and accurately predicted in&#xD;
      first-degree relatives of index cases using genetic, electrocardiographic (ECG) and imaging&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1: Identify novel candidate genes and variants associated with AVC (including cases&#xD;
      involving the right, left and the dilated cardiomyopathy types). This aim will be&#xD;
      accomplished using next generation sequencing of probands-family member trios &quot;genomic&#xD;
      familial triangulation&quot; approach and an innovative bioinformatics, statistical, and systems&#xD;
      based biology approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: Correlate genotype with phenotype in confirmed cases of AVC followed longitudinally&#xD;
      using clinical, ECG and imaging data to 2a. predict disease onset; 2b. predict disease&#xD;
      progression; and 2c. predict the likelihood of arrhythmia (ventricular, supra-ventricular and&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #3: Combine registries from the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA and Papworth Hospital,&#xD;
      University of Cambridge, UK, to study longitudinal data and correlate genotype with&#xD;
      phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #4: Characterize desmosomal changes in buccal mucosal cells with genotype and validate&#xD;
      with gold-standard endomyocardial biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB and Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust for&#xD;
      collation of existing data to develop the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New directions for the project will seek appropriate approval by the IRB of each site in due&#xD;
      course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are already seen at Mayo Clinic Rochester and Papworth Hospital sites will be&#xD;
      enrolled, provided research authorization is active. A HIPPA waiver has been approved as the&#xD;
      registry collates existing data. Standard Mayo Clinic policy is to inform patients that&#xD;
      clinical data can be utilized for research purposes, and patients are asked to specifically&#xD;
      decline research authorization if they wish to opt out. A similar system is in place at&#xD;
      Papworth Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For specific aims which require blood or other bio-specimens for the biobank, a separate IRB&#xD;
      will be utilized and this requires a signed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data includes but is not limited to the following, at index presentation or&#xD;
      screening visit for first-degree relatives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination findings including features suggestive of cardio-cutaneous syndromes etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family history of at least 3 generations. An online tool will be utilized for generating&#xD;
           a pedigree (http://www.progenygenetics.com/online-pedigree)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serial ECG data (12-lead, signal-averaged and Brugada protocols)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous ECG monitoring data (Holter, extended-Holter, event recorders, implantable&#xD;
           loop recorders etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging data (echocardiography, cardiac MRI, cardiac CT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiopulmonary exercise testing or exercise stress testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires on exercise capacity, activities of daily living (these will be approved&#xD;
           by the IRB if self-completed by patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac catheterization data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Existing genotyping data (including methods used)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Where available, endomyocardial biopsy data&#xD;
&#xD;
      For clinical follow-up visits and screening follow-up of first-degree relatives, in addition&#xD;
      to those test above, the following will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac implantable electronic devices data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac electrophysiology studies, and where catheter ablation delivered, this will be&#xD;
           recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biobank for genotyping and novel variant discovery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current guidelines recommend genetic testing for index cases and blood-relatives. Where this&#xD;
      is performed and available, this will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probands and their blood-relatives will be invited to participate in this optional component&#xD;
      of the study. Blood, saliva and buccal scrapings will be collected from probands and blood&#xD;
      relatives, to identify current pathogenic variants associated with AVC, and to discover novel&#xD;
      variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biobank for novel biomarker discovery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be stored at baseline and subsequent visits to test for known blood-biomarkers of&#xD;
      disease progression (such as high-sensitivity cardiac troponins, natriuretic peptides,&#xD;
      high-sensitivity CRP and cytokines). Blood will also be stored for high throughput 'omics&#xD;
      (transcriptomics, metabolomics and proteomics) to identify novel biomarkers which reflect&#xD;
      disease progression, prognostication and crucially help illuminate new biological pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual Clinical Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients with AVC are followed-up annually or more frequently dependent upon symptoms.&#xD;
      At each follow-up an ECG and/or Holter is usually performed. The investigators will ensure&#xD;
      each site performs this consistently. Data generated will be used for the registry. In&#xD;
      addition, investigators may contact patients by telephone to assess symptoms (following IRB&#xD;
      approval).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up at every 3-year interval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical guidelines for screening first-degree relatives recommend follow-up approximately&#xD;
      every 3 years, as phenotype expression can be delayed (with the exception of familial cases&#xD;
      where a pathogenic variant has been identified, and the blood-relative is negative). Thus,&#xD;
      this time period has been chosen for subsequent follow-up visits, where patients will be&#xD;
      re-assessed by 2010 Task Force Criteria for evidence of AVC. This follow-up visit will&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG (12-lead and signal-averaged)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Holter monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat cardiac MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise testing (CPET or treadmill)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is our objective to continue this registry indefinitely, in order to capture adequate&#xD;
      event rates for valid and accurate modelling to predict disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collation and Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) tool for completion&#xD;
      of case report forms at enrollment and follow-up visits (link to a demonstration website&#xD;
      https://projectredcap.org). The servers are based in-house at Mayo Clinic, with access only&#xD;
      provided to approved study personnel. No personal identifiable information will be collated&#xD;
      online. All cases will have a unique study ID, with the key to link each subject ID to&#xD;
      patient identifiable data located at each site, and only available to the PIs and senior&#xD;
      research personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data stored is considered confidential and will not be disclosed to any 3rd parties, with&#xD;
      the exception of the participants clinical health-care providers responsible for the&#xD;
      patient's welfare.&#xD;

      For participants who volunteer and consent to the biobank arm, a baseline blood sample,&#xD;
      saliva sample and buccal scrapings will be collected and stored for analyses in the future.&#xD;
      The investigators will initially test for exisiting and novel pathogenic variants using next&#xD;
      generation whole exome sequencing, which is not approved for clinical diagnosis. However,&#xD;
      technologies are rapidly evolving, and samples may be used for whole genome and epigenome&#xD;
