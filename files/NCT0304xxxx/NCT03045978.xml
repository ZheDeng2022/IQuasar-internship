      To study the role of ghrelin, leptin, adiponectin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), orexin A, IGF-1,&#xD;
      IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3, and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the nutritional status in&#xD;
      children with feeding difficulty, and further to evaluate their regulation with feeding&#xD;
      difficulties (anorexia, picky eating behavior, feeding disorders with concurrent medical&#xD;
      conditions).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigations plan to prospectively evaluate the plasma concentration of endocrine&#xD;
      parameters in children with feeding difficulties. The studied children are arranged to do the&#xD;
      dietary records, clinical survey and laboratory studies at the inpatient or outpatient&#xD;
      department at clinical evaluation and follow-up. The duration of evaluation and follow-up is&#xD;
      3 months. The healthy children in the control group are also assigned to do the dietary&#xD;
      records, clinical survey and laboratory studies after exclusion of feeding difficulty and&#xD;
      malnutrition by feeding and nutritional assessment (same survey as the studied patients&#xD;
      demonstrated in the following section &quot;clinical survey&quot;). The healthy children do not need&#xD;
      the follow-up assessment at 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of feeding difficulty is based on &quot;IMFeD&quot; program. The categorizations of&#xD;
      feeding difficulties in the IMFeD tool was originally developed by Dr. Chatoor and Dr.&#xD;
      Kerzner (Clinical investigation of feeding difficulties in young children: a practical&#xD;
      approach, Clinical Pediatrics, 2009). The 7-day dietary records and assessment of daily&#xD;
      calories are evaluated by dietician and research assistant. Nutritional assessment includes&#xD;
      7-day dietary record, assessment of daily calories, body weight (BW), body height (BH),&#xD;
      weight for age z-score, height for age z-score, BMI, BMI for age z-score, weight for height&#xD;
      index, weight-for-height z-score, severity of malnutrition, and nutritional serum markers&#xD;
      (hemoglobin, lymphocyte count, pre-albumin, albumin, ferritin, and zinc). Growth standards&#xD;
      for height, weight, and BMI based on World Health Organization (WHO) population were used to&#xD;
      obtain z-scores for each measurement, according to age and gender. The severity of&#xD;
      malnutrition is determined by weight-for-height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laboratory studies will be performed at baseline and at 12 weeks. Venous blood is&#xD;
      collected in Serum separation tubes and kept at 4 째C for 1 before being centrifuged, and the&#xD;
      serum is stored at -80 째C. All measurements are performed in the same assay without&#xD;
      extraction. Concentrations of serum ghrelin, leptin, adiponectin, NPY, orexin A, IGF-1,&#xD;
      IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3 and CRH are all determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#xD;
      kits. All assays were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions.&#xD;

        1. Studied subjects: children with clinical diagnosis of feeding difficulty.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Methods of study: A total of 90 children aged 2-12 years old with feeding difficulty&#xD;
             are enrolled into the study, and 30 healthy children are used as control. The enrolled&#xD;
             subjects with feeding difficulty are assigned clinical survey for 12 weeks and&#xD;
             laboratory studies at enrollment and at 12 weeks, and they are classified into 3&#xD;
             groups: (1) Group 1: 30 patients without malnutrition, (2) Group 2: 30 patients with&#xD;
             mild malnutrition, and (3) Group 3: 30 patients with marked malnutrition.&#xD;
