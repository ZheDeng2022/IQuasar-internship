  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the clinical efficacy of inhaled iloprost as an invasive, selective&#xD;
      vasodilator in the cardiac catheterization laboratory in patients with pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      to the gold standard of inhaled nitric oxide. It will also examine whether echocardiographic&#xD;
      estimates of response to inhaled iloprost can predict responsiveness to invasive vasodilator&#xD;
      testing in patients with pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iloprost was the first inhaled prostacyclin analogue to be FDA-approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial hypertension. Iloprost aerosol has been shown to significantly improve&#xD;
      pulmonary hemodynamics in patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (PH), with an&#xD;
      effect greater than nitric oxide and sildenafil. It has also been shown to be more effective&#xD;
      than nitric oxide at reducing pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) than prostacyclin infusion&#xD;
      when used in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Because of its administration through&#xD;
      inhalational means, iloprost has the advantage of selective action on the pulmonary&#xD;
      vasculature with avoidance of the systemic side effects that plague many of the other&#xD;
      treatments for PH. The investigators intend to compare the efficacy of inhaled iloprost in&#xD;
      reducing pulmonary artery pressure to the gold standard of nitric oxide in patients with&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without an established noninvasive algorithm to identify beneficial hemodynamic response to&#xD;
      vasodilators, patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) are routinely subjected to expensive&#xD;
      and invasive testing. Echocardiography is routinely used to facilitate a diagnosis of PH and&#xD;
      a few echocardiographically-derived estimates have even been shown to correlate with&#xD;
      vasodilator responsiveness and survival. Dynamic, real time changes in echocardiographic&#xD;
      parameters have not been previously evaluated as a predictor of vasodilator responsiveness or&#xD;
      of clinical outcome. The investigators will examine whether echocardiographic changes in&#xD;
      response to inhaled iloprost can predict invasively derived vasodilator responsiveness and&#xD;
      help assess prognosis in patients with pulmonary hypertension, possibly even obviating the&#xD;
      need for invasive testing.&#xD;
