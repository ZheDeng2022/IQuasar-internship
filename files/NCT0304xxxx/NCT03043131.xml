      Metabolic acidosis is a frequent problem in cardiopulmonary bypass. The cause is poorly&#xD;
      understood, but it appears to be multifactorial. It is assumed to be result of hypoperfusion&#xD;
      with resultant lactatemia. And other theories include bicarbonate dilution to excessive&#xD;
      proton activity and diluting fluid.The main three contributors for the development of&#xD;
      metabolic acidosis are stress of anaesthesia, surgery and Cardio Pulmonary Bypass(CPB)&#xD;
      prime.Even after research discussion and debate, there is no agreement upon ideal prime.The&#xD;
      literature is extensive, comparing different types of colloids, colloids versus crystalloids,&#xD;
      synthetic versus organic, and inclusion of numerous additions in an attempt to make a grossly&#xD;
      unphysiological state the least disruptive to the body as possible&#xD;

      REVIEW OF LITERATURE The ideal prime for Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) has never been fully&#xD;
      established. The development of acid-base disorders during some routine cases and the&#xD;
      possible contribution to this from priming fluids caused this hospital to question its&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma Lyte-A injection, pH 7.4, is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution, for&#xD;
      intravenous administration. Each 100mL contains 368mg of Sodium acetate Trihydrate,&#xD;
      (C2H3NaO2.3H2O), 502 mg of Sodium gluconate (C6H11NaO7), 526 mg of sodium chloride, (NaCl),&#xD;
      30 mg of Magnesium chloride (MgCl2.6H2O) ,37 mg of Potassium chloride, (KCl). It contains no&#xD;
      anti microbial agents. pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide. Its pH is 7.4 (6.5 to 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One litre has an ionic concentration of 27mEq of acetate, and 23mEq of gluconate, 5mEq of&#xD;
      potassium, 140mEq sodium, 3mEq of magnesium, 98mEq of chloride. The osmolarity of 294mOsm/ml.&#xD;
      Normal physiological osmolarity range is 280 to 310mOsm/lit. Administration of substantially&#xD;
      hypertonic solutions may cause vein damage. The calorie content is 21 k.Cal/lit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100ml of Ringer's lactate contains 320mg of sodium lactate, 600mg of sodium chloride, 40mg of&#xD;
      potassium chloride, and 27mg of calcium chloride. It is equivalent to sodium of 130mEq,&#xD;
      calcium of 3mEq, potassium of 4mEq, bicarbonate of 28mEq and chloride of 109mEq. Hence it has&#xD;
      value as source of water, electrolytes and calories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infusion fluids that do not contain the physiological buffer base bicarbonate tend to produce&#xD;
      dilutional acidosis because infusion of such solution dilutes (reduces) the HCO3-&#xD;
      concentration (buffer base) of the entire extracellular compartment, while the partial&#xD;
      pressure of CO2 (buffer acid) remains constant. Dilution may be isovolemic (normovolemic),&#xD;
      i.e., HCO3- is lost along with the blood and the blood or extracellular fluid volume is&#xD;
      restored to normal with a solution that is free of HCO3-, or the ECFV is expanded with a&#xD;
      bicarbonate-free solution to produce hypervolemia. A decrease in arterial pH to 7.20 was&#xD;
      observed in a dog model after infusion of 1,500mL of 0.9 % NaCl solution in 5 minutes, while&#xD;
      no such effect was observed in dogs infused with the same volume of a solution containing&#xD;
      30mmol/L of NaHCO3. In summary, dilutional acidosis is predictable and defined as an&#xD;
      iatrogenic disruption brought on by bicarbonate dilution in the entire extracellular space&#xD;
      which may be associated with hyperchloremia or hypochloremia depending on whether dilution&#xD;
      was produced by infusion of a hyperchloremic or hypochloremic solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dilutional acidosis can be prevented by the use of adequate concentrations of metabolizable&#xD;
      anions to replace HCO3-.The following anions of organic acids, acetate (acetic acid), lactate&#xD;
      (lactic acid), gluconate (gluconicacid), malate or hydrogen malate (malic acid), and citrate&#xD;
      (citric acid) may be used as metabolizable bases. Consuming H+ ions and oxygen in the&#xD;
      process, these anions are metabolized in the intact liver (mainly lactate) or in muscle&#xD;
      (mainly acetate and malate) to produce HCO3-. At pH 7.40, carbonic acid (H2CO3) is the only&#xD;
      H+ ion source of the body (while supplied at a low concentration of 1.2mmol/L, H2CO3 can be&#xD;
      synthesized freely from CO2 + H2O). HCO3- is therefore released in equimolar amounts. For&#xD;
      every mole of acetate, gluconate, or lactate oxidized, one mole of bicarbonate is produced,&#xD;
      while for every mole of malate or citrate oxidized, 2 or 3 moles of bicarbonate are produced,&#xD;
      respectively. The two latter metabolizable anions would thus produce excessively high,&#xD;
      unphysiological bicarbonate concentrations. If an infusion fluid contains metabolizable&#xD;
      anions in concentrations exceeding the lack of bicarbonate, infusion-induced alkalosis is a&#xD;
      likely consequence, called rebound alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis is always iatrogenic. The&#xD;
      normal plasma acetate concentration is very low and has been reported to range from 0.06 to&#xD;
      0.2mmol/L. Patients undergoing acetate hemodialysis have had plasma acetate levels as high as&#xD;
      6.5mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acetate Metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any metabolic pathway must be electro-neutral on balance. Acetate (the base the patient is&#xD;
      infused with) is therefore oxidized in the form of acetic acid (after taking up H+). Two&#xD;
      moles of O2 are required per mole of acetic acid. The chemical equation for the reaction of&#xD;
      sodium acetate with oxygen is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CH3-COONa + 2 O2&lt;------&gt; CO2 + H2O + NaHCO3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two important conclusions can be drawn from this equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For every mole of acetate oxidized, one mole of bicarbonate is produced; this is the&#xD;
           expected effect of acetate for HCO3- replacement or alkalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For every two moles of O2 consumed, only one mole of CO2 is produced. This is a&#xD;
           surprising &quot;side&quot; effect in that the respiratory quotient (RQ) for acetate is only 0.5.&#xD;
           Compared with glucose (dextrose), which has a RQ of 1.0, this means that the metabolism&#xD;
           of acetate causes only half the inhaled O2 to be exhaled as CO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with HCO3-, acetate has practically the same effect Lactate Metabolism CH3-CH-COONa&#xD;
      + 3 O2 &lt;-----&gt;CO2 + 2H2O + 2NaOH CO2 +H2O &lt;-----&gt;H2CO3 H2CO3 + NaOH&lt;----&gt;NaHCO3+H2O Summary :&#xD;
      Na lactate +3O2 &lt;-----&gt; 2CO2+2 H2O+NaHCO3 At the basal metabolic rate (BMR), the myocardium,&#xD;
      muscle, brain, intestinal mucosa, and red blood cells produce approximately 1mmol of&#xD;
      lactate/kg/h, and more than half of it is eliminated by the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the BMR, gluconeogenesis accounts for approximately 20 % and oxidation for approximately&#xD;
      80 % of lactate metabolism. When lactate is supplied exogenously, up to 70 % of lactate can&#xD;
      be used as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Intrahepatic gluconeogenesis ceases once pH falls&#xD;
      below 7.1, or a base excess (BE) of -15mmol/L. Incipient hepatic dysfunction (increases in&#xD;
      bilirubin and SGOT) quickly results in lactate concentrations as high as 8mmol/L, which are&#xD;
      associated with very high mortality. Compared with acetate, lactate infusion is characterized&#xD;
      by a relatively slow onset of alkalization and, therefore, has been called &quot;delayed HCO3-&#xD;
      infusion&quot;. Peak lactate turnover has been reported to be approximately 450mmol/h. As glucose&#xD;
      levels may increase quite significantly after lactate administration, it comes as no surprise&#xD;
      that intra-operatively administered Ringer's lactate may cause glucose concentrations to&#xD;
      double in diabetics. Plasma lactate has similarly high predictive power to base excess for&#xD;
      mortality in patients with various forms of shock including cardiac, hemorrhagic, and septic&#xD;
      shock. Subsequent mortality is approximately 50 % when plasma lactate (not blood lactate)&#xD;
      exceeds 4 to 7mmol/L in the first 24 to 48 hours of shock. An initial value of only 3mmol/L&#xD;
      plasma lactate concentration predicts a 25 % mortality of cardiac, hemorrhagic, and septic&#xD;
      shock patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many physicians apparently are not aware that the use of lactate-containing infusion fluids&#xD;
      (such as Ringer's lactate) or blood products (such as packed red cells) and the diagnostic&#xD;
      use of lactate as a marker of hypoxia are mutually exclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lilley A et al conducted a survey to analyze practice of CPB circuit priming. The response&#xD;
      rate was 74%. It was found that no two units in the UK used the same prime. The most common&#xD;
      reason for fluid choice was historical beliefs and there appeared to be little perceived&#xD;
      association between prime and acidosis on bypass. The results revealed that there is no&#xD;
      consensus in the UK of the preferential prime for CPB, suggesting the effect this aspect has&#xD;
      is not fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liskaser FJ et al studied role of pump prime in the etiology and pathogenesis of CPB acidosis&#xD;
      and reported that fluid with no lactate significantly limits the increase in the serum&#xD;
      lactate concentrations in post operative period. In this study he has compared the Ringer's&#xD;
      solution and Plasma Lyte-A. He has done a prospective, double blind randomized trial, which&#xD;
      was conducted in a tertiary health care centre with 22 patients, undergoing CPB for coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass surgery. He concluded that CPB induced metabolic acidosis appears to be&#xD;
      iatrogenic in nature and derived from effect of pump prime fluid on acid-base balance. The&#xD;
      extent of such acidosis and its duration varies according the type of pump prime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hayhoe M et al conducted a study and concluded that in patients receiving pump prime rich in&#xD;
      chloride and polygeline, metabolic acidosis in CPB is mainly due to iatrogenic chloride&#xD;
      concentration and unmeasured strong anions.Sampling of arterial blood at four time intervals:&#xD;
      post-induction, on CPB during cooling and rewarming, and at skin closure. Measurement of&#xD;
      serum Na+ K+, Mg++ ,Ca++, Cl-, bicarbonate, and phosphate concentrations, arterial blood&#xD;
      gases, and serum albumin, lactate, and pyruvate concentrations at each collection point.&#xD;
      Analysis of findings according to quantitative physicochemical principles, including&#xD;
      calculation of the strong ion difference apparent, the strong ion difference effective, and&#xD;
      the strong ion gap (SIG). All patients developed a mild metabolic acidosis. The median serum&#xD;
      standard bicarbonate concentration decreased from 25.0mEq/l post-induction to 22.3mEq/l at&#xD;
      cooling and 22.2mEq/l at rewarming (p &lt; 0.05).The standard base excess decreased from a&#xD;
      median of 1.55mEq/l prior to CPB, to ±2.50mEq/l at cooling,±1.65mEq/l at rewarming&#xD;
      and,±0.85mEq/l at skin closure(p &lt;0.001). This mild metabolic acidosis occurred despite a&#xD;
      decrease in the median serum lactate concentration from 3.20mEq/l post-induction to 1.83,&#xD;
      1.80, and 1.58mEq/l at the three other time points. The increase in the median serum chloride&#xD;
      concentration from 104.9mEq/l post induction to111.0,111.1,and110.0mEq/l at the subsequent&#xD;
      time points (p&lt;0.0001) was the main cause of the acidosis. There was also a significant&#xD;
      increase in the SIG of 3.8mEq/l at cooling and rewarming (p&lt;0.0001), suggesting a role for&#xD;
      other unmeasured anions (polygeline) in the genesis of this acidosis. He has concluded that&#xD;
      using quantitative biophysical methods, it can be demonstrated that, in patients receiving a&#xD;
      pump prime rich in chloride and polygeline, the metabolic acidosis of CPB is mostly due to&#xD;
      iatrogenic increases in serum chloride concentration and unmeasured strong anions (SIG). Its&#xD;
      development is partially attenuated by iatrogenic hypoalbuminaemia. Changes in lactate&#xD;
      concentrations did not play a role in the development of metabolic acidosis in the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Himpe D et al conducted a study by adding lactate to prime fluid during CPB and concluded&#xD;
      that exogenous lactate attenuated the CPB related acidosis. He has conducted study on twenty&#xD;
      patients scheduled for coronary surgery was studied prospectively. All patients were treated&#xD;
      identically, except for the prime, which either contained lactate or was lactate free. Just&#xD;
      before bypass and before coming off bypass, haemoglobin, glucose, plasma osmolality and&#xD;
      colloid osmotic pressure were determined; albumin, lactate, sodium, potassium, ionized&#xD;
      calcium, magnesium, phosphate, arterial pH, pCO2, bicarbonate, and base excess were measured&#xD;
      for use in Stewart's analysis. Metabolic acidosis had resolved by the end of bypass with the&#xD;
      lactated prime. Although the strong ion gap (apparent minus effective strong ion difference)&#xD;
      increased significantly in both groups, its composition differed significantly between the&#xD;
      groups. The Stewart technique detected polyanionic gelatin as a weak acid component&#xD;
      contributing to the unidentified anion fraction. Colloid osmotic pressure was maintained in&#xD;
      both groups. He concluded that exogenous lactate attenuates acidosis related to CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weinberg LD et al conducted a randomized blinded study of 50 adult patients undergoing&#xD;
      elective Coronary Artery Bypass Graft or heart valve replacement. Both groups received a&#xD;
      prime solution of 2000mL; anions lactate and chloride (Hartmann's), or anions acetate,&#xD;
      gluconate and chloride (Plasma Lyte-A).Blood was collected immediately prior to CPB (BL),&#xD;
      2-minutes (T2), 5-minutes (T5), 10-minutes (T10), 30-minutes (T30), and 60-minutes (T60) on&#xD;
      CPB. Patient characteristics were evenly matched. On delivery of pump prime both groups&#xD;
      developed metabolic acidosis. Plasma Lyte-A, standard BE: 0.53mmol/L (BL) to -3.03mmol/L&#xD;
      (T2), P&lt;0.001; Hartmann's standard BE: 0.42mmol/L (BL) to -2.20mmol/L (T2), P&lt;0.001. There&#xD;
      was a surge in the Plasma Lyte-A group's SIG - 1.39mEq/L (BL) to 12.13mEq/L (T2), P&lt;0.001,&#xD;
      remaining elevated at T60 (6.22mEq/L). The SIG in the Hartmann's group increased from&#xD;
      0.43mEq/L (BL) to 2.00mEq/L (T2). The Hartmann's group experienced a significant lactate&#xD;
      surge at 2 minutes (P&lt;0.001) remaining elevated at T60; there was no hyperlactatemia in the&#xD;
      Plasma Lyte-A group. There was significant hyperchloraemia with Hartmann's compared to Plasma&#xD;
      Lyte-A. He concluded that the mechanism of acidosis with Hartmann's solution was due to&#xD;
      combination of iatrogenic hyperlactatemia and hyperchloraemia. The mechanism with Plasma&#xD;
      Lyte-A was a production of unmeasured anions (likely acetate and gluconate). Metabolic&#xD;
      acidosis can be treated or minimized by widening the strong ion difference (alkalinizing&#xD;
      effect), maintaining a higher sodium concentration (use of sodium bicarbonate), while&#xD;
      decreasing the chloride through use of intravenous fluids with lower chloride concentrations&#xD;
      compared the Hartmann's solution and Plasma Lyte-A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morgan TJ et al designed a bicarbonate based crystalloid based circuit balanced on&#xD;
      physio-chemical principles with a strong ion difference of 24mEq/l compared its acid base&#xD;
      effects with those of Plasma-Lyte 148 a multiple electrolyte replacement solution containing&#xD;
      acetate and gluconate (total 50mEq/l). Twenty patients with normal acid base status&#xD;
      undergoing elective cardiac study were randomized 1:1 to a 2 litres prime of either&#xD;
      bicarbonate based fluid or Plasma-Lyte 148. With the trial fluid metabolic acid base status&#xD;
      was normal following cardiopulmonary bypass initiation (standard base excess 0.1 (1.3) mEq/l,&#xD;
      mean, SD), whereas plasma Lyte - 148 produced a slight metabolic acidosis (standard base&#xD;
      excess 2.2 (2.1)mEq/l, mean, SD). Estimated group difference after baseline adjustment was&#xD;
      3.6mEq/l (95% confidence interval 2.1 to 5.1 p=0.0001). By late bypass mean standard base&#xD;
      excess in both groups was normal (0.8(2.2)mEq/l Vs -0.8 (1.3) p=0.5). Strong ion gap values&#xD;
      were unaltered with trial fluid, but with the Plasma Lyte - 148 increased significantly on&#xD;
      bypass initiation. (15.2(2.5)mEq/l Vs 2.5(1.5)mEq p&lt;0.0001 )remaining elevated in late&#xD;
      bypass. (8.4(3.4)mEq/l Vs5.8(2.4)mEq/l p&lt;0.05). They have concluded that bicarbonate based&#xD;
      crystalloid with strong ion difference of 24mEq/l is balanced for cardiopulmonary bypass in&#xD;
      patients with normal acid base status, whereas Plasma-Lyte 148 trigger a surge of unmeasured&#xD;
      anions, persisting throughout the bypass. These are likely to be acetate and gluconate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alston RP et al studied the effects of changing the solutions back to Hartmann's on metabolic&#xD;
      acidosis that develops during CPB in patients undergoing heart surgery. He has taken two&#xD;
      groups of patients were studied. The first received Ringer's (n = 63) and the second&#xD;
      Hartmann's solution (n = 66). Arterial blood samples were taken before induction of&#xD;
      anaesthesia and towards the end of CPB. Samples were analyzed in a blood gas analyzer.&#xD;
      Results: Hydrogen ion concentration increased from 38 (4) to 41 (7)mmol/L in the Ringer's&#xD;
      group, but decreased from 38 (5) to 36 (6)mmol L-1 in the Hartmann's group. Changes in PaCO2&#xD;
      (0.77, p &lt; 0.001) and volume of fluid administered (r = 0.23, p &lt; 0.01) were significant&#xD;
      univariate correlates of change in hydrogen ion concentration, but haemoglobin concentration&#xD;
      was not (r &lt; 0.01, p = 0.97). Analysis of variance for repeated measures found significant&#xD;
      difference between subject effects on the change in hydrogen ion concentration during CPB&#xD;
      caused by the choice of intravascular solution used (p &lt; 0.001) and PaCO2 (p = 0.001), but&#xD;
      not as a result of the volume of solution administered (p &gt; 0.10). He concluded that changing&#xD;
      the solutions used for priming and intravascular volume replacement from Ringer's to&#xD;
      Hartmann's was associated with a reduction in metabolic acidosis that developed during CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Murray DM et at al conducted a study to define the true incidence and nature of acidosis in&#xD;
      paediatric patients post cardiac surgery. In their study Tissue acidosis occurred overall in&#xD;
      60 of 150 samples. This was due to raised unmeasured acids alone in 44 of 60 (73.3%), raised&#xD;
      lactate alone in six of 60 (10%), and a combination of the two in ten of 60 (16.6%).&#xD;
      Hyperchloremia occurred in 19 of 150 samples overall and 12 of 25 (48%) samples immediately&#xD;
      after cardiopulmonary bypass. Measured base deficit showed a poor correlation with true&#xD;
      tissue acidosis (p &lt; 0.001) and the worst discriminatory ability. They concluded that&#xD;
      metabolic acidosis occurs frequently post cardiac surgery and is largely due to raised&#xD;
      unmeasured acids and less commonly raised lactate. Hyperchloremia is common, particularly&#xD;
      after cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;

      using the software link http://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize2/. The arterial blood gases&#xD;
      along with lactate levels are recorded at the time of induction, and followed, five minutes&#xD;
      after CPB, at the end of the termination of CPB, half an hour stay in the ICU soon after the&#xD;
      patient is shifted from completion of surgery and at the time of extubation. Urea levels,&#xD;
      Creatinine levels and Creatinine clearance will be recorded pre operatively and will be&#xD;
      followed in immediate post-operative period and 12 hours after surgery, 24 hours surgery, and&#xD;
      48 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STASTISTICAL ANALYSIS As discussed in methodology, the primary objective is to compare Plasma&#xD;
      Lyte-A and Ringer's lactate as cardiopulmonary bypass prime on the basis of ABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence the lactate is primary outcome variable which is quantitative in nature. It is presumed&#xD;
      that the variable lactate will follow normal distribution and therefore, the appropriate&#xD;
      statistical test to study the significant difference at each condition between the two groups&#xD;
      will be independent t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it doesn't follow normal distribution non-parametric alternative of independent t-test&#xD;
      will be used like Mann-Whitney U-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see the trend within the group at different time intervals, repeated measure ANOVA will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary statistics for the quantitative variables will be represented by mean, SD and for the&#xD;
      qualitative variable will be represented by number or percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see the trend, line chart will be used. All the proposed tests will be used at 5% level of&#xD;
      significance (α) All the statistical computation will be done on Statistical Package for&#xD;
      Social Sciences software (SPSS version 22.0) on windows operating system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL JUSTIFICATION Recent studies have demonstrated that better outcomes in terms of&#xD;
      acidosis with the use of Plasma Lyte-A (Acetate containing balanced crystalloid solution) as&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary Bypass prime, being more physiological to plasma in composition. Thus, the&#xD;
      present study compares the effects of Plasma Lyte-A as a priming fluid with respect to ringer&#xD;
      lactate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the guidelines set up by Indian Council of Medical Research (1994) and Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration (modified 2000), the following will be adhered to in all patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patients involved in the research project will be volunteers and informed&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Each patient will be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any&#xD;
           possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the&#xD;
           anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail&#xD;
           to him/her and the remedies thereof.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Every precaution will be taken to respect the privacy of the patient, the&#xD;
           confidentiality of the patients information and to minimize the impact of the study on&#xD;
           his/her physical and rental integrity and his/her personality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The patient will be given the right to abstain from participation in the study or to&#xD;
           with draw consent to participate at any time of the study without reprisal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Due care and caution will be taken at all stages of the research to ensure that the&#xD;
           patient is put to the minimum risk, suffer from no irreversible adverse effects and,&#xD;
           generally, benefit from and by the research or experiment. There will be no risk to the&#xD;
           patient as a simple investigation like complete haemogram, arterial blood gas analysis&#xD;
           is routinely done for all patients undergoing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Written informed consent will be obtained from all the patients included in the study.&#xD;
