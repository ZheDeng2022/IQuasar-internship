      Surgical resection of the primary tumour and treatment of the metastatic site in&#xD;
      oligometastatic stage IV metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma enhances survival and improves&#xD;
      quality of life with acceptable postoperative morbidity and mortality in a selected group of&#xD;
      operable patients with only one metastatic site that does not progress under chemotherapy.&#xD;
