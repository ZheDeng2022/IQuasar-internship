  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate physical therapy (standard of care) and home exercise vs. home&#xD;
      exercise alone for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with adhesive capsulitis receive a glenohumeral and subacromial injection routinely&#xD;
      for treatment. In addition, the patients are routinely prescribed physical therapy with a&#xD;
      home exercise component. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether home exercise alone&#xD;
      is an alternative option to physical therapy. Patients will be approached about the study&#xD;
      after they have agreed to receive a glenohumeral and subacromial injection per standard of&#xD;
      care for their clinical treatment. The hypothesis being tested is whether home exercise is&#xD;
      alone is as beneficial for pain relief, restoration of range of motion, and improvement in&#xD;
      shoulder disability from adhesive capsulitis as physical therapy. Additionally sex&#xD;
      differences, diabetes mellitus, endocrine, and mental health histories will be noted.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinical Diagnosis of Adhesive Capsulitis (limited range of motion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Given glenohumeral and subacromial injection as part of standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Capacity to conduct home exercise program or physical therapy (based upon physician&#xD;
             judgment, proximity to physical therapy office and as decided by patient)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. English speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. 18 years of age or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior glenohumeral or subacromial corticosteroid injection within 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior ipsilateral shoulder surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current prescription (narcotic) pain medication use&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pain disorder (ex. Fibromyalgia, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Cervical radiculopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Full-thickness rotator cuff tear&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Calcific Tendinopathy (past or present)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Advanced Stage osteoarthritis as seen on radiograph&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Past/present ipsilateral shoulder fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Women that may be pregnant or nursing (self report)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Past/present physical therapy treatment will be documented, but will not be considered an&#xD;
        exclusion factor. The reasoning behind this is that the physical therapy likely was not&#xD;
        properly targeting the adhesive capsulitis for the patient to arrive in an orthopaedic&#xD;
        clinic and is likely at a similar starting point to most other patients regardless of&#xD;
        previous physical therapy. All patients currently enrolled in physical therapy will be&#xD;
        assigned to either our physical therapy or home exercise program.&#xD;
