  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and the&#xD;
      world. Many interventions relating to prevention have been emphasized as more risk factors&#xD;
      for this devastating disease are discovered. Periodontal disease is known to have a close&#xD;
      association with cardiovascular disease, but its role as a risk factor is still not well&#xD;
      understood. Inflammation is a driving force in both of these diseases, creating a potential&#xD;
      bridge between the two. Specifically, periodontal disease can cause an inflammatory reaction&#xD;
      in the body, which may predispose or even directly contribute to atheroma formation in the&#xD;
      coronary arteries. In this study, the investigators will study the link between the&#xD;
      inflammatory state of the body and will search for a correlation with levels of coronary&#xD;
      artery disease and periodontal disease. Inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and immunoglobulin G (IgG)&#xD;
      levels in the patient's blood will be analyzed and correlated to clinical attachment loss&#xD;
      measured via pocket depth measurement, the distance from the gingival margin to the base of&#xD;
      the pocket. A definitive link between these disease processes will allow preventive measures&#xD;
      to be taken earlier to prevent this lifelong disease.&#xD;

      Dental probes will be used to probe depth of gum recession in subjects with and without a&#xD;
      history of cardiac events. Venous blood samples will also be collected from all subjects for&#xD;
      measurement of sedimentation rate, myeloperoxidase, and IgG levels. Statistical analysis will&#xD;
      then be done, in attempt to identify a difference in gum recession depth and/or serum&#xD;
      inflammatory markers among those with and without prior cardiac events.&#xD;
