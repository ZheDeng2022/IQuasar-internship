  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently when defining the upper limit of normal (ULN) or 99th percentile of a troponin&#xD;
      assay manufacturer's use a healthy population traditionally aged 18-40. The 99th percentile&#xD;
      value is the recommended value to use when diagnosing patients with an acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. With the advent of the new highly sensitive troponin assays it has become clear&#xD;
      that many patients have a troponin level above the 99th percentile when they have not&#xD;
      suffered a myocardial infarction. We believe part of the problem with interpreting the the&#xD;
      troponin values for patients is that the 99th percentile value which determines the ULN has&#xD;
      been derived from population that is very different to the hospital population of patients.&#xD;
      This study aims to demonstrate what the 99th percentile is for the population of people who&#xD;
      use the hospital services who are traditionally older and have more comorbidities when&#xD;
      compared to the population traditionally used to define the 99th percentile of a troponin&#xD;
      assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An amendment was approved to follow-up patients' clinical outcomes at 1 year using NHS&#xD;
      Digital data.&#xD;
