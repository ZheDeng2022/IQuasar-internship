      The study hypothesis is that placement of LAMS plus an overlapping double pigtail stent for&#xD;
      endoscopic transmural drainage of PFCs with solid debris will result in improved drainage and&#xD;
      require fewer endoscopic interventions compared to placement of LAMS alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with symptomatic pancreatic fluid collections who are scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      EUS-guided drainage of PFCs with LAMS placement will be eligible for study participation. The&#xD;
      initial portion of this procedure consists of diagnostic EUS for imaging and assessment of&#xD;
      the PFC. This EUS examination is able to distinguish the relative liquid and solid components&#xD;
      of PFCs, detail which may not be evident by CT imaging. Adult patients with PFCs consisting&#xD;
      of &gt;30% solid component as assessed at the time of EUS will be eligible for randomization.&#xD;
      This threshold was selected as the enrollment criteria in order to select patients with a&#xD;
      significant solid necrotic component to the lesion, as prior study of patients undergoing&#xD;
      LAMS placement for drainage of PFCs have used &gt;70% fluid content as the definition for a PFC&#xD;
      with predominantly liquid contents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation to study arm will be determined by the contents of sealed envelope. Subjects&#xD;
      randomized to LAMS alone will undergo EUS-guided transmural placement of an Axios stent with&#xD;
      a 15 mm luminal diameter. The choice of transgastric or transduodenal LAMS placement will be&#xD;
      at the discretion of the endoscopist and contingent upon PFC location and window relative to&#xD;
      the EUS transducer. Subjects randomized to LAMS plus double pigtail stent will undergo&#xD;
      EUS-guided transmural placement of a single Axios stent with a 15 mm luminal diameter;&#xD;
      following this, wire access across the stent lumen will be achieved using a 0.035 inch&#xD;
      hydrophilic guidewire, and a double pigtail plastic biliary stent (6 French, 7 French, or 10&#xD;
      French at the discretion of the endoscopist) will be deployed over the wire. The use of&#xD;
      fluoroscopy for stent deployment will be at the discretion of the endoscopist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point: Greater than 50% decrease in size of PFC (in mm), compared to&#xD;
      pre-intervention size (in mm), on cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) imaging at 30 days&#xD;
      following stent placement. This was selected as the primary outcome in order to maintain&#xD;
      consistency with the primary outcomes of a prior multicenter study of LAMS placement for&#xD;
      PFCs.&#xD;

          <title>Lumen Apposing Metal Stent (LAMS)</title>
          <description>Subjects randomized to LAMS alone will undergo EUS-guided transmural placement of an Axios stent with a 15 mm luminal diameter.&#xD;
Lumen Apposing Metal Stent (LAMS): The AXIOS Stent and Electrocautery-Enhanced Delivery System is an endoscopic device designed to enable the ultrasound trained interventional endoscopist to deliver a transenteric stent between the gastrointestinal tract and a pancreatic pseudocyst.</description>

          <title>LAMS Plus Double Pigtail Stent</title>
          <description>Subjects randomized to LAMS plus double pigtail stent will undergo EUS-guided transmural placement of a single Axios stent with a 15 mm luminal diameter. Following this, wire access across the stent lumen will be achieved using a 0.035 inch hydrophilic guidewire, and a double pigtail plastic biliary stent (6 French, 7 French, or 10 French at the discretion of the endoscopist) will be deployed over the wire.&#xD;
