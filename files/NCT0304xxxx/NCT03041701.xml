    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood. Two types are&#xD;
      embryonal RMS (ERMS) and alveolar RMS (ARMS). Dasatinib may block over-expression of a&#xD;
      certain enzyme. Ganitumab may block a certain growth factor, which might suppress tumor&#xD;
      growth. This drug combination may help slow tumor growth in people with ERMS and ARMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if dasatinib combined with ganitumab is safe and shrinks or slows the growth of tumors&#xD;
      in people with ERMS and ARMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People any age who have ERMS or ARMS that did not respond to previous treatment and who can&#xD;
      swallow tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans/x-rays&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue sample: This can be from previous surgery or biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional biopsy: A small piece of the tumor is removed with a needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to co-enroll in another protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get a drug interaction handout and wallet card that show what foods and&#xD;
      medications to avoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be treated in cycles. The first cycle is 35 days and the rest are 28 days.&#xD;
      Participants will take dasatinib by mouth daily. They will get ganitumab through an IV every&#xD;
      2 weeks. They will have a physical exam every 1-2 weeks, and urine and heart tests before&#xD;
      most cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue treatment as long as they do not have severe side effects or their&#xD;
      tumors do not get worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ending treatment, participants will have a visit. This includes repeats of the&#xD;
      screening tests.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood. The annual&#xD;
           incidence in the United States is 4-7 cases per million children under 15 years, which&#xD;
           represents 250 new cases per year. Two major histologic subtypes exist: embryonal&#xD;
           rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS), the latter of which&#xD;
           carries a particularly poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Over-expression of both the type 1 IGF receptor (IGF-1R) and its ligands has been&#xD;
           observed in multiple malignancies, including pediatric sarcomas, and abnormal activation&#xD;
           of this pathway contributes to sarcoma development and progression. Downstream signaling&#xD;
           cascades of IGF-1R further regulate tumor cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis&#xD;
           through the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR pathways. In the majority of RMS, IGF-1R is highly&#xD;
           expressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monoclonal antibodies targeting IGF-1R interfere with ligand binding and decrease the&#xD;
           expression of the receptor on cell surfaces by internalization and degradation of the&#xD;
           receptor. A number of these have been tested in the clinical setting. Results from a&#xD;
           phase II trial using monotherapy with monoclonal antibodies against IGF-1R resulted in&#xD;
           clinically meaningful responses in about 10-15% of patients with RMS. However, the vast&#xD;
           majority of these responses were short-lived with a rapid onset of resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  YES is a member of the SRC family tyrosine kinases (SFKs), non-receptor tyrosine kinases&#xD;
           that function in a number of signaling pathways necessary for cell growth,&#xD;
           differentiation and survival. Preclinical work suggests involvement of YES in a number&#xD;
           of solid tumor types, including colon carcinoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, glioma,&#xD;
           pancreatic cancer, mesothelioma, and RMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recently, the Helman lab published preclinical work showing that in both embryonal and&#xD;
           alveolar RMS models, blockade of IGF-1R results in YES activation and that YES&#xD;
           activation is associated with resistance to IGF-1R blockade. In addition, combination&#xD;
           blockade of IGF-1R and YES in vitro results in downregulation of phospho-AKT in some&#xD;
           cell lines. Treatment blocking both IGF-1R and YES results in enhanced growth inhibition&#xD;
           of multiple cell lines of both embryonal and alveolar RMS in vitro and in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase I: To determine the safe dose of dasatinib when given with ganitumab in patients&#xD;
           with relapsed or refractory embryonal or alveolar RMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase II: To determine if the use of ganitumab plus dasatinib is able to be associated&#xD;
           with a modest fraction of patients who experience an objective clinical response (CR and&#xD;
           PR) as defined by RECIST criteria. In addition, a second primary objective will estimate&#xD;
           the fraction that is without progression at 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a diagnosis of relapsed or refractory embryonal or alveolar RMS, be&#xD;
           able to swallow tablets, have archival tissue available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have adequate performance status and adequate major organ function and&#xD;
           have recovered from acute toxicity of all prior therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is an open label, multi-site, phase I/II study designed to determine if ganitumab&#xD;
           given in combination with dasatinib in children and adults with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
           embryonal or alveolar RMS for whom no curative options exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the phase I portion, using a standard 3 + 3 design, limited dose escalations will be&#xD;
           performed to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest safe dose tested of&#xD;
           dasatinib when given in combination with ganitumab in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the phase II component, sixteen (16) evaluable patients, including up to 6 patients&#xD;
           from the phase I portion treated at the selected phase II dose, will be enrolled to rule&#xD;
           out a 5% fraction with a clinical response in favor of a 30% fraction with a clinical&#xD;
           response, using a one sided 0.10 significance level exact test for a binomial&#xD;
           proportion. In practice, the fraction of the 16 patients that have objective responses&#xD;
           will be determined and reported along with 80% and 95% confidence intervals. If there&#xD;
           are 3 objective responses in 16 evaluable patients, the lower one-sided exact 90%&#xD;
           confidence interval is 7.1%, thus ruling out 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is anticipated that approximately 10-15 patients per year may be accrued onto this&#xD;
           trial. Thus, 2 to 3 years is expected to completed accrual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In all patients, mechanisms of response and resistance will be assessed by analyzing&#xD;
           archival tissue for expression of IGF-1R, insulin receptor, IGF-2 expression and&#xD;
           phospho-YES expression, and through genomic sequencing (on protocol 10-C-0086). Genomic&#xD;
           sequencing of tumor cells from tissue relative to non-tumor cells from whole blood will&#xD;
           be profiled to identify the genomic variances that may contribute to response or disease&#xD;
           progression and provide an understanding of molecular abnormalities. RNA sequencing will&#xD;
           be conducted to provide expression data and give relevance to DNA mutations;&#xD;
           Quantitative proteomics analysis will be conducted on all patients to determine the&#xD;
           exact amounts of specific proteins and/or to confirm expression of genes that are&#xD;
           correlative of response and disease progression. Genomic and transcriptomic analysis&#xD;
           will be conducted on patients who consent to protocol 10-C-0086, Comprehensive Omics&#xD;
           Analysis of Pediatric Solid Tumors and Establishment of a Repository for Related&#xD;
           Biological Studies.All genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic molecular analyses will be&#xD;
           retrospective and exploratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients who agree to undergo biopsy of their tumor, provided the tissue is easily&#xD;
           accessible and can be biopsied safely with minimal morbidity, mechanisms of response and&#xD;
           resistance will be assessed by analyzing biopsy tissue expression of IGF- 1R, insulin&#xD;
           receptor, IGF-2 expression and phospho-YES expression, and through genomic sequencing.&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to dasatinib or ganitumab or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require concurrent treatment with any medications or substances that are&#xD;
             potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these&#xD;
             agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a&#xD;
             frequently-updated list or medical reference text such as the Physician s Desk&#xD;
             Reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be&#xD;
             counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require concurrent treatment with antithrombotic and/or anti-platelet&#xD;
             agents (e.g., warfarin, heparin, low molecular weight heparin, aspirin, and/or&#xD;
             ibuprofen).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any condition (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an&#xD;
             inability to take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation r surgical&#xD;
             procedures affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease) that impairs their&#xD;
             ability to swallow and retain dasatinib tablets are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of radiation pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have any clinically significant cardiovascular disease including the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  myocardial infarction or ventricular tachyarrhythmia within 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  major conduction abnormality (unless a cardiac pacemaker is present).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with any cardiopulmonary symptoms of unknown cause (e.g., shortness of breath,&#xD;
        chest pain, etc.) should be evaluated by a baseline echocardiogram with or without stress&#xD;
        test as needed in addition to electrocardiogram (EKG) to rule out QTc prolongation. The&#xD;
        patient may be referred to a cardiologist at the discretion of the principal investigator.&#xD;
        Patients with underlying cardiopulmonary dysfunction should be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, the following:&#xD;
             ongoing or active infection; history of significant bleeding disorder, including&#xD;
             congenital (von Willebrand s disease) or acquired (anti-factor VIII antibodies)&#xD;
             disorders; large pleural effusions; or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known pre-existing diabetes mellitus will be excluded because of the&#xD;
             risk of hyperglycemia with ganitumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because animal studies with dasatinib have&#xD;
             shown embryolethality and fetal skeletal alterations at non-toxic maternal doses.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing human&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with dasatinib, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with dasatinib.&#xD;
