      This prospective nonrandomized multicenter phase I study, will evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      performing uterine transposition before chemoradiation for rectal cancer and uterine&#xD;
      reimplantation after the treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with pelvic cancer frequently require radiotherapy, which causes infertility even at&#xD;
      low doses. Oocytes are highly sensitive to radiation, as a dose of 2 Gy is able to destroy up&#xD;
      to 50% of the oocyte population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic radiotherapy with fertility preservation is not yet available for women with pelvic&#xD;
      tumors. In such cases, the only options are egg and/or embryo freezing and ovarian&#xD;
      transposition (OT), which might preserve reproductive and hormonal function, respectively.&#xD;
      While ovarian tissue cryopreservation and transplantation are possible, they are still&#xD;
      experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine and adnexal transposition (UT) to the upper abdomen before radiotherapy might protect&#xD;
      these organs, and the later repositioning of the uterus into the pelvis after radiotherapy&#xD;
      might allow the patients to experience a normal pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pelvic cancer who will need pelvic radiation will be offered the possibility to&#xD;
      performed the uterine transposition before the radiation therapy and after the treatment the&#xD;
      uterus will be replaced in it's natural position. The study period is 2 years or 10 patients,&#xD;
      that happens first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The suggested treatment consisted of oocyte or embryos vitrification or before the uterine&#xD;
      transposition, but this is not mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient preparation, equipment and trocars placement will be performed as usual for pelvis&#xD;
      procedures and retroperitoneal dissection. The following provides each step of the surgical&#xD;
      procedure: sealing and section of the round ligament; opening of the broad ligament;&#xD;
      dissection of the vesicovaginal space; sealing and section of the uterine vessels at the&#xD;
      level of the cervix; sealing and sectioning of the pericervical vessels and uterosacral&#xD;
      ligaments; Section of the vagina. Closure of the vagina with absorbable sutures; dissection&#xD;
      of the infundibulopelvic (IP) ligaments up to their intersection with the iliac vessels;&#xD;
      separation of the terminal ileum, right, sigmoid and descending colon from the&#xD;
      retroperitoneal space to allow dissection of the gonadal vessels up to their origin;&#xD;
      transposition of the uterus to the upper abdomen, and repositioning of the colon and ileum&#xD;
      bellow the arch formed by the uterus, adnexa and the corresponding vessels; fixation of the&#xD;
      round ligaments and gonadal vessels to the upper abdomen by means of a transparietal suture&#xD;
      to avoid herniation or by moving them into the pelvis; draining the pneumoperitoneum and&#xD;
      placement of transabdominal sutures at the site; fixation of the cervix to the umbilical&#xD;
      incision to allow for menstruation from the navel; and visual inspection of the cervix, which&#xD;
      indicates the end of the surgical procedure. The adnexa should not be contacted at any time&#xD;
      during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative care will be performed as for major procedures in gynecology. Visual inspection&#xD;
      of the cervix will be performed twice per day, and uterine perfusion was assessed every 2&#xD;
      days by Doppler ultrasound of the ovarian vessels. The patient is discharged 2-4 days after&#xD;
      surgery if no complications occur. Three-dimensional radiotherapy or Intensity-Modulated&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy following the standard treatment for the disease will start 10 to 14 days&#xD;
      later. Chemotherapy may be used, also following the usual treatment. Chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy protocols must follow the standard treatment of the disease, no adaptations are&#xD;
      accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five weeks after the end of radiotherapy, in rectal cancer cases, rectosigmoidectomy with&#xD;
      total mesorectal excision (TME) and repositioning of the uterus will be performed. Patients&#xD;
      with other tumors that do not need surgery as part of its treatment, the uterine&#xD;
      repositioning will be performed 7 - 30 days after the end of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The repositioning procedures is performed as follows: First, the cervix is separated from the&#xD;
      navel, and the first trocar is inserted. Second, adhesions are removed, and the uterus and&#xD;
      adnexa are repositioned into the pelvis. Rectosigmoidectomy with laparoscopic TME then&#xD;
      followed the usual technique., Chromotubation is performed at the end of the procedure to&#xD;
      demonstrate tubal patency. Patients without complications are expected to be discharged 2 - 4&#xD;
      days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven days after surgery, cervical inspection is performed. Image exams will be performed as&#xD;
      clinically indicated in the postoperative period. Clinical evaluation with pelvic examination&#xD;
      will be performed every week for 4 weeks, then every months for 6 months and after that every&#xD;
      3 months for 2 years. Complications form will be filled in all clinical evaluations. Every 3&#xD;
      months, quality of life protocols will be applied. Abdominal and pelvic Magnetic resonance&#xD;
      will be performed 1, 6 and 12 months after the surgery. Transvaginal ultrasound will be&#xD;
      performed 2, 4 and 6 months after the surgery. Hormonal evaluation will be performed every 3&#xD;
      months. Tumor follow-up will be performed according to the institution protocols. It is&#xD;
      recommend to the patients to wait for 1 year before trying pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reports concerning safety will be presented every 6 months to the local Ethics Committee. No&#xD;
      uterine necrosis is expected and in case of 2 uterine necrosis, the study will be stoped. Up&#xD;
      to two local recurrences in the study period are accepted, but in case of a third recurrence,&#xD;
      the study will be stoped. All complication will be reviewed by the local board and the study&#xD;
      will be under permanent evaluation. Every 6 months the local board will provide a report&#xD;
      allowing the study to continue or not.&#xD;
