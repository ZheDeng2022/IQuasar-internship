  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Joint discomfort is reported by 32% of U.S. adults, and increases with age. The knee is the&#xD;
      most common site of joint discomfort regardless of age. Nearly half of people with knee joint&#xD;
      discomfort use natural supplements to alleviate symptoms, but more research is needed to&#xD;
      determine their effectiveness. In a previous study, we measured the effect of 8-weeks&#xD;
      ingestion of a commercialized joint support dietary supplement (InstaflexTM Joint Support,&#xD;
      Direct Digital, Charlotte, NC) compared to placebo on joint discomfort, stiffness, and&#xD;
      function in adults with self-reported joint discomfort. This study will be repeated using&#xD;
      Instaflex Advanced, with a longer 12-week time period. The Instaflex Advanced supplement&#xD;
      includes six products: turmeric, resveratrol, Boswellia serrata, collagen, hyaluronic acid,&#xD;
      and black pepper extract. This unique blend may improve joint function and increase mobility,&#xD;
      but has not yet been tested in humans using a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      research design. The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effect of 12-weeks&#xD;
      ingestion of the Instaflex Advanced supplement compared to placebo in improving knee function&#xD;
      in adults with self-reported knee joint discomfort.&#xD;

      The research procedures will be conducted at the Human Performance Laboratory (Room 1201,&#xD;
      Plants for Human Health Institute Building, 600 Laureate Way), operated by Appalachian State&#xD;
      University at the North Carolina Research Campus (NCRC) in Kannapolis, NC. Subjects will come&#xD;
      here for orientation/baseline testing and then 3 other lab visits (each session will take&#xD;
      about 30 minutes). The total amount of time study participants will be asked to volunteer for&#xD;
      this study is about 2 hours at the Human Performance Laboratory (over a 12-week period).&#xD;
      Participants will also take a daily supplement for 12 weeks and keep compliant with this&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lab visit testing sequence:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Medical health questionnaire to verify medical history, and lifestyle habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Questionnaire for previous 4-weeks symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Height, weight, and percent body fat (BIA).Testing will take place behind a&#xD;
                screened area of the lab to maintain privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Questionnaires: WOMAC, visual pain scale, POMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Receive supplement organizer tray with 4-weeks supply (and instructions).&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. After a practice trial, study participants will walk as quickly and far as they can&#xD;
                on a track for 6 minutes. Total distance covered in 6 minutes will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 4 weeks, 8-weeks, 12 weeks (second, third, and fourth lab visits):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Symptoms log for previous 4-weeks symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Height, weight, and percent body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Questionnaires: WOMAC, visual pain scale, POMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Receive supplement organizer tray with 4-weeks supply (and instructions) during&#xD;
                second and third lab visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. 6-minute walk test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplements (Instaflex Advanced, placebo) will be contained in identical looking capsules and&#xD;
      organized by day of the week in supplement organizer trays. Study participants will take 1&#xD;
      capsule each day in the morning. The placebo capsules contain magnesium stearate, an inert&#xD;
      substance. The Instaflex Advanced supplement ingredients include: turmeric, resveratrol,&#xD;
      Boswellia serrata, collagen, hyaluronic acid, and black pepper extract. Compliance will be&#xD;
      monitored with bi-weekly email messages, and by counting unused capsules when the supplement&#xD;
      trays every 4 weeks. Acetaminophen, as found in Tylenol, will be allowed as a rescue medicine&#xD;
      for pain during the study as needed.&#xD;
