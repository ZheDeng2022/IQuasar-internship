  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy (PCNL) is a common endoscopic procedure performed for upper&#xD;
      urinary tract calculus disease. Despite being minimally invasive, it is associated with&#xD;
      significant postoperative pain, often necessitating inpatient hospitalization and narcotic&#xD;
      pain medications. Additionally, one of a number of catheters is often left protruding from&#xD;
      the access tract for a period of time following the procedure, adding to patient discomfort.&#xD;
      Attempts have been made to study peri-tubular or access tract analgesic installation, which&#xD;
      have shown promise.1-2 However, no studies, to our knowledge, have examined the use of&#xD;
      liposomal bupivacaine preparations in this regard. In this study we hope to prospectively&#xD;
      analyze the use of liposomal bupivacaine injected to the access tract site at the time of&#xD;
      PCNL and determine its effects on postoperative narcotic requirement and pain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting for PCNL will be randomized to either the liposomal bupivacaine or usual&#xD;
      care, which involves no injection of local anesthesia. Patients will then be followed during&#xD;
      their inpatient stay. Total narcotic requirement (in milligrams) and pain scores (using&#xD;
      Wong-Baker FACES rating scale) will be compared.3 Typical postoperative care and discharge&#xD;
      criteria will not change during the course of this study.&#xD;

      Subjects will be randomly assigned by a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Saline (control arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Liposomal bupivicaine (long-acting local anesthetic)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bupivacaine (local anesthetic)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Biostatistics Unit will develop a randomization procedure using a permuted block&#xD;
           design. Randomization will be stratified by site (LIJ or NSUH). The randomization&#xD;
           process will occur in REDCap using the Randomization Module. Details of the procedure,&#xD;
           including required record keeping, will be further developed upon approval of this&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients undergoing PCNL will need no alterations of procedure in regards to&#xD;
           positioning, obtaining access, or removal of calculi. Efforts will be made to remove the&#xD;
           calculus with use of one access tract only; however, if the surgeon performing the&#xD;
           procedures deems that additional access tracts are needed they can be obtained.&#xD;
           Similarly, efforts will be taken to include a single nephrostomy tube without the need&#xD;
           for a ureteral stent. However, if the attending surgeon deems either of these factors&#xD;
           need to be altered, he may do so at his discretion. The use of multiple access tracts,&#xD;
           multiple nephrostomy tubes, or a ureteral stent will then disqualify the patient from&#xD;
           the trial and they shall then be withdrawn from the study. Because of the nature of the&#xD;
           procedure, it is difficult to predict with certainty if patients will need any of these&#xD;
           alterations and thus these decisions may need to be made intraoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the patient still meets inclusion criteria, 20 mL of agent will be infiltrated&#xD;
           subcutaneously depending on what arm the patient was randomized to. 10 mL will be place&#xD;
           at the lateral edge of the tract while 10 mL will be placed at the medial edge. The&#xD;
           patient will be awakened without any other changes to standard PCNL protocol. All PCNL&#xD;
           procedures will be performed in the aforementioned manner by one of three fellowship&#xD;
           trained endourologists with high-volume stone practices (David Hoenig, Zeph Okeke, and&#xD;
           Arthur Smith).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary outcome being assessed is the patient's pain rating at 24 hours after the&#xD;
           procedure. All patient scores will be recorded using a specific VAS, the Wong-Baker&#xD;
           FACES Pain Rating Scale. These values will be converted to a numerical scale from 0-10&#xD;
           accordingly. Patients will be assigned a pain rating handout which will be present in&#xD;
           their hospital room for 48 hours or until they are discharged, whichever comes first.&#xD;
           Nursing staff or a urology inpatient team member will prompt the patient at the 24 hour&#xD;
           period to describe their pain using the FACES scale and they will record this on their&#xD;
           handout. Nursing or a urology inpatient team member will collect handouts at time of&#xD;
           discharge or after 48 hours, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine the effects of liposomal bupivacaine injections at the access site during&#xD;
           PCNL on postoperative pain and narcotic requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Visual analog scale (VAS) at 24 hours (Liposomal bupivicaine vs. bupivicaine only)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Total dose of narcotics (mg) over the course of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  VAS pain scores (across time)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Length of Stay (LOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time-to-first rescue pain medication after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will be randomly assigned by a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Saline (control arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Liposomal bupivicaine (long-acting)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Bupivacaine (local anesthetic)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Biostatistics Unit will develop a randomization procedure using a permuted block design.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by site (LIJ or NSUH). The randomization process will occur&#xD;
      in REDCap using the Randomization Module. Details of the procedure, including required record&#xD;
      keeping, will be further developed upon approval of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics (means ± standard deviations or medians and interquartile range [25th&#xD;
      percentile, 75th percentile] for continuous data; frequencies and percentages for categorical&#xD;
      data) will be calculated by group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparability of the three groups at baseline will be analyzed using the chi-square test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test, as deemed appropriate, for categorical variables. Continuous variables&#xD;
      such as age and narcotic usage will be compared using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or the&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis test as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary outcome, the 24 hour VAS score will be compared between the liposomal&#xD;
      bupivacaine vs. bupivacaine groups using the two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney test as deemed&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) with a mixed models approach will be used&#xD;
      to determine if the groups' trajectories for VAS differ across time, measured at 6, 12, 24,&#xD;
      and 48 hours post-operatively (i.e., the group x time interaction). The standard assumptions&#xD;
      of Gaussian residuals and equality of variance will be tested. If the normality assumption is&#xD;
      not met, a transformation will be used for the analysis of VAS. The repeated within subjects&#xD;
      factor will be time and the within subjects factor will be group (Saline, Liposomal&#xD;
      bupivicaine, or Bupivacaine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Time-to-first rescue pain medication after surgery&quot; will be analyzed by applying standard&#xD;
      methods of survival analysis, i.e., computing the Kaplan-Meier product limit curves, where&#xD;
      group will be the stratification variable. In cases where the endpoint event, &quot;first rescue&#xD;
      pain medication after surgery&quot;, did not occur, the number of hours until last follow-up will&#xD;
      be used and considered 'censored'. The groups will be compared using the log-rank test. The&#xD;
      median &quot;time to first rescue pain medication after surgery&quot; and corresponding 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals for each group will be obtained from the Kaplan-Meier/Product-Limit Estimates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LOS will also be analyzed using the standard methods of survival described above, however,&#xD;
      without any censored data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A result will be considered statistically significant at the p&lt;0.05 level of significance.&#xD;
      Upon finding a significant difference among the three groups in any of the above analyses,&#xD;
      Bonferroni adjusted multiple pairwise comparisons will be carried out in order to determine&#xD;
      specifically which groups differed from one another. A pairwise comparison will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant if p&lt;0.0167 (=0.05/3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention-to-Treat (ITT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using the modified intention-to-treat population&#xD;
      (mITT), defined as all randomized subjects who receive treatment and who have completed at&#xD;
      least one pain score after baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Analysis and Early Stopping:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no plans for interim analysis for efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed sample size for this prospective, single-blinded randomized trial is 99 subjects&#xD;
      (n=33 per group). The sample size is based on the primary analysis of VAS at 24 weeks between&#xD;
      the Liposomal bupivicaine vs. bupivicaine groups. Although other analyses will be performed&#xD;
      on all 3 groups, the sample size calculation has been simplified to the analysis of Liposomal&#xD;
      bupivicaine vs. bupivicaine at a single time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on data published by Kirac et al. (2013), the mean 24-hour VAS score for the&#xD;
      bupivicaine group was 2.8 ± 0.9. We assume that the VAS score at 24-hours for the Liposomal&#xD;
      bupivicaine group will be 25% greater (VAS=3.5). A sample size of 33 in each group will have&#xD;
      80% power to detect such a difference in means of -0.7 assuming that the common standard&#xD;
      deviation is 1.0 using a two group t-test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. Expanding&#xD;
      this to 3 groups will yield a total sample size of 99 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcome being assessed is the patient's pain rating at 24 hours after&#xD;
      the procedure. All patient scores will be recorded using a specific VAS, the Wong-Baker FACES&#xD;
      Pain Rating Scale. These values will be converted to a numerical scale from 0-10 accordingly.&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned a pain rating handout which will be present in their hospital room&#xD;
      for 48 hours or until they are discharged, whichever comes first. Nursing staff or a urology&#xD;
      inpatient team member will prompt the patient at the 24 hour period to describe their pain&#xD;
      using the FACES scale and they will record this on their handout. Nursing or a urology&#xD;
      inpatient team member will collect handouts at time of discharge or after 48 hours, whichever&#xD;
      comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will also be recorded and serve as the secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient's pain rating at 6, 12, and 48 hours in all arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient's pain rating at 24 hours in the saline arm&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient length of stay (LOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Time-to-first rescue pain medication after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Total narcotic use&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Weight adjusted total narcotics use&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Narcotic density (mg of morphine equivalent/hours) used at 0-6 hours, 6-12 hours, 12-24&#xD;
           hours, 24-48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, patient demographics and clinical characteristics such as age, gender, BMI, and&#xD;
      previous medical and surgical history will be collected. Procedural characteristics such as&#xD;
      location of tracts (supracostal vs infracostal), size of nephrostomy tract, and type of&#xD;
      nephrostomy tube will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary outcome that deserves further mention will be the total dose of narcotics from&#xD;
      over the inpatient hospital course. This will be measured from 1 hour after the patient&#xD;
      reaches the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) until the discharge order is placed. All opiate&#xD;
      medication will be converted morphine equivalents and the values will be reported as total&#xD;
      number of milligrams of morphine. In order to help reduce variability due to variations in&#xD;
      prescriber patterns, patients will be started on a pain regimen as followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mild pain: 1 tablet PO Oxycodone 5mg/Acetaminophen 325mg q4 hours Moderate pain: 2 tablets PO&#xD;
      Oxycodone 5mg/Acetaminophen 325mg q4 hours Severe pain: 1 mg IV hydromorphone q4 hours&#xD;
      Breakthrough pain: 0.5 mg IV hydromorphone q4 hours The analgesic regimen can be altered by&#xD;
      the physician or physician assistant treating the patient at their discretion but efforts&#xD;
      will be maintained to follow this analgesic regimen. Amount of narcotics used will be gleaned&#xD;
      from the electronic medical record upon discharge of the patient. Time to start recording&#xD;
      analgesics will begin one hour after patient is sent to the PACU. This will help decrease&#xD;
      variability in anesthesiologist and peri-anesthesia prescribing patterns immediately at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the procedure.&#xD;
