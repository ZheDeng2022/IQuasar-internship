      PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the Composite Clinical&#xD;
      Success of the study group receiving the Superion® IDS is not inferior to the success rate&#xD;
      observed in the study group treated by direct decompression at 60 months follow-up.&#xD;
      Secondarily, the trial is intended to establish that Composite Clinical Success of the study&#xD;
      group receiving the Superion® IDS at 24 months is not inferior to the success rate observed&#xD;
      at 24 months in patients treated with the Superion® IDS in the original IDE trial. Thirdly,&#xD;
      the trial is intended to establish that Composite Clinical Success of the population&#xD;
      receiving the Superion® IDS in this trial at 24 months is not inferior to the success rate&#xD;
      observed at 24 months in patients treated with direct decompression.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN:This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled &quot;Conditions of&#xD;
      Use&quot; clinical trial comparing the Superion® IDS to open, direct decompression in the&#xD;
      treatment of subjects aged 45 or older suffering from moderate symptoms of neurogenic&#xD;
      intermittent claudication secondary to a confirmed diagnosis of moderate LSS at one or two&#xD;
      contiguous levels from L1 to L5, i.e. from the L1-L2 level to the L4-L5 level. A maximum of&#xD;
      20 investigative sites in the U.S. will enroll subjects into the trial using a 1:1&#xD;
      randomization assignment. Enrollment will include 358 subjects (152 per arm, plus 18% to&#xD;
      account for lost to follow-up). An investigative site is defined as a facility or facilities&#xD;
      in the same general geographic location if they are under the control of a local&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After implantation of the Superion® IDS or performance of the direct decompression, each&#xD;
      Investigator will be permitted to provide a postoperative care regimen based on the subject's&#xD;
      specific need. The regimen may include, but need not be limited to: medications, a corset or&#xD;
      brace, acupuncture, traction, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment, use of a TENS unit&#xD;
      and massage therapy. The type and amount of the postoperative care will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each follow-up visit through 60 months, subjects will be interviewed to determine if they&#xD;
      have experienced adverse events (AEs) since the previous follow-up visit. A neurological&#xD;
      assessment will be performed for all patients at baseline and all follow-up visits. All&#xD;
      subjects will be required to complete ZCQ, ODI, VAS, EQ-5D and the VertiFlex® Patient&#xD;
      Satisfaction questionnaires to evaluate disability, function, pain, quality of life and&#xD;
      satisfaction at each follow-up visit. Subjects are also required to complete a VAS&#xD;
      questionnaire to evaluate pain status at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential impact of spinal injections/nerve blocks use on the ZCQ was evaluated based on&#xD;
      review of the medical literature. As these are potentially confounding of the ZCQ outcomes,&#xD;
      epidural steroid injections or nerve block procedures at the treated level(s) will be deemed&#xD;
      failures. Further, rhizotomy procedures at the treated level(s) will be deemed failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With respect to spinal cord stimulators, because the use of a permanent implant would require&#xD;
      a surgical procedure, this will be deemed a device failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic evaluations will be performed at discharge, and at each scheduled follow-up&#xD;
      visit and prior to any re-operations, in accordance with the Radiographic Evaluation&#xD;
      Protocol. The Investigator may also obtain x-rays at unscheduled visits or to assess adverse&#xD;
      events, if clinically indicated.&#xD;

             intervention other than that required to implant the Superion® device or if randomized&#xD;
             to the direct decompression arm, would not require a decompression procedure which&#xD;
