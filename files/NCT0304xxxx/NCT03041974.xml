  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During storage, red blood cells (RBCs) undergo changes collectively termed &quot;Storage lesions&quot;.&#xD;
      these changes may have an impact of the outcomes of transfused patients. One of these changes&#xD;
      is the release of microparticles by RBCs and other blood cells types. The aim of the study is&#xD;
      to (1) quantify red cell- and platelet-derived microparticles in RBC concentrates, and (2)&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of transfused microparticles (MPs) on survival and post-transfusion&#xD;
      complications in critical care patients participating in the ABLE trial (ISRCTN44878718).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During conservation of red blood cell concentrates, red blood cells (RBCs) undergo&#xD;
      biochemical and morphological changes that have been well described, and are collectively&#xD;
      termed &quot; storage lesions &quot;. The exact effects of these lesions in terms of beneficial or&#xD;
      deleterious implications in the recipient remain to be elucidated. However, several&#xD;
      retrospective studies in targeted populations suggest that an increase in the duration of RBC&#xD;
      conservation could lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality in transfused patients. The&#xD;
      multicenter, prospective trial ABLE (Age of Blood Evaluation, ISRCTN44878718) aimed to&#xD;
      evaluate in a randomised clinical trial, the impact of the age of transfused RBC concentrates&#xD;
      on several outcomes in critical care patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the modifications that RBCs undergo during storage, the generation of microparticles&#xD;
      from red blood cellsRBCs or residual platelets present in the blood concentrate has never&#xD;
      been evaluated in a prospective clinical study. It has been reported that the number of red&#xD;
      cell-derived microparticles (RMPs) present in stored blood increases with storage duration.&#xD;
      In vivo, microparticles MPs appear to be increasingly involved in disease processes, notably&#xD;
      due to their pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant effects. Furthermore, it has been shown that&#xD;
      the antigens of the Rhesus group are expressed on the RBC derived microparticles, and the&#xD;
      investigative team has shown that microparticles derived from elsewhere (endothelial cells)&#xD;
      are capable of activating cells which are important in the induction of immune responses&#xD;
      (dendritic cells). Thus, transfusing red blood cell derived microparticles could participate&#xD;
      in post-transfusional alloimmunization which may also be evaluated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the IMIB study is to (1) quantify red cell- and platelet-derived microparticles&#xD;
      MPs in RBC concentrates, and (2) evaluate the impact of the quantity of transfused&#xD;
      microparticles (MPs) on survival and several outcomes in the patients enrolled in the ABLE&#xD;
      trial in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other aims are to investigate the relationship between the number of microparticles in RBC&#xD;
      units and (1) the age of RBC, (2) donors characteristics, (3) the procedures used to prepare&#xD;
      the blood products (to define a potential new &quot;lesion storage&quot; marker).&#xD;
