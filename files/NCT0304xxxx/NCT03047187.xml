      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the ability of ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation to perform a&#xD;
           single-hop for distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine isometric muscle strength of ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine ACLR patients' self-reported knee function at discharge from rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the psychological factors for ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To correlate single-hop for distance with self-reported knee function, strength and&#xD;
           psychological factors for ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation to discover&#xD;
           whether any of these factors can predict the others.&#xD;

      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) To investigate subjective measures, objective measures, functional performance and&#xD;
      psychological factors for ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-a There will be no differences between ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation, and&#xD;
      return to sport criteria leg symmetry index (LSI ≥ 85%), in functional performance for&#xD;
      single-hop for distance tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-b There will be no differences between ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation, and&#xD;
      return to sport criteria leg symmetry index (LSI ≥ 85%), in objective measures of quadriceps&#xD;
      and hamstring isometric muscle strength tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-c There will be no differences between ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation, and&#xD;
      return to sport criteria (LSI ≥ 85%) in subjective measures of self-reported knee function&#xD;
      (KOOS) and (IKDC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-d There will be no differences in psychological factors for the anterior cruciate ligament&#xD;
      return to sport after injury scale (ACL-RSI) between ACLR patients at discharge from&#xD;
      rehabilitation and the cut-off score for return to sport (score ˃ 63).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-e There will be no differences in the psychological factors for the Tampa scale of&#xD;
      kinesiophobia between ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation and the cut-off score of&#xD;
      fear of movement (score ≤ 37).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) To investigate the relationship between self-reported knee function, isometric muscles&#xD;
      strength, single-hop test and psychological factors post ACL reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-a There will be a correlation between self-reported knee function and isometric muscles&#xD;
      strength in ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-b There will be a correlation between self-reported knee function and single-hop test in&#xD;
      ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-c There will be a correlation between self-reported knee function and psychological factors&#xD;
      in ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-d There will be a correlation between isometric muscles strength and single-hop test in&#xD;
      ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-e There will be a correlation between isometric muscles strength and psychological factors&#xD;
      in ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-f There will be a correlation between single-hop test and psychological factors in ACLR&#xD;
      patients at discharge from rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure After the participants confirm that they are interested in the study, they&#xD;
      will be seen again at the rehabilitation class during their regular hospital appointment.&#xD;
      During the participants' last visit to the rehabilitation department, they will be briefed&#xD;
      again about the study, and if they agree to partake, they will be asked to sign the consent&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-reported knee function The participants will be asked to complete the Knee injury and&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire on symptoms, stiffness, pain, function&#xD;
      daily living, function sport sand recreational activities and quality of life, and The&#xD;
      International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form (IKDC) questionnaire, which&#xD;
      assesses symptoms, function, and sports activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological factors The participants will be asked to complete The Tampa Scale for&#xD;
      Kinesiophobia (fear of movement) (TSK) which is a questionnaire that assesses pain related&#xD;
      fear of movement followed by the Anterior Cruciate ligament Return to Sport after Injury&#xD;
      (ACL-RSI) scales, which is a questionnaire that measures athletes' emotions, confidence in&#xD;
      performance, and risk appraisal concerning to returning to sport following an ACL injury. A&#xD;
      demographics form (age, height and weight) will also be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isometric muscle strength To gather isometric muscle strength data on each participant, data&#xD;
      on isometric muscle strength for both legs will be obtained using two different tests for&#xD;
      knee extensors and knee flexors muscles, using a hand-held dynamometer (HHD). The&#xD;
      participants will be asked to wear sports clothing. The strength of both lower limbs of the&#xD;
      participants will be assessed using the HHD, with peak force measured throughout five seconds&#xD;
      of muscle contraction. Quadriceps muscles will be measured by first requesting the&#xD;
      participants sit on the edge of the treatment bed with their knees 90 degrees flexion and&#xD;
      both feet off the ground. The participants will then be asked to apply maximum force in&#xD;
      extending the knee joint against the HHD device, which will be fixed using a belt and placed&#xD;
      in front of the leg proximal to the ankle joint. They will be asked to do so for five&#xD;
      seconds, and to repeat three times with 30 seconds of rest in between. The maximum peak force&#xD;
      will be recorded throughout the three trials. To measure hamstring muscles, participants will&#xD;
      be instructed to sit on the edge of the treatment bed with 90 degrees' flexion in the knee&#xD;
      with both feet off the ground. Then, participants will be instructed to apply maximum force&#xD;
      to flex knee joint against the immovable HHD device that will be fixed with a belt and placed&#xD;
      at the back of the leg proximal to the ankle joint. They will be asked to so for five&#xD;
      seconds, and this will be repeated three times with 30 seconds of rest in between. Maximum&#xD;
      peak force will be recorded throughout the three trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional tasks Participants will be requested to perform a single-leg hop for distance, and&#xD;
      this will be assessed using a standard metric tape measure. A 3m strip of tape will be placed&#xD;
      on the floor, with the start line labelled using a 0.3m strip of tape placed perpendicular to&#xD;
      the 3m strip of tape. The participants will be performed three practice trials for the hop&#xD;
      test. After finishing the practice trials, four test trials will be asked to perform a single&#xD;
      leg hop for distance as described by (Bolgla and Keskula, 1997). Attempts will be classified&#xD;
      as successful provided the participant hops and lands with full stability on one leg for&#xD;
      three seconds. The participants will be required to achieve four maximum hop attempts with&#xD;
      complete stabilisation after landing for three seconds. Attempts will be deemed unsuccessful&#xD;
      if the participant hops and touches the ground with their other leg during landing, or if&#xD;
      they fail to hop within the limited marked distance; any failed hops will be counted and&#xD;
      noted, but not processed. The participant's leg length will be measured while they are lying&#xD;
      in a supine position before the first test using a standard tape measure to measure from the&#xD;
      anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the distal tip of the medial malleolus. Leg length&#xD;
      will be used during data analysis to normalise excursion distances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will begin with their toe on the starting line, standing on one leg, before&#xD;
      hopping as far as they can horizontally and landing on the same leg, and the distance hopped&#xD;
      will be recorded. The hop data will be normalised to limb length by dividing the distance&#xD;
      covered by the participant's leg length and then multiplying by 100, resulting in a&#xD;
      percentage value. After completing the test, the participants will be asked to repeat the&#xD;
      procedure with the other leg.&#xD;
