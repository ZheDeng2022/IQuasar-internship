  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of the feasibility of the virtually reality, online, culturally&#xD;
      grounded HIV prevention intervention for Native American men who have sex with men. The&#xD;
      project will include 90 Native American men who have sex with men (MSM) from across the&#xD;
      continental United States as well as Alaska and Hawaii.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a randomized clinical trial with a waitlist control condition to&#xD;
      evaluate the intervention's impact on HIV / Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) testing&#xD;
      behavior, condom use, and substance use harm reduction. Specifically, investigators will ask&#xD;
      participants to spend 3 weeks exploring a virtual reality environment hosted in the Second&#xD;
      Life® platform. The island consists of 3 levels: Learning Level, Skills building level, and&#xD;
      Experiential level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Learning level the participant's avatar will have the opportunity to attend up to 2&#xD;
      free Motivational Interviewing sessions to establish their goals for their time on the&#xD;
      island. Additionally, they will explore 4 learning paths each covering a knowledge objective:&#xD;
      HIV Testing, Condom Use &amp; Condom Use Negotiation, Safer Sex, and Harm Reduction. Each path&#xD;
      will present knowledge via videos, interactive games, stories, and teachings. After&#xD;
      completing level 1, participants will move on to the Skills building level. Here participants&#xD;
      will have the opportunity to role play scenarios (e.g., obtaining an HIV test, requesting&#xD;
      PrEP from their doctor, negotiating condom use) with pre-program virtual actors. All&#xD;
      scenarios are based on the knowledge gained in the Learning Level. Participants will also&#xD;
      engage on mini-quests for additional knowledge and in-world rewards. Finally, in the third&#xD;
      level participants will be able to practice the skills learned in interactions with other&#xD;
      participants' avatars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If efficacious, this online HIV prevention intervention has the potential for widespread&#xD;
      dissemination and could be particularly helpful for rural and reservation-based Native MSM&#xD;
      who often have difficulty accessing services and support.&#xD;

      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment is nationwide via online ads in Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Questioning (GBTQ)&#xD;
      dating sites such as Grindr, GROWLr, Jack'd, etc. Investigators will send emails and flyers&#xD;
      to partners in GBTQ and Two-Spirit organizations for them to advertise within their listservs&#xD;
      and centers. Finally, investigators and project consultants will reach out to other&#xD;
      researchers and community partners asking them to advertise the project within their own&#xD;
      communities and organizations. Investigators expect a certain amount of &quot;word-of-mouth&quot;&#xD;
      recruitment to occur as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants are screened over the phone using a screening script.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men who screen out will be given a community resource list either by mail or email.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a person is eligible, but declines to participate, they will be given a brief one&#xD;
           item exit question regarding general reason for nonparticipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If needed, participants are walked through the process of creating a free Second Life®&#xD;
           (SL) account and downloading the SL software onto their computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      An email is sent to the participant with consent information and baseline assessment links.&#xD;
      Prior to beginning the baseline assessment in REDCap, participants will read and confirm&#xD;
      their consent (click &quot;I agree to participate&quot; or &quot;I do not wish to participate&quot;). Once&#xD;
      participants consent online, they are assigned a study survey ID number and take the baseline&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment is conducted via Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) a mature, secure&#xD;
      web application for building and managing online surveys and databases. After completing the&#xD;
      baseline assessment, participants are randomly assigned to either the Immediate or the 3-week&#xD;
      Waitlist group. Participants in the immediate group will be asked to complete 3 online&#xD;
      assessments (Baseline, end of intervention, and 3-month follow up). Participants in the&#xD;
      Waitlist group will be asked to complete 4 an additional assessment at the end of their wait&#xD;
      period. Participants will be paid in Tango gift cards for each survey completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMMEDIATE participants. After completing the Baseline assessment, they will receive an email&#xD;
      containing: their Tango card information, the invitation to the private island, their unique&#xD;
      Personal Identification Number (PIN) for accessing the private island as well as a Second&#xD;
      Life® How-to guide and a community resource list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WAITLIST participants. After completing the baseline assessment, they will enter a 3-week&#xD;
      wait period. At the end of the 3-week wait period, they complete the Baseline 2 (End of&#xD;
      waitlist) survey in REDCap. They will then proceed through the same steps as the Immediate&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention in the Virtual Two Spirit (Vr2L 2Spirit) project is conducted exclusively&#xD;
      online through the SL® platform. SL is a free and 3-dimensional online virtual world&#xD;
      developed by Linden Lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accessing the Vr2L 2Spirit Island&#xD;
&#xD;
      SL® consists of both public and private virtual spaces. The Vr2L 2Spirit island is a private&#xD;
      island and only those avatars who have been authorized access by study staff are able to find&#xD;
      it and enter it. Participants cannot grant access to other people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Vr2L 2Spirit island.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The island is split into three levels: 1) learning paths, 2) skill building, and 3)&#xD;
      experimental. Access to the levels are locked hierarchically, meaning that until participants&#xD;
      complete a lower level they will not gain access to the higher levels; however, once they&#xD;
      successfully complete a level they are welcomed to return to it as often as they like.&#xD;
      Participants are expected to complete each level in approximately one week; although they are&#xD;
      allowed to complete it sooner and some may take a bit longer. We will encourage participants&#xD;
      to move through the intervention in 3 weeks. Participants will be paid in Tango gift cards&#xD;
      for each level completed whether they complete it in 2 days or in two weeks. If necessary,&#xD;
      staff will use reminder emails, texts, in-world messages, and phone calls to encourage&#xD;
      participants to complete the level in the allotted time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be informed that their avatars' actions, interactions, and conversations&#xD;
      with the programmed scenarios and with other avatars are considered data, and will be&#xD;
      analyzed as part of the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 1 - The Learning Level: 1st Week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Orientation. After the participants' avatar authentication is completed, they will&#xD;
           teleport to the orientation caves. Here they will receive a brief orientation to the&#xD;
           Vr2L 2Spirit island and a refresher on basic SL skills needed to successfully navigate&#xD;
           the virtual experience. Afterward they are free to explore the Vr2L 2Spirit island.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In-World Counseling. Participants will have the option of receiving up to two free&#xD;
           Motivational Interviewing (MI) counseling sessions in the Vr2L 2Spirit island with an MI&#xD;
           trained counselor. The counseling sessions will be confidential and will be an&#xD;
           opportunity for participants to discuss their goals during their participation in this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Learning Paths. The main component of level 1 is the learning paths. There are 4&#xD;
           learning paths that cover different areas of HIV prevention: safer sex, harm reduction,&#xD;
           condom use, and HIV testing. Each learning paths consists of some combination of videos,&#xD;
           scripted interactions, interactive exercises, and small quests or games.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Safer sex. Includes information on Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP): what it is, how&#xD;
                to use it, and how to obtain it. It also covers the risks of sexual intercourse&#xD;
                with multiple partners and ways participants can protect themselves and their&#xD;
                partners. Additionally, it covers strategic positioning, sero-sorting and its&#xD;
                risks. Finally, it addresses partner's behavior and ways in which the participant&#xD;
                can protect themselves and their partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Harm reduction. Includes a definition of harm reduction, information on how one can&#xD;
                reduce harm from IDU, other substances, and binge drinking. Finally, it addresses&#xD;
                how to decrease IDU risk of HIV exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Condom use / condom negotiation. Includes information on the different types of&#xD;
                condoms, how to use them, and how to bring up and negotiate condom use with your&#xD;
                partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. HIV Testing. Includes information on types of HIV tests, where to find testing&#xD;
                sites, the testing experience, and what happens after your HIV results are back.&#xD;
&#xD;
           While walking the paths, learning participants will have the opportunity to collect&#xD;
           traditional medicines or materials (e.g., corn, prairie sage, birch bark, flowering&#xD;
           tobacco). These collectibles can be turned into the lodge where the participant will&#xD;
           learn about the traditional uses of these materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As participants move through the learning paths, they will gain in-world coins for&#xD;
           completing tasks. The coins gained in the Vr2L 2Spirit island are specific to the Vr2L&#xD;
           2Spirit island only. Participants can use these coins to purchase in-world rewards such&#xD;
           as additional customization for their avatar (e.g., clothing, hats, accessories,&#xD;
           tattoos).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The Lodge. It contains the MI counseling rooms, a smudging station, the collectibles&#xD;
           station, the store containing avatar accessories (e.g., clothing, hats, sunglasses,&#xD;
           jewelry). There is also a receptionist available to answer participants' questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Leisure activities. Level 1 also contains many opportunities for leisure activities such&#xD;
           as horseback riding, canoeing, wind surfing, drum circle and a camp fire among others.&#xD;
           These activities are not a required portion of the interaction and are instead created&#xD;
           to enhance the immersion experience, provide fun and relaxation alongside the learning&#xD;
           experience, and allow for participants to build camaraderie with their fellow&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 2 - The City Level: 2nd Week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The city level or skill-building level contains the clinic, the park, the bookstore, the&#xD;
      Q-center, the nightclub, and the city store. The purpose of the city level is for&#xD;
      participants to practice the knowledge gained in level 1 through quests, challenges, and&#xD;
      role-play scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Challenges. There are six city challenges created to reinforce participants' knowledge.&#xD;
           All challenges must be completed before gaining access to the Level 3 - Bathhouse.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. HIV Test. In the clinic, the avatar will have the opportunity to take a Rapid&#xD;
                Response HIV test at the clinic. The participant will have the option of selecting&#xD;
                their avatar's HIV status or be randomly assigned an HIV status after taking the&#xD;
                test.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. PrEP. If HIV negative, avatar will have the option of requesting a prescription for&#xD;
                Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) at the city clinic. Participants will receive&#xD;
                counseling regarding PrEP and will be able to purchase the PrEP prescription at the&#xD;
                city store.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Condoms. Avatars will be required to pick up free latex condoms at the city clinic.&#xD;
                They also have the option of purchasing polyurethane, polyisoprene, or sheepskin&#xD;
                condoms at the city store.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Needle exchange. Avatars will be required to find a dirty needle in the city and&#xD;
                exchange it for a clean needle at the clinic. Using the dirty or clean needle is&#xD;
                not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Book challenge. Hidden around the city landscape are six books. Every time an&#xD;
                avatar finds a book, they are given a fact related to HIV prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Role play scenarios. More information below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Role play scenarios. Throughout the city participants will encounter a series of&#xD;
           role-play scenarios related to harm reduction, safer sex, condom use, and HIV testing.&#xD;
           The role-plays are scripted; however, they allow participants to make decisions&#xD;
           throughout the interactions which will allow them to experience likely outcomes based on&#xD;
           their choices. In order to move on to level 3, they must complete each scenario at least&#xD;
           once.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Drug use. This role-play will allow participants to practice the skills around harm&#xD;
                reduction with intravenous drug use (IDU).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Anonymous / Casual sex. This role-play allows the participant the opportunity to&#xD;
                practice skills around anonymous / casual sexual intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Binge drinking. This role-play allows the participant the opportunity to practice&#xD;
                skills around harm reduction related to binge drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Condom use. This role-play allows the participant the opportunity to practice&#xD;
                skills around condom use and condom use negotiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Teaching opportunity. This role-play allows the participant the opportunity to&#xD;
                assume the role of teacher. They will encounter a younger Native American man who&#xD;
                has questions about the four content areas. The participant will have the&#xD;
                opportunity to answer the stranger's questions thus reinforcing their own&#xD;
                knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. HIV Testing. This role-play scenario allows the participant to gain further&#xD;
                knowledge about the HIV testing experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At the end of level 2. After completing all the city challenges, participants are&#xD;
           granted access to Level 3 - Experiential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 3 - The Experiential Level: 3rd Week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physically located in the city space of the Vr2L 2Spirit island, the area is nevertheless&#xD;
      locked to participants until they complete all the challenges on level 2. Once participants&#xD;
      have gained access, they will be in a &quot;free play&quot; area; although their interactions are still&#xD;
      monitored and recorded. The participants is reminded of this through signage upon entering&#xD;
      the locker room. There are no scripted interactions in this space. Interactions will be&#xD;
      limited to other participants' avatars only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Intervention Assessment Debrief Phone Call&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the next business day after the participant has completed one-week in Level 3 , they will&#xD;
      receive the prompt to take the next online survey in REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be contacted to schedule a debriefing interview with study staff.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked debriefing questions about their experience in the virtual world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three Month Follow-up Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately three months after the participant completes Level 3 of the island, they will&#xD;
      receive an email asking them to complete the final (follow-up) survey.&#xD;
