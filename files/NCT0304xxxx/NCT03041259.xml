      A Phase I/IIa Dose-Escalation Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of&#xD;
      Rejuveinix in Combination With Standard Interventional Therapy for Critical Limb Ischemia&#xD;
      Patients with Rutherford Class 4, 5 and 6 Disease&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multi-center study, comparing MAE and&#xD;
      WIQ rates to historical controls to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Rejuveinix for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients presenting with symptoms as defined by Rutherford categories 4, 5, or&#xD;
      6, and who have undergone a successful infrainguinal percutaneous intervention within the&#xD;
      femoral, femoral-popliteal, popliteal, peroneal, and/or tibial arteries. Treatment at or&#xD;
      below the ankle will be permitted (e.g. pedal arteries). This intervention must be successful&#xD;
      as defined by ≤ 30% stenosis as determined by angiographic or duplex ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies support that Rejuveinix has acute perfusion properties that have the&#xD;
      potential to provide synergistic benefits to patients after undergoing current standard of&#xD;
      care interventional procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an endovascular intervention, in one or more target vessels/lesions, using FDA&#xD;
      cleared technology, such as a bare metal stent, angioplasty, and/or atherectomy, patients&#xD;
      will receive Rejuveinix as an adjunct therapy. Enrolled subjects will be assigned randomly to&#xD;
      one of two groups. Group A will receive two 20 mL treatments of Rejuveinix per week plus one&#xD;
      placebo treatment per week comprised of 20 mL 0.9% saline. A dye will be added to the&#xD;
      placebo; the dye will be selected from one found in the Orange Book. Group B will receive&#xD;
      three treatments of Rejuveinix per week. Each 20 mL treatments will be combined with 100 mL&#xD;
      0.9% saline and administered via intravenous (IV) injection over the course of a minimum of&#xD;
      30 minutes. The study trial will occur for 12 one-week cycles with a washout period of two&#xD;
      days between each cycle (a one-week cycle will include either 2 or 3 Rejuveinix treatments&#xD;
      depending on the randomized group). Reven will also assess results calculated on four 21-day&#xD;
      cycles to allow for a direct comparison to preclinical results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to demonstrate Rejuveinix treatment as an adjunctive therapy is&#xD;
      non-inferior to historical controls in terms of patient safety, as measured by MAE rates, and&#xD;
      efficacy, as assessed by the modified WIQ.&#xD;
