  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter controlled intervention study that aims to assess the efficacy of a&#xD;
      telephone follow-up program for the prevention of suicidal behavior in adults discharged from&#xD;
      general hospitals after a suicide attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the implementation of this program is associated with reduced rates of&#xD;
      suicide reattempts in these patients and also with delayed reattempts in them.&#xD;

      Justification: Suicide is a global public health concern and is the leading cause of&#xD;
      avoidable death in the Basque Country (Spain). The use of telemedicine techniques applied to&#xD;
      high risk patients has shown to be useful in the prevention of suicide and suicidal behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To assess the efficacy of a telephone follow-up program for the prevention of&#xD;
      suicidal behavior in patients who recently attempted suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a multicenter, prospective intervention study, non-randomized and with&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: A sample of adults discharged from 2 general hospitals after a suicide attempt are&#xD;
      enrolled in a telephone follow-up program which is added to their usual treatment (TAU). The&#xD;
      program consists of 5 short calls made by nurses during 6 months. The calls are intended to:&#xD;
      1) Assess the risk of suicide in that moment, 2) Improve patient's adherence to treatments,&#xD;
      and 3) Provide general psychoeducation guidelines. The control group is composed of patients&#xD;
      discharged from a third general hospital after a suicide attempt. These receive TAU but are&#xD;
      not enrolled in the telephone follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation: All patients are followed during 12 months. Main outcome measures include the&#xD;
      percentage of patients that make a second attempt and the average time to reattempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients sign and informed consent.&#xD;
