  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety of treating men with oligometastatic prostate cancer with the following&#xD;
      therapy: (1st) Systemic chemo-hormonal therapy with up to 6-months (~24 weeks) of adjuvant&#xD;
      androgen deprivation and up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy, (2nd) definitive local tumor control&#xD;
      with adjuvant radiation therapy, and (3rd) consolidative stereotactic radiation to&#xD;
      oligometastatic lesions. The men will receive a total of 2 years of androgen deprivation.&#xD;
      Androgen blockade will be the same throughout the course of treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant treatment (month 1 through ~6): All patients will be treated with up to 6 months of&#xD;
      androgen deprivation, plus up to 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy. Following docetaxel&#xD;
      therapy, patients with a PSA response of at least a 50% decrease from baseline, will proceed&#xD;
      to maximum consolidative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation (month 7 though ~11): After completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, the men will be&#xD;
      treated with definitive local therapy with adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). After definitive&#xD;
      local therapy, patients will be treated with consolidative stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy (SBRT) to the metastatic sites (if present).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: Patients will continue on androgen deprivation for a total of 2 years. They will&#xD;
      be followed clinically and monitored with serum testosterone and PSA until 2-years after&#xD;
      completion of ADT (Androgen deprivation therapy) treatment. Androgen blockade will be the&#xD;
      same throughout the course of treatment.&#xD;
