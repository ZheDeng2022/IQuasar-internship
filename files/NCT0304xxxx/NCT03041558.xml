  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will evaluate the implementation and efficacy of a domestic violence&#xD;
      intervention module for parents receiving child welfare home visitation services.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal of this proposed project is the provision of culturally-relevant,&#xD;
      trauma-informed services leading to a reduction of family violence, and a resultant increase&#xD;
      in family stability, improved communication, and a healthy home environment for children in&#xD;
      Latino families with co-occurring domestic violence (DV) and child abuse/neglect (CAN). The&#xD;
      Administration for Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) funded project and evaluation will be&#xD;
      layered onto the existing UC San Diego's NIH-funded R01 research (NIH R01 MH092950) on&#xD;
      scale-up of SafeCare (SC) across the entire San Diego Child Welfare System. In the first&#xD;
      phase of this project, the community and academic partners will collaborate to develop a&#xD;
      detailed evaluation plan by collecting formative qualitative data via focus groups with&#xD;
      active CW clients with domestic violence (DV) histories and community child welfare and DV&#xD;
      service providers. The second phase of this project will begin with the implementation of&#xD;
      SafeCare+ (SC+), an evidence-based training curriculum for parents referred for child&#xD;
      maltreatment, coupled with the Healthy Relationships (HR) module for Latino families with&#xD;
      co-occurring child maltreatment and domestic violence experiences. SafeCare速 (SC) has been&#xD;
      shown to be widely accepted among the Latino community and the HR module has been&#xD;
      specifically adapted for and successfully utilized with Latino populations. As part of the&#xD;
      expansion of the original research study, 80 clients who will be recruited into the existing&#xD;
      study will also be randomly assigned to receive the additional HR module.&#xD;

    <description>Fidelity monitoring will begin simultaneously with the implementation of SafeCare (SC速). Fidelity is assessed largely via client report, with clients completing a fidelity questionnaire at the end of every SC or SC+ session. A secondary fidelity component utilizes information gained from the natural implementation of SC速. SC+ includes ongoing consultation in the form of expert SC速 clinicians who accompany home visitors, observe their interactions with families, and coach them on improving performance and services.</description>
