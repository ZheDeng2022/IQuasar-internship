  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well selumetinib sulfate works in treating patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer with Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) G12R mutations that has spread from where&#xD;
      it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or other places in the body. Selumetinib sulfate&#xD;
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the objective response rate to selumetinib sulfate (selumetinib) administered as&#xD;
      75 mg orally twice daily on a continuous schedule in patients with advanced pancreas cancer&#xD;
      harboring Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) G12R mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the progression free survival of patients with locally advanced, unresectable&#xD;
      and stage IV pancreas cancer treated with selumetinib monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety of selumetinib in patients with advanced pancreas cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the impact of additional genetic alterations on the response to selumetinib&#xD;
      in pancreas cancer harboring KRAS G12R mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To develop a clinically applicable biomarker predicting response to selumetinib in&#xD;
      pancreas cancer harboring KRAS G12R mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive selumetinib sulfate orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 27 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 52 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of Participants With an Objective Response (Partial Response + Complete Response)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 1-8.2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Response was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Complete Response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10mm (&lt;1 cm). Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <time_frame>From start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first and was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <description>Here are the grade 3 or greater adverse events assessed by the CTCAEv5.0 probably or definitely attributable to the agent Selumetinib. Grade 3 is defined as severe or medically significant, Grade 4 is life-threatening consequences, and Grade 5 is death related to adverse event. Probably is defined as likely related to the agent, and Definitely is defined as clearly related to the agent.</description>

    <description>Here is the number of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of variants identified in the 50-cancer gene panel will be compared with response, presenting the results in a 2x2 table with findings reported descriptively. Pre-treatment ctDNA levels will be divided into groups to separate aberrant values from the rest. The cutoffs will be &gt; and &lt; 2 standard deviations of the mean, with the cutoffs applied to both ctDNA levels. Based on these groups, resulting in participants with cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) transcripts levels &gt; 2 standard deviation (SD) above the mean, participants with cfDNA transcripts levels &lt; 2 SD below the mean, and the rest in between, the categorical results will be evaluated and reported relative to response vs. non-response in a descriptive manner.</description>

    <time_frame>start of treatment every (q)2 weeks, up to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Circulating free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) transcript levels will be followed from the start of treatment every (q)2 weeks and the change to pre-treatment will be plotted for each timepoint in a spider plot format. Variant profile derived from voluntary repeat biopsies will be compared to pre-treatment variant profile and gain of variants (adjusted for similar sequencing depth) will be recorded.</description>

                       excluded; the use of medication(s) that can prolong QTc interval is&#xD;

                  orbito-temporal plexiform neurofibroma (PN) (such as visual loss, strabismus)&#xD;
                  will NOT be considered a significant abnormality for the purposes of the study&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>180 pts were not enrolled to the study. All pts who made contact to participate in the study all had KRAS G12R mutation testing thus pre-screening was not necessary. The 1st 8 pts who made contact with the study and were eligible were consented, enrolled and treated. No other pts were enrolled in the study per the statistical design in the protocol. As pre-specified, the study did not move into the second phase due to lack of efficacy.</pre_assignment_details>
