  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia is widely used as the procedure of choice for cesarean delivery. In&#xD;
      comparison to epidural anesthesia it is faster, easier to perform, patients are more&#xD;
      comfortable, complication rates are lower, and it is more cost effective. Spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      is an accepted technique in elective cesarean sections. However, hypotension, resulted from&#xD;
      sympathectomy is a common problem, especially in pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal block causes peripheral vasodilation and venous pooling, which may result in maternal&#xD;
      hypotension. Maternal hypotension after spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery, without&#xD;
      prophylactic measures, has a very high incidence (80%-100%). Even though highly investigated,&#xD;
      spinal induced hypotension remains a major concern, and it has been referred to as the &quot;Holy&#xD;
      Grail&quot; of obstetric anesthesia. The detrimental effects of the spinal induced hypotension are&#xD;
      maternal and fetal. Maternal effects are nausea, vomiting and dizziness. Hypotension results&#xD;
      in reduced uterine and intervillous blood flow with potential fetal hypoxia and acidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and prevention of hypotension has been the subject of much investigation and&#xD;
      controversy. Prophylactic measures include: 1) left lateral tilt, 2) fluid preload, 3)&#xD;
      vasopressors,4) low dose spinal anesthesia. A 15° left lateral tilt is used routinely during&#xD;
      cesarean section, to prevent aorto-caval compression, however it is not sufficient as a sole&#xD;
      method. Left uterine displacement is achieved by tilting the operating table or by placing a&#xD;
      wedge under the woman's hip. Aorto-caval compression also may increase the spread of spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia. Among the non-pharmacological interventions studied to minimize the incidence of&#xD;
      hypotension sitting the patient up for up to 7 min after CSE anesthesia for cesarean section&#xD;
      reduced intraoperative ephedrine requirement without affecting the success of the spinal&#xD;
      anesthetic. In contrast, sitting up for 9 min resulted in the need for rescue epidural&#xD;
      anesthesia without additional benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenylephrine Treatment of vascular failure in shock, shock-like states, drug-induced&#xD;
      hypotension or hypersensitivity; correction of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia;&#xD;
      prolongation of spinal anesthesia; vasoconstriction in regional analgesia; maintenance of&#xD;
      adequate level of BP during spinal and inhalation anesthesia. It has a number of important&#xD;
      attributes for treating spinal hypotension: (i) as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, its mechanism&#xD;
      of action directly addresses the decrease in systemic vascular resistance following spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia;(ii) phenylephrine has a faster onset of action compared with ephedrine; (iii)&#xD;
      ephedrine is associated with a ﬁve-fold increased risk of fetal acidosis; and (iv) ephedrine&#xD;
      is more likely to cross the placenta and increase concentrations of lactate, glucose, and&#xD;
      catecholamines in the fetal circulation compared with phenylephrine. However, phenylephrine&#xD;
      used alone may be accompanied by maternal bradycardia and does not beneﬁt from widespread&#xD;
      clinical experience, as does ephedrine do. Thus, phenylephrine has not yet become popular,&#xD;
      particularly for prophylactic use. Clinical experience suggests that phenylephrine may be&#xD;
      useful in addition to ephedrine when the latter fails to correct hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ephedrine sulphate is a potent sympathomimetic that stimulates both α and β receptors and has&#xD;
      clinical uses related to both actions. Its peripheral actions, which it owes in part to the&#xD;
      release of norepinephrine, simulate responses that are obtained when adrenergic nerves are&#xD;
      stimulated. These include an increase in blood pressure, stimulation of heart muscle,&#xD;
      constriction of arterioles.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective randomized clinical double-blind study using a computer generated randomization&#xD;
      will be conducted in a Women's Health Hospital, Assuit University. Neither the doctor&#xD;
      &quot;investigator&quot; nor the participant &quot;parturient&quot; will be aware of the group allocation or the&#xD;
      drug used. The study drugs will be prepared by one of the supervisor anesthetist (not&#xD;
      included in the procedure, observation or in data collection). The study will be carried on&#xD;
      60 parturient scheduled for elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. They will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated into two equal groups of 30 parturient each:&#xD;
&#xD;
      P group: Phenylephrine 30 µg/minute by syringe pump infusion for30 min. E group: Ephedrine 3&#xD;
      mg/ minute by syringe pump infusion for30 min. The study solutions (vasopressors) will be&#xD;
      prepared by another supervisor anesthetist and will be diluted with normal saline (Na Cl&#xD;
      0.9%) to the same total 50 ml volume in a syringe pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-intervention Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All parturient will undergo full pre-anesthetic checkup (according to ASA guidelines)&#xD;
      including detailed history, physical and systemic examinations. They will be kept NOP (nil&#xD;
      per mouth) 6-8 hours for solids and 2 hours for water and clear fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parturient in the holding area:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline monitoring readings of the maternal vital signs including HR, NIBP, SpO2 and RR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive Cardiac Output Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will positioned in the supine position, with uterine displacement to the left&#xD;
      lateral for several minutes and the electrodes of the noninvasive cardiac output monitor are&#xD;
      placed to measure cardiac output. Baseline reading of cardiac output will be recorded before&#xD;
      any intervention using NCCOM3 cardiodynamic monitor. . From this apparatus we will get HR,&#xD;
      EF, CO /CI, SVR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine blood flow evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline uterine blood flow will be recorded in the holding area and before any intervention&#xD;
      using SONO Ace R5 by the obstetric supervisor. Colour Doppler ultrasound will be used to&#xD;
      demonstrate the main ascending branches of left and right uterine arteries as they cross over&#xD;
      the hypogastric vessels just before they enter the uterus at the uterine-cervical junction.&#xD;
      The high pass filter was set at 125 Hz and the uterine artery will be obtained immediately&#xD;
      after the crossing of the hypogastric artery. The sample vol¬ume will be placed on the artery&#xD;
      with an angle of about 0°. After detection of blood flow and visu¬alization of the waveform&#xD;
      of the uterine artery, five blood flow indices will be automatically cal¬culated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pulsatility index (PI) (PI=PSV-EDV/TAMXV); The resistance index (RI) (RI=PSV-EDV/PSV);&#xD;
      The peak systolic velocity (PSV, units of cm/s); The end-diastolic velocity (EDV, units of&#xD;
      cm/s). TAMXV: Time averaged maximum velocity PSV: Peak systolic velocity. EDV: End-diastolic&#xD;
      velocity At least three consecutive correctly imaged blood flow velocity waveforms will be&#xD;
      analyzed; both right and left uterine arteries diameters will be measured on a perpendicular&#xD;
      B-mode view of the longitudinal vessel section at maxi¬mum magnification. Mean values of&#xD;
      bilateral uterine RI and PI will be used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then intravenous cannula 18 G will be inserted into forearm vein under local anesthesia and&#xD;
      no premeditated drugs will be given to all women. Ringer's Lactate solution 10ml/kg will be&#xD;
      infused for all women participating in the study over 20-30-minutes, and then will be&#xD;
      transferred to the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parturient in the operating room:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The previous monitoring data will be recorded again for the second time (including vital&#xD;
      data, maternal non-invasive cardiac output and uterine blood flow). Then the study solutions&#xD;
      will be started to infuse according to the previous description ( to prevent hypotension&#xD;
      mostly occur with spinal anesthesia during cesarean section).Then subarachnoid block will be&#xD;
      carried out under complete aseptic condition while the in the sitting position and the table&#xD;
      in the horizontal level using 25 G pencil point spinal needle, intrathecal block will be&#xD;
      performed at level of L 3-4 or L 4-5 vertebral interspaces, 12.5 mg (2.5 ml) of hyperbaric&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.5% and 300 ug morphine sulphate will be injected intrathecally at the rate of&#xD;
      1ml/15 second (12) in all parturients for anesthesia. Immediately after end of injection of&#xD;
      drugs intrathecally, the parturient will be placed in the supine position with left uterine&#xD;
      displacement. Sensory block will be assessed using loss of sensation in response to cold&#xD;
      sensation using piece of ice along midclavicular line bilaterally every 2 minutes until reach&#xD;
      the level of T5 dermatome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third monitoring reading of the vital data, maternal non-invasive cardiac output and&#xD;
      uterine blood flow will be taken 15 minutes after spinal block and before the surgical&#xD;
      operation (cesarean section) starts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After subarachnoid block all will be monitored for HR, NIBP, SpO2 and RR every 5 minutes till&#xD;
      the end of the surgery. All parturients will be continuously monitored intra-operatively for&#xD;
      any episodes of hypotension, hypertension, bradycardia or tachycardia. Hypotension: defined&#xD;
      as more than 20% decrease in maternal systolic blood pressure from the baseline. It will be&#xD;
      treated with intravenous crystalloid fluid bolus or drug boluses (1 ml) of the study drug&#xD;
      according the groupwhen needed. The total dose of drug boluses will be calculated when used.&#xD;
      Hypertension defined as more than 29% increase in maternal systolic blood pressure from the&#xD;
      baseline, if occurred, drug infusion will be stopped until the effect ends, then the infusion&#xD;
      will be started again. If relapse occur for 2 times, the drug infusion will be stopped and&#xD;
      the case will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial blood sample will be collected from the fetal umbilical cord immediately through&#xD;
      double clamp segment after birth (about 10 cm of umbilical cord during clamping will be&#xD;
      sufficient to withdraw the sample). Analysis of the fetal umbilical arterial blood gas will&#xD;
      be performed. An umbilical blood PH of less than 7.2 will be considered fetal acidosis (19).&#xD;
      To assess the acid-base status and oxygenation of the fetus at delivery. Blood is drawn&#xD;
      separately with heparinized syringes from both an umbilical artery and umbilical vein from a&#xD;
      doubly clamped segment of the umbilical cord. If both umbilical vein and artery blood show&#xD;
      low PO2 (below 30 and 15 mmHg) and high pco2 (above 40 and 50 mmHg) , respectively&#xD;
      uteroplacental insufficiency was present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All newborns will be evaluated by pediatrician regarding the APGAR score at 1st. and 5th&#xD;
      .minutes of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      1- The difference in maternal cardiac output between the study groups Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The difference in uterine blood flow indices by Doppler&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The difference of intraoperative maternal vital singes.&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. Complications or side effects of medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Parturient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected and will be analyzed using SPSS version 20 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago,&#xD;
      Illinios, USA). Normally distributed numerical data will be presented as mean +_SD, rang,&#xD;
      number and percentage. Numerical variables will be compared among the three groups using the&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney test. Categorical variables will be compared among the&#xD;
      three groups using the Chi-Square test and Fisher's exact test. P-value of less than 0.05&#xD;
      will be considered significant.&#xD;
