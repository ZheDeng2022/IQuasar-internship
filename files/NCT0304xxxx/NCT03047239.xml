    <textblock>
      Baseline 24-hour SENSIMED Triggerfish (TF) recordings as well as functional and structural&#xD;
      vision tests measured prospectively every 3 months over a 2-year period, will be used to&#xD;
      model TF's ability to serve as a risk factor for individual progression rates.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma subjects will be selected based on scheduled appointments (consecutive selection)&#xD;
      and clinic records such as patient databases (convenience selection) and invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study. After having signed and dated the informed consent form, they will&#xD;
      receive an appointment for a screening visit, during which they will undergo an ophthalmic&#xD;
      examination and review of their medical and ophthalmic history as well as prior and current&#xD;
      treatments. The eye at higher risk of disease progression will be selected for the study if&#xD;
      both eyes are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On study day 0 (SD0), subjects will receive TF for a 24-hour recording of the profile of&#xD;
      ocular dimensional changes, starting between 11 am and 3 pm, with simultaneous recording of&#xD;
      24-hour blood pressure (BP). The recordings will be carried out in ambulatory conditions with&#xD;
      the subjects pursuing as close to normal daily activities as possible. Subject activities&#xD;
      will be captured in a logbook. After completion of the recording, subjects will receive an&#xD;
      ophthalmic exam to exclude or adequately address any side effects and provide the logbook to&#xD;
      the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3-month intervals following the TF recording until 2 years after the TF recording,&#xD;
      follow-up visits will be scheduled for assessment of the visual field (VF), the retinal nerve&#xD;
      fiber layer (RNFL) thickness by optical coherence tomography (OCT), optic disc photo and&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP). 24-hour TF recording (starting at the same time as on SD0) will&#xD;
      be performed at 1 and 2 years and, if glaucoma subjects undergo a glaucoma surgery in the&#xD;
      follow-up period, an additional 24-hour TF profile will be recorded approximately 3 months&#xD;
      after the intervention (again starting at the same time as on SD0).&#xD;
