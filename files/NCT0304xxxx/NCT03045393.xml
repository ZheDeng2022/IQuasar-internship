  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine how 2 doses mirvetuximab soravtansine affects&#xD;
      the amount and activity of folate receptor alpha proteins in tumor cells of patients who have&#xD;
      completed standard neoadjuvant treatment and are scheduled to have their tumors surgically&#xD;
      removed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The folate receptor alpha protein is important in tumor growth and can be over-expressed in&#xD;
      some tumor cells. The word &quot;over-expressed&quot; in this situation means that there are too many&#xD;
      copies of the protein on the surface of the cell when compared to a healthy, normal cell, and&#xD;
      this helps the tumor continue to grow in size. Mirvetuximab soravtansine acts by targeting&#xD;
      the folate receptor in tumor cells. In animal models, mirvetuximab soravtansine is highly&#xD;
      effective in decreasing tumor size. This suggests that mirvetuximab soravtansine may help&#xD;
      shrink or stop growth of folate receptor alpha positive breast cancer in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigator will be looking at how folate receptor alpha expression&#xD;
      changes following 2 doses of neoadjuvant mirvetuximab soravtansine. The investigator will&#xD;
      also look to evaluate the safety of this regimen, measure any change in tumor size, associate&#xD;
      folate receptor alpha expression with a change in tumor size, and describe any changes in&#xD;
      Ki-67 and percent of apoptotic cells in this population.&#xD;
