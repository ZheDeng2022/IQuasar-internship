      The goal of this research study is to learn how useful a wearable exercise tracker watch is&#xD;
      to monitor your physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Inpatient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete a questionnaire about any symptoms&#xD;
      you may have had in the past 24 hours. The questionnaire should take about 5 minutes to&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive a wearable exercise tracker watch and an iPod touch. You should wear the&#xD;
      exercise tracker watch on your wrist for 24 hours a day (or as much as possible) while you&#xD;
      are in the acute inpatient rehabilitation unit, even when you sleep. The iPod touch will be&#xD;
      used to sync the data from the tracker watch to the study's activity database so the study&#xD;
      team can view your activity. Instructions on how to use the tracker and how to sync the&#xD;
      trackers to the iPod touch will be given to you and demonstrated by the research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research coordinator will be available to help you with any issues you may have while&#xD;
      taking part in the study and will call you to answer any questions. You will be called on Day&#xD;
      3 (+/- 2 days) of the study and again at the end of the study. These calls should last about&#xD;
      5 minutes each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wearable tracker will record your steps, sleep time, time spent doing physical activity,&#xD;
      heart rate, and distance. You may choose to record the food you eat and mood. Your ability to&#xD;
      keep wearing the watch will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should wear the band loosely enough that it can move back and forth on your wrist. If it&#xD;
      becomes too bothersome, you can take the watch off and put it back on after an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should regularly clean the band and your wrist, especially after your rehabilitation&#xD;
      sessions. Rinse the band with water or wipe it with a small amount of rubbing alcohol. Do not&#xD;
      use hand soap, body soap, dish soap, hand sanitizers, cleaning wipes or household cleaners&#xD;
      which could get trapped beneath the band and irritate your skin. Always dry the band well&#xD;
      before putting it back on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any of the devices are lost, stolen, or broken, you should tell the study staff right&#xD;
      away. They will be replaced at no cost to you as long as you have followed the study doctor's&#xD;
      instructions. After you complete the study, we ask that you return the devices to the study&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 24 hours before you are discharged, you will return the devices to the research staff.&#xD;
      You will be asked to complete the same questionnaire about your symptoms and a questionnaire&#xD;
      about your experience with the wearable exercise tracker. These questionnaires should take&#xD;
      about 10 minutes total to complete. If you are unable to complete them in person, you will be&#xD;
      given the option to complete them over the phone or electronically after you have been&#xD;
      discharged. If you choose to complete them electronically, your e-mail address will be&#xD;
      collected so the survey link can be sent to you. We ask that you complete the questionnaires&#xD;
      within 1 week after you are discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information will be collected from your medical records about your daily living at the&#xD;
      beginning and at the end of the study. Basic information, such as your name, date of birth,&#xD;
      race, gender, economic background, and medical record number will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You participation on this study will be over after you complete the second set of&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete 2 questionnaires about any&#xD;
      symptoms you may have had in the past 24 hours and your current level of physical function.&#xD;
      These should take about 10 minutes total to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive a wearable exercise tracker watch and an iPod touch. You should wear the&#xD;
      exercise tracker watch on your wrist for 24 hours a day (or as much as possible) while you&#xD;
      are in the acute inpatient rehabilitation unit, even when you sleep. The iPod touch will be&#xD;
      used to sync the data from the tracker watch to the study's activity database so the study&#xD;
      team can view your activity. Instructions on how to use the tracker and how to sync the&#xD;
      trackers to the iPod touch will be given to you and demonstrated by the research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research coordinator will be available to help you with any issues you may have while&#xD;
      taking part in the study and will call you to answer any questions. You will be called on Day&#xD;
      3 (+/- 2 days) of the study and again at the end of the study. These calls should last about&#xD;
      5 minutes each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wearable tracker will record your steps, sleep time, time spent doing physical activity,&#xD;
      heart rate, and distance. You may choose to record the food you eat and mood. Your ability to&#xD;
      keep wearing the watch will be measured. No identifying information will be used on the&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should wear the band loosely enough that it can move back and forth on your wrist. If it&#xD;
      becomes too bothersome, you can take the watch off and put it back on after an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should regularly clean the band and your wrist, especially after your rehabilitation&#xD;
      sessions. Rinse the band with water or wipe it with a small amount of rubbing alcohol. Do not&#xD;
      use hand soap, body soap, dish soap, hand sanitizers, cleaning wipes or household cleaners&#xD;
      which could get trapped beneath the band and irritate your skin. Always dry the band well&#xD;
      before putting it back on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any of the devices are lost, stolen, or broken, you should tell the study staff right&#xD;
      away. They will be replaced at no cost to you as long as you have followed the study doctor's&#xD;
      instructions. After you complete the study, we ask that you return the devices to the study&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 14-day period, you will be called by the study staff to remind you to&#xD;
      complete the same 2 questionnaires about your symptoms and level of physical function. You&#xD;
      will complete another questionnaire about your experience with the wearable exercise tracker.&#xD;
      These questionnaires should take about 15 minutes total to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you choose to complete these forms electronically, they will be made available online with&#xD;
      a link on the iPod. You may also choose to complete the questionnaires over the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to return the wearable tracker and iPod Touch to the research coordinator&#xD;
      at your next routine clinic visit. If you are unable to return to the clinic, you will be&#xD;
      asked to mail back the devices with the FedEx postage paid envelope provided to you when you&#xD;
      started the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic information, such as your name, date of birth, race, gender, economic background, and&#xD;
      medical record number will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
