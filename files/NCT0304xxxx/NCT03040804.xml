      To establish the safety of radiotherapy in the treatment of advanced hidradenitis&#xD;

      This is a phase I clinical trial using a Simon-two stage design to establish the safety of&#xD;
      radiotherapy in the treatment of advanced hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). In the first six&#xD;
      months, 6 patients will be enrolled, if the patients in the study do not meet the termination&#xD;
      criteria, then the study will extend to a second stage. A maximum of 20 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Patients will be treated with skin-directed radiotherapy, using a total&#xD;
      prescription dose of 7.5 Gy in five fractions of 1.5 Gy over one week. Patients will then be&#xD;
      seen in the HS specialty clinic at Montefiore Medial Center for at least three months.&#xD;
      Quality of life changes, immunohistochemical changes, and cutaneous discharge will also be&#xD;
      evaluated during the study period.&#xD;

    <description>Number of participants with HS who experience treatment-related CTCAE version 4.0 Grade ≥3 adverse events during radiotherapy or within 3 months of radiotherapy completion. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) is an internationally accepted standard for defining and categorizing adverse events based on severity of reported adverse events. The grading scheme is from 1 (least severe) to 5 (most severe). For radiotherapy associated adverse events, CTCAE version 4.0 will be applied to &quot;Rash: dermatitis associated with radiation&quot;.&#xD;
Grade 1. Mild: Faint erythema or dry desquamation. Grade 2. Moderate: Moderate to brisk erythema; patchy moist desquamation, mostly confined to skin folds and creases; moderate edema.&#xD;
Grade 3. Severe: Moist desquamation other than skin folds and creases; bleeding induced by minor trauma or abrasion.&#xD;
Grade 4. Life threatening: Skin necrosis or ulceration of full thickness dermis; spontaneous bleeding from involved site.&#xD;

          <title>Number of Participants With HS Who Experience Treatment-related Grade ≥3 Adverse Events During Radiotherapy or Within 3 Months of Radiotherapy Completion, Assessed Using CTCAE Version 4.0</title>
          <description>Number of participants with HS who experience treatment-related CTCAE version 4.0 Grade ≥3 adverse events during radiotherapy or within 3 months of radiotherapy completion. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) is an internationally accepted standard for defining and categorizing adverse events based on severity of reported adverse events. The grading scheme is from 1 (least severe) to 5 (most severe). For radiotherapy associated adverse events, CTCAE version 4.0 will be applied to &quot;Rash: dermatitis associated with radiation&quot;.&#xD;
Grade 1. Mild: Faint erythema or dry desquamation. Grade 2. Moderate: Moderate to brisk erythema; patchy moist desquamation, mostly confined to skin folds and creases; moderate edema.&#xD;
Grade 3. Severe: Moist desquamation other than skin folds and creases; bleeding induced by minor trauma or abrasion.&#xD;
Grade 4. Life threatening: Skin necrosis or ulceration of full thickness dermis; spontaneous bleeding from involved site.&#xD;
