  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pegylated-interferon (Peg-IFN) α-2a, entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)&#xD;
      are current recommended first-line antiviral therapies for chronic hepatitis B (CHB).&#xD;
      Compared with Peg-IFN therapy, nucleot(s)ide analogue (NUC) therapy has the advantages of&#xD;
      having a potent antiviral effect, and good tolerance without side effect. The long-term&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of ETV and TDF therapy had also been identified. However, poor durability&#xD;
      of the effectiveness after stopping NUC therapy are encountered in the majority of patients.&#xD;
      Previous study identified a high HBV relapse rate of over 50% in HBeAg- positive CHB patients&#xD;
      treated with lamivudine. A recent study investigating the post-treatment durability of ETV&#xD;
      showed that higher to 45.3% of the HBeAg-negative CHB patients happened a clinical relapse&#xD;
      within 1-year after stopping ETV therapy. TDF is another recommended first line NUC with high&#xD;
      potency and high genetic barrier. Although the efficacy of long-term TDF therapy had been&#xD;
      identified, there is lack of data regarding the off-therapy response in CHB patients with TDF&#xD;
      therapy currently. Only a small scale of patients treated with TDF were included in a recent&#xD;
      study investigating off-therapy relapse in non-cirrhotic HBeAg-negative CHB patients after&#xD;
      greater than 4 years of NUC therapy. In addition, the factors associated with off-therapy&#xD;
      response are also still uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enrolled 400 CHB patients who had received oral antiviral therapy&#xD;
      ETV or TDF and achieved the Asia Pacific association of the study of liver (APASL) criteria&#xD;
      of stopping NUC therapy. The aims of the study are to investigate the rate of HBV relapse&#xD;
      including virological and clinical relapse in all and between patients with ETV and TDF&#xD;
      therapy, and to identify the predictive factors of relapse.&#xD;
