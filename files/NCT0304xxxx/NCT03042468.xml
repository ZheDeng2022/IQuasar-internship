      Phase I dose escalation study with 177Lu-PSMA-617 using dose fractionation regimen will be&#xD;
      performed in patients with documented progressive metastatic CRPC. The cumulative 177Lu dose&#xD;
      [100 mCi (3.7 GBq) - 600 mCi (22.2 GBq)] will be escalated in up to 6 different dose levels&#xD;
      (3 + 3 study design). Additional 10 subjects will be enrolled at the MTD dose level to&#xD;
      further assess safety and tolerability and to obtain a preliminary assessment of efficacy.&#xD;
      The study will enroll adult males 18 years of age or older with documented progressive&#xD;
      metastatic CRPC. The primary objectives are: - To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
      of fractionated dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 - To determine the maximal tolerated and recommended&#xD;
      phase II dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in a 2-week dose-fractionation regimen Subjects will receive&#xD;
      the following study interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 177Lu-PSMA-617 [50mCi (1.85GBq) - 300mCi (11.1GBq)] intravenous X2 doses, 2 weeks apart&#xD;
           (Visit 1 and 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC [5 ±2mCi or 185 ±74MBq] intravenous during screening and at 12 weeks&#xD;
           with standard imaging Subjects will be on this study from screening to end of study (day&#xD;
           85).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment phase comprises of 8 visits over 12 weeks. Patients will be followed until&#xD;
      death for survival assessment. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events&#xD;
      will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event. All tests and&#xD;
      procedures performed on this study are routine and standard of care except: 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC&#xD;
      PET/CT scan, administration of investigational agent 177Lu-PSMA-617, research blood samples&#xD;
      (CTCs for research, cell-free DNA sample), and PSMA testing on archive tissue.&#xD;
