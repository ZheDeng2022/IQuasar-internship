      The present collaborative R01 study, between Cornell and Johns Hopkins, aims to compare&#xD;
      Problem Adaptation Therapy for Mild Cognitively Impaired Older Adults (PATH-MCI) vs.&#xD;
      Supportive Therapy for Cognitively Impaired Older Adults (ST-CI) in improving cognitive,&#xD;
      affective and functioning outcomes. Psychotherapy, also known as talking therapy, is the use&#xD;
      of psychological methods to help a person change and overcome problems in desired ways.&#xD;
      PATH-MCI differs from standard of care psychotherapy by offering a combination of emotion&#xD;
      regulation techniques with the provision of environmental adaptation tools (notes,&#xD;
      checklists, calendars, etc.), the use of the WellPATH app, and the participation of a willing&#xD;
      and available caregiver. Supportive Therapy incorporates standard of care approaches by using&#xD;
      non-specific techniques to provide a supportive environment and help patients to express&#xD;
      their feelings &amp; focus on their strengths and abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to randomize 80 treatment subjects, older adults (40 at Cornell and 40&#xD;
      at Johns Hopkins) with MCI-depression. 80 study partners may also be potentially recruited.&#xD;
      Both sites have shown feasibility of recruitment, randomization, retention, and assessment&#xD;
      procedures for patients with MCI. Cornell has shown evidence of administration of PATH in&#xD;
      this population. Certified mental health clinicians in PATH-MCI and ST-CI will administer 15&#xD;
      in-office sessions in six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to compare the effects of 15 sessions (12 weekly in first 12 weeks&#xD;
      and 3 monthly booster sessions afterwards) of PATH-MCI vs. ST-CI in 80 older adults&#xD;
      (treatment subjects) with MCI-depression. Research assistants, unaware of study hypotheses&#xD;
      and participant randomization status, will perform research assessments at baseline and at 6&#xD;
      (no cognitive measures), 12, 24, 36 (no cognitive measures) and 52 weeks after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will also be optional blood draws at study entry, 12, and 52 weeks. The purpose of the&#xD;
      blood draws is to better understand whether response to psychotherapy treatment is affected&#xD;
      by genes, by inflammation, or by the possible memory factor called BDNF (brain-derived&#xD;
      neurotrophic factor). Also, all therapy sessions will be audiotaped (if the patient consents)&#xD;
      and Dr. Shermer (a clinician outside of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry)&#xD;
      will evaluate randomly selected sessions and rate the therapists' adherence and competence&#xD;
      based on the PATH-MCI and ST Adherence Scales&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study partner will provide information about the treatment subject and participate in&#xD;
      treatment if agreed by the treatment subject. To explore the effects of PATH-MCI on the study&#xD;
      partner, the investigators will collect the following data from the study partner:&#xD;
      demographic, burden (Short Zarit Burden interview), and treatment satisfaction (Client&#xD;
      Satisfaction Questionnaire).&#xD;
