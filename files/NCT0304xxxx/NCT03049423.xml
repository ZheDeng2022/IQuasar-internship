  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the results of multi-position MRI scans for ankle ligaments and tendons to clarify&#xD;
      how to obtain imaging data of different ankle ligaments and define severity of injuries to&#xD;
      calculate the rate of correct diagnosis, thereby developing a reasonable surgical treatment&#xD;
      in clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ankle joint is an important part of the human lower limb. It has the function of&#xD;
      maintaining the normal standing of the human body, supporting and bearing the body weight and&#xD;
      conducting movements. As one of the complex joints of the human body, its surrounding&#xD;
      ligaments and tendons not only play an important protective effect on it, but also play a&#xD;
      fixed role in the movement of the ankle to effectively prevent excessive ankle varus/valgus.&#xD;
      Ankle fractures account for approximately 3.9% of total body fractures, ranking the first in&#xD;
      intra-articular fractures. An ankle injury is often accompanied by intra-articular fractures&#xD;
      and surrounding ligament rupture. With the increasing requirements for joint functions and&#xD;
      clinical surgery, inappropriate treatment for ankle ligament injury can result in limited&#xD;
      movement function of the ankle, and even lead to traumatic arthritis and chronic ankle&#xD;
      instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X-ray examinations are routinely preferred for the diagnosis of ankle injury, which can make&#xD;
      an accurate diagnosis of ankle dislocation and fracture. However, X-ray plain film has a low&#xD;
      resolution for tendon and ligament lesions, which is easy to result in missed diagnosis of&#xD;
      mild fractures, bone contusion and occult fractures, and moreover, it is difficult to fully&#xD;
      clear the location, type and degree of ankle injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI has high definition and resolution to implement a multi-parameter multi-directional&#xD;
      scanning. Its histopathological findings can accurately and objectively display ankle and&#xD;
      surrounding ligament injuries and their severity. MRI is able to display the anatomic&#xD;
      structure and severity of ligament injury of the ankle on three anatomic planes: transverse,&#xD;
      sagittal and coronal. Sagittal MRI is a good helper for diagnosis of Achilles tendon lesion,&#xD;
      which can clearly show the talus, posterior tibial tendon, talocalcaneal joint, Achilles&#xD;
      tendon, subtalar joint, articulatio talonavicularis, tibiotalar joint, and the cartilage and&#xD;
      joint cavities. Coronal MRI can clearly show structures of the peroneal joint, tibiotalar&#xD;
      joint, and lateral malleolus, especially the articular surface between the tibia, fibula and&#xD;
      the ankle bone as well as between the ligament fibula and the ankle bone; and meanwhile, it&#xD;
      can display the posterior tibial ligament, posterior talofibular ligament and posterior&#xD;
      tibial tendon. Transverse MRI well shows the tibiofibular ligament, and anterior talofibular&#xD;
      ligament. The ankle ligament mainly consists of three parts: the lateral collateral ligament,&#xD;
      medial collateral ligament and tibiofibular ligament. Activities of the ankle refer to&#xD;
      flexion and extension along the sagittal plane, including plantar flexion and dorsiflexion,&#xD;
      to play a role of supporting and bearing, movement conduction and function as a lever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events If expected or unexpected adverse events (such as headache and nausea) during&#xD;
      the MRI detection, the date of occurrence, type of injury and therapeutic managements will be&#xD;
      recorded. Severe adverse events, including a requirement for immediate surgery, damage to&#xD;
      patient's work ability, life-threatening events or death will be reported to the project&#xD;
      manager and the institution review board within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection, management, analysis and open access All data will be collected on a case&#xD;
      report form, recorded electronically and saved in a dedicated computer. Continuous variables&#xD;
      from each record will be collected for descriptive statistical analysis, to allow real-time&#xD;
      review and identify any potential deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validity of the data will be assessed by the censor once every 6 months through a random&#xD;
      sampling of 10% of the database. Only the researchers participating in the study will have&#xD;
      the right to query the database that will not be modified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be completed by professional statisticians who will responsible for&#xD;
      a statistical report. The statistical results will be given to the project manager, who will&#xD;
      be responsible for writing the research report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anonymized trial data will be released at www.figshare.com.&#xD;
