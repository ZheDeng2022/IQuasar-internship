  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IIa trial studies how well recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      work in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in&#xD;
      the body or head and neck squamous cell cancer that has come back or spread to other places&#xD;
      in the body. Recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving&#xD;
      recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein and pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients&#xD;
      with non-small cell lung or head and neck squamous cell cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the response rate of the combination of pembrolizumab and recombinant EphB4-HSA&#xD;
      fusion protein (sEphB4-HSA) as combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the biomarkers of response. II. Determine the unique toxicities of the&#xD;
      combination of pembrolizumab and sEphB4-HSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and recombinant&#xD;
      EphB4-HSA fusion protein IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 3&#xD;
      weeks for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
