    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of low frequency, low intensity&#xD;
      ultrasound treatment on wound healing and health-related quality of life with a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial of patients with venous ulcers or diabetic ulcers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The two most common types of chronic wounds are venous ulcers (VUs) and diabetic ulcers&#xD;
      (DUs). The investigators will conduct the first double-blind randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) to test the effect of low-frequency, low-intensity (LFLI) ultrasound (US) on chronic&#xD;
      wound healing and health related quality of life (HRQOL) with high statistical confidence (Î±&#xD;
      &lt; 0.05, power &gt; 0.90, n=60 VUs, n=60 DUs). The investigators' approach combines this active&#xD;
      therapy with non-invasive diagnostic monitoring of wound hemodynamics throughout the&#xD;
      treatment cycle, and includes analysis of the impact of nutritional status and inflammation&#xD;
      on wound closure. There are several innovative aspects of this work. Specifically, (1) The&#xD;
      lightweight, battery-powered applicator is the first potentially wearable ultrasound wound&#xD;
      therapy device that is safe to apply for extended periods of time. (2) The applicator&#xD;
      actively promotes healing, which is fundamentally different from commercial ultrasonic&#xD;
      systems that remove necrotic tissue only. (3) The study approach will link LFLI US exposure&#xD;
      to changes in wound hemodynamics and HRQOL, which has the potential to enable personalized&#xD;
      medicine. (4) The analysis of patient nutritional and systemic inflammatory status may enable&#xD;
      further treatment customization by identifying those patients most likely to benefit from&#xD;
      LFLI US therapy. (5) The study approach incorporates both disease-specific and generic&#xD;
      measures of HRQOL, which is unique for a therapeutic ultrasound RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The low-frequency, low-intensity (20 kiloHertz (kHz), &lt;100 milliWatt per square centimeter&#xD;
      (mW/cm2) spatial peak-temporal peak), portable ultrasound applicator is lightweight (&lt;25g)&#xD;
      and permits safe and clinically pragmatic wound treatment. The field parameters of the US&#xD;
      device were previously optimized for venous ulcers, and three recent pilot clinical human&#xD;
      studies (VUs: n=20, n=25; DUs: n=10) demonstrated that the treatment improved healing by 15%&#xD;
      per week compared to sham treatment. The investigators therefore anticipate that our&#xD;
      treatment will accelerate closure of chronic wounds, and hypothesize that (1) LFLI US will&#xD;
      improve generic and disease-specific HRQOL scores, (2) LFLI US will activate beneficial&#xD;
      changes in the microvasculature of the wound and surrounding tissue, and (3) individuals with&#xD;
      poor nutrition and high levels of inflammation will have delayed wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are to: (1) Assess the effect of LFLI US on VUs and DUs by measuring wound&#xD;
      closure as a primary endpoint and generic and disease-specific HRQOL as secondary endpoints.&#xD;
      (2) Monitor the effects of LFLI US on wound perfusion and oxygenation using non-invasive&#xD;
      optical methods, and (3) Determine the impact of nutritional status and inflammation on&#xD;
      closure of DUs and VUs. Overall, this work will validate LFLI US as a safe, portable, and&#xD;
      cost-effective therapy for chronic wounds. This is important because new therapies and&#xD;
      improved clinical paradigms for wound management are urgently needed. Over the long-term, the&#xD;
      study findings may enable the development of personalized wound treatment regimens across&#xD;
      care settings.&#xD;
