    <textblock>
      This study is designed to identify Dermatophagoides farinae, or Der f, sensitive asthmatics&#xD;
      who demonstrate a late phase asthmatic response after Der f inhalation. These subjects may be&#xD;
      invited to participate in a planned future study investigating novel asthma treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is an increasingly common chronic illness among children and adults, and allergen&#xD;
      exposure is among the most common common triggers for asthma exacerbations. Exacerbations of&#xD;
      allergic asthma are characterized by an early phase response (EPR), mediated by release of&#xD;
      preformed mediators like histamine from mast cells, and a late phase response (LPR) 3-7 hours&#xD;
      later mediated by chemokines and cytokines that attract leukocytes such as neutrophils and&#xD;
      eosinophils to the airways, increase mucus production, trigger airway smooth muscle&#xD;
      contraction, and result in airway constriction and airway hyperreactivity (AHR). The LPR does&#xD;
      not occur in the absence of an EPR. The LPR is thought to be predominantly responsible for&#xD;
      the symptoms associated with acute exacerbations of allergic asthma and is often used as the&#xD;
      measure of efficacy in trials of asthma therapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This group has taken a particular interest in targeting an inflammatory cytokine,&#xD;
      Interleukin-1β, involved in both the early and late phase asthmatic responses to inhaled&#xD;
      allergen in allergic asthmatics. In the lung, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) is produced by&#xD;
      numerous cell types (including epithelial cells, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, and&#xD;
      mast cells), where it signals through its receptor to induce transcription of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory genes (17-19). IL-1β is increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from&#xD;
      persons with symptomatic asthma vs. those with asymptomatic asthma; likewise,&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry of bronchial biopsies of allergic asthmatics reveal increased expression&#xD;
      of IL-1β in both bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages. Previous studies in animal and&#xD;
      in vitro models demonstrate that IL-1β can directly impact three aspects of an airway&#xD;
      inflammatory response: 1). granulocyte (neutrophil/eosinophil) recruitment; 2). non-specific&#xD;
      (23, 24) and allergen-specific airway reactivity; and 3). production and clearance of airway&#xD;
      mucous. Supporting literature and preliminary studies in human subjects further promote the&#xD;
      study of IL-1 blockade for mitigating features of acute allergen-induced asthma exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of IL-1 in allergen challenge models has not been fully defined. In a study&#xD;
      examining 12 asthmatics allergic to D. farinae at this research center, we found that 9/12&#xD;
      asthmatics had a greater than 10% reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)&#xD;
      after inhaled dust mite challenge. These individuals were considered responders. It was&#xD;
      notable that when comparing post-allergen levels of cytokines between responders and&#xD;
      non-responders there was a much greater concentration of IL-1β in post-challenge sputum from&#xD;
      responders vs. nonresponders, Furthermore, within the responders, post challenge IL-1β also&#xD;
      significantly correlated with sputum eosinophil concentrations (r=0.83, P&lt;0.05) and&#xD;
      neutrophil concentrations (r=0.89, P&lt;0.05) 24 hours after allergen challenge. These data&#xD;
      suggest that IL-1β may play a role in both immediate airway hyperresponsiveness and the late&#xD;
      phase recruitment of inflammatory cells (neutrophils and eosinophils) after inhaled allergen&#xD;
      challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to better understand the role of IL-1β in allergen-induced airway inflammation,&#xD;
      induced sputum will be obtained to determine if higher baseline sputum IL-1β concentrations&#xD;
      or larger increases in IL-1β following allergen challenge impact non-specific airway&#xD;
      hyperresponsiveness (via methacholine challenge), sputum granulocyte recruitment (neutrophil&#xD;
      and eosinophil counts and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), a marker of airway eosinophilia), or&#xD;
      changes in expression of inflammatory or allergy-related genes. To this last point, little is&#xD;
      known about the mechanisms contributing to response patterns in allergic asthmatics&#xD;
      undergoing allergen challenge. Changes in gene expression occurring during the window of time&#xD;
      between the EPR and LPR, as these expression changes may dictate whether or not a LPR occurs&#xD;
      or to what extent it occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this screening protocol is to identify subjects who exhibit both an EPR and LPR&#xD;
      and who will be eligible for enrollment in the yet to be developed Il-1β protocols. Subjects&#xD;
      will undergo a baseline methacholine challenge to establish reactivity, then allergen&#xD;
      exposure, followed 24 hours later by methacholine challenge.&#xD;
