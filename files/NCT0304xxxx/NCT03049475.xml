      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a blood disorder that occurs mainly in people of African&#xD;
      descent. Researchers want to learn more about the painful attacks and complications&#xD;
      associated with SCD. They want to look for a relationship between SCD and specific changes in&#xD;
      the blood. They want to study the role of genetics, inflammation, and blood clotting factors&#xD;
      in SCD. They will do this with blood samples collected during an acute painful attack and in&#xD;
      between attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the painful attacks and complications associated with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18-80 with SCD or who are healthy Africans or African Americans without SCD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy participants will have one visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with SCD will have their first visit when they are not having a pain&#xD;
           attack. They will have their next visit during a pain attack. About 3-4 months after&#xD;
           this attack, they will have a final visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits will include a physical exam, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have their blood samples used for genetic testing for research.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Episodic pain is the most common acute morbidity and the leading cause of hospitalization in&#xD;
      patients with sickle cell disease. It is caused by microvaso-occlusion induced by sickled red&#xD;
      blood cells, an outcome of the polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin S (HbS). Factors&#xD;
      that contribute to the acute sickle pain include the release of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and&#xD;
      heme that initiate a downstream of events involving inflammation and thrombosis, and&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell-free DNA has been shown to be present in plasma of healthy subjects, but elevated in&#xD;
      diseases and conditions that are characterized by increased cell death through necrosis or&#xD;
      apoptosis. Indeed, we have previously shown that cfDNA in patients with sickle cell disease&#xD;
      (SCD) increased dramatically during acute painful episodes. During acute sickle pain, marked&#xD;
      elevation of plasma hemoglobin has also been observed due to the acute increase in sickled&#xD;
      red blood cells and hemolysis. Both cfDNA and heme (break down product of hemoglobin), act as&#xD;
      damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules, initiating endothelial inflammation,&#xD;
      stimulation of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, leukocyte recruitment, and&#xD;
      microvascular thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there have been several studies of cytokines and chemokines in steady state and&#xD;
      acute sickle cell disease, there has been no comprehensive study of how the inflammatory&#xD;
      markers correlate with quantitative levels and profile of cfDNA. In this study, we would like&#xD;
      to apply next generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze cfDNA from the plasma of patients with&#xD;
      SCD in steadystate, and during painful crises to derive insights on the origin of tissue&#xD;
      damage. In parallel with the free plasma DNA, we propose to measure markers of hemolysis and&#xD;
      inflammation (cytokines, chemokines), and to investigate if interactions between these&#xD;
      circulating molecules and blood cells (e.g. neutrophils) have the potential to modulate the&#xD;
      progress and severity of the disease. In addition, we would also like to explore if there is&#xD;
      a distinctive cell-free DNA and inflammatory signature in SCD in steady-state and during&#xD;
      acute vaso-occlusive crises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, this study provides an opportunity to evaluate new biomarkers of sickle cell pain&#xD;
      crisis and to predict disease severity and prognosis. These measures may allow us to better&#xD;
      understand the role of vaso-occlusion, hemolysis, and inflammation-related events and&#xD;
      responses and serve as clinical endpoints in future studies of disease pathogenesis and/or&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention for sickle cell disease.&#xD;
