    <textblock>
      Recent phase III trials have confirmed the efficacy and safety of mirabegron in the treatment&#xD;
      of overactive bladder (OAB) in Europeans, Australians, North Americans, Japanese and Asians.&#xD;
      Whether mirabegron 25mg or 50mg should be used as the first line treatment for OAB has not&#xD;
      been determined yet. The dose effectiveness relationship between 25mg and 50mg mirabegron has&#xD;
      also not been investigated yet. Hence, investigators have conducted this post marketing study&#xD;
      in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety between mirabegron 25mg and 50mg in Taiwanese&#xD;
      people with symptoms of OAB.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is defined as the symptom syndrome with frequency, and&#xD;
      urgency with or without urgency incontinence. OAB affects more than 400 million people&#xD;
      worldwide and has been estimated to affect around 16% of the adult population across Europe&#xD;
      and the USA. In Asian countries, the prevalence of OAB has been reported to be 6% of men and&#xD;
      women aged ≥18 years in China; 12.2% of men and women in Korea;12.4% of men and women aged&#xD;
      ≥40 years in Japan; and 21 to 25% of women and 16.9% of community dwelling adults in Taiwan.&#xD;
      Another study reported that the prevalence of OAB among adult men across 11 Asian countries&#xD;
      (India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, China,&#xD;
      Hong Kong and Thailand) was 29.9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antimuscarinics are first line pharmacotherapy for OAB. However, some patients have a&#xD;
      suboptimal response to antimuscarinics and some may experience adverse effects, such as dry&#xD;
      mouth or constipation. Therefore, a high proportion of patients discontinue antimuscarinic&#xD;
      therapy, with fewer than 25% remaining on treatment at 1 year. There is an unmet need to&#xD;
      develop new drugs for OAB without the bothersome adverse effects of antimuscarinic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      β3-adrenergic receptors are known to promote urine storage in the bladder by inducing&#xD;
      detrusor relaxation in animal and human bladders. In humans, the β3-adrenoceptor is the&#xD;
      predominant β-receptor subtype in the urinary bladder. β3-adrenoceptor agonists relax the&#xD;
      detrusor smooth muscle during the bladder storage phase and increase bladder capacity without&#xD;
      accompanying changes in micturition pressure, residual volume or voiding contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mirabegron is the first β3-adrenoceptor agonist to have been approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      OAB. Pooled safety data indicates that dry mouth, the chief cause of treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation with antimuscarinic agents, occurs with low incidence with mirabegronc.&#xD;
      Hence, mirabegron may be a valuable treatment option for patients with OAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent phase III trials have confirmed the efficacy and safety of mirabegron in the treatment&#xD;
      of OAB in Europeans, Australians, North Americans, Japanese and Asians. Whether mirabegron&#xD;
      25mg or 50mg should be used as the first line treatment for OAB has not been determined yet.&#xD;
      The dose effectiveness relationship between 25mg and 50mg mirabegron has also not been&#xD;
      investigated yet. Hence, investigators have conducted this post-marketing study in order to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety between mirabegron 25mg and 50mg in Taiwanese people with&#xD;
      symptoms of OAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Title: Therapeutic Efficacy and Safety of Mirabegron , a β3-Adrenoceptor Agonist, for&#xD;
      Patients with Overactive Bladder Syndrome in Taiwan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: to evaluate the efficacy of Mirabegron 50 mg vs 25 mg in Taiwanese&#xD;
      patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: to assess safety and tolerability of Mirabegron 50 mg vs 25 mg in&#xD;
      Taiwanese patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other objective: to investigate potential predictive factors of treatment outcome using&#xD;
      baseline demographic (ex. Comorbidity, age, etc.) and urodynamic study findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be accomplished using a computer-generated randomization scheme (Cenduit&#xD;
      GmbH, Allshwil, Switzerland) with stratification by site; allocation to treatment groups at&#xD;
      each site was accomplished via an interactive response system with a study coordinator. Study&#xD;
      visits took place at Week 0 (Visit 1; confirmation of eligibility criteria); Weeks 4, 8 and&#xD;
      12 (Visits 2, 3 and 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be approved by the institutional review board of each study site and conducted&#xD;
      in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice, International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines, and&#xD;
      all applicable laws and regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy End-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint(s): The percentage of patients with a change from baseline to the final&#xD;
      visit in the urgency episodes per 24 hours by 2 or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Secondary efficacy end-points are change from baseline to the final visit in OABSS&#xD;
           score, Patient Perception on Intensity of Urgency Scale (PPIUS), mean number of&#xD;
           frequency episodes, urinary incontinence episodes, urgency incontinence episodes and&#xD;
           nocturia episodes per 24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition. Change from&#xD;
           baseline to each study visit in each efficacy variable will also be measured. An&#xD;
           additional secondary end-point is change from baseline to final visit in the Patient&#xD;
           Perception of the ladder Condition (PPBC) to assess patients' subjective satisfaction of&#xD;
           treatment drugs on bladder conditions. Paper diary will be used in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adverse events (AEs) are assessed at all visits. Safety endpoints are incidence and&#xD;
           severity of AEs, and changes from baseline to end-of-treatment in vital signs (heart&#xD;
           rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures) and laboratory tests (hematology,&#xD;
           biochemistry and urinalysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the predictive factors of treatment outcome using baseline demographic (ex.&#xD;
           comorbidity, age, etc.) and urodynamic study findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPIUS (Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale):&#xD;
&#xD;
      0. No urgency, I felt no need to empty my bladder, but did so for other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mild urgency, I could postpone voiding as long as necessary, without fear of wetting&#xD;
           myself.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Moderate urgency, I could postpone voiding for a short while, without fear of wetting&#xD;
           myself.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Severe urgency, I could postpone voiding, but had to rush to the toilet in order not to&#xD;
           wet myself.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Urge incontinence, I leaked before reaching the toilet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Perception of the ladder Condition (PPBC):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Which of the following statements describes your bladder condition best at the moment? 0: My&#xD;
      bladder condition does not cause me any problems at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. My bladder condition causes me some very minor problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. My bladder condition causes me some minor problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. My bladder condition causes me (some) moderate problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. My bladder condition causes me severe problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. My bladder condition causes me many severe problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments included reporting of adverse events (AEs, all unfavorable signs and&#xD;
      symptoms observed from the start of the run-in period until the end of the follow-up period).&#xD;
      Exacerbation of the symptoms of OAB was not defined as an AE in this clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 574 patients within two years Justification:The sample size for this study was&#xD;
      based on results from a 12-week Phase III study (178-CL-074). In 074 study, the responder&#xD;
      analysis for reduction in urgency episodes for minimum important difference of 1.54 episodes&#xD;
      was 47.1% in the M25 group and 57.7% in the M50 group. In this ISR, the primary efficacy&#xD;
      end-point is the percentage of patients with a change from baseline to the final visit in the&#xD;
      urgency episodes per 24 hours by 2 or greater. The responding rate is assumed as 60% in the&#xD;
      M50 group and 45% in the M25 group. The number of patients per group necessary to demonstrate&#xD;
      superiority to the first group (mirabegron 25mg for 12 weeks) would be 244 at a two-sided&#xD;
      significance level of 5% and power of 90%. Assuming a dropout rate of 15% during the&#xD;
      treatment period, 287 subjects per group are to be enrolled for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will demonstrate that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mirabegron 25mg once-daily for 12 weeks is effective and safe in treatment of patients&#xD;
           with OAB (group 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mirabegron 50mg is effective in improving OAB symptoms when the therapeutic efficacy of&#xD;
           the dose of 25mg mirabegron for 4 weeks is suboptimal (group 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigators will try to search for predictive factors for responders to mirabegron&#xD;
           25mg alone, escalating to mirabegron 50mg, based on the baseline demographics and&#xD;
           urodynamic study findings,&#xD;
