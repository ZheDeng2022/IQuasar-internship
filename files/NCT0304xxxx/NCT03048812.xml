  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental implants are often the preferred treatment option and in some clinical scenarios they&#xD;
      are considered the standard of care to restore missing or damaged teeth, due to the&#xD;
      limitations of conventional treatments. For fully edentulous subjects, conventional&#xD;
      tissue-supported dentures in some cases are associated with severe subjective complaints and&#xD;
      difficult adaptation, mainly the mandibular denture, resulting in limited function and&#xD;
      detrimental effects on oral health-related quality of life, especially for older patients.&#xD;
      The use of implants to retain a mandibular denture (overdenture) has been recommended as a&#xD;
      suitable and low-cost alternative to improve denture stability, with positive effects on oral&#xD;
      comfort and function. The two-implant mandibular overdenture has been considered an effective&#xD;
      design to achieve clinical benefits for patients. However, the main problem facing&#xD;
      two-implant overdenture is the high cost of implantation and the relative complexity of the&#xD;
      surgical intervention, so the use of a single midline implant to retain a mandibular&#xD;
      overdenture was suggested as a more viable solution for reducing costs and complexity of&#xD;
      treatment with similar benefits compared to solutions with higher number of implants.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there are few studies that compared the performance of different retention&#xD;
      systems and their effects on patient-centered outcomes, such as satisfaction with the&#xD;
      dentures, oral health-related quality of life, individual preferences and other subjective&#xD;
      ratings of clinical outcomes. Thus, the aim of this randomized clinical trial with a&#xD;
      crossover design is to investigate the changes in clinical and patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
      following the use of different retention systems for a single implant-retained mandibular&#xD;
      overdenture Hypothesis: it was hypothesized that clinical and patient-reported outcomes of a&#xD;
      single-implant mandibular overdenture is dependent on the type of retention system, and&#xD;
      patients have distinct preferences in relation to different attachments&#xD;

      The absence of all natural teeth has negative effects on edentulous subjects' quality of&#xD;
      life. It affects badly the masticatory muscles, chewing efficiency and digestive process,&#xD;
      ability to speak clearly, psycho-social impacts related to esthetics and non-self-confidence&#xD;
      and it is often associated with increasing risk for chronic systemic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Brazil, tooth loss is still a public health problem with high prevalence and negative&#xD;
      impacts on the lives of individuals, despite the possibility of control by means of&#xD;
      preventive and rehabilitation technologies aimed at promoting oral health. The prevalence of&#xD;
      tooth loss is 76.6% in the general population, with a median of 6 teeth lost for the&#xD;
      population aged 15 or more years old. There is a high prevalence of edentulism in the 65-74&#xD;
      years age group for the maxilla (63.1%) and mandible (37.5%). Epidemiological data showed&#xD;
      that there was an improvement in the oral health status of adults as the demand for dentures.&#xD;
      However, the major problem is still concentrated in the population aged 65 to 74, who had an&#xD;
      average caries index rate of 27.1 in 2010 (in 2003 the average was 27.8) with a predominance&#xD;
      of component lost by decay. From 2003 to 2010, the proportion of elderly people who need&#xD;
      dentures dropped from 24% to 23% and from 16% to 15% for those who need partial dentures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although treatments using implants are widely available, conventional complete dentures are&#xD;
      still an important part of oral health care for edentulous individuals, mainly due to&#xD;
      economic reasons. However, conventional complete dentures do not always achieve all treatment&#xD;
      goals regarding patient satisfaction and function, as a number of edentulous patients have&#xD;
      problems with their dentures related to retention and comfort during mastication and speech,&#xD;
      especially for the mandibular denture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The limitations of conventional dentures make the implant-supported mandibular overdenture be&#xD;
      considered the preferred option for a number of edentulous elders. As stabilization by&#xD;
      implants can increase denture retention and stability, improve masticatory efficiency and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction. Furthermore, there are scientific evidences that it also contributes&#xD;
      for prevention of bone resorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mandibular overdenture retained by two implants has been recommended as the minimum&#xD;
      standard of care for the edentulous mandible. However, these consensus reports consider that&#xD;
      anything less is negligent care disregard who cannot afford two implants, so the main problem&#xD;
      related to implant overdenture is higher financial costs compared to the conventional&#xD;
      complete denture. This is inconsistent with treatment concepts for the elderly, which include&#xD;
      simplicity and cost effectiveness as major requirements in treatment planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the single-implant mandibular overdenture has been proposed as an&#xD;
      alternative to more complex overdenture designs for the treatment of mandibular edentulism.&#xD;
      This treatment approach is assumed to be simpler and less costly than both the fixed implant&#xD;
      treatment and the overdenture retained by two implants. It is also considered a more feasible&#xD;
      option for geriatric patient groups because of their diminished functional demands and the&#xD;
      favorable local bone condition in the symphyseal region that ensures satisfactory primary&#xD;
      implant stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of clinical studies showed satisfactory results of the single-implant mandibular&#xD;
      overdenture treatment regarding patient satisfaction and quality of life measures, as well as&#xD;
      other clinical and radiographic outcomes such as implant survival rate, marginal bone loss&#xD;
      and longitudinal implant stability. Although these studies differed on the experimental&#xD;
      design, use of different implant and retention systems, loading protocols and evaluation of&#xD;
      distinct clinical outcomes, they agree that the use of a single implant to retain an&#xD;
      overdenture results in marked improvements compared to the conventional treatment Attachment&#xD;
      systems used for implant-retained overdentures are small interlocking devices which links the&#xD;
      implant with the dentures and this offer many balanced solutions between functions and oral&#xD;
      comfort. The attachment systems allow an improvement in masticatory function, bite forces,&#xD;
      food selection and quality of life. The retention design can be classified as mechanical,&#xD;
      friction fit or magnetic. There are various attachments available for the clinicians in the&#xD;
      market today such as bar connections, ball attachments, magnets, rigid or non-rigid&#xD;
      telescopic copings and stud attachments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies also reported complications related to the clinical performance of&#xD;
      attachment systems used for single-implant mandibular overdentures. Loss of retention and&#xD;
      matrix replacement was one of the most common maintenance events in single mandibular&#xD;
      overdenture patients, although some studies reported no need for replacement in the long-term&#xD;
      follow-up. Studies showed great variation on the incidence of matrix replacement, although no&#xD;
      comparison of different types of retention systems and no time-to-event analysis were&#xD;
      reported. No difference between the incidence of repair and adjustments of mandibular&#xD;
      overdentures supported by 1 or 2 implants was observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of different attachment types on patient satisfaction and quality of life is&#xD;
      recognized as a critical outcome requiring further investigation. For single-implant&#xD;
      mandibular overdentures, studies reported in their majority the use of ball-o'ring, magnet&#xD;
      and stud attachment systems. However, no evidences of the superiority of one system over&#xD;
      another are available, considering both patient-reported outcomes such as individual&#xD;
      preferences, easy to handle and oral comfort; and technical criteria such as level of&#xD;
      retention, longevity, retrievability and the need of adjustments and replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will focus in improving patient health care quality, satisfaction and treatment&#xD;
      outcomes as it is considered the golden goal for studying clinical benefits from treatments&#xD;
      by comparing between different types of attachments for single-implant mandibular overdenture&#xD;
      treatment. This will be an experimental study using a randomized clinical trial with a&#xD;
      crossover design to test if clinical and patient-reported outcomes are dependent on the type&#xD;
      of retention system, and if patients have distinct preferences about the tested attachments.&#xD;
