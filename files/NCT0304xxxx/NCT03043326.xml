      The purpose of the study is to evaluating the acceptability, use and adherence of a&#xD;
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) program using the co-formulation tenofovir disoproxil&#xD;
      fumarate 300 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg (TDF/FTC) administered daily by mouth, at four health&#xD;
      facilities and one community-based organization providing health care services for MSM and&#xD;
      transgender women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an Observational, longitudinal, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the&#xD;
      acceptability, use and adherence to TDF/FTC-based PrEP in volunteer men who have sex with men&#xD;
      and transgender women at substantial high risk of acquiring HIV, who were prescribed for PrEP&#xD;
      , following the clinical guidelines to prevent HIV infection of the U.S. Centers for Disease&#xD;
      Control and Prevention (2014) and the World Health Organization (2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Participants will be followed for 96 weeks (approximately two years) after the&#xD;
      start of prophylactic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation Target Population: Adults (≥18 years of age), without HIV infection diagnosis,&#xD;
      and who were prescribed with PrEP and have a substantial risk of acquiring HIV infection&#xD;
      according to the international guidelines for HIV prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 1,000 participants&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hypothesis 1. The use of PrEP based on daily intake of TDF/FTC is acceptable for MSM and&#xD;
           transgender women and their acceptance correlates with knowledge of PrEP and sexual risk&#xD;
           behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis 2. Adherence and duration of use of PrEP based on daily intake of TDF/FTC&#xD;
           correlates with the level of education, socioeconomic level, knowledge of PrEP and risk&#xD;
           behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describing the acceptability and its socio-demographic and sexual behavior correlates&#xD;
           for the use of PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the persistence of the use of PrEP and its correlates with risk behaviors&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluating the adherence to the PrEP using self-reporting and pill counts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describing the changes over time in risky sexual behavior among study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describing the number of participants who acquire HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluating the deviation of the indication of use of PrEP through self-reporting of its&#xD;
           sale or sharing with third parties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational, longitudinal, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the&#xD;
      acceptability, use and adherence to PrEP in an MSM and transgender women population. Four&#xD;
      nongovernmental organization health centers and one community-based organization in the&#xD;
      cities of Lima and Iquitos will participate in this observational study. The study will&#xD;
      enroll up to 1,000 participants (estimate of 200 participants per study site) for a period of&#xD;
      72 weeks (one and a half years). Each participant will be followed for up to 96 weeks (two&#xD;
      years) after the start of PrEP. The estimated duration of the study implementation is 192&#xD;
      weeks (four years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, participants must attend an assessment visit at 4 weeks, 12 weeks and then&#xD;
      every 12 weeks until they complete their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPLEMENTATION TARGET POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the Study Population This PrEP research project will be implemented in&#xD;
      volunteer MSM and transgender women without diagnosis of HIV infection and at risk of&#xD;
      acquiring HIV because of their sexual behavior and prior to this observational study&#xD;
      enrollment, be prescribed with PrEP by their primary care providers according the clinic&#xD;
      guidelines of the U.S. CDC (2014) and the WHO ( 2015)&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH SITES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each one of the proposed sites have the ability to meet the specific project implementation&#xD;
      and procedures in this protocol. Their investigators have shown to comply with all national&#xD;
      regulations, including good clinical practice and protection of human research subjects. The&#xD;
      proposed sites have experience in providing comprehensive health care services to the target&#xD;
      population and have additionally participated in research studies that have evaluated&#xD;
      different strategies for HIV prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this profile, the sites are ideal for implementing the PrEP Demonstration Project in&#xD;
      MSM and transgender women. The sites proposed for this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Asociación Civil Impacta Salud y Educación, Barranco site&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Asociación Civil Impacta Salud y Educación, San Miguel site&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Asociación Civil Selva Amazónica, ACSA site&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Asociación Vía Libre, Vía Libre site&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Espacio Común (Epicentro), Epicentro site&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participation of a health facility of the Ministry of Health will be promoted given that&#xD;
      with the information obtained in this study the cost-effectiveness of the program will be&#xD;
      modeled to determine the feasibility of its escalation at various health centers that may be&#xD;
      supported by public funds in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment The recruitment of volunteers for this study will be carried out through the&#xD;
      implementation of a mass media campaign to promote the performing of HIV infection diagnostic&#xD;
      testing. Virtual broadcast channels and social networking platforms will be used. In them&#xD;
      messages will be placed in the form of banners or links to redirect users to the websites of&#xD;
      the participating institutions, in which HIV testing diagnosis will be promoted during the&#xD;
      time the study is implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retention of Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retention of study participants will be governed by the following principles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Warm care at each site will establish a friendly relationship between the participant&#xD;
           and the staff in charge of care;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quality care, including the established procedures, permanent and timely information to&#xD;
           the user, as well as a short waiting time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the primary objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of implementing a&#xD;
      PrEP program in MSM and transgender women at risk of acquiring HIV, this study will not&#xD;
      promote active retention of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formulation/Content TDF/FTC co-formulation contains a fixed TDF dose of 300 mg (equal to 245&#xD;
      mg of tenofovir disoproxil and 136 mg of tenofovir) and 200 mg of FTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen and Administration Study participants will follow the prescription issued by their&#xD;
      primary health care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PrEP medication will be provided at no cost by Gilead Sciences, Inc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Dispensing After receiving a prescription signed by the primary care provider of the&#xD;
      participant, the pharmacist of each site will be responsible for dispensing the medication to&#xD;
      each participant at each visit. At the start of PrEP visit, the pharmacist will dispense one&#xD;
      bottle and at the first follow-up visit (week 4) will dispense two bottles. At all subsequent&#xD;
      visits to take place every 12 weeks, three bottles will be dispensed. All study participants&#xD;
      will be advised that the medication should not be shared. Study participants that report the&#xD;
      loss or theft of medications will be provided with additional medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particularly for the Espacio Común site, which lacks a registered pharmacy that allows the&#xD;
      storage and dispensing of products, medications will be dispensed at the Barranco de&#xD;
      Asociación Civil Impacta Salud y Educación site pharmacy. In this scenario, the prescription&#xD;
      will be issued at Espacio Común and with it, the participant will go to the pharmacy&#xD;
      described at which the medication will be dispensed. It is important to mention that there&#xD;
      are four blocks between the Espacio Común site and the Barranco site of Asociación Civil&#xD;
      Impacta Salud y Educación. Given this geographical proximity, we do not consider that this is&#xD;
      a problem for access to the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Accounting. The pharmacists of the Barranco and San Miguel sites of Asociación Civil&#xD;
      Impacta Salud y Educación, Asociación Civil Selva Amazónica and Asociación Vía Libre will be&#xD;
      responsible for maintaining complete and updated records of the accounting of products&#xD;
      received or acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All unused products will be returned to the central pharmacy of the study located at the&#xD;
      Barranco site of Asociación Civil Impacta Salud y Educación once the project ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to the Study Medication. Adherence to PrEP will be made by counting the returned&#xD;
      tablets at each of the scheduled visits and the self-reporting of medication intake using&#xD;
      questionnaires applied by an interviewer.&#xD;
