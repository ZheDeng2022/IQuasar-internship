  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) remains a persistent problem&#xD;
      for investigators in part because of the wide array of pathogenic cccccccccc mechanisms that&#xD;
      contribute to these disorders as well as the lack ofs. While glucocorticoids remain the&#xD;
      primary therapy for many forms of protein uric glomerularxxxxxxxxx diseases, prolonged use is&#xD;
      associated with significant morbidities including steroid induced diabetes, metabolic bone&#xD;
      disease, and excessive weight gain.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple agents have been investigated in the treatment of patients with SRNS, but there is&#xD;
      no consensus on what constitutes optimal therapy. Previous studiesoids and have shown&#xD;
      complete and partial response rates between 40% and 60%. More recently, calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitors (CNI) have become an effective second line therapy with similar response rates&#xD;
      between 50%-70%. However, both treatment regiments are limited by the risk for infection as&#xD;
      well as the development of vvvvvvv CNI-induced nephrotoxicity and progressive renal disease.&#xD;
      Acthar gel is a porcine pituitary preparation composed of ACTH and for treatment of&#xD;
      idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Previous studies, as well as more current studies, have shown&#xD;
      that ACTHar gel can effectively reduce proteinuriammmmmmmm in idiopathic membranous&#xD;
      glomerulonephritis and other forms of glomerulopathy including focal segmental&#xD;
      glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and advanced diabetic nephropathy. While the mechanism is unknown,&#xD;
      previous studies have shown that melanocortin 1-receptors are expressed in glomerular&#xD;
      podocytes and thatpathway could be involved in the protein lowering effects of ACTHar&#xD;
      bbbbbbbbgel. Incubation of cultured podocytes with ACTH leads to activation of MCR-1&#xD;
      receptors and the subsequent stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA) through a&#xD;
      G-protein-dependent pathway. The downstream phosphorylation and stabilization of Rho GTPases,&#xD;
      synaptopodin and other cell-cytoskeletal associated proteins may stabilize podocyte function&#xD;
      and density.&#xD;
