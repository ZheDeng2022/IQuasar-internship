  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Voice disorders are the most common communication disorder across the lifespan, affecting&#xD;
      more than 5 million school-aged children annually in the United States. Vocal fold nodules&#xD;
      are the most frequent pathology affecting voice in children, with 21% of children negatively&#xD;
      influenced at any given point in time, resulting in negative quality of life consequences and&#xD;
      inferior academic performance. The traditional first-line approach to treatment of vocal fold&#xD;
      nodules is voice therapy by Speech-Language Pathology, although corticosteroids are often&#xD;
      implemented in conjunction with voice therapy to reduce focal inflammation at the lesion&#xD;
      site. Operating room procedures are the traditional method to administer corticosteroids to&#xD;
      the lesion site, although recent advances in office-based laryngeal steroid injections have&#xD;
      become a widely popular alternative to reduce lesion size. Unfortunately, although in-office&#xD;
      injections are more favorable to operating room procedures, due to their less invasive&#xD;
      nature, in-office procedures are still an invasive alternative in the pediatric population.&#xD;
      Specifically, they involve equipment that may be intimidating to the child and require the&#xD;
      child to remain very still for prolonged periods of time, which may not be feasible with some&#xD;
      children. Furthermore, focal vocal fold injections still involve potential adverse effects&#xD;
      such as vocal fold hematoma. To mediate these concerns, a short course of inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids may be a safe and non-invasive alternative to reducing inflammation and&#xD;
      lesion size within the larynx. The goal of the present study is to determine the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of a short-course of inhaled corticosteroids in addition to standard voice&#xD;
      therapy for treating vocal fold nodules. The study also aims to examine the effects of&#xD;
      inhaled corticosteroids on quality of life outcomes and acoustic and aerodynamic outcomes.&#xD;
