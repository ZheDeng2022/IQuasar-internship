  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well sapanisertib works in treating patients with&#xD;
      bladder cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally&#xD;
      advanced) or other places in the body (metastatic) with tuberous sclerosis (TSC)1 and/or TSC2&#xD;
      mutations (changes in deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]). Sapanisertib may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) defined as complete response (CR) and partial&#xD;
      response (PR) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma&#xD;
      (TCC) harboring a TSC1 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sapanisertib (MLN0128) (TAK-228) in patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced or metastatic TCC harboring a TSC1 or TSC2 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the ORR in patients with locally advanced or metastatic TCC harboring a TSC2&#xD;
      mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate toxicity, PFS, and OS in TSC2 mutation patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and every 6 months&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
