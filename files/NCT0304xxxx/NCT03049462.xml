      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a type of fat in the body. It may prevent weight gain, improve&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, and reduce fatty liver. Researchers want to see if BAT helps the body&#xD;
      burn energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about how BAT works to burn energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 18-40 with a body mass index between 18 and 40&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietitian interview&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an overnight baseline visit. This includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeats of screening tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans. For one scan, a radioactive substance is injected into the arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FSIVGIT: An IV is inserted into veins in the right and left arms. Glucose and insulin are&#xD;
      injected in one arm. Blood glucose and insulin levels are measured from the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic suite: Participants stay 18 19 hours in a room that measures their metabolic rate.&#xD;
      Monitors on the body measure heart rate, movement, and temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional fat biopsy: A small piece of tissue is removed with a needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take 2-4 pills daily for 4 weeks. All women will take the drug mirabegron.&#xD;
      Men will be randomly get either the drug or a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have a visit after 2 weeks of the pills. They will repeat the screening&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an overnight visit 2 weeks later. They will repeat the baseline tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep food and medication diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit 2 weeks after stopping the pills. This includes&#xD;
      heart tests.&#xD;

      Background issues and controversies&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than ever before, there is a rise in the rates of obesity and diabetes. As opposed to&#xD;
      white fat which stores excess calories, brown fat - also known as brown adipose tissue or&#xD;
      BAT-consumes this energy to generate heat. In settings of increased food consumption and&#xD;
      cold- exposure, studies show that human BAT becomes more active, potentially combatting&#xD;
      weight gain. Other emerging evidence indicates that human BAT may be an endocrine organ,&#xD;
      releasing hormones into the blood and regulating other organs like skeletal muscle, liver,&#xD;
      and the insulin- releasing pancreatic beta-cell. However, alongside these promising studies&#xD;
      are those people who believe that there is not enough BAT in humans to be functionally&#xD;
      relevant, and it contributes little to heat generation or overall health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose/Rationale of the proposed study&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the principal reasons for skepticism about the ability to utilize human BAT is that&#xD;
      there is not very much compared to smaller animals in which BAT activation has shown such&#xD;
      promise. Therefore, a critical step is to develop medicines that can grow BAT in people and&#xD;
      evaluate what kind of health benefits can be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will administer the clinically-available beta3-AR agonist, mirabegron (Myrbetriq ,&#xD;
      Astellas Pharma). We will determine whether we can increase BAT volume and activity in people&#xD;
      after they have taken this medication daily for four weeks. Our current goal is to see if&#xD;
      chronic administration of mirabegron leads to an increase in BAT volume and metabolic&#xD;
      activity and if it produces health benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key elements of what is involved&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, the participants will undergo a series of tests to determine&#xD;
      their baseline amounts of BAT, blood sugar status, and levels of specified hormones. The&#xD;
      testing will take place over the course of two to three days while an inpatient on the&#xD;
      Metabolic Patient Care Unit at the NIH Clinical Center. Depending on the Cohort, participants&#xD;
      will then take the medication alone for four weeks or both the medication and placebo for&#xD;
      four weeks each, during which time they will continue their standard daily routines. At two&#xD;
      weeks after starting placebo or mirabegron, participants will return for one day for the&#xD;
      assessment of any interim changes and to validate safety. At the end of each set of four&#xD;
      weeks there will be a second set of inpatient testing over two to three days. Participants&#xD;
      will be brought back two weeks after finishing the study for a follow-up safety visit, at&#xD;
      which time they will receive an ECG and heart rate monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is either the change in BAT metabolic activity as measured by 18FFDG&#xD;
      PET/CT or glucose infusion rate as measured by a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will examine multiple other factors, including body weight, fat mass, glucose&#xD;
      tolerance, changes in levels of hormones, and improved liver function.&#xD;
