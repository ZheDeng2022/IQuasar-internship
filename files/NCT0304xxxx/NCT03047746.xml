      This is a single arm pilot study using TCR alpha/beta+ T cell-depleted peripheral blood stem&#xD;
      cells (PBSC) from closely matched unrelated donors or partially matched/haploidentical&#xD;
      related donors for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in patients with acquired and&#xD;
      inherited bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes. Previously established, disease-specific&#xD;
      transplant preparative regimens will be administered based on the specific underlying BMF&#xD;
      condition. Mobilized PBSC will be processed using the CliniMACS system for TCR alpha/beta+ T&#xD;
      cell depletion plus cluster of differentiation 19+ (CD19+) B cell depletion. The study will&#xD;
      determine efficacy of this strategy in terms of engraftment, rates of acute and chronic Graft&#xD;
      versus Host Disease (GvHD), and one year overall and event-free survival.&#xD;
