  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around a third of patients who develop acute kidney injury (AKI) do so after a hospital&#xD;
      admission (hospital-acquired - HA-AKI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to prospectively test whether introducing a complex&#xD;
      intervention (a 'care package' - comprising a clinical prediction rule incorporating an&#xD;
      electronic alert which generates a checklist for patient management to relevant health&#xD;
      professionals) can identify patients on admission to hospital who are at risk of developing&#xD;
      HA-AKI, highlight the need for closer monitoring and allow putative preventative measures to&#xD;
      be put in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will introduce the care package in one acute hospital and evaluate its&#xD;
      effectiveness in reducing HA-AKI and its associated morbidity, over ten months, compared to a&#xD;
      sister hospital within the same Trust (which will act as a control site). The investigators&#xD;
      will extend evaluation for a further ten months to assess sustainability on the first site&#xD;
      and introduce the package at the control hospital to assess generalisability. The primary aim&#xD;
      is reducing HA-AKI, but secondary aims will include improved outcomes associated with HA-AKI,&#xD;
      management of patients already with AKI on admission to hospital (whose care may also benefit&#xD;
      from the checklist) and a cost-effectiveness analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is common in hospital (incidence of 10-20% - up to 70% in the&#xD;
      critically ill), with high associated morbidity and mortality. Even small changes in renal&#xD;
      function are associated with increased mortality. The 2009 National Confidential Enquiry into&#xD;
      Patient Outcome and Death examined the care of patients who had died in hospital with a&#xD;
      primary diagnosis of AKI. Over 40% of cases had an unacceptable delay in diagnosis and in 20%&#xD;
      of cases, AKI was thought to be predictable and avoidable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic alerts have been studied for patients with established AKI, however, they have&#xD;
      highlighted rises in creatinine after insult rather than identifying patients at risk of AKI&#xD;
      - a third of hospital AKI cases occur after admission (HA-AKI). Risk factors have been&#xD;
      reported in surgical and burns patients. However, strategies to identify patients admitted as&#xD;
      medical emergencies at risk of developing AKI are lacking - the group accounting for most&#xD;
      Intensive Care admissions with AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators multidisciplinary team, with significant experience utilising technology in&#xD;
      healthcare, have developed a novel prediction score - Acute Kidney injury Prediction Score&#xD;
      (APS). Utilising physiological measurements, biochemical parameters and known co-morbidities,&#xD;
      the APS identifies patients at risk of developing HA-AKI following admission (1/3 of all AKI&#xD;
      cases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 'care package' has been devised incorporating the APS into an automated electronic&#xD;
      algorithm to send realtime alerts to staff on the Observation chart, e-mail the patient's&#xD;
      Consultant and advise on a checklist. Alongside this, an E-learning AKI module for ward staff&#xD;
      has been developed building on NICE Guidance with additional information regarding the APS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims Primary: investigate whether introducing a 'care package' can reduce HA-AKI in patients&#xD;
      admitted to hospital as an emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary include determining whether the intervention: reduces associated complications;&#xD;
      improves outcomes in patients with AKI on admission; and is cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions Primary: can a 'care package' by systematically recognising the 'at risk'&#xD;
      patient, alerting and prompting management to staff educated in the problem, reduce HA-AKI?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can harms associated with AKI be reduced?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the intervention acceptable to staff and are there barriers to implementation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are improvements sustainable and can the intervention be successfully applied to a&#xD;
           second hospital?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the intervention improve outcomes of those with AKI on admission?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the intervention cost-effective?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design A prospective, non-randomised, parallel cohorts study, with before-after trial&#xD;
      periods, at intervention and control hospital sites, will be performed. A run-in phase (10&#xD;
      months) for baseline data collection and prospective external validation is followed by the&#xD;
      intervention on one site (Worthing) with the Chichester site acting as control (Phase 1) for&#xD;
      10 months. The intervention will then be introduced at Chichester whilst continuing at&#xD;
      Worthing (Phase 2) for 10 months. The additional period will allow analysis of the&#xD;
      interventions' impact on readmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preventing morbidity and mortality including secondary complications such as chronic&#xD;
           kidney disease (immediate and longer term).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reducing length of stay, thus reducing potential exposure to harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prevent requirement for renal replacement therapies and escalation to Intensive Care&#xD;
           with associated morbidity, mortality and psychological harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A Cost-effectiveness analysis will aim to demonstrate whether such a strategy could&#xD;
           provide savings locally and to the wider health economy (short and long-term).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Inform the healthcare community on applicability of information technology to benefit&#xD;
           patients and improve staff engagement, with potential utilisation in a number of other&#xD;
           conditions.&#xD;
