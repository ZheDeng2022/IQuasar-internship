  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The large share of chronic diseases correlated with an aging population calls to develop&#xD;
      necessary coordination between the hospital and non-hospital (professional of the city, home&#xD;
      ...) to create new complementarities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since July 2013, the Nantes University Hospital experiences the establishment of a&#xD;
      coordinator route patient in Gerontology. The evaluation program of the benefit of&#xD;
      coordinating the course in elderly patients in health establishment (PROCOPES) must allow to&#xD;
      prove the efficiency of the intervention of a coordinator route patient, following elderly&#xD;
      patients in complex situations, both within the hospital and outside the hospital (home,&#xD;
      nursing home,...). The objective of PROCOPES is to show the added value of an innovative&#xD;
      position that can make the link between the hospital and the city on deemed complex&#xD;
      situations.The pilot study results present a strong interest for health care settings,&#xD;
      nursing home and in the world of research. It will also permit to have preliminary data for&#xD;
      bigest studies.&#xD;

    <description>A differential cost-utility ratio will be used to compare both interventions. The evaluation of costs will take into account direct health care insurance cost, hospital costs and patient cost (according to the french health care insurance system). The evaluation of utility will be based on the evaluation of patient's quality of life, measured by EuroQol EQ-5D.</description>
