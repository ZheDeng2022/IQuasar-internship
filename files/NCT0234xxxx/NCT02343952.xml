      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients must have completed concurrent chemoradiation with a standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen (either cisplatin/etoposide or carboplatin/paclitaxel) and a dose of radiation&#xD;
      ranging from 59.4-66.6Gy, with restaging completed 28 days to 56 days post-chemoradiation.&#xD;
      Patients with progressive disease will not be eligible for investigational treatment.&#xD;
      Patients with stable disease/response will be eligible to register for investigational&#xD;
      treatment of consolidation therapy to begin a minimum of 28 days and a maximum of 56 days&#xD;
      from completion of chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
