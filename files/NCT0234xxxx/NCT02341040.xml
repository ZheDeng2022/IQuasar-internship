      The goal of the study is to determine accurate blood test levels that can predict whether or&#xD;
      not subjects are truly allergic to certain foods. In this study, subjects that are clinically&#xD;
      documented to be wheat-allergic will participate in a double blind oral food challenge. Blood&#xD;
      will be collected from the subject to evaluate the potential allergenicity of proteins&#xD;
      introduced into genetically modified crops and evaluate wheat-specific immunoglobulin-e (IgE)&#xD;
      antibody reactivity to biotech and conventional wheat varieties.&#xD;

      The prevalence of food allergy is increasing in the pediatric population. A diagnosis of food&#xD;
      allergy carries significant medical, nutritional, and psychological implications for both&#xD;
      patients and their families. Therefore, making an accurate diagnosis is critical. However,&#xD;
      the diagnosis of symptomatic food allergy continues to be a challenge for allergists and&#xD;
      other practicing physicians. The patient's clinical history remains a key component in&#xD;
      diagnosing food allergy. Skin prick testing and food-specific immunoglobulin-e (IgE) testing&#xD;
      act as secondary tools to aid in the evaluation process, but these tests also suffer from a&#xD;
      high rate of false positivity. For specific IgE levels below the cutoffs to these foods,&#xD;
      however, supervised oral food challenges (OFCs) may be necessary to establish the diagnosis&#xD;
      of symptomatic food allergy, as the sensitivity of these values is relatively low. Currently,&#xD;
      the double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) remains the gold standard for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of food allergy. OFCs have their own inherent drawbacks: they are not always&#xD;
      readily available to all patients, they are time-consuming, and they are potentially&#xD;
      dangerous due to their risk of anaphylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wheat is one of the eight allergenic foods that are responsible for approximately 90% of all&#xD;
      food allergies. Wheat is less allergenic than other foods in this group and less likely to&#xD;
      cause multi-organ, severe, life-threatening reactions. Allergy to wheat is more prevalent in&#xD;
      children than adults and is considered a transient allergy of infancy/childhood. Wheat&#xD;
      allergy is often outgrown in early childhood, in most cases by age 3-5 years, but 35% show a&#xD;
      persistent allergy into adolescence. While previous studies using food-specific IgE&#xD;
      antibodies have determined diagnostic decision points that indicate a high likelihood of&#xD;
      clinical reactivity for certain foods, namely milk, egg, peanut, and fish, wheat-specific IgE&#xD;
      levels do not seem to be useful predictors of food challenge outcome, enabling reduction in&#xD;
      need for food challenges. Furthermore, false-positive IgE reactions to wheat and other&#xD;
      cereals are frequently seen in grass-allergic patients due to insignificant cross-reactivity&#xD;
      between water/salt-soluble proteins. Therefore, identification of wheat proteins associated&#xD;
      with symptoms to wheat is of importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gliadins in particular have been implicated in allergy to wheat, both in IgE-mediatedallergy&#xD;
      and the non-IgE mediated celiac allergy. IgE antibodies to ω-5-gliadin have been found in&#xD;
      children with immediate reactions to ingested wheat, and published results show that&#xD;
      increased levels of IgE to ω-5-gliadin correlate with the outcome of food challenges. In a&#xD;
      Finnish study, all children with IgE antibodies to ω-5-gliadin reacted with immediate&#xD;
      symptoms to wheat challenges, while all patients with delayed or negative challenge test&#xD;
      results showed no detectable IgE antibodies to ω-5-gliadin.15 In a Japanese cohort, the&#xD;
      presence of elevated ω-5-gliadin-specific IgE antibodies was associated with immediate&#xD;
      symptoms with wheat food challenges and also in patients with a strong convincing history of&#xD;
      wheat allergy who were not challenged due to risk of anaphylaxis. Furthermore, patients with&#xD;
      severe reactions upon challenge had significantly higher levels of ω-5-gliadin-specific IgE&#xD;
      antibodies compared to children with mild or moderate symptoms. In a multicenter Japanese&#xD;
      study, Ebisawa et al. showed a significant relationship between the probability of wheat&#xD;
      allergy and the concentration of ω-5-gliadin-specific IgE antibodies with 2.6-fold increased&#xD;
      risk. In a study of mixed German and American subjects, ω-5-gliadin-specific IgE antibodies&#xD;
      did not correlate with food challenge outcomes in patients with suspected allergy. However,&#xD;
      the sample size in this study was much smaller than in others, and the German population&#xD;
      included more patients with non-IgE mediated wheat allergy with delayed symptoms, almost half&#xD;
      of the German cohort. Nonetheless, ω-5-gliadin-specific IgE antibodies may differ among&#xD;
      populations in Asia, Europe, and the United States due to dietary habits and genetics, and&#xD;
      further study is warranted, especially in a larger U.S. cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food crops that have been developed through agricultural biotechnology for commercial use are&#xD;
      thoroughly assessed for their safety. One of the key elements in the safety assessment of a&#xD;
      genetically improved crop is an evaluation of potential changes in their allergenic&#xD;
      properties. Allergenic properties of the crop can potentially be altered if a known allergen&#xD;
      or a protein that has high potential to become an allergen is introduced. In addition, the&#xD;
      level of expression of endogenous allergens might be altered as a result of transformation&#xD;
      and insertion of the new gene into the plant genome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since wheat is a known allergenic food crop, international guidelines require analyses to&#xD;
      determine if the introduction of the genes and production of the recombinant proteins in&#xD;
      wheat cause an unintended change in the levels of endogenous allergenic proteins. To address&#xD;
      this question, levels of wheat-specific IgE binding observed in the biotechnology derived&#xD;
      wheat varieties are compared to the set of binding values observed in reference wheat&#xD;
      varieties that are already on the market. Determining the levels of direct IgE binding using&#xD;
      an enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) has been shown to be an appropriate method to&#xD;
      perform such comparisons, especially when the assay is validated and calibrated prior to the&#xD;
      production of data. This comparison is important as it will enable determinations of whether&#xD;
      there is heterogeneity in wheat-allergic patients with wheat allergy in terms of a&#xD;
      predominant trigger. Ultimately, crops may be engineered to eliminate culprit components if&#xD;
      predominant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food challenge outcomes and standard ImmunoCAP IgE assays to wheat will be compared to CRD&#xD;
      wheat testing in this study (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). When evaluated together&#xD;
      with clinical history, skin test reactivity, and OFC outcomes, responses to individual&#xD;
      components may be able be used to predict food challenge responsiveness. With respect to&#xD;
      intact wheat-specific IgE levels, in two previous studies using these, a true 95% positive&#xD;
      predictive value cutoff to predict reactivity at OFC could not be determined to wheat,&#xD;
      although a physician challenge was suggested at an estimated wheat level of 26 kU/L to&#xD;
      determine possible reactivity.6,7 However, these studies are now over a decade old and&#xD;
      pre-dated component resolved diagnostics (CRD). CRD to major proteins ω-5-gliadin may prove&#xD;
      to be more beneficial in determining predictive levels of IgE and positive OFC outcomes to&#xD;
      wheat. Therefore, in addition to determining wheat component patterns that could predict OFC&#xD;
      outcomes, the investigators hope to determine 95% predictive decision points for each of the&#xD;
      individual components and compare these to the decision points estimated by the ImmunoCAP&#xD;
      assay to wheat.&#xD;
