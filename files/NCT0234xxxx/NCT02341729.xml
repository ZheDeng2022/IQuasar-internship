      The first aim of the study is to prove that after starting the therapy with crushed tablets,&#xD;
      the platelet inhibition will be as expected after starting therapy with intact tablets.&#xD;
      Gurbel et al. showed that 100% of the patients on ticagrelor treatment have a decrease from&#xD;
      baseline platelet aggregation of &gt;10% 4 hours after last maintenance dose. So the&#xD;
      investigators expect that after 3 days of treatment, all of our patients will have a closing&#xD;
      time of more than 106seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will observe two different clinical conditions of Acute Coronary Syndrome.&#xD;
      First after semi-urgent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, secondly in patients&#xD;
      after cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both are clinical situations in which crushed tablets are needed to give. The second&#xD;
      objective is to determine plasma concentrations of Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX (active&#xD;
      metabolite of ticagrelor) in these two patient populations after receiving 180mg or 90mg&#xD;
      start-dose. Determination of plasma concentrations is done after protein precipitation, by&#xD;
      using liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection. Measurements will be determined&#xD;
      before intake (0h) and at 0,5; 1; 2; 4; 8; 24h and at day 4 +4h.7 The first 24h this will be&#xD;
      a crushed tablet and 4 hours after the first intake at day 4 of therapy, this will be a non&#xD;
      crushed tablet.&#xD;

      This study is a single-centre, open-label, non-randomised longitudinal study in which the&#xD;
      effect of ticagrelor, both crushed and non-crushed will be evaluated in two separate clinical&#xD;
      conditions. The plasma concentrations after a crushed intake will be used to determine the&#xD;
      maximum plasma concentration and time to achieve this maximum concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients of each condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition A: patients who received CPR because of cardiac arrest. A gastric tube is inserted.&#xD;
      Subjects receive 2 crushed tablets of ticagrelor (180mg) with 10 ml water and a flush of 20&#xD;
      ml water. The first blood sample is taken before administration. The following samples are&#xD;
      taken at 30minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24h. The ninth sample is taken 24 hours after&#xD;
      stopping sedation and 4h after administration of ticagrelor with 10 ml water and a flush of&#xD;
      20 ml water via nasogastric tube. The tenth sample is taken 4 days and 4hours after first&#xD;
      intake of ticagrelor, this last sample is mostly after a non-crushed intake of ticagrelor&#xD;
      (this depends on the neurological condition of the patient). Only the first dose is a loading&#xD;
      dose of 180mg, hereafter a normal dose of 90mg is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each blood sampling moment 1 or 2 samples are taken (see also flow chart). At time 0, 2,&#xD;
      4, 8, 12, 24h, 24h after sedation stop and at 4 days and 4hours after first intake of&#xD;
      ticagrelor: a Platelet Function Analysis and an Aggreguide aggregometry is done. For each&#xD;
      analysis 3,6ml of blood is needed, this makes a total of 28,8ml for the clotting analyses. At&#xD;
      time 30min, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24h and 4 days and 4h; 4ml of blood is needed for the plasma&#xD;
      concentration measurements, a total of 28ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition B: Patients in need of semi-urgent coronary bypass surgery, allowing interrupting&#xD;
      the administration of ticagrelor 3 days before surgery. A nasogastric tube is inserted during&#xD;
      surgery. On intensive care the patients will receive crushed tablets of ticagrelor with 10 ml&#xD;
      water and a flush of 20 ml water via gastric tube, the first dose will be a loading dose. The&#xD;
      first blood sample is taken just before surgery (weak effect of ticagrelor because&#xD;
      administration has stopped 3 days). The following samples are taken at 30minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8,&#xD;
      12, and 24h. The ninth sample is taken 24 hours after stopping sedation and 4h after&#xD;
      administration of ticagrelor with 10 ml water and a flush of 20 ml water via nasogastric&#xD;
      tube. The tenth sample is taken 4 days and 4hours after first intake of ticagrelor, this last&#xD;
      sample is mostly after a non-crushed intake of ticagrelor (this depends on the neurological&#xD;
      condition of the patient). Only the first dose is a loading dose of 180mg, hereafter a normal&#xD;
      dose of 90mg is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each blood sampling moment 1 or 2 samples are taken (see also flow chart). At time 0, 2,&#xD;
      4, 8, 12, 24h, 24h after sedation stop and at 4 days and 4hours after first intake of&#xD;
      ticagrelor: a Platelet Function Analysis and an Aggreguide aggregometry is done. For each&#xD;
      analysis 3,6ml of blood is needed, this makes a total of 25,2ml for the clotting analyses. At&#xD;
      time 30min, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24h and 4 days and 4h; 4ml of blood is needed for the plasma&#xD;
      concentration measurements, a total of 28ml.&#xD;

    <description>Patients, after CPR because of an ACS, will receive 2 crushed tablets of ticagrelor (180mg) through a gastric tube. After this dose twice a day 90mg is given for the duration of 1 year. The 1st blood sample is taken before administration. In total 10 blood samples are taken for determination of platelet aggregation and plasma concentrations.&#xD;
When patients receive a semi-urgent CABG, ticagrelor has been interrupted for 3 days. Postoperative the patients get crushed tablets of ticagrelor, the 1st dose will be 90mg, and every 12h 90mg is given, for the duration of 1 year. The 1st blood sample is taken before the 1st dose. In total 9 blood samples are taken for determination of platelet aggregation and plasma concentrations.</description>
