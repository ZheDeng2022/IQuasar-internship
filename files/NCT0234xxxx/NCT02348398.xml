      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of topotecan and&#xD;
      pazopanib can help to control recurrent cervical cancer. The safety of the study drug&#xD;
      combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive the study drugs&#xD;
      in 28-day study cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take pazopanib every day for 28 days. You will take topotecan at about the same time&#xD;
      every day on Days 1-21, but not take it on Days 22-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should not take pazopanib 1 hour before or within 2 hours after eating. The pazopanib&#xD;
      tablets should be swallowed whole with about a cup (8 ounces) of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should not chew, crush, dissolve, or divide either the topotecan or the pazopanib&#xD;
      tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a study drug diary in which you will write information about when you take&#xD;
      the study drug each time and how much you took. You will bring this diary to every study&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam. This will include a pelvic exam every 2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be collected for biomarker testing (Cycles 1 and 2&#xD;
           only), including genetic biomarkers. Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be&#xD;
           related to your reaction to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, you will have a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are taking warfarin, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check your blood's&#xD;
      ability to clot. This will be done weekly during Cycle 1 and on any cycle after which you&#xD;
      change your dose of warfarin or one of the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of every even-numbered cycle (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on), you will have a CT scan or&#xD;
      MRI of your abdomen and pelvis to check the status of the disease. You will also have an&#xD;
      x-ray or CT scan of the chest to check the status of the disease as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease appears to be getting better at any time while you are taking the study drug,&#xD;
      blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study doctor thinks you are responding to the study drugs, blood (about 2 tablespoons)&#xD;
      will be drawn on Day 1 of Cycle 6. If you leave the study before then, this sample will be&#xD;
      drawn at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 4 weeks after your last dose of study drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 ½ teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a chest x-ray and either a CT scan or an MRI to check the status of&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are taking warfarin, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check your blood's&#xD;
      ability to clot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ° If you stopped taking the study drug before Cycle 6 because the disease got worse, blood&#xD;
      (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you came off study for a reason other than the disease getting worse, you will be asked to&#xD;
      return to the clinic for follow-up testing every 3 months. At these visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT scan, MRI, or x-ray to check&#xD;
           the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease did get worse, you will be called every 3 months and asked about how you are&#xD;
      doing. Each call should last about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Pazopanib is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced kidney cancer and certain types of advanced soft tissue sarcoma&#xD;
      such as bone, cartilage, fat, or muscle. Topotecan is FDA approved and commercially available&#xD;
      for the treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer that has returned after treatment and for the&#xD;
      treatment of small cell lung cancer that has returned after first-line treatment. Topotecan&#xD;
      is also FDA approved to treat advanced, recurrent or persistent carcinoma of the cervix in&#xD;
      combination with cisplatin. The use of these drugs in combination is investigational. The&#xD;
      study doctor can explain how the drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study. Up to 30 will take part at&#xD;
      MD Anderson. Up to 10 will be enrolled at the Harris Health System.&#xD;
