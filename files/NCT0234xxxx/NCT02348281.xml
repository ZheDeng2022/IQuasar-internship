    <textblock>
      This prospective, single center, phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      bicalutamide as a treatment in androgen receptor (AR)-positive metastatic triple-negative&#xD;
      breast cancer (mTNBC) patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined as the absence of estrogen and progesterone&#xD;
      receptor expression as well as ERBB2 amplification. It has no response to endocrine or&#xD;
      anti-ERBB2 therapies. Recent studies have found some potential therapeutic targets for TNBC.&#xD;
      However, it still has a poor outcome. It was reported that TNBC has six subtypes, including 2&#xD;
      basal-like (BL1 and BL2), an immunomodulatory (IM), a mesenchymal (M), a mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem-like (MSL), and a luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype. Different subtype may be&#xD;
      sensitive to different treatment. Bicalutamide is an oral, non-steroidal, androgen receptor&#xD;
      (AR) antagonist. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment&#xD;
      of metastatic prostate cancer. Recently, a study explored the efficacy of bicalutamide in AR&#xD;
      positive, estrogen receptor negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC), which showed a high&#xD;
      clinical benefit rate (CBR) and a good safety profile. Based on the above reasons, we&#xD;
      initiate this phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bicalutamide in AR&#xD;
      positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Females elder than 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histological proven unresectable or metastatic breast cancer patients who underwent at&#xD;
             least one chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with androgen Receptor (AR) positive (IHC &gt;10% nuclear staining) either for&#xD;
             primary tumor or metastatic lesion&#xD;

          4. Triple-negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progestogen receptor (PR), and human&#xD;
             epithelial receptor-2 (HER2) by IHC (ER &lt;1%, PR &lt;1% and Her2 negative). A negative&#xD;
             Her2 gene amplification should be verified by FISH test for those patients with Her2&#xD;
