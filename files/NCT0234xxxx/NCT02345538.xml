      The purpose of this study is to establish the range of pelvic floor pressure in groups of&#xD;
      women, including women with and without pelvic pain, and compare the change in perineometer&#xD;
      measurements between rest and maximum pelvic floor contraction in women with and without&#xD;
      pelvic pain. Purpose is also to determine whether resting pelvic floor perineometer&#xD;
      measurements correlate with the severity of pain symptoms in women with chronic pelvic pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is defined as non-cyclic pelvic pain lasting at least 6 months.&#xD;
      Approximately 3-15% of women are affected by CPP. Care of patients with CPP contributes to&#xD;
      considerable healthcare costs, accounting for 880 million dollars annually in outpatient&#xD;
      visits alone. Although CPP may be multifactorial, many women have a contribution from&#xD;
      increased pelvic floor tone. CPP due to increased pelvic floor tone is usually referred to as&#xD;
      levator spasm or high tone pelvic floor dysfunction. Levator tenderness and increased pelvic&#xD;
      tone may be identified on physical exam. However, physical exam is somewhat subjective and&#xD;
      may vary based on the clinician performing the exam. There are currently no validated,&#xD;
      objective measures to judge resting pelvic tone, which 1) limits objective assessment in&#xD;
      research studies and 2) limits our ability to assess response to new treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to contract the pelvic floor may be assessed during pelvic exam with a Brink's&#xD;
      score. However, there are still elements of subjectivity in components of this score and&#xD;
      researchers continue to look for an objective measure of pelvic floor muscle tone. The&#xD;
      Peritron perineometer device has been shown to correlate well with pelvic floor contraction,&#xD;
      based on Brinks scores.Measurements taken with the Peritron device have better inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability than other measures of pelvic floor contraction, which makes it an attractive&#xD;
      tool for clinical research. However, its use in clinical research is hampered by the lack of&#xD;
      normative data with perineometer measurements. Though there are some studies that use the&#xD;
      perineometer to assess resting (i.e. non-contracted) pelvic tone after therapies for pelvic&#xD;
      pain, there are no studies that assess the typical perineometer measurements in women with&#xD;
      levator spasm, and there are no data to guide how these measurements may compare with women&#xD;
      having a normal pelvic floor examination. We hypothesize that: 1) Women with high resting&#xD;
      pelvic tone perceived on exam will have high perineometer measurements and women with normal&#xD;
      pelvic tone on exam will have low perineometer measurements, regardless of whether or not&#xD;
      they report pelvic pain. 2) Women with high resting perineometer measurements will have&#xD;
      minimal change in perineometer scores between resting and maximum pelvic floor contraction&#xD;
      (squeeze). 3) In women with clinical evidence of levator spasm, resting perineometer&#xD;
      measurements will correlate with severity of pelvic pain symptoms. We plan to investigate&#xD;
      these hypotheses by executing the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To compare clinical assessment of resting pelvic tone with perineometer&#xD;
      measurements in a range of women, including those with and without pelvic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To compare the change in perineometer measurements between rest and maximum&#xD;
      pelvic floor contraction in women with and without pelvic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To determine whether resting pelvic floor perineometer measurements correlate&#xD;
      with the severity of pain symptoms, as measured by short form McGill questionnaire scores and&#xD;
      visual analog scale (VAS), in a subset of women with pelvic pain and clinical evidence of&#xD;
      levator spasm.&#xD;
