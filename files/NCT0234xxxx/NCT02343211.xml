      Paraneoplastic Neurological Syndromes (PNS) are rare remote effects of cancer, not directly&#xD;
      attributed to mass lesions, metastases, infections, ischemia, coagulopathy, metabolic&#xD;
      disruptions or tumour treatment. Currently, PNS treatment is mostly limited to tumour&#xD;
      treatment. Because of an initial inflammatory stage early in the evolution of the PNS several&#xD;
      immunotherapy modalities have been tried. Intravenous human immunoglobulins could be expected&#xD;
      to provide a stabilization or even improvement of PNS, if administered early enough to&#xD;
      prevent permanent neuronal damage.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are remote effects of malignant neoplasia on&#xD;
      neural tissue, not directly caused by mass lesions, metastases, infections, ischemia,&#xD;
      coagulopathy, metabolic disruptions or treatment. The symptoms and signs of PNS are diverse,&#xD;
      usually acute or subacute. Onconeural antibodies are detected in their serum, and sometimes&#xD;
      in their Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF); onconeural antibodies are highly specific for identifying&#xD;
      patients with neurologic symptoms as having a paraneoplastic syndrome. The most frequent ones&#xD;
      are anti-Hu, anti-Yo and anti-CV2/CRMP5. Although a known cancer patient may present with a&#xD;
      PNS, neurologic symptoms precede other manifestations of a tumor in about 65% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, autoimmunity is postulated to underlie the pathophysiology of PNS. Tumor cells can&#xD;
      sometimes express antigens normally found only in the nervous system, an immunologically&#xD;
      privileged site. Onconeural antigens on tumors can be identified as foreign by the immune&#xD;
      system and an immune attack can be elicited against them. In the subset of PNS patients, the&#xD;
      immune system could also recognize and attack onconeural antigens in normal nervous tissue.&#xD;
      This autoimmune hypothesis for the pathogenesis of PNS is supported by a series of arguments:&#xD;
      Onconeural antibodies are found in serum and CSF; Cerebrospinal fluid studies show&#xD;
      inflammation in 93% of patients; In the acute phase of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration&#xD;
      hypermetabolism in 18F-Fluoro-2-Desoxy-Glucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) scan&#xD;
      and increased perfusion on Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) have been&#xD;
      described and attributed to inflammatory changes; Pathological examination of the nervous&#xD;
      system from patients with anti-Hu associated paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis demonstrates&#xD;
      loss of neurons in affected areas with extensive T-cells infiltration and immunohistochemical&#xD;
      studies on damaged neural tissue after autopsy reveal inflammatory infiltrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective treatment of PNS requires an early clinical suspicion followed by rapid diagnosis,&#xD;
      through detection of onconeural antibodies, and identification of the underlying tumor.&#xD;
      Unfortunately appropriate treatment of the cancer is most often unsuccessful to improve&#xD;
      neurological symptoms and these patients are generally left bedridden until death. It's seems&#xD;
      important to associate an immune treatment but has never been adequately tested. Experience&#xD;
      with immunotherapy modalities, such as corticosteroids, plasma exchange, immunosuppressants&#xD;
      or human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), relies on case reports, retrospective studies,&#xD;
      and a couple of prospective studies in patients generally treated at a late stage. To date,&#xD;
      it has not been possible to set up a prospective therapeutic trial evaluating the role of&#xD;
      early immune treatment, administered less than 6 months after the onset of symptoms, in these&#xD;
      patients. Considerable evidence for an initial inflammatory stage (early in the evolution of&#xD;
      the PNS), and isolated case reports of early immunological intervention suggest that this&#xD;
      approach may be valid to treat these disorders. Because IVIg are often use in&#xD;
      neuro-immunological disorders (ex. first-line therapy in Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy and&#xD;
      dermatomyositis) with little and well known side effects and no interaction with cancer&#xD;
      treatment we decide to use IVIg for our trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Aim of the study is to improve neurological impairment and function in patients with&#xD;
      early diagnosis of various PNS associated with well-characterized onconeural antibodies&#xD;
      anti-Hu, anti-Yo, anti-CV2/CRMP5. The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of&#xD;
      patients with neurological improvement after 3 months of immunotherapy with IVIg. &quot;Success&quot;&#xD;
      is defined by ≥ 1 point lower score in the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) after treatment&#xD;
      compared to baseline. This is a prospective, open-label trial explores the efficacy of drugs&#xD;
      approved for treatment of immune-mediated neurological disorders given early in the evolution&#xD;
      of PNS associated with well-characterized onconeural antibodies. A total number of 17&#xD;
      patients will be treated. This is a multicenter study carried under the auspices of the&#xD;
      French National Reference Center on PNS.&#xD;
