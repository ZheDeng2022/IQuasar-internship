      This post market registry consists of a retrospective and a prospective part. The first part&#xD;
      is a retrospective registry of all implanted IBE devices of Gore in the Netherlands after CE&#xD;
      mark was obtained, to get an initial insight on the feasibility and safety of this procedure.&#xD;
      The second part is to prospectively register all data on implanted IBE Gore devices, in order&#xD;
      to gain more robust data on the efficacy of the device in maintaining hypogastric artery&#xD;
      patency.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The Gore IBE device is a newly designed iliac branched device, that is used in&#xD;
      combination with the widely accepted C3 Excluder endograft for the exclusion of common iliac&#xD;
      aneurysms and aorto-iliac aneurysms. The later has a proven safety and efficacy in excluding&#xD;
      abdominal aortic aneurysms. The Gore IBE device got CE mark on October 2013. Technical and&#xD;
      clinical data at short and long terms are still to be collected to give insight into&#xD;
      technical success rates, patency data and long term follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective and design: This investigator-initiated post market registry consists of a&#xD;
      retrospective and a prospective part. The first part is a retrospective registry of all&#xD;
      implanted IBE devices of Gore in the Netherlands after CE mark was obtained, to get an&#xD;
      initial insight on the feasibility and safety of this procedure. The second part is to&#xD;
      prospectively register all data on implanted IBE Gore devices, in order to gain more robust&#xD;
      data on the efficacy of the device in maintaining hypogastric artery patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All patients in whom a Gore IBE was or will be implanted. In the&#xD;
      retrospective part of the study all implantations in the Netherlands will be gathered,&#xD;
      whereas the prospective part will be expanded in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Aneurysm exclusion and reinterventions will be end-points of&#xD;
      this study. As safety and feasibility is the main outcome of the retrospective part, the data&#xD;
      will be analyzed at 30-days. Patients in the prospective study will be followed for 5 years,&#xD;
      with the primary end-point being hypogastric side branch patency at 1-year. Clinical&#xD;
      endpoints include freedom from symptoms of pelvic ischemia (buttock claudication, impotence&#xD;
      and bowel ischemia) and freedom from aneurysm rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Since this is a registry study, no burden or risk exist for the patient. There&#xD;
      is also no direct benefit for the participating patients, but the gathered data will improve&#xD;
      insight for patients with the same disease and might improve health care in the future for&#xD;
      this group of patients.&#xD;
