      This study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the Spineology Interbody Fusion System&#xD;
      (SIFS) in an instrumented interbody lumbar fusion in subjects presenting with symptomatic&#xD;
      single-level lumbar degenerative disc disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This regulated prospective, multi-center, Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved&#xD;
      single-arm performance goal clinical investigation was conducted at 10 centers with 102&#xD;
      subjects being enrolled and treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were actively evaluated from pre-op to 24-months postoperative. Based on enrollment&#xD;
      duration, some subjects were remotely assessed through self-administered surveys at 36-&#xD;
      and/or 48-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint, assessed at 24-months postoperative, is a composite score that includes&#xD;
      pain, function, fusion and safety assessments.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint of this trial is the rate of Patient Success at 24-months defined as a composite endpoint that includes:&#xD;
Pain -- Clinically meaningful reduction in low back pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score at 24-months post-operative. A clinically meaningful reduction is defined as a difference of at least 20 mm compared to pre-op (pre-op score minus post-op score).&#xD;
Function -- Clinically meaningful improvement in function at 24-months post-operative. A clinically meaningful improvement is defined as a reduction of at least 15 points compared to baseline (pre-op Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score minus the post-op ODI score).&#xD;
Fusion -- Defined as bridging bone demonstrated on computed tomography (CT) scan&#xD;
Safety -- No device-related serious adverse events (SAEs) from intra-op through the 24-month timepoint.&#xD;
For the study to be a success, 68% of subjects need to meet the above success criteria.</description>

    <measure>Mean Low Back Pain Score at 24-months Post-operative</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score was used to evaluate a subject's level of pain. The VAS is a 100 mm horizontal line where score of &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;No Pain&quot; and a score of &quot;100&quot; represents the &quot;Worst possible&quot; pain. The subject marks a vertical line across the horizontal line representing their pain level. The pain score is obtained by using a ruler to measure where the vertical line intersects the horizontal line. Improvement is defined as a clinically meaningful difference (20 mm reduction) when compared to pre-op. Success for this parameter is evaluated at the 24-month visit.</description>

    <measure>Mean Back Function Score at 24-months Post-operative</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>A subject's back function was assessed by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The ODI is a 10 question survey that evaluates the degree of functional impairment. Completion of the survey yields a score from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;100&quot; points. A score of &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;No disability&quot; and &quot;100&quot; represents &quot;Total disability&quot;. A clinically meaningful difference is defined as a 15-point reduction when compared to pre-op. Success for this parameter is evaluated at the 24-month visit.</description>

          <title>Low Back Pain Status</title>
          <description>A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score was used to evaluate a subject's level of pain. The VAS is a 100 mm horizontal line where score of &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;No Pain&quot; and a score of &quot;100&quot; represents the &quot;Worst possible&quot; pain. The subject marks a vertical line across the horizontal line representing their pain level. The pain score is obtained by using a ruler to measure where the vertical line intersects the horizontal line. Improvement is defined as a clinically meaningful difference (20 mm reduction) when compared to pre-op. Success for this parameter is evaluated at the 24-month visit.</description>

Completion of the survey yields a score from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;100&quot; points. A score of &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;No disability&quot; and &quot;100&quot; represents &quot;Total disability&quot;.

        <description>The primary endpoint of this trial is the rate of Patient Success at 24-months defined as a composite endpoint that includes:&#xD;
Pain -- Clinically meaningful reduction in low back pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score at 24-months post-operative. A clinically meaningful reduction is defined as a difference of at least 20 mm compared to pre-op (pre-op score minus post-op score).&#xD;
Function -- Clinically meaningful improvement in function at 24-months post-operative. A clinically meaningful improvement is defined as a reduction of at least 15 points compared to baseline (pre-op Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score minus the post-op ODI score).&#xD;
Fusion -- Defined as bridging bone demonstrated on computed tomography (CT) scan&#xD;
Safety -- No device-related serious adverse events (SAEs) from intra-op through the 24-month timepoint.&#xD;
For the study to be a success, 68% of subjects need to meet the above success criteria.</description>

        <title>Mean Right Leg Pain Score at 24-months Post-operative</title>
        <description>A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score was used to evaluate a subject's level of pain. The VAS is a 100 mm horizontal line where score of &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;No Pain&quot; and a score of &quot;100&quot; represents the &quot;Worst possible&quot; pain. The subject marks a vertical line across the horizontal line representing their pain level. The pain score is obtained by using a ruler to measure where the vertical line intersects the horizontal line. Improvement is defined as a clinically meaningful difference (20 mm reduction) when compared to pre-op. Success for this parameter is evaluated at the 24-month visit.</description>
