  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how effect lacosamide is in reducing the amount of&#xD;
      pain medication needed following a total hip arthroplasty. The study team hypothesizes that a&#xD;
      single dose of lacosamide will reduce the amount of pain medication required after surgery.&#xD;
      The study team plans to evaluate the amount of pain medication needed and quality of pain&#xD;
      control during a subject's hospital stay and at their three month follow-up visit following&#xD;
      their surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients who agree to participate in this study will receive the same surgical and&#xD;
      anesthetic techniques that are provided to all our patients undergoing this procedure at this&#xD;
      institution. Post-operative treatment and therapy and follow-up will also be the same as any&#xD;
      of our patients undergoing this procedure at this institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only difference would be that patients would be randomized (determined by chance, like a&#xD;
      flip of a coin) to either receive a single dose of lacosamide (100 mg by mouth) or placebo&#xD;
      (sugar pill by mouth) before the surgical procedure. This would be the only experimental part&#xD;
      of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, specific information will be collected throughout the patients care until&#xD;
      discharged from the orthopedic clinic (approximately 3 months after the procedure). The&#xD;
      collected information will include subject's age, race and ethnicity, sex, height, weight,&#xD;
      American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status, total amount of opioid (pain&#xD;
      medication) use, pain scores, nausea and vomiting, time spent in the post anesthesia care&#xD;
      unit (time to discharge readiness), and discharge from the hospital. The patient's pain score&#xD;
      and opioid use will be assessed during their follow-up at approximately 3 months (Note: all&#xD;
      of the specific information collected is normally gathered or documented in our surgical&#xD;
      patients' record). In addition, participants may withdraw from the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this study is to determine if lacosamide can reduce the amount of opioids&#xD;
      required in patient's undergoing a total hip arthroplasty. Lacosamide is a FDA approved&#xD;
      medication for the treatment of partial-onset seizures and is a man-made amino acid (usually&#xD;
      are used as the building blocks from which proteins are made in the body) which block special&#xD;
      proteins inby a change in the electricity that a cell may feel (voltage-gated sodium&#xD;
      channel). Lacosamide is a new antiepileptic drug apparently lacking any major pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      interactions (how the body affects a specific drug after administration, as well as the&#xD;
      chemical changes of the substance in the body, and the effects and routes of excretion of the&#xD;
      metabolites of the drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lacosamide, carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are known to block special proteins in the&#xD;
      covering of cells which allow sodium into the cells when they are turned on by a change in&#xD;
      the electricity that a cell may feel (voltage-gated sodium channel, NaV1.7). Lacosamide was&#xD;
      chosen over carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine because it causes fewer side effects. Currently,&#xD;
      lacosamide is being tested in patients with painful diabetic nerve pain. Further trials to&#xD;
      identify lacosamide's potential in pain control and for other indications have been started.&#xD;
