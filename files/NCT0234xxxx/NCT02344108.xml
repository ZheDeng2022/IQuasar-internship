  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects up to 1% of the general pediatric population and is&#xD;
      associated with adverse behavior and quality of life, as well as long term cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      system complications. Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) is the most common chromosomal disorder,&#xD;
      with a incidence of approximately 1 per 660-800 births. Patients with Down Syndrome have a&#xD;
      higher incidence of OSA than the general pediatric population, with rates of 30-60%,&#xD;
      resulting in increased morbidity and decreased quality of life for affected individuals. In&#xD;
      children, adenotonsillectomy (T&amp;A) is often a contributing factor to OSA, and&#xD;
      adenotonsillectomy is a first line treatment. Children with Down Syndrome often undergo T&amp;A&#xD;
      for obstructive sleep apnea, however 30-50% will have persistent obstructive sleep patterns&#xD;
      requiring continuous positive pressure airway support (CPAP) or tracheotomy. Persistent&#xD;
      obstruction is attributed to anatomic and physiologic differences in this population,&#xD;
      including reduced muscular tone, macroglossia, maxillary hypoplasia, and lingual tonsil&#xD;
      hypertrophy. This pilot study is designed to determine if the Inspire® Upper Airway&#xD;
      Simulation System, Model 3024 IPG, and any subsequent iteration thereof that are approved&#xD;
      under P130008 for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, which has already been approved&#xD;
      for use in adults with OSA, can be safely implanted and used in adolescents and young adults&#xD;
      with Down Syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a multi-center, prospective, single-arm study conducted under a common&#xD;
      implant and follow-up protocol. Twenty-one adolescents and young adults (10-21 years of age)&#xD;
      with Down Syndrome with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea after adenotonsillectomy&#xD;
      will be identified through a Multi-Disciplinary clinic for patients with Trisomy 21 at each&#xD;
      of our participating sites Patients and their parents will be screened by a senior&#xD;
      pulmonologist and pediatrician for medical clearance and willingness to participate. Subjects&#xD;
      will then undergo preoperative evaluation with an in-lab polysomnogram (PSG), evaluation by a&#xD;
      pediatric otolaryngology surgeon, and drug induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) to ensure all&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria are met. Subjects meeting eligibility criteria will then be&#xD;
      implanted with the Inspire® Upper Airway Simulation System, Model 3024 IPG, and any&#xD;
      subsequent iteration thereof that are approved under P130008 for the treatment of obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea, a hypoglossal nerve stimulator, after informed consent. Surgery will be&#xD;
      performed by senior pediatric otolaryngologists who have completed a training program for the&#xD;
      Inspire® system. Subjects will then adhere to a follow-up schedule. The device will be&#xD;
      activated and settings titrated during an in-lab sleep study 1 month postoperatively. Quality&#xD;
      of life surveys and device interrogation will be conducted at timed intervals. Subjects will&#xD;
      then undergo in-lab polysomnography at 2 months, 6 months, and 12-months, then on an annual&#xD;
      basis, and the device titrated as needed. All personnel adjusting device parameters will be&#xD;
      trained in programming the Inspire® system. For this pilot study, we will evaluate safety and&#xD;
      efficacy over the first year after device implantation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Only children and young adults with Down Syndrome age 10-21 years with prior&#xD;
             adenotonsillectomy will be considered for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have BMI &lt;95th percentile for age&#xD;

             attributable to central events) based on prior in-lab polysomnography performed after&#xD;
             adenotonsillectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have either tracheotomy or be ineffectively treated with CPAP due to&#xD;
             noncompliance, discomfort, un-desirable side effects, persistent symptoms despite&#xD;
             compliance use, or refusal to use the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children and their parents must be willing to have stimulation hardware permanently&#xD;
             implanted, and be willing to participate in follow-up visits, postoperative&#xD;
             polysomnography, and questionnaire completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children's parents must complete a questionnaire confirming that their child is&#xD;
             capable of communicating feelings of pain or discomfort. They must also confirm they&#xD;
             are able to assess their child for adverse effects related to device implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children and their parents must be proficient in English for this pilot study in order&#xD;
             to ensure full disclosure during the consent process, as well as have the ability to&#xD;
             communicate with all staff, at all times, regarding any questions about participation&#xD;
             or concerns about this device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In order to participate, subjects will require written consent from both parents. All&#xD;
             study subjects must provide written assent as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be excluded if they meet the following criteria: BMI &gt;95th percentile&#xD;
             for age, apnea hypopnea index (AHI) &lt;10 or &gt;50 on in-lab polysomnography (PSG),&#xD;
             central or mixed apneas accounting for &gt;25% of the total AHI, any anatomic finding on&#xD;
             physical exam or drug induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) that would compromise the&#xD;
             performance of stimulation (e.g. concentric soft palate collapse), other medical&#xD;
             conditions resulting in medical instability (e.g. congestive heart failure, recent&#xD;
             open heart surgery, immunosuppression, or chronic lung disease or aspiration),&#xD;
             presence of another medical condition requiring future magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
             (MRI), history of cholesteatoma, or patients with another implantable device which&#xD;
             could interact unintentionally with the Inspire system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects in whom general anesthesia for a surgical procedure is contraindicated due to&#xD;
             other medical illnesses or conditions will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a life expectancy &lt; 12 months will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are unable to communicate pain or discomfort to their caretaker/parent,&#xD;
             based on parental or investigator assessment, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of bleeding or clotting disorders and those on blood thinning&#xD;
             or NSAID medications will be excluded from participation.&#xD;

             will be excluded. All female subjects will undergo urine beta-HCG testing on the day&#xD;
             of procedures requiring general anesthesia (DISE, implantation, and any other&#xD;
             unanticipated surgical procedures related to implantation). Subjects who are positive&#xD;
             will not undergo surgical implantation or procedures under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects deemed unfit for participation by investigators or any other reason will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
