      The goal of the study is to identify a dose and schedule of CC-486 that can be safely&#xD;
      administered with R-CHOP. To evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the&#xD;
      maximal administered dose (MAD) of CC-486 in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) in subjects with high risk (IPI 2 or more)&#xD;
      previously untreated DLBCL or Grade 3B FL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, to determine pharmacokinetics (PK) of CC-486 when administered alone and in combination&#xD;
      with R-CHOP and to explore preliminary efficacy of CC-486 plus R-CHOP by 2007 International&#xD;
      Working Group (IWG) criteria.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of oral azacitidine (CC-486) when&#xD;
      combined with R-CHOP (the treatment regimen normally used in treating Diffuse large B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma or Grade 3B follicular lymphoma). This study also proposes to explore the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of oral azacitidine when administered in combination with R-CHOP and to&#xD;
      assess the effects the drug can have on the human body, as well as the ability of CC 486 in&#xD;
      combination with R CHOP to further effect the response of tumors associated with Diffuse&#xD;
      large B-cell lymphoma or Grade 3B follicular lymphoma, .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral azacitidine in combination with R-CHOP has not been approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or Grade 3B follicular lymphoma and its use in this study is&#xD;
      investigational. Various dose levels of this investigation treatment will be administered to&#xD;
      subject enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is separated into three periods: Screening and Registration, Treatment and&#xD;
      Follow-up periods. Before the patient can receive the study drug the doctor will perform&#xD;
      tests to find out whether he/she can participate in the study. This is done during the&#xD;
      Screening Period. If the patient and the treating physician determine that the patient is&#xD;
      eligible to participate in the study, the patient will be registered in the study and&#xD;
      assigned to receive one of the investigational dose levels of oral azacitidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Treatment period starts when the patient receives their first dose of the study drug. The&#xD;
      maximum time the patient will receive study treatment is 5 months. The intent is for the&#xD;
      patient to complete 6 cycles of treatment. Each cycle will be 21 days. The Follow-up period&#xD;
      starts when the patient's treatment is completed or discontinued for any reason. The patient&#xD;
      will have fewer exams, tests and visits once entering the follow-up period. These visits will&#xD;
      be every 6 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

             allowed as long as no prior anti-lymphoma therapy of any kind has been administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A formalin fixed paraffin embedded lymph node or tumor biopsy specimen must be&#xD;
                  submitted during the Screening Period. The specimen must have been acquired by a&#xD;
                  surgical or core needle biopsy (≥ 2 cores at baseline); material from a fine&#xD;
                  needle aspiration is not acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  submitted for storage. This is optional only for the subjects who have a&#xD;
                  biopsy-accessible site and consent to the procedure. In case no prior fixed&#xD;
                  formalin paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsy is available, this specimen can also be&#xD;
                  used for diagnostic confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. No prior anti-lymphoma therapy. However, for subjects with bulky disease,systemic&#xD;

                  and the subjects is considered eligible. A washout period does not apply. However&#xD;
                  the fresh core biopsy mentioned above should be performed before starting&#xD;
                  prednisone.&#xD;
