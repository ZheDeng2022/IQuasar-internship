    <textblock>
      The goal of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of belimumab as a maintenance&#xD;
      therapy in adults with refractory Idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM) as compared with&#xD;
      standard of care. This is a multicentre double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults with refractory IIM will be enrolled. IIM is defined as Dermatomyositis (DM) or&#xD;
      Polymyositis (PM), meeting the Bohan &amp; Peter (1975) diagnostic criteria for definite or&#xD;
      probable DM or PM. Refractory IIM is defined as chronic active IIM with a history of&#xD;
      inadequate response or intolerance to three months of glucocorticoids and/or at least a&#xD;
      history of inadequate response or intolerance to three months of one other immunosuppressive&#xD;
      agent (IS) (azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, leflunomide, tacrolimus,&#xD;
      cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, Rituximab or intravenous gamma globulin [IVIG]).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects enrolled in the study must meet the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Have a diagnosis of:&#xD;

               2. Definite or probable diagnosis of polymyositis (PM) with presence of one of&#xD;
                  myositis specific antibodies. In the absence of myositis specific&#xD;
                  auto-antibodies, the diagnosis of PM will require review of the muscle biopsy and&#xD;
                  adjudication by the predetermined committee of experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of positive autoantibody (ANA &gt;1:80 or RNP or SSA/SSB or any of the myositis&#xD;
             specific autoantibody: antisynthetase autoantibodies (anti-Jo-1, PL-7, PL-12, EJ, OJ,&#xD;
