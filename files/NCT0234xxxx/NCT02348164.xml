  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the research study is to measure and compare the absorption of equivalent amounts&#xD;
      of beta-cryptoxanthin and Iycopene provided in citrus fruit. The investigators want to&#xD;
      determine whether adults absorb beta-cryptoxanthin to a greater extent than lycopene, when&#xD;
      both are supplied in comparable citrus fruits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lycopene and beta-cryptoxanthin are carotenoids found in a small number of foods. Unlike&#xD;
      lycopene, beta-cryptoxanthin is among the 10% of carotenoids that can form vitamin A.&#xD;
      Lycopene is primarily found in tomatoes and tomato-based products, but also in pink&#xD;
      grapefruit and pink guava. Beta-cryptoxanthin is primarily found in tangerines, oranges,&#xD;
      pumpkin, peaches, and papayas. Tomatoes and tomato products contain very high concentrations&#xD;
      of lycopene, but beta-cryptoxanthin is present in modest amounts, of about 2 to 3 mg per&#xD;
      serving, even in its primary food sources. Lycopene is typically the most abundant carotenoid&#xD;
      in the diet and in the blood. Despite its scarcity in foods, beta-cryptoxanthin is the third&#xD;
      or fourth most abundant carotenoid in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This suggests that beta-cryptoxanthin absorption and metabolism may be quite different from&#xD;
      the absorption and metabolism of lycopene and other carotenoids. Specifically, it suggests&#xD;
      either that beta-cryptoxanthin itself is absorbed unusually well or that the citrus fruits&#xD;
      that are the primary food sources of beta-cryptoxanthin in the diet are much more&#xD;
      bioavailable than the tomato products that are the major source of lycopene. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that adults absorb a significantly greater amount of&#xD;
      beta-cryptoxanthin than lycopene even when both carotenoids are supplied in comparable&#xD;
      amounts in a similar matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be given a list of foods that are good sources of lycopene and&#xD;
      beta-cryptoxanthin and asked to avoid them. Both carotenoids are found in limited numbers of&#xD;
      foods, and can be avoided by limiting intakes of tomatoes, red and orange peppers, pumpkin,&#xD;
      watermelon, pink guava, pink grapefruit, tangerines, oranges, papayas and mangos. The&#xD;
      investigators will feed citrus fruit to volunteers in a randomized crossover design. On study&#xD;
      days 14 and 28, subjects will receive either tangerines, or pink grapefruit in a randomized&#xD;
      fashion so that each subject gets both treatments during the study. Each subject will serve&#xD;
      as his/her own control, and will be fed both treatments at different times, separated by a&#xD;
      two-week washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days 14 and 28, subjects will arrive at the Western Human Nutrition Research Center at&#xD;
      approximately 10:30 AM. After a baseline blood draw, subjects will be fed their&#xD;
      carotenoid-containing fruit with a controlled meal (low carotenoid, 30-35% fat). Subjects&#xD;
      will be given a controlled, low carotenoid, 30-35% kcal from fat dinner at about 6:30 PM on&#xD;
      treatment days (days 14 and 28) and a controlled low carotenoid, 30 - 35% kcals from fat&#xD;
      breakfast at about 8 AM on study days 15 and 29. Investigators will collect 25 mL of blood&#xD;
      per collection, by venipuncture of an arm vein at the following time points, 0, 3, 5, 7, 9,&#xD;
      21, and 24hr following the fruit containing meal. Blood will be collected into heparinized&#xD;
      vacutainer tubes and placed on ice in a covered ice bucket.&#xD;
