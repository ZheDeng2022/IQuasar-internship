        <title>Change From Baseline in Awake (0-8 Hours) Objective Cough Frequency for Cohort 1</title>
        <description>Awake (0-8 hours) Objective Cough Frequency is the total number of cough events during the monitoring period the participant was awake for the first 8 hours after the participant took their study medication divided by 8 or the total duration (in hours) for the monitoring period the participant was awake whichever is less. 24-hour sound recordings were collected using a digital recording device. Results are change from baseline: a negative result indicates a decrease in cough frequency, while a positive result indicates an increase in cough frequency.&#xD;
Cough frequency was analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) to evaluate the results of the 2-period cross-over study. The derived change measured at each dose were the repeated measures.</description>
        <time_frame>Period 1 (while awake): baseline (Day 0) and 0-8 hours after Day 4, 8, 12 &amp; 16 doses; Period 2 (while awake): baseline (Day 22) and 0-8 hours after Day 26, 30, 34 and 38 doses</time_frame>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Awake (0-8 Hours) Objective Cough Frequency for Cohort 1</title>
          <description>Awake (0-8 hours) Objective Cough Frequency is the total number of cough events during the monitoring period the participant was awake for the first 8 hours after the participant took their study medication divided by 8 or the total duration (in hours) for the monitoring period the participant was awake whichever is less. 24-hour sound recordings were collected using a digital recording device. Results are change from baseline: a negative result indicates a decrease in cough frequency, while a positive result indicates an increase in cough frequency.&#xD;
Cough frequency was analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) to evaluate the results of the 2-period cross-over study. The derived change measured at each dose were the repeated measures.</description>
          <population>Analysis population consisted of all participants in Cohort 1 for Periods 1 and 2 who were randomized, received at least 1 dose of study drug, were compliant with the study procedure and had available data for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Sleep Cough Frequency - Cohort 1</title>
        <description>Sleep Objective Cough Frequency is the total number of cough events during the monitoring period the participant is asleep divided by the total duration (in hours) for the monitoring period the participant is asleep. 24-hour sound recording were collected with a digital recording device. Results are change from baseline: a negative result indicates a decrease in cough frequency, while a positive result indicates an increase in cough frequency.&#xD;
Cough frequency was analyzed using MMRM to evaluate the results of the 2-period cross-over study. The derived change measured at each dose were the repeated measures.</description>
        <time_frame>Period 1 (while asleep): baseline (Day 0) and 24 hours after Day 4, 8, 12 &amp; 16 doses; Period 2 (while asleep): baseline (Day 22) and 24 hours after Day 26, 30, 34 and 38 doses</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis population consisted of all participants in Cohort 1 for Periods 1 and 2 who were randomized, received at least 1 dose of study drug, were compliant with the study procedure and had available data for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline of the Mean Total Daily Cough Severity Diary (CSD) Score for Cohort 1</title>
        <description>The daily CSD Score is calculated using the daily CSD instrument, a 7-item, disease specific, patient-reported outcome measure with a recall period of &quot;today&quot; (the current day). The measure evaluates frequency of cough (3 items); intensity of cough (2 items); and sleep disruption due to cough (2 items). Each of these 7 items is rated on an 11-point scale, ranging from 0 (best) to 10 (worst), with higher scores indicating greater severity. The total daily CSD score is the sum of these 7 item scores (Min=0, Max=70). Baseline CSD score = average of CSD scores at screening and baseline. Results are change from baseline: a negative result indicates a decrease in cough severity, while a positive result indicates an increase in cough severity.&#xD;
CSD was analyzed using MMRM to evaluate the results of the 2-period cross-over study. The derived change measured at each dose were the repeated measures.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at End of Treatment Period Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ): Individual Domain and Total Scores for Cohort 1 and 2</title>
        <description>The LCQ-Acute is a 19-item health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) questionnaire specific for acute cough which contains three domains (i.e., physical, psychological, and social). It is calculated as a mean score for each domain ranging from 1 (worst) to 7 (best), and total score ranging from 3 (worst) to 21 (best). Each item on the LCQ-acute assesses symptoms or the impact of symptoms on HRQoL in the last 24 hours using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7. Higher scores indicate better HRQoL. Participants' perception of their cough severity was assessed, based on the LCQ-Acute score, at Baseline and last day of dose.&#xD;
LCQ was analyzed using MMRM to evaluate the results of the 2-period cross-over study. The derived change measured at each dose were the repeated measures.</description>

        <title>Baseline (Predose) for the Mean Total Daily Cough Severity Diary (CSD) Score for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2</title>
        <description>The daily CSD Score is calculated using the daily CSD instrument, a 7-item, disease specific, patient-reported outcome measure with a recall period of &quot;today&quot; (the current day). The measure evaluates frequency of cough (3 items); intensity of cough (2 items); and sleep disruption due to cough (2 items). Each of these 7 items is rated on an 11-point scale, ranging from 0 (best) to 10 (worst), with higher scores indicating greater severity. The total daily CSD score is the sum of these 7 item scores (Min=0, Max=70). Baseline CSD score = average of CSD scores at screening and baseline. A negative result indicates a decrease in cough frequency, while a positive result indicates an increase in cough frequency. Baseline measurements were not available by individual arm because baseline cough frequencies were measured before participants received the first dose of study drug. Baseline summaries were evaluated based on the participant's randomized group (gefapixant or placebo).</description>

        <title>Baseline (Predose) for the Acute Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) Instrument for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2</title>
        <description>The LCQ-Acute is a 19-item health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) questionnaire specific for acute cough which contains three domains (i.e., physical, psychological, and social). It is calculated as a mean score for each domain ranging from 1 (worst) to 7 (best), and total score ranging from 3 (worst) to 21 (best). Each item on the LCQ-acute assesses symptoms or the impact of symptoms on HRQoL in the last 24 hours using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7. Higher scores indicate better HRQoL. As per the Statistical Analysis Plan, each domain and total LCQ score change from baseline were analyzed without the treatment by dose interaction. Baseline summaries were evaluated based on the participant's randomized group (gefapixant or placebo).</description>

          <description>Cough VAS: scored from 0 to 100 using a 10 mm visual analogue scale with 0 (no cough) and 100 (most severe cough) mm. Baseline cough VAS is defined as average of screening and baseline cough VAS. Baseline measurements were not available by individual arm because baseline cough frequencies were measured before participants received the first dose of study drug. Baseline summaries were evaluated based on the participant's randomized group (gefapixant or placebo).</description>
          <population>Analysis population consisted of all randomized participants in Periods 1 and 2 who received at least 1 dose of study drug, were compliant with the study procedure and had available data.</population>
