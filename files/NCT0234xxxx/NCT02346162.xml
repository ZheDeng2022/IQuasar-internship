  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The US obesity epidemic is being transmitted to the next generation. Growing evidence&#xD;
      suggests that both a mothers' weight at pregnancy onset, and excessive weight gain during&#xD;
      pregnancy, are associated with increased risk of pregnancy-related complications such as&#xD;
      gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, and an increased risk that her child will become&#xD;
      obese and face obesity-related health issues in later life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, over one-third of reproductive-aged women in the U.S. are obese [body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) ≥ 30]. Our research team has shown that we can improve birth weight outcomes in babies&#xD;
      of obese women who start a weight-management intervention program at 14 to 15 weeks of their&#xD;
      pregnancy (soon after their first prenatal visit). However, organogenesis and metabolic&#xD;
      programming begin early in the first trimester, well before the first prenatal visit.&#xD;
      Therefore, waiting to address mothers' weight, physical activity, and diet quality until the&#xD;
      first prenatal visit is not optimal. Given the need to reach overweight and obese women prior&#xD;
      to pregnancy, and the Institute of Medicine's (IOM's) recent recommendation, based on&#xD;
      observational studies, that women should reach a healthy weight before conceiving, this&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial will evaluate a comprehensive preconception weight loss program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goals are to help overweight and obese women (BMI ≥ 27) who are considering pregnancy to&#xD;
      adopt improved dietary and physical activity habits and lose weight prior to becoming&#xD;
      pregnant, and then help them maintain those habits and prevent excessive weight gain during&#xD;
      their pregnancy. We model this intervention after successful, frequent-contact interventions&#xD;
      designed by ourselves and other investigators. We start with face-to-face counseling followed&#xD;
      by frequent telephone counseling contacts. The expected outcomes for mothers include reduced&#xD;
      pregnancy-related weight gain (primary) and lower weight at the start of pregnancy&#xD;
      (secondary) and for babies, decreased risk of exceeding national norms for weight at birth&#xD;
      (secondary).&#xD;
