  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia of pregnancy is defined as a hemoglobin concentration of less than 11 g/dL in the&#xD;
      first and third trimesters, and less than 10.5 g/dL in the second trimester. The rates of&#xD;
      anemia are variable and depend largely on preexisting iron stores and supplementation.&#xD;
      Estimates from the World Health Organization report that 35% to 75% of pregnant women in&#xD;
      developing countries and 18% of women from industrialized countries are anemic. Maternal&#xD;
      anemia is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, low birthweight, and small for&#xD;
      gestational age infants. Many studies have shown improvement in these outcomes with maternal&#xD;
      iron supplementation in cases of iron-deficiency anemia. Mounting evidence also indicates&#xD;
      that maternal iron deficiency in pregnancy reduces fetal iron stores, perhaps well into the&#xD;
      first year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anemia in pregnancy can also impact maternal morbidity and mortality. Viteri reported that&#xD;
      anemic pregnant women are at greater risk of death during the perinatal period and that&#xD;
      anemia is the major contributory or sole cause of death in 20-40% of the 500,000 maternal&#xD;
      deaths per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for iron averages close to 1000mg in a typical singleton gestation. This amount&#xD;
      considerably exceeds the iron stores of most women and will result in iron-deficiency anemia&#xD;
      unless supplemental iron is taken. One problem with iron supplement use is compliance,&#xD;
      secondary to adverse effects such as constipation and nausea. Research on the use of cast&#xD;
      iron pots in decreasing the incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in non-pregnant women has&#xD;
      been promising. These studies have demonstrated good compliance with no reported adverse&#xD;
      effects. The aim of our study is to determine if providing anemic women in the first&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy with a cast iron pot will decrease the incidence of anemia later in&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Cooking in cast iron pots will increase hematocrit levels in pregnancy.&#xD;

      Research Question: Will the addition of cast iron pots to the standard of care (nutrition&#xD;
      counseling, food recall, prenatal vitamin, +/- iron and vit c) improve the hematocrit of&#xD;
      pregnant women with anemia? Study Intervention: To provide a cast iron pot to those pregnant&#xD;
      women with anemia who are randomized to intervention group and an aluminum pot to those women&#xD;
      in the control group. Women will be blinded to their allocation. Women with a qualifying&#xD;
      hemoglobin will meet with our nutritionist (as they would if not enrolled in the study), and&#xD;
      she will perform a standardized 24 hour food recall and nutrition counseling according to the&#xD;
      standard of care, as well as perform written informed consent. The 24 hour food recall will&#xD;
      be submitted to the manufacturer (Nutrition Quest) to calculate the baseline iron intake of&#xD;
      each subject. Subjects will be enrolled only if they can agree to incorporate the provided&#xD;
      pot into their cooking (in any capacity) 3x/week. Subjects will be called 1x/month and asked&#xD;
      about the frequency of pot use over the past month as well as their compliance with iron and&#xD;
      vitamin C supplements, if prescribed. Subjects will then also be contacted postpartum to&#xD;
      determine satisfaction with the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measure: We will be looking at hemoglobin levels in the first, second, and third&#xD;
      trimester as well as postpartum (which are all routinely collected labs in pregnancy).&#xD;
      Ferritin will be added along with routine labs at approximately 19 weeks as this is often&#xD;
      performed in the workup of anemia. No labs outside of routine maternal labs will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
