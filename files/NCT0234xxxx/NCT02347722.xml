  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate existing biomarkers and see if they can be used to&#xD;
      accurately diagnose the etiology of heart failure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cohort study consisting of 2 patient cohorts. The first cohort will be studied&#xD;
      retrospectively, using existing blood samples from different biobanks. Biomarkers will be&#xD;
      measured and matched with the etiology of previously diagnosed heart failure by a biomarker&#xD;
      panel of heart failure experts. This cohort consists of 100 patients each with (1) ischemic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, (2) dilated cardiomyopathy and (3) diastolic heart failure. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be analyzed for novel biomarkers. Investigators will be seeking biomarker candidate(s)&#xD;
      alone or in combination which can predict each category of heart failure etiology with over&#xD;
      85% accuracy and the lowest levels of reclassification. A panel of heart failure experts will&#xD;
      be assembled, and the appropriate cut-off values determined. Once this goal has been&#xD;
      achieved, the prospective study will go ahead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second cohort, biomarkers will be measured and used to diagnose the etiology of heart&#xD;
      failure for each subject. This diagnosis will then be compared to the diagnosis from results&#xD;
      of the usual diagnostic tests. Investigators will recruit 450 patients admitted to hospital&#xD;
      or outpatient clinics with recently diagnosed heart failure (&lt;2 years) and test for different&#xD;
      biomarkers. Using the biomarker values, investigators will predict their heart failure&#xD;
      etiology in an objective manner. The patients will then undergo definitive etiological workup&#xD;
      as usual to establish the actual etiology of the heart failure. The duration of a typical&#xD;
      etiological workup is about 3 days for hospitalized patients and up to 8 weeks for patients&#xD;
      admitted to outpatient clinics. The predictive accuracy of the new heart failure panel will&#xD;
      be compared to clinical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will perform cost-modeling in terms of the potential savings in avoiding&#xD;
      unnecessary coronary angiographies or perfusion scans in a typical mixed cohort of heart&#xD;
      failure patients based on the marker determined etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of healthy volunteers will be added. This group will serve as age matched controls to&#xD;
      the prospective cohort of heart failure patients.&#xD;
