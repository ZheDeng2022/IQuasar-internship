      The H4K Trial is a randomized controlled trial to improve children's body composition by&#xD;
      testing a comprehensive, culturally and linguistically relevant, family-oriented intervention&#xD;
      for overweight and obese Hispanic children (ages 6-11) in three pediatric clinics in San&#xD;
      Antonio, Texas. The H4K trial will test the efficacy of a 6-month pediatric obesity&#xD;
      management intervention (physician counseling plus telephone counseling, newsletters and text&#xD;
      messages) compared to standard care (physician counseling only) on three outcomes: 1) body&#xD;
      composition (i.e., waist circumference, weight and z-BMI); 2) insulin, glucose and&#xD;
      cholesterol levels; and 3) behavior change in physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior and&#xD;
      consumption of sugary beverages and fruits and vegetables. The investigators will recruit 230&#xD;
      overweight and obese children-and a parent or guardian for each-and randomize them to the H4K&#xD;
      intervention (n = 115 child/parent dyads) or standard care (n = 115 child/parent dyads). The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that intervention children will significantly improve their body&#xD;
      composition, increased their PA levels and diet quality (more fruits and vegetables and less&#xD;
      sugary beverages), and decrease their sedentary activity, compared to children in standard&#xD;
      care. If successful, this study will generate new scientific knowledge about effective&#xD;
      Hispanic family-based approaches for obesity prevention with high potential for replication&#xD;
      in underserved areas across the nation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the continuing rise of the U.S. Hispanic population, reversing the Hispanic childhood&#xD;
      obesity epidemic is critical to the nation's future health. Mexican American children and&#xD;
      those from socioeconomically disadvantaged families often are far more overweight and obese&#xD;
      than their peers, heightening their risk for obesity-related health complications. Our&#xD;
      proposed randomized controlled trial, the Health4Kids (H4K) Trial for Hispanic Families, aims&#xD;
      to improve Hispanic children's body composition by testing a comprehensive, culturally and&#xD;
      linguistically relevant, family-oriented intervention for overweight and obese (body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) between the 85th and 99.9thth (&lt;99th) percentile for age and gender) Hispanic&#xD;
      children ages 6-11 in pediatric clinics in San Antonio, Texas, a largely Hispanic city. Our&#xD;
      team, formed during our pilot research funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid&#xD;
      Services (1H0CMS030457), unites academic investigators and community partners with experience&#xD;
      working together to conduct behavioral and clinical interventions and outreach with&#xD;
      Hispanics. The H4K trial will test the efficacy of a 6-month pediatric obesity management&#xD;
      intervention (physician counseling plus telephone counseling, newsletters and text messages)&#xD;
      compared to standard care (physician counseling only) on three outcomes: 1) body composition&#xD;
      (i.e., waist circumference, weight and z-BMI); 2) insulin, glucose and cholesterol levels;&#xD;
      and 3) behavior change in physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior and consumption of&#xD;
      sugary beverages and fruits and vegetables. We will recruit 230 overweight and obese&#xD;
      children-and a parent or guardian for each-and randomize them to the POM intervention (n =&#xD;
      115 child/parent dyads) or standard care (n = 115 child/parent dyads). From a baseline, we&#xD;
      will measure the impact of the trial on the primary outcome (body composition) and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes (insulin, glucose and cholesterol levels and several specific health behavior&#xD;
      changes) at 1 month, 6 and 12 months post-randomization. We also will evaluate the critical&#xD;
      role of parenting strategies and changes in the home environment as mediators of intervention&#xD;
      effects. We hypothesize that intervention children will significantly improve their body&#xD;
      composition, increased their PA levels and diet quality (more fruits and vegetables and less&#xD;
      sugary beverages), and decrease their sedentary activity, compared to children in standard&#xD;
      care. If successful, this study will generate new scientific knowledge about effective&#xD;
      Hispanic family-based approaches for obesity prevention with high potential for replication&#xD;
      in underserved areas across the nation.&#xD;
