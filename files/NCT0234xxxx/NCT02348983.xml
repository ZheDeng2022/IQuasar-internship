  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Being obese can be a risk factor for many health problems, including high cholesterol, high&#xD;
      blood pressure, low back pain, heart attacks and some cancers. Truckers, who are integral to&#xD;
      our economy, face challenges that put them at increased likelihood of being obese. The&#xD;
      investigators want to come up with a program to help drivers get to a healthy weight and stay&#xD;
      there.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WHEEL pilot study is a 12 week weight loss intervention in long-haul commercial truck&#xD;
      drivers. The study involves two visits to the University of Utah's Rocky Mountain Center for&#xD;
      Occupational and Environmental Health, one at the start of the study and a second one at the&#xD;
      end of the study. Both visits include a general health history questionnaire, a 24-hour diet&#xD;
      recall questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, as well as an assessment of blood&#xD;
      pressure, hemoglobin A1c, and a cholesterol and lipid panel. Each truck driver is assigned a&#xD;
      health coach who helps the driver create and achieve three health goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health coach works with the driver to set individualized goals specific to weight loss,&#xD;
      and contacts the driver weekly to check in and tweak goals as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drivers are also compensated for their participation in the study and get to keep all of the&#xD;
      intervention materials that the investigators give them. All that the researchers ask is that&#xD;
      they try their best to have a healthier lifestyle and give us feedback on what they liked and&#xD;
      didn't like in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators recruited 13 truckers based in Utah's Wasatch Front (population 2.2&#xD;
      Million) who expressed interest in participating in a weight loss intervention when they&#xD;
      participated in the cross-sectional truck driver study (current enrollment, n= 817 truckers).&#xD;
      Other options the investigators may pursue to maintain enrollment include enrolling&#xD;
      participants directly through local trucking companies. Participants will be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility based on&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt; 21&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No reported unstable chronic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interstate truckers are required to be at least 21 years old. Participants will not be&#xD;
      enrolled in the intervention until they complete the physical assessment component of the&#xD;
      baseline visit that includes blood pressure, lipids, and HbA1c. Individuals who do not meet&#xD;
      the established medical guidelines and regulations of the FMCSA will be excluded. Those&#xD;
      individuals will be advised to follow-up for care with their personal physicians, and/or will&#xD;
      be referred to a primary care clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health coaches will have at least weekly contact with participants to discuss individual&#xD;
      goals and behavior change. Motivational messages will be delivered in addition to weekly&#xD;
      content via text messages and/or emails. Research suggests that individuals who begin losing&#xD;
      weight quickly are more successful at weight loss and maintaining loss, therefore, after 3&#xD;
      weeks individuals who have not lost at least 3 pounds will receive additional contacts with&#xD;
      health coaches to address slow rate of weight loss. Individual Competitions surrounding&#xD;
      successful healthy behaviors of Truckers will be conducted every other week. Winning&#xD;
      behaviors will be shared with other participants by email, text, phone calls, blogs and/or&#xD;
      other distance friendly format to both engage drivers and model successful peer behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a study of weight loss intervention for long-haul commercial truck drivers who face&#xD;
      unusual challenges to a healthy lifestyle while working. Participants (n=13) will be&#xD;
      long-haul commercial truck drivers with a BMI over 30 kg/m2. Due to licensing issues, all&#xD;
      interstate truck drivers are required to be at least 21 years old (US DOT, FMCSA), and thus&#xD;
      proposed study participants will be at least 21 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are aware that there are some intrastate truck drivers who may be under age&#xD;
      21, however they are a much smaller and different population. By definition they are not&#xD;
      long-haul drivers, tend to have more job instability, have a different occupational&#xD;
      environment that is relevant to this study (e.g., sleep at home), and thus are a different&#xD;
      population that this research does not target. Thus, this study has sound rationale for not&#xD;
      including children ages 18-20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sampling will be convenient. Participants will be recruited using email, postal mail and&#xD;
      opportunities for personal contact that are identified through the Utah Trucking Association&#xD;
      website, newsletter, at truck stops, and at Commercial Truck Driver meetings. The&#xD;
      investigators will inquire for current interest among subjects from our current cross&#xD;
      sectional study who indicated interest in a follow-up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened for approximate BMI, and medical history prior to recruitment.&#xD;
      Participants under current treatment for cancer will be excluded. Participants with&#xD;
      significant medical issues (such as unstable blood pressure, diabetes mellitus) will be asked&#xD;
      to provide a medical release from their physician prior to participation. Participants&#xD;
      currently in treatment for cancer will be excluded. In addition participants will not be&#xD;
      enrolled until they have completed the physical assessment component of the study with blood&#xD;
      pressure below 159/99 mm Hg (stage 2 hypertension), HbA1c below 10.0%, and total cholesterol&#xD;
      below 300 mg/dL. If participants do not meet these standards a letter of permission to&#xD;
      participate from a physician will be required. Participants will be referred to their&#xD;
      personal physician or the primary care clinic at the University of Utah Redwood Health Center&#xD;
      if they do not have a personal physician to obtain such permission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will take place in the Occupational Medicine conference room at the University&#xD;
      of Utah Redwood Health Center where Drs. Eric Wood practice, to gather demographic data,&#xD;
      medical history, reported physical activity, occupational health outcomes (slips trips and&#xD;
      falls) and psychosocial factors, self-efficacy, sleepiness scale, job satisfaction and&#xD;
      measure blood lipids, hemoglobin A1c and HsCRP, and body weight and circumferences at&#xD;
      baseline and 12 weeks for all participants t. Participants will weigh themselves weekly using&#xD;
      a scale provided by the study and will report weekly weight to health coaches using a scale&#xD;
      provided via telephone, text, or email. Participants will have at least weekly contact with&#xD;
      research staff (health coaches) regarding the intervention in the first 12 weeks of WHEEL.&#xD;
      Contact will continue bi-weekly after the first 12 weeks of WHEEL with a goal of continued&#xD;
      weight loss or weight loss maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the weight loss intervention. Participants will be monitored&#xD;
      closely for weight loss success in the first 3 weeks of the intervention. If weight loss is&#xD;
      not at least 3 pounds, then health coaches will double their efforts with these participants&#xD;
      as it is known that early success is associated with better long-term success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will obtain information on questionnaires, asking a person's birth date,&#xD;
      but only record a person's age in tenths of a year. The investigators will measure height,&#xD;
      weight, waist, hip, chest, neck circumferences, blood pressure, heart rate, take a&#xD;
      finger-stick to measure fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, highly sensitive C-Reactive Protein,&#xD;
      and blood lipids using point of service analysis and perform a urinalysis. No blood specimens&#xD;
      will be stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and questionnaires will be completed in the Occupational Medicine conference&#xD;
      room at the University of Utah Redwood Health Center in Salt Lake City. This clinic is&#xD;
      conveniently located around the corner from a large truck stop, and close to both I-80 and&#xD;
      I-15, the two main interstates in Salt Lake City. The clinic has ample truck-friendly&#xD;
      parking. The investigators have obtained letters of support from The Utah Trucking&#xD;
      Association. Data will be recorded on laptop computers that are encrypted. Consent forms will&#xD;
      be transported to the University of Utah for storage in locked cabinets.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Participants will be screened for eligibility based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 21&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No reported unstable chronic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will not be enrolled in the intervention until they complete the physical&#xD;
             assessment component of the baseline visit that includes blood pressure, lipids, and&#xD;
             HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who do not meet the established medical guidelines and regulations of the&#xD;
             FMCSA will be excluded. Those individuals will be advised to follow-up for care with&#xD;
             their personal physicians, and/or will be referred to a primary care clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion of women&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women will be included as they are represented in this population, although, the&#xD;
        investigators expect, at rates that are less than the overall population. This is a&#xD;
        convenience sample, thus there will not be attempts to over or under represent genders. The&#xD;
        individualization of the interventions increases the likelihood of success of the&#xD;
        intervention with both men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion of minorities&#xD;
&#xD;
        The investigators will include minorities when possible. This is a convenience sample, so&#xD;
        there will not be attempts to either over or under represent any racial or ethnic group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion of Children&#xD;
&#xD;
        Commercial truck drivers must be 21 to drive interstate routes. Therefore, children,&#xD;
        including those 18-20 years old, will not be included.&#xD;
