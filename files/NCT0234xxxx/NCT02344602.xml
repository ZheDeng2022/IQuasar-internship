  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are at high risk of developing kidney&#xD;
      complications potentially leading to end stage renal disease. Uric acid (UA), the end product&#xD;
      of purine metabolism, emerged as an important determinant of renal and vascular injury due to&#xD;
      its ability activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and increase production&#xD;
      of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS cause progressive endothelial cell dysfunction,&#xD;
      inflammation, tissue fibrosis and eventually cell death. These processes are enhanced in DM&#xD;
      because of the effect of hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since existing preventive drug therapies fail to completely prevent kidney damage, an&#xD;
      examination of the effect of UA lowering against initiation and progression of renal and&#xD;
      vascular complications is therefore of the utmost importance. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      examine the effect of UA lowering with febuxostat on renal and systemic vascular function in&#xD;
      patients with uncomplicated T1DM. It was hypothesized that UA lowering will improve kidney&#xD;
      and systemic vascular function through effects on blood vessel function and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney and blood vessel function will be assessed under conditions of normal and high blood&#xD;
      sugar levels before and after 8 weeks of treatment with the UA lowering drug febuxostat in&#xD;
      patients with diabetes and during normoglycemia only in health controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment for renal and vascular complications in DM patients includes blockade of&#xD;
      the RAAS. Unfortunately, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II&#xD;
      (AngII) receptor blockers (ARBs) lead to incomplete RAAS suppression, and do not completely&#xD;
      prevent renal or vascular complications. Moreover, dual RAAS blockade increases renal and&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk. Recent experimental work suggests that UA lowering therapies can block&#xD;
      the RAAS, suppress inflammation and promote renal and systemic vascular protection.&#xD;
      Therefore, our study is critical in determining the possible role of early UA lowering on&#xD;
      renal and systemic hemodynamic dysfunction in young patients with T1DM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uric acid (UA) was recently suggested to exert deleterious effects on blood pressure and&#xD;
      renal function, even when baseline UA levels are within the normal range. UA activates the&#xD;
      renin angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), increases oxidative stress and promotes&#xD;
      inflammation. As a consequence, higher UA levels are associated with metabolic abnormalities&#xD;
      (insulin resistance, hyperglycemia), cardiovascular disease (hypertension, endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction, arterial stiffness, cardiac diastolic dysfunction) and kidney function&#xD;
      abnormalities (hyperfiltration - a marker for intraglomerular hypertension, proteinuria).&#xD;
      Thus pharmacologic UA lowering may promote renal and cardiovascular protection. The&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying these protective effects in humans, prior to the onset of clinical&#xD;
      disease, remain unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is focused on the prevention of complications in young, normotensive type 1&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients with normal renal function and UA levels. The study will&#xD;
      examine the effect of UA lowering with febuxostat (FBX) on renal hemodynamic function,&#xD;
      vascular function and urinary inflammatory biomarkers. Based on substantial supportive&#xD;
      pre-clinical and epidemiological data, we hypothesize that lowering UA levels that are within&#xD;
      normal range at baseline will: 1) ameliorate hemodynamic abnormalities characteristic of&#xD;
      T1DM, and reduce renal and systemic hypertensive responses to hyperglycemia; 2) ameliorate&#xD;
      endothelial function abnormalities characteristic of T1DM; 3) reduce urinary inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines/chemokine excretion.&#xD;
