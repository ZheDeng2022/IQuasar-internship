  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Buckypaper (BP) is an innovative material that has attracted the attention of many&#xD;
      research groups engaged in the study of its possible applications in various technological&#xD;
      fields. Our purpose is demonstrate the viability of the application of nanotechnologies to&#xD;
      the General Surgery in human with thwe use of a new self standing prosthetic device for the&#xD;
      reconstruction of abdominal wall defects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The interesting material properties, such as good mechanical strength, electrical&#xD;
      conductivity, low density, porosity adaptable, are closely associated to the intrinsic&#xD;
      characteristics of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), of which BP is made . The high surface&#xD;
      development of CNT, in addition to promoting their aggregation, allows the preparation of&#xD;
      micro-and nano-porous membranes that exclude the passage of colloidal particles with a&#xD;
      diameter greater than 50 nm. The micro-porous structure, also gives the BP high capacity to&#xD;
      absorb liquids, such as water, for which the effect of capillarity, penetrates quickly in the&#xD;
      mesh material. This could be a possible interpretation of the rapid and effective adhesion of&#xD;
      BP to humid biological tissues observed in our preliminary studies on the effects of the BP&#xD;
      implanted in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bio-adhesion of BP has been documented in ex vivo preliminary experiments mechanical&#xD;
      peeling (bench surgery). The results showed that the force required the posting of BP from&#xD;
      organic support is much greater than that required for the conventional prosthesis made from&#xD;
      polymer networks, commonly used in human hernia surgery fixed with fibrin glue or synthetic&#xD;
      materials. Based on these assessments the use of BP could be introduced in the field of&#xD;
      prosthetic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these assessments and based on the potential offered by the use of BP in the field&#xD;
      of prosthetic surgery, deductible by the intrinsic characteristics of the material in this&#xD;
      project is expected to further research for the development of a new generation of prosthetic&#xD;
      materials for humans use, easily implantable by the surgeon without the need for sutures,&#xD;
      graphs and / or biological glues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reasons are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. stitches: they could tighten the knot vessels (ischemia-atrophy) or nerves (chronic&#xD;
           pain);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. graphs: placing blind and can cause bleeding or pain;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. biological glues: derived from the plasma of donors and thus could transmit diseases&#xD;
           unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is still unknown if BP has the appropriate mechanical properties to withstand the stresses&#xD;
      that occur on the abdominal wall and In any case is documented the good bio-adhesion on&#xD;
      living tissues and anatomical preparations, but only if made humid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploiting the functional groups present or introduced into the crystalline structure of&#xD;
      MWCNTs (multiwall carbon nanotube) and/or on the polymer, it will be possible to implant on&#xD;
      the muscle/muscular fascia surface, the composite material, to obtain gripping. Moreover,&#xD;
      biologically active molecules, with functions antimicrobial, anti-adhesive, anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      or analgesic, can be introduced into the crystalline structure of MWCNTs, for modulate the&#xD;
      inflammatory response and the incorporation of the implanted material in the fibrous scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like investigate the effects of exposition to BP fragments on healthy tissues and&#xD;
      CaCo2 cells (Cancer Colon cluster), MCF-7 (Michigan Cancer Foundation-7), a breast cancer&#xD;
      cell line, and hSCs (healthy smooth-muscle cells) of thyroid artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project is to obtain results that can direct the search for the&#xD;
      ultimate realization of a prosthetic device for use in human abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Research Group proposes that the present research program has all the skills to achieve&#xD;
      all the objectives .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol have been drawn in the respect of environmental policies, and ethical principles&#xD;
      on experimentation on animal model, in accordance with the guidelines of the European Union&#xD;
      (86/609/EEC-European Economic Community), and the Italian Law n° 116/92.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical-chemical parameters examined from blood samples of 1 ml will be: BUN (blood urea&#xD;
      nitrogen), blood glucose, creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, albumin, total&#xD;
      Blood proteins levels, SGOT (serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase), SGPT (serum&#xD;
      glutamate pyruvate transaminase), GGT (galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase), ALP&#xD;
      (alkaline phosphatase) and fractionated bilirubin, PT (prothrombin time), APTT/PTT (activated&#xD;
      partial thromboplastin time / prothrombin time), Fibrinogen, CBC (complete blood count)&#xD;
      formula, lymphocyte sub-populations, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure will be performed under sedation and followed by body weight check and the&#xD;
      pick-up of a blood sample. The same procedure will be repeated twice at the intervention and&#xD;
      after 35 days at the sacrifice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of sacrifice will be prepared anatomic samples of all the viscera and of the&#xD;
      implantation site, to be studied histologically. Pathohistological samples for microscopic&#xD;
      examination will be prepared. Portions of BP implanted in BPR1-BPR15 will be excised with all&#xD;
      the surrounding fascia, dermal and muscular tissues. The same procedures will be performed,&#xD;
      also in PRR16-PRR30 group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-operative pain, as in the human, it will be mild, and will be treated with&#xD;
      analgesics according to techniques standardized in humans. In our experience, the animals&#xD;
      undergo to prosthetic surgery, both the experimental and the control group, will treated with&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics and pain medication in the immediate post -operative, and will be&#xD;
      closely watched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if in animal model, the sterility of all the surgical procedure prevents inflammation,&#xD;
      edema and sepsis and abscesses and ensures a low level of postoperative pain. The days after&#xD;
      the surgical procedure is expected a moderate appetite of the operated animals and mild&#xD;
      clinical symptoms related to the post-operative .&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treated animals will be observed daily to carefully control the amount of food that will&#xD;
      be consumed and thus the potential loss of appetite. Will be look for evidence of possible&#xD;
      inflammatory and degenerative processes affecting the skin of the abdominal wall, the&#xD;
      symptoms of infection or rejection of the prosthesis. If weight loss will be excessive (e.g.&#xD;
      more than 10% of the normal weight of an animal of the same race, the same age and in&#xD;
      comparison to the control group), or the animal will show clinical symptoms of suffering more&#xD;
      than a normal postoperative, will be subjected to general anesthesia and then deleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analgesic and antibiotic therapy performed in the postoperative period will be as follows&#xD;
      :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotic : enrofloxacin 2.5 mg /kg /day I.M. for 5/ 7 days; and anti-inflammatory analgesic&#xD;
      : ketoprofen, Findol 10%, 0.3 ml/10kg/die i.m. for 3 /5 days. If necessary will be given also&#xD;
      tramadol, 2-4 mg /kg/day in the first 2 /3 days post-intervention . The surgical wound will&#xD;
      be checked daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical -chemical parameters examined from blood samples of 3 ml will be: BUN (Blood&#xD;
      Urea Nitrogen), blood glucose, creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, albumin,&#xD;
      total proteinemia and Blood protein level, SGOT(Serum Glutei Oxaloacetic Transaminase),&#xD;
      SGPT(Serum Glutamic PyruvateTransaminase), GGT(gamma glutamyl transferase), ALP(alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase) and fractionated bilirubin, PT(Prothrombin Time), APTT/PTT(Activated partial&#xD;
      thromboplastin time), Fibrinogen, CBC(Complete Blood Count) formula, lymphocyte&#xD;
      subpopulations, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the sacrifice the organ samples will be fixed in 10% buffered formalin, cut and stained&#xD;
      with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) for histological observation.&#xD;
