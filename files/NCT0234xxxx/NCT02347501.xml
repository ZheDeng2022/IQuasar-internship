    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if sitagliptin (Januvia®) improves&#xD;
      psoriasis severity after 24 weeks of treatment in 60 participants with psoriasis who do not&#xD;
      have type 2 diabetes mellitus, and who are due to receive a course of narrowband&#xD;
      ultraviolet-B phototherapy (NB-UVB). The investigators will compare the change in psoriasis&#xD;
      severity in 60 participants treated with both sitagliptin and NB-UVB to 60 participants&#xD;
      treated with NB-UVB alone. Participants will be recruited from two centres and after a 3 week&#xD;
      run-in period will be followed prospectively for 36 weeks. Participants will be stratified by&#xD;
      centre, plasma glycated haemoglobin level (HbA1c), obesity status and previous response to&#xD;
      NB-UVB, after which they will be randomly allocated to Arm A or Arm B. Participants will be&#xD;
      treated with either sitagliptin for 24 weeks and NB-UVB (Arm A), or NB-UVB alone (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the research participants and the investigators will be aware of the trial arm to which&#xD;
      the research participant has been allocated randomly (open-label study). Research&#xD;
      participants are prohibited from using systemic psoriasis therapy for the duration of their&#xD;
      trial involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at 8 study visits over 39 weeks. Participants will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires, have a medical history recorded and physical examination, blood sampling and&#xD;
      skin biopsies taken (in a small number of willing participants at 2 visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following endpoints will be analysed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in psoriasis severity at 24 and 36 weeks; changes in validated quality of life&#xD;
      scores; incidence of adverse events; incidence of discontinuation of one of the study IMPs,&#xD;
      time to relapse of psoriasis; changes in cardiovascular disease risk factor profiles; changes&#xD;
      in cytokines, hormones, expression of immune proteins in blood and skin biopsies; and genetic&#xD;
      profiles that predicts best response to sitagliptin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that sitagliptin therapy decreases psoriasis severity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease affecting approximately 2% of the world's&#xD;
      population. It is characterised by keratinocyte hyperproliferation, by aberrant keratinocyte&#xD;
      differentiation and by cutaneous inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is expressed on keratinocytes and its activity is upregulated&#xD;
      in psoriasis. DPP-4 inhibition suppresses keratinocyte proliferation and restores partially&#xD;
      keratinocyte differentiation. The main site of DPP-4 activity is cluster of differentiation&#xD;
      antigen 26 (CD26). CD26 is a marker of T cell activation and is a key molecule in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. One case of DPP-4 inhibitor therapy improving psoriasis&#xD;
      severity has been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agents used to treat psoriasis target commonly the underlying inflammation. C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP) is a sensitive, systemic marker of inflammation. In people with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (T2DM) DPP-4 inhibitor therapy decreases CRP concentrations. Serum CRP concentrations&#xD;
      correlate with psoriasis severity and interventions that decrease the CRP concentration may&#xD;
      decrease also psoriasis severity. Medications that improve insulin resistance may decrease&#xD;
      also systemic inflammation and improve psoriasis. We have shown previously, in psoriasis&#xD;
      patients without T2DM (both lean and obese), that the fasting insulin concentration and the&#xD;
      homeostatic model of insulin resistance (measures of insulin resistance) correlate strongly&#xD;
      with the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI, a measure of psoriasis severity: r=0.48,&#xD;
      p&lt;0.001; r=0.49, p&lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DPP-4 inhibitors prevent also the degradation of insulin secretagogues, such as glucagon-like&#xD;
      peptide-1 (GLP-1), thereby ameliorating hyperglycaemia without causing hypoglycaemia. Due to&#xD;
      this effect DPP-4 inhibitors are effective for the treatment of T2DM. Other interventions&#xD;
      which increase GLP-1 receptor activation, such as roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery and GLP-1&#xD;
      analogue therapy, can improve also psoriasis severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have reported previously a significant improvement in two patients with psoriasis and&#xD;
      diabetes treated with the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide. In a subsequent open study of 7&#xD;
      patients with both psoriasis and type 2 diabetes we found a significant reduction in&#xD;
      psoriasis severity and a significant improvement in quality of life following treatment with&#xD;
      liraglutide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Name and Description of the Investigational Medicinal Products(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Januvia® 100 mg tablets, which are film-coated tablets for oral ingestion that contain 100mg&#xD;
      of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For research participants with moderate kidney disease (CrCl &lt; 50 ml/min or eGFR &lt; 50&#xD;
      ml/min/1.73m2), a dose of 50mg per day of sitagliptin will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks and benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 1% of people who take Januvia® tablets experience upper respiratory tract infection&#xD;
      (no greater incidence than with placebo), hypoglycaemia (no greater incidence than with&#xD;
      placebo), headache or limb pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential benefits of DPP-4 inhibition include decreased risk of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      and decreased risk of bone fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated benefits of Januvia® therapy in psoriasis patients without type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      thus justify the potential risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of and justification for the route of administration, dosage, dosage regimen and&#xD;
      treatment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a two centre, thirty-nine week, prospective, randomized, open-label clinical&#xD;
      trial of oral Januvia® (sitagliptin) tablets in 120 people with psoriasis without diabetes&#xD;
      who are due to undergo a course of NB-UVB phototherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a three week run-in period, where research participants will not receive the&#xD;
      investigational medicinal product, research participants will be allocated randomly, after&#xD;
      stratification by centre, by HbA1c level (HbA1c &lt; 38mmol/mol or ≥ 38mmol/mol), BMI level (BMI&#xD;
      &lt; 30 kg/m2 or ≥ 30 kg/m2) and previous response to NB-UVB (achieved remission within 25&#xD;
      exposures during most recent course of NBUVB or not) either to Arm A or to Arm B. Those who&#xD;
      have not been exposed previously to NBUVB will be placed in the &quot;did not achieve remission&#xD;
      within 25 exposures&quot; group. Research participants allocated to Arm A will receive a twenty&#xD;
      six week supply of Januvia® tablets (DPP-4 Inhibitor) and will be instructed to ingest orally&#xD;
      one 100mg tablet once daily (or 50mg once daily for participants with moderate kidney&#xD;
      disease) for twenty four weeks. Research participants allocated to Arm B will receive no&#xD;
      treatment (aside from usual medications and phototherapy). Both the research participants and&#xD;
      the investigators will be aware of the trial arm to which the research participant has been&#xD;
      allocated randomly (open-label study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research participants will be prohibited from making any changes to the dose of medications&#xD;
      used to treat psoriasis. Any other medications that are considered necessary for the&#xD;
      participant's welfare and will not interfere with the study medication may be given at the&#xD;
      discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Januvia® is licensed to improve glycaemic control for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The&#xD;
      Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) states that the dose of Januvia® is 100mg once daily&#xD;
      (using tablets for oral ingestion). For research participants with moderate kidney disease&#xD;
      (CrCl &lt; 50 ml/min or eGFR &lt; 50 ml/min/1.73m2), the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC)&#xD;
      states that the dose of Januvia® is 50mg once daily (using tablets for oral ingestion). In&#xD;
      keeping with this all participants with an eGFR &lt; 50ml/min/1.73m2 who are due to receive&#xD;
      Januvia® will receive 50mg once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor therapy decreases psoriasis severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of Trial Conduct:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, with the guidelines of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki (see Appendix 2), with the International Conference of Harmonisation&#xD;
      Tripartite Guideline on Good Clinical Practice, with all applicable regulatory requirements&#xD;
      and with data protection legislation (Data Protection Act 1988 and Data Protection Amendment&#xD;
      Act 2003)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population to be studied will be psoriasis patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enrol 120 research participants in total. Research participants will be recruited&#xD;
      from two centres: St Vincent's University Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin 4 and Adelaide and Meath&#xD;
      Hospital, Tallaght, Dublin 24. These hospitals provide outpatient dermatology services.&#xD;
      Psoriasis patients attending these centres who have a psoriasis area and severity index&#xD;
      (PASI) greater than 7 and who are due to undergo a course of NB-UVB phototherapy will be&#xD;
      considered potentially eligible research participants and will be invited to attend for a&#xD;
      screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification and Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially eligible research participants will be identified through use of patient&#xD;
      databases in St Vincent's University Hospital and in Adelaide and Meath Hospital and through&#xD;
      review of healthcare records in St Vincent's University Hospital and in Adelaide and Meath&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially eligible research participants will be recruited in one of two ways by the study&#xD;
      investigators or suitably qualified designee. One of these two ways will be during a clinic&#xD;
      visit by the study investigators or suitably qualified designee. The other of the two ways&#xD;
      will be mailing a letter of invitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A record of all medication taken by study participants in the month before visit 1 and&#xD;
      concomitant medication a participant takes throughout the study will be recorded on the&#xD;
      appropriate page of the Case Report Form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment compliance of research participants will be measured by pill counts. Research&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to bring opened, unopened and empty investigational medicinal&#xD;
      product packages to each visit in order to allow the assessment of compliance with study&#xD;
      treatment. A record of all investigational medicinal product dispensed and returned will be&#xD;
      documented on the investigational medicinal product dispensing and accountability log. Blood&#xD;
      taken during stages when the participant is expected to be taking drug therapy will be used&#xD;
      for future determination of plasma glucose and glycated haemoglobin concentrations. These&#xD;
      concentrations will also be used to help ascertain compliance with the allocated treatment&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for measurement of laboratory parameters will be taken between the hours of&#xD;
      0800 and 1200 after a greater than 12 hour overnight fast (with the exception of the&#xD;
      Screening Visit when participants can attend in a non fasting state) and before ingestion of&#xD;
      the study investigational medicinal product. The blood will be taken by a senior clinician,&#xD;
      or suitably qualified designee, with competence and experience in the procedure of&#xD;
      venepuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty millilitres (30ml) of blood will be drawn during visit 1, and 73.5 ml during visit 2.&#xD;
      Sixty millilitres (60ml) of blood will be drawn from the research participants during visits&#xD;
      3 to 5, and at visit 7. During visits 6 and 8, 67.5 mls of blood will be drawn.Blood will be&#xD;
      drawn into vacutainer tubes containing either ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), lithium&#xD;
      heparin, sodium fluoride, clot activator or a DPP-4 inhibitor cocktail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each research participant will be asked to give a blood sample for genetic analysis at the&#xD;
      2nd Visit. These genetic samples will be analysed to try determine the genetic, and/or&#xD;
      epigenetic, profile that predicts best response to DPP-4 inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood will be stored for future DNA extraction using the protocols detailed in the&#xD;
      Molecular Medicine Ireland Guideline for Standardised Biobanking (First Edition 2010). This&#xD;
      involves drawing blood into a blood tube containing EDTA and storing the blood tube at -20°C&#xD;
      in secure, dedicated freezers in the Research Laboratories in the Education and Research&#xD;
      Centre in St Vincent's University Hospital. The blood will be stored within 12 hours of blood&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood that has been stored for future DNA extraction will be destroyed once the DNA analyses&#xD;
      are complete. Disposal of this material will be in accordance with current practice in this&#xD;
      unit and with the written protocols in place in this unit. Disposal will involve the use of&#xD;
      solid plastic waste containers which will be sent for incineration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To protect the research participant's identity, a unique identification code will be assigned&#xD;
      by the Investigator, or authorised designee, to each participant's genetic sample and used in&#xD;
      lieu of the participant's name. This coded form of identification, instead of the&#xD;
      participant's name, will appear on all documents/databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and baseline clinical data will be summarized using descriptive statistics by&#xD;
      treatment group. Similarly, the primary and secondary efficacy variables will be summarized&#xD;
      using descriptive statistics by treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from research participants who are not allocated to either arm of the study and who do&#xD;
      not receive a supply of the investigational medicinal product will be excluded from&#xD;
      statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T tests (or the appropriate alternative for non-parametric data), using two-sided tests, will&#xD;
      be used to test for significant differences between the sets of data obtained. The&#xD;
      independent samples T test will be used to assess for differences between the effects of the&#xD;
      test product (Januvia®) compared to the effects of no additional treatment. Chi square&#xD;
      analyses will be used to test for significant differences in categorical variables between&#xD;
      the sets of data obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analyses will be performed on those research participants who:&#xD;
&#xD;
      complete the visit 6 assessment; have severe psoriasis; have non-severe psoriasis; are male;&#xD;
      are female; are obese; and are older than 45 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Packaging and Labelling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study medication will be labelled and stored in accordance with Annex 13 of the EU&#xD;
      guidelines of good manufacturing practice in respect of investigational medicinal products&#xD;
      for human use, the SPC and hospital procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit (Visit 1, Week -3) Before any screening examinations take place potentially&#xD;
      eligible research participants will be given a full explanation as to what participation in&#xD;
      the study would involve - this will be done both verbally and in writing in the form of a&#xD;
      written participant information leaflet. Potential research participants will be given&#xD;
      sufficient time to consider their participation in the study and to ask any questions&#xD;
      concerning the study. Potential research participants who are willing to take part in the&#xD;
      study will be asked then to sign an informed consent form. No study related procedures will&#xD;
      take place for any research participant before the informed consent form has been signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will then be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Checking against inclusion and exclusion criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obtaining demographic information;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Obtaining a detailed medical history (previously diagnosed illnesses etc);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Obtaining a detailed medication history for the previous month;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Measurement of weight, blood pressure and heart rate;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Performing a urine based pregnancy test (women of child bearing potential only);&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Assessment of PASI; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Blood sampling for laboratory examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An identification number will be allocated to the potential research participant following&#xD;
      informed consent and provided that he or she meets the inclusion criteria and does not have&#xD;
      an exclusion criterion to study entry. This identification number, together with the&#xD;
      participant's initials, will act as a unique identifier for that participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (Visit 2, Day 0) The potential research participant will return for the baseline&#xD;
      visit within three weeks of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Completion of quality of life questionnaires by the research participant (Dermatology&#xD;
           Life Quality Index (DLQI); EuroQol five item questionnaire (EQ-5D); Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
           Depression Scale (HADS); and Stanford HAQ 8-Item Disability Scale (HAQ-8) ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recording of adverse events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recording of changes in concomitant medication;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Measurement of height, weight, blood pressure and heart rate;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Performing a urine based pregnancy test (women of child bearing potential only);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assessment of PASI; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Blood sampling for laboratory examination. If the participant is willing a skin biopsy&#xD;
           will be performed, using a sterile technique by an experienced physician, to determine&#xD;
           skin immune cell number and skin pro-inflammatory protein level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant is noted to score greater than 8 (out of 21) on either the anxiety or the&#xD;
      depression components of the HADS, at this or any subsequent study visits, their General&#xD;
      Practitioner (GP) will be advised of this and of the high likelihood of depressive/affective&#xD;
      mental illness which may require treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator, or authorised designee, will allocate then the research participant to a&#xD;
      trial treatment arm using one of sixteen (8 per centre) prepared randomisation lists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator, or authorised designee, will chose the appropriate list based on the&#xD;
      participant's centre, HbA1c level (HbA1c &lt; 38mmol/mol or ≥ 38mmol/mol), BMI level (BMI &lt; 30&#xD;
      kg/m2 or ≥ 30kg/m2) and previous response to NB-UVB (achieved remission within 25 exposures&#xD;
      during most recent course of NBUVB or not). Those who have not been exposed previously to&#xD;
      NBUVB will be placed in the &quot;did not achieve remission within 25 exposures&quot; group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For research participants allocated randomly to treatment arm A the investigator, or&#xD;
      authorised designee, will ask the participant to bring back all used and unused Januvia®&#xD;
      tablet packages at each study visit to enable a pill compliance check to be performed.&#xD;

      advised to agree to attend an early withdrawal visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a separate section in the CRF to be completed if the research participant&#xD;
      withdraws early from the study before week 36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Completion of quality of life questionnaires by the research participant as detailed in&#xD;

&#xD;
      The research participant's involvement in this study will end following the completion of the&#xD;
      End of Study Visit (or Early Withdrawal visit if applicable). Once participants have&#xD;
      completed their involvement in this study they will be provided with standard treatment by&#xD;
      their usual healthcare providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive assessments of any apparent toxicity experienced by the research participant&#xD;
      will be performed throughout the course of the study from the time of participant's signature&#xD;
      of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs) considered related to Study Drug at the End of Study Visit (or Early&#xD;
      Withdrawal Visit, if applicable) will be followed until the participant is stable or the AE&#xD;
      is resolved or the participant is lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any medical condition, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date&#xD;
      before the Baseline Visit and not related to a protocol-associated procedure, is not an AE.&#xD;
      It will be considered to be pre-existing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete and appropriate data on all Adverse Events experienced (observed, volunteered or&#xD;
      elicited) during the reporting period will be reported on an ongoing basis in the Adverse&#xD;
      Event Form pages of the Case Report Form. The investigator will classify the severity of an&#xD;
      adverse event. The investigator will systematically assess the relationship of the adverse&#xD;
      event to the investigational medicinal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Information about all SAEs will be collected and&#xD;
      recorded on the SAE Report Form. Each SAE must be reported by the Investigator, or an&#xD;
      authorised designee, to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and scientific judgement will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is&#xD;
      appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately&#xD;
      life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation, but may jeopardise the research&#xD;
      participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the&#xD;
      definition above. These will be considered also serious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of Population and Method of Estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enrol 120 research participants in total in the two sites. The primary objective&#xD;
      of the research project is to determine the change in the psoriasis area and severity index&#xD;
      (ΔPASI) during twenty four weeks of treatment with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor&#xD;
      (Januvia®, 100mg daily or 50mg daily for participants with moderate kidney disease) in&#xD;
      psoriasis patients undergoing narrow-band ultraviolet-B (NB-UVB) light therapy. This will be&#xD;
      compared to the ΔPASI of psoriasis patients undergoing NB-UVB light therapy who are allocated&#xD;
      randomly to not receive any additional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kleinpenning et al have determined previously the effect of two different NB-UVB light&#xD;
      therapy regimens on the decrease in PASI three months after completion of a course of NB-UVB&#xD;
      light therapy. Three months after cessation of NB-UVB light therapy the decrease in the PASI&#xD;
      in those receiving an high-dose regimen was 5.93±4.1compared to baseline. This decrease in&#xD;
      PASI was significantly less in the group receiving a low-dose regimen (4.14±2.96, p&lt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these data, and assuming a 33% dropout rate, we have calculated that we will require&#xD;
      60 research participants (in each arm) to detect a greater than 33% difference in the ΔPASI&#xD;
      with 80% power and a 5% significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unit of randomisation will be the individual research participant. After stratification&#xD;
      by centre, by HbA1c level (HbA1c &lt; 38mmol/mol or ≥ 38mmol/mol), BMI level (BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2 or&#xD;
      ≥ 30 kg/m2) and previous response to NB-UVB (achieved remission within 25 exposures during&#xD;
      most recent course of NBUVB or not) 120 research participants will be assigned randomly, in a&#xD;
      ratio of 1:1 using blocks of 2, to receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Januvia® tablets; OR No additional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve this we have prepared 8 randomisation lists using a web-based random&#xD;
      generator programme. One copy of this document will be used for each centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant the investigator, or authorised designee, will chose the appropriate&#xD;
      list and will add the participant's identifier to the list in chronological order. This list&#xD;
      will be thereby used to determine the study treatment which the participant will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random allocation will occur at visit 2 (baseline visit) once all screening procedures&#xD;
      required at visit 1 (screening visit) have been completed, once it has been confirmed that&#xD;
      the participant satisfies all inclusion and exclusion criteria and once the participant&#xD;
      completes the three week run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification numbers will be assigned chronologically in consecutive, ascending order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before initiating this study the Study Protocol, Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC),&#xD;
      Patient Information Leaflet and Informed Consent Form, applicable advertising, and any other&#xD;
      written information to be given to participants will be reviewed and approved by a properly&#xD;
      constituted Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC/IRB). A signed and&#xD;
      dated statement that all documents submitted for review have been approved by the IEC/IRB&#xD;
      will be given to the Sponsor or designee before the study can commence at a site. The&#xD;
      membership and the constitution of the IEC/IRB who approved the documents will be also&#xD;
      supplied to the Sponsor or designee.&#xD;
&#xD;
