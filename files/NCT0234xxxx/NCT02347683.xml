      The optimal timing to measure thyroglobulin(Tg) after thyroidectomy is unknown in patients&#xD;
      with thyroid cancer. The ATA and NCCN guidelines are not specific on optimal timing of Tg&#xD;
      levels in post-op state and suggest anywhere between 2-12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis - Post -op Tg nadirs at 6-8 weeks .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective -Determine optimal timing of post thyroidectomy Tg nadir, so to determine&#xD;
      the most accurate time to check post operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome - Determine factors that will affect Tg levels post operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adults age 19 and above already planning to undergo near total /total thyroidectomy for&#xD;
      reasons unrelated to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure Tg , Tg Ab and TSH pre-op, post op ---&gt; 7-14 days, 4 wk, 6 wk, and 3 month in&#xD;
      patients with pathology confirmed benign disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure Tg , Tg Ab , TSH pre-op, post op ---&gt; 7-14 days, 4 wk, 6 wk, 3 month, 6 month, and 12&#xD;
      month in patients with thyroid cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid cancer, the most common endocrine tumor, constitutes 3.8% of all cancers. 62,980 new&#xD;
      cases were estimated in the U.S. in 20141, an increasing trend from the 37,200 new cases in&#xD;
      20092. 90% of all thyroid cancers are differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTC), which include&#xD;
      both papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of DTC involves a total thyroidectomy, with possible central and lateral neck&#xD;
      dissection if there are clinical lymph node involvement, except for low-risk lesions that are&#xD;
      unifocal, intrathyroidal, node-negative and measuring less than 1 cm in size. Radioactive&#xD;
      iodine ablation of any remnant thyroid tissue may follow a total thyroidectomy depending on&#xD;
      the risk stratification of the patient3. As for any cancer, management of thyroid cancer&#xD;
      involves long-term surveillance for early detection of disease recurrence3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the ATA guidelines, postoperative surveillance includes regular (every 6 to 12&#xD;
      months) clinical evaluation for tumor recurrence, evaluation with neck ultrasound and serum&#xD;
      Thyroglobulin (Tg) levels while on levothyroxine replacement3. Serum Tg has become a very&#xD;
      useful and well-acknowledged marker in patients with thyroid cancer post thyroidectomy for&#xD;
      disease persistence, metastasis or recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroglobulin is a 660 kDa dimeric glycoprotein that is exclusively produced and stored by&#xD;
      thyroid follicular cells in benign conditions, but also by well-differentiated thyroid cancer&#xD;
      cells4. A total thyroidectomy for higher risk patients is thus not only is important to&#xD;
      provide definitive treatment and decrease risk of recurrence, but also allows for long term&#xD;
      follow-up with Tg levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One study has reported Tg is eliminated through the liver and its half-life following total&#xD;
      thyroidectomy has been reported to be about 65.2 hours. The Tg level was noted to decrease to&#xD;
      less than 5-10 ng/ml 25 days after thyroidectomy, or after 7 to 10 half-lives in 11 patient&#xD;
      samples5. Detection of Tg following the total thyroidectomy during long-term surveillance&#xD;
      would therefore suggest persistent thyroid tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the determined half-life of Tg, in a retrospective study with 36 patients with&#xD;
      low-risk papillary thyroid carcinoma, the unstimulated Tg level fell to &lt; 0.5 ng/ml after 6&#xD;
      months postoperatively in only 61%, and after 2 years postoperatively in 100% of the&#xD;
      patients6. No prospective studies have yet determined the nadir of the Tg level post&#xD;
      thyroidectomy. In our personal clinical experience, unstimulated serum Tg levels may be found&#xD;
      undetectable 6 to 12 weeks following a total thyroidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of&#xD;
      unstimulated (normal or low TSH ) serum Tg in assessing completeness of thyroidectomy (&lt; 0.5&#xD;
      ng/ml) have been reported to be 70%, 100%, 100% and 92% respectively6. Obtaining a basal&#xD;
      unstimulated serum Tg level post thyroidectomy not only determines the completeness of the&#xD;
      total thyroidectomy7, but also provides a basal level for future comparison during long-term&#xD;
      surveillance. The high negative predictive value allows for the identification of patients&#xD;
      less likely to have disease recurrence and provide less aggressive and more cost effective&#xD;
      management strategies3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal time to obtain an unstimulated serum Tg level has not yet been determined.&#xD;
      Obtaining the Tg level too early following the total thyroidectomy may result in a&#xD;
      misleadingly significant Tg level and erroneously suggest residual disease, thereby leading&#xD;
      to unnecessary further investigation and more aggressive management strategies. NCCN&#xD;
      guidelines suggest to check anywhere between 2-12 weeks in patients with thyroid cancer 8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radioactive iodine ablation of remnant thyroid tissue may potentially be avoided with a&#xD;
      postsurgical stimulated Tg level of &lt; 1ng/ml in low risk, well-differentiated thyroid&#xD;
      cancer9. This practice is not yet approved by the American Thyroid Association, and is less&#xD;
      likely to be feasible with no concensus on the timing of the Tg measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is therefore to find the nadir of the unstimulated serum Tg level&#xD;
      following total thyroidectomy, and therefore the optimal time for Tg measurement in&#xD;
      postoperative surveillance.&#xD;
