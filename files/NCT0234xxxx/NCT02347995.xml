  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke survivors experience severe muscle wasting during the chronic phase of recovery, with&#xD;
      implications for strength, function and general health. Although resistive exercise training&#xD;
      effectively combats this problem, it is unknown whether sub-optimal protein intake limits the&#xD;
      observed gains in skeletal muscle growth. Skeletal muscle adaptations may occur when&#xD;
      resistive training (RT) is combined with nutritional therapy in the form of post- exercise&#xD;
      protein consumption. This study would be the first to directly compare RT+protein&#xD;
      supplementation to RT+placebo (same calories as protein supplement) in those with chronic&#xD;
      hemiparesis caused by stroke, providing evidence-based rationale for combination therapy in&#xD;
      the clinical care of this population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The VA research team has played a prominent role in documenting the significant skeletal&#xD;
      muscle atrophy that accompanies chronic hemiparesis after disabling stroke. Muscle volume is&#xD;
      reduced by 24% in paretic vs. non-paretic legs, having significant implications for strength,&#xD;
      function, fitness, metabolism and general health. The investigators' previous work&#xD;
      establishes progressive, high-intensity resistive training (RT) as an effective&#xD;
      rehabilitation strategy for older stroke survivors, producing thigh muscle hypertrophy on&#xD;
      both the paretic and non-paretic sides. Protein supplementation can significantly augment&#xD;
      gains in muscle mass after RT in healthy populations, but no experiments have yet been&#xD;
      conducted in stroke. New preliminary data from the investigators' group indicates that stroke&#xD;
      participants consume 20% less protein than the recommended daily amount for older individuals&#xD;
      (0.80 vs. 1.0 g/kg/day) suggesting that relative gains in skeletal muscle could be&#xD;
      significantly better in the presence of adequate protein intake. New data also indicates that&#xD;
      leg muscle mass predicts resting metabolic rate (RMR) in stroke, implying that a combined&#xD;
      nutrition and RT therapy aimed at maximizing muscle gains would translate into improved&#xD;
      energy balance, a key factor in rehabilitation success. A better understanding of the true&#xD;
      potential for aggressive RT interventions to address stroke-related atrophy and related&#xD;
      problems for maximum benefit awaits clinical trials directly comparing RT with and without&#xD;
      nutritional therapy. The investigators propose to conduct a 12-week randomized placebo&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial comparing the effects of RT+ protein supplementation at 1.2&#xD;
      g/kg/day (RT+PRO) vs. RT+isocaloric placebo (RT+PLA) on body composition, hypertrophy,&#xD;
      strength, functional mobility and energy expenditure in chronic stroke.&#xD;
