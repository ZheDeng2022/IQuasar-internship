      This is a phase 1 study of concurrent chemoradiation using a regimen of sorafenib and&#xD;
      vorinostat with gemcitabine and radiation following chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer to find the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the concurrent chemoradiation&#xD;
      combination. A traditional 3+3 dose-escalation design will be conducted for the sorafenib and&#xD;
      vorinostat dose escalation. Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas without distant metastasis that&#xD;
      has been treated with ≥ 1 prior therapy (not including radiation) encompassing at least 2&#xD;
      months. Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. Ability to take oral medication.&#xD;
      To determine the doses and schedule appropriate for phase 2 study of sorafenib and vorinostat&#xD;
      with concurrent gemcitabine and radiation therapy (RT) as neoadjuvant treatment of pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer following chemotherapy.This is a dose-escalation trial employing a standard &quot;3+3&quot;&#xD;
