      The study uses in depth interviews to understand their experience of somatoform disorder,&#xD;
      possible explanations and their experience of somatoform disorder, possible explanations and&#xD;
      their understanding of treatments, especially their ideas about psychosocial treatments.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      &quot;Somatoform&quot; or &quot;functional&quot; syndromes are those that present with physical symptoms, not&#xD;
      explained by well-recognized medical illness. Such symptoms are common in all settings and&#xD;
      studies have reported that they accounted for one-fifth of all new presentations in primary&#xD;
      care. Literature suggests that they are associated with significant levels of psychological&#xD;
      distress, disability, impairments in quality of life and high levels of healthcare&#xD;
      utilization. Research also suggests that medically unexplained symptoms cause similar (or&#xD;
      higher) levels of disability than medically explained symptoms in primary care settings.&#xD;
      There have been a number of studies that have looked at the cognitive and behavioural basis&#xD;
      of somatisation, and treatment strategies have been trialed based upon a cognitive behavior&#xD;
      therapy (CBT)-led approach for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In British South Asian patients the difficulties in managing this condition are further&#xD;
      compounded as culture can have an important role in shaping the experience, interpretation &amp;&#xD;
      clinical presentation of emotional distress. Patel reported that GPs found it very&#xD;
      challenging to manage South Asian patients with chronic pain due to the way they present with&#xD;
      pain, and a greater likelihood of psychosomatic presentations. Language differences as well&#xD;
      as cultural differences contributed to the challenges, especially among first- generation&#xD;
      South Asians. Further, they felt that self-management strategies were difficult to address.&#xD;
      The author concludes by saying 'cultural influences play an important role in the&#xD;
      consultation process where patients' behaviour is often bound in their cultural view of&#xD;
      health care. (South Asian) patients' presentation of their condition makes diagnosis&#xD;
      difficult but can also lead to miscommunication'.&#xD;

    <description>Individual qualitative interviews with a group of British South Asians to explore their understanding of somatoform disorder and available therapies. These findings will then be used to inform the development of culturally adapted Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) for somatisation in British South Asians.</description>
