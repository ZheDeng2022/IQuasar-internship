  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of doxycycline in relapsed Cutaneous T-cell&#xD;
      Lymphomas (CTCL). The primary objective is to determine the overall response rate of&#xD;
      doxycycline monotherapy in patients with relapsed CTCL.&#xD;
