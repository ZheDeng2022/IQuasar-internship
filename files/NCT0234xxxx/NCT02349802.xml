      Phase I multi-cohort study will employ a flexible study design to accommodate multiple&#xD;
      cohorts. Healthy male or female subjects &gt;or= 18 years with no significant health issues will&#xD;
      be included. Each cohort will employ an open-label, single-arm, repeat-dose design. Injection&#xD;
      failure rates will be continually assessed. Injection pain will also be assessed.&#xD;
