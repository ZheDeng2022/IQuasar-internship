      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of human immunodeficiency&#xD;
      virus (HIV)-resistant gene modified stem cells in treating HIV-positive patients who are&#xD;
      undergoing first-line treatment for Hodgkin or Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. Stem cells are collected&#xD;
      from the patient and HIV-resistance genes are placed into the stem cells. The stem cells are&#xD;
      then re-infused into the patient. These genetically modified stem cells may help the body&#xD;
      make cells that are resistant to HIV infection.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of infusing C46/CCR5/P140K lentiviral&#xD;
      vector-transduced autologous hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPC) (gene modified,&#xD;
      HIV-protected HSPC) after standard first line treatment of lymphoma in patients with HIV&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the dose of carmustine (BCNU) in combination with O6-benzylguanine (O6BG)&#xD;
      that results in selection in vivo of gene-modified HIV resistant cells with minimal toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the effect of HIV infection on the presence of HIV-resistant blood cells as&#xD;
      measured by genetic marking for vector sequences before and after highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) interruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the molecular and clonal composition of gene-modified cells after standard first&#xD;
      line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the molecular and clonal composition of gene-modified cells after O6BG/BCNU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the correlation between the level of MGMT(P140K) marking with toxicity and&#xD;
      response to O6BG/BCNU chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Characterize the toxicity associated with in vivo selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Describe time to disease progression, progression-free survival, treatment-related&#xD;
      mortality, time to neutrophil and platelet recovery, and incidence of infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Effect of procedure on the latent HIV reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Effect of procedure on HIV-specific immune reconstitution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MOBILIZATION AND HSPC COLLECTION: Between the second and the last course of planned standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy, patients undergo mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells with filgrastim&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) beginning the day after the last dose of chemotherapy in the previous&#xD;
      cycle. If CD34 cell count in peripheral blood at least 24 hours after recovery from nadir is&#xD;
      &gt;= 40 CD34 cells/mcL, patients will undergo apheresis collection the next day. If CD34 cell&#xD;
      count is &lt; 40 CD34 cells/mcL, plerixafor SC will be administered and patients will undergo&#xD;
      apheresis collection the next day. Patients undergo apheresis until a total apheresis product&#xD;
      of &gt;= 4.0 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEM CELL INFUSION: Patients receive CD34+ gene-modified C46/CCR5/P140K lentiviral&#xD;
      vector-transduced autologous HSPC intravenously (IV) within 2 to 8 days, but no later than 28&#xD;
      days, after completion of the last cycle of first line treatment for lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IN VIVO SELECTION WITH O6-BENZYLGUANINE AND CARMUSTINE: Between 28-180 days after infusion of&#xD;
      gene-modified HSPC and after hematopoietic recovery from first line treatment, patients with&#xD;
      &gt;= 1% and &lt; 10% gene marked cells receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour, immediately&#xD;
      followed by carmustine IV, and followed 7-8 hours later by O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour.&#xD;
      Treatment continues for an additional course provided that gene marked cells does not meet or&#xD;
      exceed 10% of peripheral blood cells and in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRUCTURED TREATMENT INTERRUPTION (STI): Patients achieving &gt;= 10% gene marked cells for 2&#xD;
      consecutive months following infusion of gene-modified HSPC and with CD4+ cell counts and&#xD;
      total lymphocyte counts at baseline begin STI of HAART for up to 12 weeks. Patients resume&#xD;
      HAART if one of the following criteria occurs: 1) CD4 count &lt; 350 cells/mcL or decline in&#xD;
      percent CD4+ cells by &gt; 33% from baseline for three consecutive evaluations; 2) increase in&#xD;
      HIV RNA &gt; 100,000 copies/mL on two consecutive evaluations; 3) 12 weeks have passed since&#xD;
      discontinuation of HAART; or 4) at the discretion of the infectious disease (ID) consultant&#xD;
      or principal investigator (PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      * If patient is not on an efavirenz-containing regimen, HAART is discontinued simultaneously.&#xD;
      If patient is on an efavirenz-containing regimen, patients will switch from efavirenz to an&#xD;
      integrase inhibitor for at least 2 weeks and then discontinue HAART simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years, every 6 months for&#xD;
      3 years and then annually for 15 years.&#xD;
