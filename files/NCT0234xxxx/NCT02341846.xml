    <textblock>
      This interview and focus group study will explore patient, caregiver, and health professional&#xD;
      opinions about the potential roles of digital technology to support effective cancer pain&#xD;
      management. The views, opinions, and ideas expressed in this study will be used to design and&#xD;
      develop a digital intervention which is likely to take the form of a measurement (pain and&#xD;
      analgesic use) guided medication management intervention to improve cancer pain management in&#xD;
      the community.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is increasing in incidence and prevalence in the United Kingdom. Pain is the most&#xD;
      frequent complication of cancer and cancer pain control is frequently suboptimal. Previous&#xD;
      research has established several potentially modifiable reasons for suboptimal cancer pain&#xD;
      management. These include: under-reporting of pain; inadequate communication about pain&#xD;
      between patients and health care professionals ; inadequate assessment of pain by health care&#xD;
      providers; inadequate analgesic prescribing; suboptimal adherence to prescribed analgesic&#xD;
      regimens by patients; and failure to re-assess pain timeously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information and communication technology (ICT) is a term used to describe all digital&#xD;
      technologies that facilitate the electronic capture, processing, storage, and exchange of&#xD;
      information. ICT could offer innovative solutions to suboptimal cancer pain management.&#xD;
      Technological solutions might include electronic diaries, available as applications or&#xD;
      &quot;apps&quot;, which could encourage pain self-monitoring by people with cancer, and prompt medical&#xD;
      assessment when pain is poorly controlled. Accurate patient reported pain data could help&#xD;
      professionals to adequately assess pain and might influence the patient-professional&#xD;
      consultation. Feedback of adherence data to patients and carers might improve the way that&#xD;
      medications are used. Electronic medication adherence devices are currently available which&#xD;
      can capture data on analgesic utilisation and timing. This data might be useful for health&#xD;
      care professionals to inform safe and timely adjustments of analgesic doses (i.e. is pain&#xD;
      control poor because of inadequate analgesic dose or because of non-adherence to the&#xD;
      prescribed regime?). The aim of the proposed study is to explore the desirability,&#xD;
      feasibility, and practicalities of using ICT to improve cancer pain management The proposed&#xD;
      study would seek the views of patients with cancer pain, their caregivers, and health care&#xD;
      professionals, about using technology to help with cancer pain management. The study will&#xD;
      investigate the acceptability of electronic pain diaries and electronic medication adherence&#xD;
      devices to patients and health care professionals, barriers to using such technology, and how&#xD;
      data generated from technology might be used by patients, caregivers, and health care&#xD;
      professionals to improve cancer pain management. This study will form part of a programme of&#xD;
      research and data from the proposed study will be used to inform the potential development of&#xD;
      a technological intervention to improve the management of cancer pain in the community.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adults, 18 years of age or over.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Established diagnosis of any cancer type.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have experienced pain related to cancer or its treatment requiring any form of&#xD;
                  analgesic within the last three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with all stages and grades of cancer who feel that they are willing and&#xD;
                  able to participate in an interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Caregivers • Caregivers aged 18 years of age or over who are or have been involved in&#xD;
        providing care or assistance for somebody who has experienced cancer pain. Examples of&#xD;
        caregivers might include family members, spouse, and close friends, who provide care and&#xD;
        assistance to patients with cancer pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Professionals&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Registered doctors, nurses, and pharmacists who provide care for people with cancer pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  • Non- English language speakers. Qualitative investigations will be reliant on&#xD;
             communication in English. Specific words and phrases will be analysed by English&#xD;
             speaking researchers in order to identify thematic content. This study does not&#xD;
             include resources for interpreting services.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who are thought to have entered the terminal stages of their illness&#xD;
                  will be excluded. This will be judged at recruitment by the screening clinician&#xD;
                  from the patient's general practice. In the case that a recruited patient has&#xD;
                  become too ill to participate in the research or has died before participation,&#xD;
                  and a linked caregiver has expressed interest in the study, the caregiver will be&#xD;
                  contacted, offered sympathies, and will be given the opportunity to withdraw from&#xD;
                  the study or continue as planned. All conversations about the study will be&#xD;
                  conducted in a supportive manner that recognises the sensitivity of the subject&#xD;
                  matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who are registered at Great Western Medical Practice, Aberdeen (Rosalind&#xD;
                  Adam, researcher and interviewer practices as a doctor there).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any participant who declines to take part.&#xD;
