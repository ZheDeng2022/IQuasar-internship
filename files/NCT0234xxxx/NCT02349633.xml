  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 study of PF-06747775 as a single agent and in combination with other&#xD;
      cancer treatments in patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC. The overall clinical study consists&#xD;
      of a Phase 1 single agent dose-escalation and expansion part to determine the RP2D of&#xD;
      PF-06747775 single agent in patients with previously-treated EGFRm NSCLC followed by&#xD;
      sequential evaluations of PF-06747775 at the RP2D in 3 different clinical scenarios as&#xD;
      detailed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Phase 2 evaluation of PF-06747775 as a single agent in previously untreated&#xD;
           patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Phase 1b single arm evaluation of PF-06747775 in combination with palbociclib&#xD;
           (Cohort 2A) followed by Phase 2 randomized evaluation of PF 06747775 in combination with&#xD;
           palbociclib vs PF-06747775 single agent (Cohort 2B) in previously-treated patients with&#xD;
           EGFRm NSCLC with a secondary T790M mutation (del 19 and T790M or L858R and T790M), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: Phase 1b evaluation of PF-06747775 in combination with avelumab in&#xD;
           previously-treated patients with EGFRm NSCLC with a secondary T790M mutation (del 19 and&#xD;
           T790M or L858R and T790M).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There remains an unmet medical need to develop EGFR TKI agents that effectively target both&#xD;
      the single activating mutations of del 19 and L858R, and the secondary resistance mutation&#xD;
      T790M, while sparing WT EGFR. Drugs active against the resistance mutation will enable&#xD;
      molecularly targeted therapy with a more favorable toxicity profile than the current standard&#xD;
      of cytotoxic chemotherapy platinum based doublets. Furthermore, by having a wide margin of&#xD;
      selectivity favoring the EGFR mutants versus WT EGFR, PF 06747775 is likely to be positioned&#xD;
      to improve patient outcomes from an efficacy and safety perspective.&#xD;

             Studies at RP2D Cohort 1: Patients may have de novo T790M mutation, but it is not&#xD;
             required. Cohort 2 and Cohort 3: Patients must have EGRFm (del 19 AND T790M or L858R&#xD;
             AND T790M) NSCLC tumors as detected by local EGFR mutation test that includes QIAGEN&#xD;
             Therascreen EGFR RGQ PCR kit, Roche cobas® EGFR Mutation Test or a sponsor-approved&#xD;
             laboratory developed test that is validated in a CLIA laboratory, which will then be&#xD;
             retrospectively confirmed by the central validated Thermo Fisher Scientific Oncomine&#xD;
             Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) cancer panel test. Patients will also be enrolled if&#xD;
             they solely test positive for EGFR (del 19 AND T790M or L858R AND T790M) NSCLC in&#xD;
             plasma detected by local EGFR mutation test that includes QIAGEN Therascreen EGFR&#xD;
             Plasma RGQ kit, Roche cobas® EGFR mutation test v2 (US-IVD) or Sysmex Inostic's&#xD;
             OncoBEAMTM EGFR test or a sponsor-approved laboratory developed test that is validated&#xD;
             in a CLIA laboratory, which will then be retrospectively confirmed by a validated&#xD;
             cfDNA test as determined by the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior treatment for EGFRm NSCLC as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase 1 Has progressed after at least 1 prior line of therapy including and EGFR TKI.&#xD;
        Patients may have also received other lines of therapy before or after the EGFR TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Studies at RP2D Cohort 1: no prior treatment for locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm&#xD;
        NSCLC. Cohorts 2 and 3: must have had disease progression on treatment with an approved 1st&#xD;
        or 2nd generation EGFR TKI. Patients who have been treated with a 3rd generation EGFR TKI&#xD;
        are ineligible for this study. Patients may have had multiple lines of therapy; however,&#xD;
        the last therapy prior to study treatment must have been an approved EGFR TKI and received&#xD;
        within 6 weeks prior to study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST version 1.1 that has&#xD;
        not been previously irradiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Tumor tissue available. Requesting formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) block or 15&#xD;
        unstained sections (5 micron). If a lesser amount of tissue is available, contact the&#xD;
        sponsor. An archival specimen is acceptable for Phase 1; a de novo specimen is required for&#xD;
        Cohorts 2, and 3 if the T790M status was confirmed by tissue biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Partial Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For All Phases/Cohorts Previously diagnosed brain metastases, unless the patient has&#xD;
        completed the treatment that is clinically indicated, if any, and has recovered from the&#xD;
        acute effects of any treatment that was delivered prior to study registration, have&#xD;
        discontinued corticosteroid treatment for these metastases prior to registration, and are&#xD;
        neurologically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Major surgery within 2 weeks prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Radiation therapy, excluding stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), within 1 week prior to&#xD;
        registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Systemic anti cancer therapy within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) of&#xD;
        registration excluding EGFR TKIs. Patients on EGFR TKIs must discontinue the agent for a&#xD;
        minimum of:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2 days prior to registration for erlotinib or afatinib, or 3 days for gefitinib if&#xD;
             they will be part of the lead-in single dose PF-06747775 PK study (Phase 1 Dose&#xD;
             Escalation Single and Multiple dose PK and ECG Assessments; Phase 1 Sildenafil at MTD;&#xD;
             and Phase 1b/2 First-Line Single Agent). Please contact the Sponsor for direction for&#xD;
             any other EGFR TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  5 half-lives or 5 days (whichever is longer) prior to registration if they will be&#xD;
             starting on continuous PF-06747775 dosing directly (Phase 1 PK sub-studies at RP2D;&#xD;
             Phase 1b/2 Combination with Palbociclib; Phase 1b Combination with Avelumab).&#xD;

          <description>Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study treatment in a participant who received study treatment. Grade 3 (Severe) events = unacceptable or intolerable events, significantly interrupting usual daily activity, require systemic drug therapy/other treatment. Grade 4 (Life-threatening) events caused participant to be in imminent danger of death. Grade 5 (Death) events = death related to an AE. Treatment-emergent events = between first dose of study treatment and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Treatment-related AEs were determined by the investigator.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Shifts of Laboratory Results From Grade &lt;=2 at Baseline to Grade 3 or 4 Post-baseline in All Cohorts All Phases</title>
        <description>Laboratory values included hemoglobin, platelets, white blood cell count (WBC), absolute (abs) neutrophils, abs lymphocytes, abs monocytes, abs eosinophils, abs basophils, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), sodium, potassium, magnesium, chloride, total calcium, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or urea, creatinine, uric acid, glucose, albumin, phosphorous or phosphate, prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), urinalysis and pregnancy test. Grades of laboratory results were defined by NCI CTCAE version 4.03. Grade 3 (Severe) events = unacceptable or intolerable events, significantly interrupting usual daily activity, require systemic drug therapy/other treatment. Grade 4 (Life-threatening) events caused participant to be in imminent danger of death.</description>

        <description>DOR was the time from the date of first documentation of confirmed CR or PR to the date of first documentation of PD or death due to any cause. If tumor progression data included more than 1 date, the first date was used. DOR (months) = [progression/death date - first date of OR + 1]/30.4. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease. PR was defined as Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. Stable was defined as not qualifying for CR, PR or PD.

          <title>Duration of Objective Response (DOR) in Phase 1b/2 Cohorts</title>
          <description>DOR was the time from the date of first documentation of confirmed CR or PR to the date of first documentation of PD or death due to any cause. If tumor progression data included more than 1 date, the first date was used. DOR (months) = [progression/death date - first date of OR + 1]/30.4. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease. PR was defined as Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. Stable was defined as not qualifying for CR, PR or PD. PD was defined as 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in the sum is observed during therapy), with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm.</description>
          <population>The response analysis population included all participants who received at least one dose of study medication, had measurable disease and adequate baseline assessment, and at least 1 post baseline assessment during the study.</population>

          <description>Vz/F of PF-06747775 following a 200 mg single dose on Lead-in Day -4 in Japan LIC RP2D cohort and Cycle 1 Day 1 in Japan LIC PK cohort, and following a 100 mg single dose on Lead-in Day -7 in Japan LIC PK cohort. Vz/F was defined as apparent volume of distribution. Vz/F was calculated as: Vz/F = dose / (AUCinf * kel). kel was defined as terminal phase rate constant and calculated by a linear regression of the log-linear concentration-time curve. AUCinf was area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from zero to extrapolated infinite time.</description>

        <description>Rss of PF-06747775 following multiple doses on Cycle 1 Day 11 in Japan RP2D cohort and Cycle 1 Day 15 in Japan PK cohort. Rss was calculated as: Rss = (steady state AUCtau) / (single dose AUCinf). AUCtau was defined as area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time zero to tau, the dosing interval, where tau = 24 hours. AUCinf was area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from zero to extrapolated infinite time.</description>
