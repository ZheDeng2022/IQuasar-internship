      This study evaluates the combination of trametinib and pazopanib in patients with advanced&#xD;
      gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trametinib and pazopanib are independently approved for other cancers. Both drugs work to&#xD;
      inhibit tumor development in different ways. Combining these drugs may lead to improved&#xD;
      disease control. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the combination of&#xD;
      both drugs on advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors.&#xD;
