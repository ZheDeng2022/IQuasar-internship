  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 13.5% of patients that undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of their abdomen&#xD;
      without pancreatic symptoms are found to have an incidental pancreatic cyst, with the&#xD;
      frequency increasing with age. In a post-mortem series, 25% of patients had a pancreatic&#xD;
      cyst, of which 32% were potentially premalignant and 3% malignant. Premalignant cysts are&#xD;
      currently either observed or removed surgically according to international guidelines.&#xD;
      Observation is associated with significant anxiety for patients and a growing cost to the&#xD;
      National Health Service, while surgery for this usually benign condition is associated with&#xD;
      not insignificant morbidity and mortality. Premalignant pancreatic cysts may be indolent for&#xD;
      a number of years before malignant transformation, creating a window of opportunity for&#xD;
      minimally invasive intervention and cure. New early treatment options for premalignant&#xD;
      tumours are urgently required. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel&#xD;
      minimally invasive technique for the treatment of pancreatic cystic tumoursÍ¾ endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound guided radiofrequency ablation (EUSRFA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful it will offer an alternative to long term observation or surgery for patients&#xD;
      with this condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cystic tumours are an emerging and growing diagnostic challenge for the clinician.&#xD;
      Due to the widespread use of high quality crosssectional imaging techniques, between 1.2 to&#xD;
      2.6% of patients that undergo a CT for a nonpancreatic indication are found to have an&#xD;
      incidental pancreatic cystic tumour. Pancreatic cysts encompass a range of pathologies from&#xD;
      benign to malignant. Premalignant pancreatic cysts are known to be indolent for a number of&#xD;
      years before transforming into an invasive cancer, creating a window of opportunity for&#xD;
      intervention and cure. There is a strong correlation between pancreatic cysts and age. In a&#xD;
      recent series of patients with incidental pancreatic cystic tumours, no cases were found in&#xD;
      patients less than 40 years of age, while 8.7 percent of the patients aged 80 to 89 years had&#xD;
      a pancreatic cyst. The natural history of pancreatic cystic tumours remains poorly&#xD;
      understood, so significant uncertainty exists regarding the appropriate diagnostic workup,&#xD;
      how to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions and choice of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterisation of pancreatic cystic lesions is usually made by a combination of noninvasive&#xD;
      cross sectional imaging and where necessary, endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration (EUSFNA) of tissue and/or cyst fluid. In those undergoing EUSFNA, fluid aspirates&#xD;
      for cytology are obtained in up to 80% of cases but samples frequently have a low cellularity&#xD;
      so sensitivity for diagnostic cytology ranges between 31% and 85%. Pancreatic EUSFNA is a&#xD;
      safe test, with complication rates (mainly pancreatitis, rarely infection and bleeding)&#xD;
      occurring in approximately 12.4%. Our own published complication rates demonstrated a 0%&#xD;
      mortality and 0.6% morbidity (mild acute pancreatitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To guide treatment a consensus document was published by the International Association of&#xD;
      Pancreatology in 2006 and updated in 2012. The guidelines recommend the surgical resection of&#xD;
      all pancreatic cysts that cause symptoms or are larger than 3 cm, contain a mural nodule or&#xD;
      are associated with dilatation of the main pancreatic duct. If the cyst is less than 3cm and&#xD;
      does not have any of these features the guidelines recommend that the lesions can be safely&#xD;
      followed up with serial imaging. They recommended annual imaging for lesions &lt;10mm, 6 monthly&#xD;
      imaging for lesions 1020mm and 3 monthly imaging for lesions &gt;20mm. How long patients should&#xD;
      be followed up for or when they should be referred for surgical resection is unclear and is&#xD;
      associated with a growing surveillance cost to the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical resection of the pancreas is a considerable undertaking and is associated with a&#xD;
      significant morbidity (21 to 59%) and mortality (07%). In addition, many elderly patients&#xD;
      have significant comorbidity and will not be fit enough to undergo pancreatic surgery. To&#xD;
      date, there have been only a few small studies using ablative techniques as an alternative to&#xD;
      surgical resection. EUSguided injection of alcohol has been associated with cyst ablation&#xD;
      rates of 35 to 62%, on short term follow up. However, this technique did not achieve total&#xD;
      cyst ablation in cysts with septations and was associated with complication rates (pain and&#xD;
      pancreatitis) of 4 to 20%. A major potential advantage of EUS guided RFA is that ablation of&#xD;
      septated cystic tumours is feasible and that treatment effects can be monitored under&#xD;
      realtime EUS control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiofrequency ablation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiofrequency ablation is achieved through a high frequency alternating current which&#xD;
      generates high temperatures causing a coagulative necrosis. It has been used widely,&#xD;
      percutaneously and intraoperatively, to treat primary and secondary cancers in the liver,&#xD;
      lung, kidney, bone, pancreas and oesophagus. The Habib EUS RFA catheter is a single use&#xD;
      sterile catheter for use during endoscopic ultrasound. It is an endoscopic monopolar catheter&#xD;
      that has been designed to ablate cystic tumours of the pancreas and has European Conformity&#xD;
      approval for this purpose. Following identification and puncture of the pancreatic cyst, the&#xD;
      EUS RFA catheter can be introduced through a standard 19G EUSFNA needle. The catheter has an&#xD;
      active metallic electrode which will be placed at the most distal part of the pancreatic cyst&#xD;
      under EUSguidance. The catheter can be used with a variety of commercially available RF&#xD;
      Generators, such as the RITA 1500, RITA 1500X, or ERBE VIO200D/300D. A dose of 10W for 90&#xD;
      seconds will be administered to each cystic tumour. EUSguided needle placement into&#xD;
      pancreatic cysts is a standard technique, and will be performed by experienced (at least 5&#xD;
      years) endoscopists carrying out regular EUS interventions (at least 150 cases per year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal studies of pancreatic RFA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy of the monopolar Habib EUS RFA catheter to be used in this study has&#xD;
      been examined in the porcine model. The pancreas was visualized in all five cases and in four&#xD;
      cases multiple punctures of the pancreas was possible. Each animal received up to 12 minutes&#xD;
      of EUSguided RFA to the pancreas at a variety of currents (46W), catheter exposure (610mm)&#xD;
      and length of time (0.25 minutes). Following the procedure, blood tests did not reveal any&#xD;
      evidence of pancreatitis but at post mortem on day 7, three pigs had focal fat necrosis&#xD;
      surrounding the pancreas. Analysis of the size of the area of ablation in the normal porcine&#xD;
      pancreas found it to be proportionally related to the catheter length, power or time to which&#xD;
      the tissue was exposed.&#xD;
