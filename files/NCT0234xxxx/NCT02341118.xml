  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, are implicated in 10-15% of ovarian cancer cases, increased to 22%&#xD;
      germline BRCA1/2 mutation frequency in patients with high grade serous histology subtype,&#xD;
      including those women who have no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. With the rapid&#xD;
      advancement of therapeutics targeted this population, this protocol seeks to provide genetic&#xD;
      BRCA1/2 screening to all patients with high grade serous ovarian cancer. This information may&#xD;
      help in selection of future treatment options and genetic testing for BRCA1/2 may be used to&#xD;
      potentially prevent a proportion of cancer for the family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be an opportunity for patient to improve access at genetic and molecular&#xD;
      testing for BRCA1/2 mutation which could impact her future treatment option. Moreover, this&#xD;
      study will allow to prospectively assess the proportion of patients with BRCA mutation in&#xD;
      ovarian cancer and describe the type of mutations identified in a large population.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      · To provide genomic profiling for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutational status in patients' with high&#xD;
      grade serous ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To track the number of women with high grade serous ovarian cancer who are being&#xD;
           screened in Princess Margaret Cancer Center for mutations in BRCA1/2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To track accrual rates and clinical outcomes in patients with high grade serous ovarian&#xD;
           cancer who are BRCA1/2-positive&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate impact of BRCA1/2 mutational status on clinical outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To track utilization of genetic counseling services at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre&#xD;
