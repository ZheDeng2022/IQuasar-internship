  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a serious birth complication due to systemic&#xD;
      asphyxia which occurs in about 20 of 1,000 full-term infants and nearly 60% of premature&#xD;
      newborns. Between 10-60% of babies who exhibit HIE die during the newborn period and up to&#xD;
      25% of the HIE survivors have permanent neurodevelopmental handicaps in the form of cerebral&#xD;
      palsy, mental retardation, learning disabilities, or epilepsy. HIE also has a significant&#xD;
      financial impact on the health care system. In the state of Florida, the total cost for&#xD;
      initial hospitalization is $161,000 per HIE patient admitted, but those costs don't take into&#xD;
      account the life-long costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current monitoring and evaluation of HIE, outcome prediction, and efficacy of hypothermia&#xD;
      treatment rely on a combination of a neurological exam, ultrasound, magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). However, these methods do a poor job in&#xD;
      identifying non-responders to hypothermia. MRI requires transport of the neonate with a&#xD;
      requisite 40-45 min scan, which is not appropriate for unstable neonates. Moreover, the&#xD;
      amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG), a common bedside monitoring technique currently used in&#xD;
      these patients to assess candidates and predict outcomes prior to hypothermia, can be&#xD;
      adversely affected by hypothermia itself and the patient may not appear to improve until&#xD;
      re-warming. Consequently, the development of a simple, inexpensive, non-invasive, rapid&#xD;
      biochemical test is essential to identify candidates for therapeutic hypothermia, to&#xD;
      distinguish responders from non-responders and to assess outcome. This research is the first&#xD;
      step needed to treat neonates with HIE employing a personalized medical approach using serum&#xD;
      proteins GFAP and UCH-L1 as biomarkers and by monitoring neonates responses to therapeutic&#xD;
      hypothermia. These biomarkers will aid in the direct care by providing a rapid test to&#xD;
      predict outcomes and select candidates who are likely to benefit from therapeutic hypothermia&#xD;
      and gauge a response to the neuroprotective intervention.&#xD;

      Control Neonates will be easily obtained from a single center, Shands UF. The control samples&#xD;
      will be derived from two groups: (1) &quot;Healthy Controls&quot; will be healthy neonates with Apgar&#xD;
      scores ≥ 7 at 1 minute and ≥ 8 at 5 minutes and no other medical problems associated with&#xD;
      neurologic injury such as hyperbilirubinemia or hypoglycemia. This group will establish a&#xD;
      negative control and will have 500-800µL of blood collected at the time of standard blood&#xD;
      metabolic screens (at 24 and 48 hours of life). (2) &quot;Clinical Controls&quot; will be healthy&#xD;
      neonates evaluated for jaundice, with multiple blood samples drawn between birth and 48 hours&#xD;
      of life to monitor serum bilirubin concentrations. They will have an additional 0.8-1 mL of&#xD;
      blood drawn at the time of any clinical sample (venous or heel stick) is performed. In&#xD;
      addition, neonates will be excluded if they show signs of sepsis or hypoglycemia (&lt; 40). The&#xD;
      neonates' bilirubin will be plotted using the American Academy of Pediatrics risk-based&#xD;
      stratification method, the Bhutani monogram (which is a based on the serum bilirubin&#xD;
      concentration and the hours of life). Clinical control neonates must have low-risk or&#xD;
      low-intermediate bilirubin concentrations, with virtually no risk of brain injury.&#xD;
