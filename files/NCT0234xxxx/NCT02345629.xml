      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if a cordotomy reduces pain in patients&#xD;
      with unmanageable cancer pain. A cordotomy is a procedure, guided by computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      scans, that is performed on the spinal cord and is designed to reduce pain transmission.&#xD;

      Baseline Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete 2 questionnaires that ask about any symptoms and pain you may be&#xD;
           having. It should take about 10 minutes to complete the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have sensory testing. These are tests to measure your level of pain and&#xD;
           feelings of hot and cold in the foot, palm of the hand, and the area where your pain is&#xD;
           the worst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups. You will have an equal chance of being in either&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will have a cordotomy the day after the baseline tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive the best supportive care for 1 week. Depending&#xD;
           on your pain level after the first week, you may have a cordotomy at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cordotomy Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 2, you will have a physical exam on the day of the cordotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cordotomy procedure will take place in the CT scan area. Before the procedure, a&#xD;
      radiologist will perform a spinal tap to inject a contrast drug into the spinal fluid. This&#xD;
      will allow researchers to see the spinal cord well on the CT scan. You will be taken to the&#xD;
      diagnostic CT scanner and given local anesthetic and standard drugs by vein to help you feel&#xD;
      comfortable. A needle will be inserted using CT scan guidance into the side of the neck&#xD;
      opposite to your pain. A radiofrequency electrode will pass through the needle into your&#xD;
      spinal cord, and your nerve reactions to movement and sensation will be checked. If these&#xD;
      reactions are not satisfactory, the needle will be adjusted or the procedure will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the best position for the needle is found, the surgeon will use the radiofrequency&#xD;
      electrode to heat the pain pathway in the spinal cord at that point, so that your sensation&#xD;
      of pain is less. During this process, you will be checked for signs of weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will take 1-2 hours. You will sign a separate consent form for this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One day to one week after the procedure, you will have a MRI to help determine the effect of&#xD;
      the cordotomy on your spinal nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Tests and Phone Calls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will return to the clinic or be seen in the hospital the day after the&#xD;
      cordotomy and again 1 week later. At these visits, you will have a physical exam and sensory&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be called by phone 1 time during the first week of the study. You will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the pain and symptom questionnaires over the phone. If you are not able to return to&#xD;
      the clinic a week after your cordotomy, you will also be called at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Calls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will return to the clinic or be called on the phone 1 time each month for as long as you&#xD;
      are still having pain. You will be asked to complete the pain and symptom questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You active participation in this study will be over 6 months after your cordotomy, if you&#xD;
      have one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. It is investigational to perform a cordotomy to learn if&#xD;
      the procedure reduces pain in patients with unmanageable cancer pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>The response rate for both the cordotomy and control groups determined by the change in pain intensity between day 1 and day 8. Pain intensity assessed before and after cordotomy using a 0-10 numeric rating scale. Response rate defined as a 33% reduction in pain intensity with a 95% confidence interval, separately within each arm.</description>

    <description>Radiologist performs a spinal tap to inject a contrast drug into the spinal fluid. A 20G spinal needle guided by real-time CT scan to the C1-C2 level opposite to participant's pain. A radiofrequency electrode inserted through the spinal needle into the spinal cord, to the anatomic location of the spinothalamic tract. Once ideal position of the electrode is confirmed, 1 or 2 radiofrequency ablations performed at 70C-80C for 60 seconds. The procedure will take 1-2 hours. Quantitative sensory testing on day prior to procedure, and on postoperative days number 1 and 7. Pain and symptom questionnaire completed at baseline, over the phone during the first week of study, and at each follow up visit/phone call. Participants undergo quantitative sensory testing on day prior to procedure, and on postoperative days number 1 and 7. Sensory testing to include sharpness and heat detection.</description>
