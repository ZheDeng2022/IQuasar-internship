      In this study, 50 children between 3 and 12 years old with formally diagnosed autistic&#xD;
      spectrum disorders (ASD) and also having significant mitochondrial dysfunction will be&#xD;
      treated for a 3 month period with the Mitochondrial Cocktail, a combination of specific&#xD;
      nutritional supplements and metabolite intermediates (including anti-oxidants) and bio-energy&#xD;
      substrates. A series of neurological and psychological evaluations will be conducted by&#xD;
      trained evaluators/clinicians to evaluate both the severity and the clinical presentation of&#xD;
      the ASD/mitochondrial dysfunction with each subject at baseline prior to treatment, after the&#xD;
      3 month treatment and again at 6 months, after another 3 month non-treatment period. In&#xD;
      addition, laboratory investigations will be conducted at the same time-points to assess the&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular biomarkers thought to be associated with autistic and&#xD;
      mitochondrial disorders. These investigations will include the analysis of samples of blood&#xD;
      and cheek/buccal swabs collected from each child to assess select biochemical markers of ASD.&#xD;
      The Mitochondrial Cocktail treatment will be administered at home once a day continuously for&#xD;
      a total of 3 months. All the children in the study will be treated with the same&#xD;
      Mitochondrial Cocktail (an open label study).&#xD;

      In this study, 50 children between 3 and 12 years old with formally diagnosed autistic&#xD;
      spectrum disorders (ASD) and also having significant mitochondrial dysfunction will be&#xD;
      treated for a 3 month period with the Mitochondrial Cocktail, a combination of specific&#xD;
      nutritional supplements and metabolite intermediates (including anti-oxidants) and bio-energy&#xD;
      substrates. The Mitochondrial Cocktail is presently widely used as the standard of care for&#xD;
      clinically treating mitochondrial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The precise content of the Mitochondrial Cocktail will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ubiquinol (liquid form, 150 mg/kg subject weight/day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  carnitine, 50 mg/kg subject weight/day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  alpha-lipoic acid, 100 mg/ day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of neurological and psychological evaluations will be conducted by trained&#xD;
      evaluators/clinicians to evaluate both the severity and the clinical presentation of the&#xD;
      ASD/mitochondrial dysfunction with each subject at baseline prior to treatment, after the 3&#xD;
      month treatment and again at 6 months, after another 3 month non-treatment period. In&#xD;
      addition, laboratory investigations will be conducted at the same time-points to assess the&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular biomarkers thought to be associated with autistic and&#xD;
      mitochondrial disorders. These investigations will include the analysis of samples of blood&#xD;
      and cheek/buccal swabs collected from each child to assess select biochemical markers of ASD.&#xD;
      The Mitochondrial Cocktail treatment will be administered at home preferably in the morning&#xD;
      once a day continuously for a total of 3 months. All the children in the study will be&#xD;
      treated with the same Mitochondrial Cocktail (an open label study). . Safety will be also&#xD;
      evaluated based on the occurrence of adverse events either reported spontaneously by the&#xD;
      subject and/or caregiver or observed by the investigator(s).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject/legal representative is considered reliable and capable of adhering to the&#xD;
             protocol (e.g., able to understand and complete diaries), visit schedule, and&#xD;
             medication intake according to the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             .&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has a formal diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). the ASD diagnosis&#xD;
             will satisfy the DSM- V criteria for ASD, and will be broad-spectrum including both&#xD;
             severe and milder cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All subjects will have either suspected mitochondrial dysfunction as assessed by&#xD;
             clinical evaluation, mitochondrial dysfunction as defined by the presence of&#xD;
             significant abnormalities in their buccal mitochondrial respiratory complex activities&#xD;
             (i.e., with either respiratory complex I or complex IV deficiencies) or have&#xD;
             significantly aberrant specific activity ratios. Subjects with significant&#xD;
             deficiencies in either muscle or skin fibroblast respiratory activities will also be&#xD;
             included in those cases if buccal mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity testing&#xD;
             has not been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, could jeopardize or would compromise the subject's ability to&#xD;
             participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Subject is on a ketogenic or other specialized diet. If the subject was on a&#xD;
             specialized diet in the past, they must be off the diet for â‰¥2 months prior to the&#xD;
             Baseline Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has an acute or sub-acutely progressive central nervous system disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has major brain deformation or severe cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
