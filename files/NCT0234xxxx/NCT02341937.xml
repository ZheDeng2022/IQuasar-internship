    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer have a high risk of deep vein thrombosis which often develops in the&#xD;
      veins of the lower limbs. The initial evaluation of clinically suspected deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
      includes the estimation of the clinical probability by calculating risk scores such as the&#xD;
      Wells score and the measurement of the D-dimer. However, the usefulness and accuracy of the&#xD;
      clinical scores and d-dimer test are lower in patients with cancer who often undergo&#xD;
      unnecessary (serial) ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to analyze variables that predict the presence of thrombosis&#xD;
      and may improve the accuracy of the Wells score. In addition, various cut-off of the d-dimer&#xD;
      will be evaluated with the goal of improving the sensibility and specificity of the test.&#xD;

      Patients with cancer have a high risk of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).&#xD;
      The approach to clinically suspected deep vein thrombosis starts with the evaluation of the&#xD;
      clinical probability of disease followed by the measurement of the circulating levels of the&#xD;
      D-dimer. The presence of the thrombus is objectively demonstrated by compression&#xD;
      ultrasonography. In patients without cancer and clinically suspected DVT, a low clinical&#xD;
      probability combined with a normal d-dimer result exclude the presence of DVT and compression&#xD;
      ultrasonography can be withheld. In patients with cancer, signs and symptoms of the cancer&#xD;
      disease may mimic those of DVT shifting the result of the clinical probability scores towards&#xD;
      high probabilities. In addition, the presence of cancer is part of the Wells score which&#xD;
      further increases the chance to end up with a higher overall score and thus higher&#xD;
      probability. Eventually, patients with cancer are more often classified as at high clinical&#xD;
      probability than patients without cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The d-dimer test is poorly specific in the presence of cancer disease and its results are&#xD;
      often positive as the consequence of the cancer, the cancer treatments or the concomitant&#xD;
      comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the poor specificity of the clinical scores and d-dimer test, these initial&#xD;
      diagnostic steps have limited usefulness in patients with cancer who often need to undergo&#xD;
      ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to analyze variables that predict the presence of thrombosis&#xD;
      and may improve the accuracy of the Wells score. In addition, various cut-offs of the D-dimer&#xD;
      will be evaluated with the goal of improving the sensibility and specificity of the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: prospective cohort of cancer patients with clinically suspected DVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: to evaluate the clinical and demographic variables that predict the presence of&#xD;
      DVT and may improve the accuracy of the Wells score in cancer patients. The sensibility and&#xD;
      specificity of different cut-offs of the D-dimer will be also evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria All ambulatory cancer patients with clinically suspected DVT. All patients&#xD;
      will be managed with the calculation of the Wells score, the measurement of the D-dimer. The&#xD;
      presence of DVT will be ascertained by whole-leg ultrasonography performed independently of&#xD;
      the results of the Wells and D-dimer. A phone contact/visit at 3 months will verify the&#xD;
      development of venous thromboembolic complications in all patients in whom DVT was initially&#xD;
      excluded by ultrasonography.&#xD;
