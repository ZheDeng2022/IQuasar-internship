      Baseline Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this research study, you will return to the&#xD;
      clinic about a week later for the Baseline Visit. You will be instructed to fast (eat nothing&#xD;
      and drink only water) for at least 8 hours before this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4-5 tablespoons) will be drawn for tests of your immune function, stress&#xD;
           hormone levels, and blood sugar levels. After this blood test, you will be given&#xD;
           breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a pain assessment which involves you submerging your hand in cold&#xD;
           water. Researchers will use your response to measure your pain tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have electrocardiograms (EKGs) to check your heart function. The sensors will&#xD;
           be attached at the beginning of the visit and then removed before you leave. You will be&#xD;
           attached to the machine for several hours, but you will be able to be disconnected to&#xD;
           take bathroom breaks, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete questionnaires about fatigue, mood, stress, social support, marital&#xD;
           satisfaction, depression, and general demographics (age, race and so on). It should take&#xD;
           about 1½ hours total to complete the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a series of traditional neurocognitive tests (for example, tests to&#xD;
           check your memory and thinking abilities). You will take these tests on the computer and&#xD;
           with a pen and paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your blood pressure will be measured multiple times throughout the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups and Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Baseline visit, you will be assigned to one of 2 groups. If you are in Group 1, you&#xD;
      and your partner will take part in an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Relationship Enhancement&#xD;
      (MBRE) intervention course designed to alleviate stress and other symptoms among couples. The&#xD;
      MBRE course will consist of eight sessions taught by a professional Mindfulness instructor.&#xD;
      The sessions will occur 1 time a week and last about 2½ hours each time. The MBRE course will&#xD;
      consist of meditation and yoga techniques and handouts. The sessions will focus on teaching&#xD;
      participants (all female breast cancer survivors and partners) the basics of Mindfulness&#xD;
      Based Relationship Enhancement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attendance at these sessions and completion of daily homework assignments requiring up to 45&#xD;
      minutes per day are essential to the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 2, you will receive self-help materials that have been previously&#xD;
      developed by MD Anderson's Office of Public Education, the American Cancer Society, and the&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Intervention Follow-Up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, you will have a post-intervention follow-up visit about 12 weeks after&#xD;
      your Baseline visit (4 weeks after you finish your 8-week intervention sessions). If you are&#xD;
      in Group 2, you will have a post-intervention follow-up visit about 8 weeks after the&#xD;
      Baseline Visit. You will fast for 8 hours before a post-intervention follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 to 5 tablespoons) will be drawn to check your immune function, stress&#xD;
           hormone levels, and blood sugar. After the blood is drawn you will be given breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the cold water pain tolerance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have electrocardiograms (EKGs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete questionnaires about fatigue, mood, stress, social support, marital&#xD;
           satisfaction, depression, and general demographics (age, race and so on). It should take&#xD;
           about 1½ hours total to complete the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a series of traditional neurocognitive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your blood pressure will be measured multiple times throughout the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cortisol Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Baseline and Follow-up Visits, you will be asked to give samples to measure&#xD;
      cortisol, a hormone related to stress. You will place a small cotton tube in your mouth for&#xD;
      about 2 minutes, or until the swab is completely soaked with your saliva. After this, you&#xD;
      will place the swab back in the tube, and freeze the sample. You will be given containers to&#xD;
      hold the samples when you freeze them, as well as to mark which day and time each sample was&#xD;
      collected. You will take these samples 7 times a day (right when you wake up; about 30, 45,&#xD;
      and 60 minutes after waking; and then at noon, 4:00 p.m., and 8:00 p.m.). Researchers will&#xD;
      use these samples to measure the changes in cortisol throughout the day. You will collect&#xD;
      these samples for 2 days during the week, and 2 days on the weekend. After you complete 4&#xD;
      total days of collecting saliva samples after each visit, you will mail them back to MD&#xD;
      Anderson in pre-paid envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program Satisfaction Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the follow-up visits, the study staff will conduct individual interviews with a small&#xD;
      group of participants. Interview questions will address participants' overall reactions to&#xD;
      and satisfaction with the mind-body intervention, the impact they felt from social support,&#xD;
      motivation, and their own ability for increasing physical activity and well-being. The study&#xD;
      staff will also ask questions about both positive and negative effects of participating in&#xD;
      the intervention. Interviews will be conducted by the PI or a trained research coordinator.&#xD;
      All interviews will last no longer than 90 minutes and will be audio-taped using a digital&#xD;
      recorder and transcribed. All audio files will be destroyed after they are transcribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 couples (60 participants) will take part in this research study. All will be&#xD;
      enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
