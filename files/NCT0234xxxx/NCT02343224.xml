  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of the drug, pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PEG-Intron), used to&#xD;
      treat brain tumors in a pediatric population. Researchers want to see if treatment with&#xD;
      PEG-Intron will stop tumor growth for patients with juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas or optic&#xD;
      pathway gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn more about the response to pegylated interferon&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn more about the side effects of pegylated interferon&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn more about MRI images in patients with Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytomas or Optic&#xD;
           Pathway Gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn more about quality of life in patients treated with pegylated interferon&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low grade gliomas are the most common pediatric central nervous system malignancies and can&#xD;
      occur in different parts of the brain. Patients who undergo gross total resection, usually&#xD;
      those with hemispheric tumors, have an excellent prognosis with surgical resection alone.&#xD;
      Patients for whom gross total resection is not achievable have a significant risk of disease&#xD;
      progression. Therefore, these patients benefit from adjuvant therapy. Multiple chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimens have shown some efficacy in residual tumor, but more than 50% of patients experience&#xD;
      recurrences. Radiation has been shown to be an effective therapy in the treatment of these&#xD;
      tumors. Because of concerns regarding radiation toxicity especially in young children, and&#xD;
      progression despite chemotherapy, novel approaches are needed. This protocol represents an&#xD;
      attempt to measure the efficacy and safety of use of pegylated interferon for patients with&#xD;
      recurrent, refractory Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytomas (JPA) or optic pathway gliomas. It&#xD;
      provides a different approach to the commonly used treatment modalities. The objectives of&#xD;
      this study are to determine the response of children with chemotherapy-refractory progressive&#xD;
      JPA or optic pathway gliomas (OPG) to weekly pegylated interferon alpha-2b. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives include to better identify the toxicities of weekly pegylated interferon alpha-2b&#xD;
      (PEG-Intron™) in pediatric patients with unresectable, refractory, recurrent JPAs or optic&#xD;
      pathway gliomas, to evaluate various magnetic resonance imaging techniques for noninvasive&#xD;
      monitoring of metabolic and biologic changes in the tumors and to evaluate the quality of&#xD;
      life for patients with recurrent, refractory JPAs who receive therapy with pegylated&#xD;
      interferon alpha-2b (PEG-Intron™).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point is to determine the response rate. A two-stage design has been selected&#xD;
      to evaluate the response rate. If the treatment demonstrates at least a 25% response rate,&#xD;
      the researchers would consider it a promising regimen for further study. A response rate less&#xD;
      than 5% is considered evidence of unpromising regimen. Seventeen evaluable pediatric patients&#xD;
      with JPA or OPG will be accrued. If at least 3 responders are seen among the 17 patients,&#xD;
      this will be considered evidence of a promising response rate for further evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate hematologic toxicity of long term Peg-Intron administration, adverse event data will be collected using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). CTCAE Grading: Grade 1=Mild, Grade 2=Moderate, Grade 3=Severe, Grade 4=Life-threatening, Grade 5=Death. Grade 3 or greater hematologic toxicities will be recorded per reporting period.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life, assessed by using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (Peds-FACT-Br) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is assessed by using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (Peds-FACT-Br) questionnaire for patients with brain cancer. The FACT-Br instrument consists of 54 items to assess physical(PWB), social and family (SWB), emotional (EWB), functional well-being (FWB), and additional brain cancer specific concerns (AC). Using a 5-point Likert type scale, responses to individual items range from 0 (not at all) to 4 (Very Much) with higher scores indicating better quality of life. PWB, SWB, and FWB are the sum of 7 items and have a possible range between 0 and 28. EWB ranges between 0 and 24, and is the sum of 6 items. AC is the sum of 19 items, and ranges between 0 and 76.</description>
