    <textblock>
      This study looks to examine the feasibility and efficacy of using MR-HIFU to ablate Osteoid&#xD;
      Osteoma lesions in children and young adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoid Osteoma (OO) is a benign, but painful, bone tumor commonly occurring in children and&#xD;
      young adults. Common treatment options are surgical excision or, more recently, CT-guided&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA). RFA is less invasive, but it still requires drilling from the&#xD;
      skin through muscle and soft tissue into bone. It also exposes the patient and operator to&#xD;
      ionizing radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU) provides precise and&#xD;
      controlled delivery of focused ultrasound energy inside a lesion using an external&#xD;
      applicator, without the need for a scalpel or needle. MR-HIFU has been successfully used to&#xD;
      treat painful bone metastases in adult clinical trials and one recent report suggests that it&#xD;
      can also be used to treat OO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR-HIFU ablation of OO may provide a better alternative to surgical resection or RFA as it is&#xD;
      completely non-invasive and does not require ionizing radiation. These two qualities of&#xD;
      MR-HIFU are especially beneficial in growing children and young adults. Furthermore, MR-HIFU&#xD;
      OO ablation is quick, with expected total procedure time of less than two hours. Such short&#xD;
      treatments offer additional safety benefits from reduced anesthesia / sedation requirement&#xD;
      compared to surgery and RFA&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All patients with a clinical suspicion of OO based on presence of typical&#xD;
                  symptoms of localized nocturnal pain that is relieved by NSAIDs and unrelated to&#xD;
                  trauma or activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Typical imaging findings on CT and/or MRI. Plain radiographs and bone scans may&#xD;
                  be obtained by referring physicians and are helpful for confirming the clinical&#xD;
                  diagnosis but cannot be substituted for a CT or MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-contrast enhanced or contrast enhanced CT studies are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Contrast enhanced MRI studies should be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Tissue biopsy is not required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor location:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Target lesions can be located in any peripheral bone with acoustic accessibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Target lesions may be intracortical or juxtacortical in location.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Target lesions must be reachable within the normal safety margins of HIFU as&#xD;

             anesthetic required for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Implant or prosthesis or scar tissue within the path of the HIFU beam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Target &lt;1 cm from nerve plexus, spinal canal, bladder, bowel&#xD;
