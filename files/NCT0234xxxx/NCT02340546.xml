      In chronic systolic heart failure patients submitted to cardiac resynchronization therapy,&#xD;
      the study aims at assessing whether geometric variations in coronary sinus lead tip&#xD;
      trajectory throughout the cardiac cycle acutely induced by biventricular pacing, are&#xD;
      predictive of the volumetric and clinical response to the treatment at six-month follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has become a standard treatment in patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic chronic systolic heart failure, reduced left ventricular (LV) function and wide&#xD;
      electrocardiographic ventricular (QRS) complex, but approximately one third of patients do&#xD;
      not respond to the treatment. Current ability to predict long-term response to CRT at implant&#xD;
      is slight. Investigations have focused mostly on early prediction of the reversal of LV&#xD;
      remodeling by means of LV pacing, which is delivered more frequently as biventricular pacing,&#xD;
      combined with conventional right ventricular (RV) pacing. LV dyssynchrony areas have been&#xD;
      identified as suitable targets for pacing, but no methods still can evaluate real-time,&#xD;
      intra-operative acute effects of pacing on LV mechanics. This issue has become even more&#xD;
      evident in the subset of CS implants of quadripolar leads, which offer relevant advantages&#xD;
      but highlight the lack of methods for selecting the pacing configuration among the safe and&#xD;
      effective ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since LV pacing is currently delivered on the epicardium by a lead inserted in coronary sinus&#xD;
      (CS) branches, the interface between the point of pacing delivery on LV surface and the&#xD;
      underlying LV wall, and overall lead movements inside coronary sinus might describe some&#xD;
      underlying myocardial mechanics. By means of a recently published fluoroscopy-based method,&#xD;
      the trajectory of the electrode tip inserted in CS branches can be reconstructed in&#xD;
      three-dimensions (3D) throughout the cardiac cycle. A preliminary clinical pilot study (Heart&#xD;
      Rhythm 2013;10:1360) demonstrated that biventricular pacing acutely induced changes in&#xD;
      trajectory geometry, which were correlated to the echocardiographic volumetric response to&#xD;
      CRT at six-month post-implant follow-up. In responders only, biventricular pace abruptly&#xD;
      determined a more circular shape. Such results were &quot;hypothesis-generating&quot; and are to be yet&#xD;
      tested on a larger scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study analyzes the predictive power of the changes in pacing cathode trajectory metrics&#xD;
      occurring at the start of biventricular pacing with respect to both:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the volumetric response to CRT, measured at six-month follow-up by a unique criterion;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the clinical response to CRT, described at six-month follow-up by three clinical&#xD;
           indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondarily, this study evaluates whether trajectory variations would be able to acutely&#xD;
      guide the selection of the definitive LV pacing configuration in the subset of implants of a&#xD;
      CS quadripolar lead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trajectory geometry metrics to analyze are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  trajectory length;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  area of the surface encompassed by the trajectory in the 3D space;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  trajectory mean curvature;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the three singular values indicating to what extent the trajectory is distributed along&#xD;
           each of its three principal directions (eigenvectors);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ratio between the two main singular values, indicating to what extent the trajectory is&#xD;
           distributed along only one (principal) direction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  trajectory eccentricity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  distance between the trajectory barycenter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients submitted to implant of a CRT device (pacemaker or implantable cardioverter&#xD;
           defibrillator) according to current indications are evaluated;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  all market-released CRT devices can be implanted; the choice of CS lead, implantation&#xD;
           technique, leads placement is left to each investigator decision;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  during implant procedure, the devices are programmed in sense-only mode; if upgrades,&#xD;
           the pre-existing pacing programming is kept unmodified until the start of biventricular&#xD;
           stimulation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  short fluoroscopy recordings of lead movements inside CS branching are taken in three&#xD;
           radiological projections (posteroanterior, 30Â° right and left anterior oblique), both&#xD;
           just before and immediately after the beginning of biventricular pacing at prefixed&#xD;
           settings, which are: lower rate at 60-70 beats per min; atrioventricular (AV) delay at&#xD;
           120 ms and interventricular (VV) delay at 0 ms;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in the subset of implants of a quadripolar lead, other two fluoroscopic recordings are&#xD;
           acutely acquired during a short period of pacing from each of two other cathodes, which&#xD;
           are predefined as being at 20-35 mm and 40-50 mm from lead tip;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3D trajectories are reconstructed for the lead tip (the distal pole), and, in&#xD;
           quadripolar lead implants, also for other two pacing cathodes, both before and acutely&#xD;
           at biventricular pacing start;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after acquisition, at any time pacing settings can be optimized and modified at&#xD;
           investigators choice;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if a quadripolar CS lead is used, the pacing configuration at discharge is preferably&#xD;
           chosen as that associated with the largest change of cathode trajectory towards a more&#xD;
           circular shape at biventricular pace start;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRT device checking is scheduled at 6-month follow-up; other checks are left to the&#xD;
           discretion of each center; a visit is advised at 30-60 days after discharge;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  all centers arrange for the two index echocardiographic evaluations to be performed on&#xD;
           schedule by an expert operator, who has to be blinded about any trajectory results, and&#xD;
           according to recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography. All&#xD;
           examinations are recorded on external support (analogic or digital) and handed to the&#xD;
           internal Echocardiography Core-Lab, which is identified among participating&#xD;
           institutions. The Echo Core-Lab operator(s) is not directly involved in the study and is&#xD;
           kept unaware of all trajectory results up to the end of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the fluoroscopic recordings are stored on a CD and analyzed off-line by the Engineering&#xD;
           Core Lab, using the method previously published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables are collected at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
      - age, gender, height and weight; presence of diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive&#xD;
      bronchopneumopathy, previous stroke, previous myocardial infarction; moderate to severe&#xD;
      valvular heart disease; any previous myocardial revascularization; previous heart surgery;&#xD;
      chronic renal failure,defined by glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 square&#xD;
      metre; current value of eGFR (mL/min/1.73 square metre); current medical treatment with&#xD;
      beta-blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, aldosterone&#xD;
      antagonists, antiarrhythmic, oral anticoagulants, anti-platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables are collected both at peri-implant and at six-month follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical : New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (I to IV); distance&#xD;
           covered at the six minutes walking test (metres); total hospital stay due to heart&#xD;
           failure during 6 months before and 6 months after CRT implant (number of days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Echocardiographic: LV ejection fraction (%); LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes&#xD;
           (ml); presence and degree of any valvular regurgitation (from 1+ to 4+) and valvular&#xD;
           stenosis; Doppler-derived peak pressure in pulmonary artery (mmHg); pulsed doppler&#xD;
           pattern of transmitral flow (three types) and associated E/A ratio (abs), E wave&#xD;
           duration (msec), A wave duration (msec), E+A waves total duration (msec).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Electrocardiographic: P wave, AV interval and QRS complex durations (msec); QRS axis&#xD;
           (degrees); QRS morphology (four types: spontaneous typical or atypical left bundle&#xD;
           branch block; RV pace-induced conduction delay; non-specific intraventricular delay).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Device-related: endocavitary measurements of atrial, RV and CS leads functioning (pace&#xD;
           and sense thresholds, impedance); all programmed values of sensing and pacing;&#xD;
           programmed AV and VV intervals; total percent time of LV pacing; burden and types of any&#xD;
           supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define the sample size, the statistical power analysis is applied with a level of power&#xD;
      equal to 80%, using as sample distributions the populations in the pilot study (p&lt;0.05) and&#xD;
      considering a drop-out rate of 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics are used to present and summarize the data collected in the study. For&#xD;
      discrete variables, frequency distribution and cross tabulations are to be presented. For&#xD;
      continuous variables, the means, standard deviations, or median and 25Â° and 75Â° percentile&#xD;
      and ranges are used to represent data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the type of variable, computed trajectory parameters are to be compared by using&#xD;
      Ï2 method, with the Fisher exact test or the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test for non-normal&#xD;
      distribution (p&lt;0.05). Differences in means or in proportions are to be calculated, together&#xD;
      with their 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variations in trajectory metrics from before to after pacing start are computed and&#xD;
      correlated with variations between pre-implant and six-month post-implant assessments in both&#xD;
      echocardiographic measures of left ventricular remodeling and function and clinical and&#xD;
      electrocardiographic variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data are managed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  each patient is given a code to guarantee anonymity, used to identify both data on paper&#xD;
           and imaging recordings (fluoroscopic and echocardiographic). Recordings are supplied to&#xD;
           the Core-Labs (Bioengineering and Echocardiography) on digital support. Results from&#xD;
           imaging recordings analyses are sent to the Principal Investigator and to the Steering&#xD;
           Committee (composed by the Principal Investigator, the Study Directors and the Sites&#xD;
           Principal Investigators). The original recordings are kept in each center's archives;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  all patient's data are collected on paper forms. Each center's investigator is&#xD;
           responsible for data collection and safekeeping, and guarantees for data reliability and&#xD;
           correctness;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  each center's data are the property of the same center; each investigator has free&#xD;
           access to its own data and can divulge them, but without associating them with the study&#xD;
           TRAJECTORIES. The Steering Committee alone is responsible for the whole, appropriately&#xD;
           codified database, and can freely accede to it. Each investigator will be allowed to&#xD;
           propose ancillary substudies/subanalyses which are to use data already provided in&#xD;
           accordance with the protocol. Proposals have to be submitted to and approved by the&#xD;
           Steering Committee;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the study does not interfere with any aspect of current good clinical practice and legal&#xD;
           requirements, and all prevailing rules will be followed.The study conforms to the&#xD;
           guiding principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, to the current laws and to the&#xD;
           Institutional Ethics Committee rules.The protocol has been first approved by the Area&#xD;
           Vasta Romagna Ethics Committee, and then is submitted to other competent Ethics&#xD;
           Committees for all participating centers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adverse events and adverse device effects, defined according to current standards, will&#xD;
           be dealt with and reported to regulatory agencies and to manufacturers by each center in&#xD;
           accordance with present regulations. The investigator ensures that, if applicable,&#xD;
           adverse events are reported to their Ethical Committee, and/or to any Health Authorities&#xD;
           according to national laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), International&#xD;
      Standards Organization (ISO) 14155 and Declaration of Helsinki guidelines.The investigators&#xD;
      are responsible for conducting the study in accordance with the study plan, the signed&#xD;
      agreements, applicable laws and regulations, and any conditions of approval imposed by the&#xD;
      reviewing Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient informed consent is mandatory and required for all patients prior to their inclusion&#xD;
      in the study. The process of obtaining informed consent complies with the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki and applicable national regulations, and uses language that is understandable to the&#xD;
      patient. The informed consent form is constructed in accordance with rules given by Area&#xD;
      Vasta Romagna Ethic Committee.The form is signed in double original, and one is given to&#xD;
      patient, the second original kept in patients' file. The informed consent covers the use of&#xD;
      personal information in an anonymous form and only for scientific purposes, and the&#xD;
      acceptation of fluoroscopy as a means of clinical investigation. Patients can modify their&#xD;
      decision at any moment, and nothing will be changed in their care and clinical programs.&#xD;
