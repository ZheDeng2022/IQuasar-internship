    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is an open label Phase II study of the combination of intravenously&#xD;
      administered SGT-53 and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in patients with metastatic pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, toxicity and&#xD;
      efficacy (specifically Progression Free Survival at 5.5 month (PFS5.5mos)) of this&#xD;
      combination therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The p53 is a vital human tumor suppressor gene. Loss of p53 suppressor function is present in&#xD;
      the majority of human cancers. The p53 protein has a diverse range of functions including&#xD;
      regulation of cell cycle checkpoints, cell death (apoptosis), senescence, DNA repair,&#xD;
      maintenance of genomic integrity, and control of angiogenesis. Abnormalities of the p53 gene&#xD;
      may impact the efficacy of standard anticancer treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy.&#xD;
      P53 mutation and pathway dysfunction are associated with poor clinical outcomes and the&#xD;
      presence of the p53 mutation correlates with resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. The&#xD;
      development of somatic gene therapy has created the potential to restore wild type function&#xD;
      of p53. SGT-53 is a complex of cationic liposome encapsulating a normal human wild type p53&#xD;
      DNA sequence in a plasmid backbone. This complex has been shown to efficiently and&#xD;
      specifically deliver the p53 cDNA to the tumor cells. Introduction of the p53 cDNA sequence&#xD;
      is expected to restore wtp53 function in the apoptotic pathway. P53 restoration has been&#xD;
      shown most effective in enhancing cytotoxicity in combination with an agent which results in&#xD;
      DNA damage or initiates apoptosis. This is a Phase II clinical trial of SGT-53 plus the&#xD;
      recently approved chemotherapeutic combination of gemcitabine/Abraxane® (nab-paclitaxel) in&#xD;
      patients with confirmed metastatic pancreatic cancer. In addition to determining Progression&#xD;
      Free Survival at 5.5 months (PFS5.5mos), this trial will evaluate the response rate, overall&#xD;
      survival and time to progression as well as the tolerability and safety of SGT-53 in&#xD;
      combination with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;
