    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, double blind clinical trial. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate the weight loss efficacy of entacapone. In this study, participants are&#xD;
      randomly divided into entacapone and placebo groups. The percentage change in body weight,&#xD;
      the body mass index, waist circumstance, extent of fatty liver, quantity of visceral fat,&#xD;
      serum insulin, serum triglyceride and the adverse effects are compared between the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

      All volunteers should clearly understand the objectives and the risks of the present study.&#xD;
      Then, all volunteers should carefully read and sign the informed consent and receive a copy&#xD;
      of the signed informed consent. If the volunteer agrees to participate to the present study&#xD;
      and signs the informed consent, the volunteer is included. The included participants should&#xD;
      be followed up and the case report form should be competed by appointed researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruiting stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To check whether a volunteer are eligible to participate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All volunteers are checked according to the inclusive and the exclusive criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The clinical nutritionists provide diet and exercise regime to the volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grouping stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of 12 Participants enter the study at a time,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the performance of the volunteer complying the diet and exercise regime;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Volunteers who are able to comply the regime and sign the informed consent are included;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Every participate receives a random number which is packed in an opaque envelop;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Physical examination: blood pressure, heart rate, height, bodyweight, waist and hip&#xD;
           circumference;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Laboratory examination: level of adiponectin, leptin, resistin, C-reactive protin,&#xD;
           insulin, fasting blood glucose, haemoglobin A1c, tri glycerides, total cholesterol, LDL&#xD;
           cholesterol, HDL cholesterol;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Extra blood sample(20ml) is collected to measure the level of adiponectin, resistin and&#xD;
           leptin;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The opaque envelop contained the random number is opened by the CRA and the grouping is&#xD;
           determined;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Participants take entacapone or placebo as the physicians and researchers have&#xD;
           instructed and make a record in a standard form;&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Participants carry out the diet and exercise regime, measure their bodyweight everyday&#xD;
           and take a record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervening stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Two weeks after the first intervention, monthly telephone interview start:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Ask the participant the details of taking medicine, following the diet and exercise&#xD;
           regime, the present body weight; 1.2 Ask the participant whether they have any&#xD;
           discomfort and to decide whether medical interventions are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Four weeks after the first intervention, monthly hospital interview start:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 The day before the participants go to hospital for the second interview. 2.1.1 Any drink,&#xD;
      food and strenuous activity should be avoided at least 8 hours before the second interview;&#xD;
      2.1.2 The standard form of daily activity should be brought. 2.2 During this interview: 2.2.1&#xD;
      Physical examination：blood pressure, heart rate, height, bodyweight, waist and hip&#xD;
      circumference; 2.2.2 The details of participants taking medicine, following the diet and&#xD;
      exercise regime should be asked; 2.2.3 Laboratory examination: level of adiponectin, leptin,&#xD;
      resistin, C-reactive protin, insulin, fasting blood glucose, haemoglobin A1c, triglycerides,&#xD;
      total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol; 2.2.4 20ml blood sample is collected to&#xD;
      measure the level of adiponectin, resistin, leptin and the expression of obese related genes;&#xD;
      2.2.5 Abdominal MRI should be made; 2.2.6 Any discomfort of the participants should be&#xD;
      recorded and medical treatment should be provided when it is necessary; 2.2.7 The previous&#xD;
      standard form of daily activity are hand over to the CRA and blank forms are provided; 2.2.8&#xD;
      The untaken drugs should be retrieved, packed and a record should be maed; 2.2.9 Drugs of the&#xD;
      next month should be distributed and a relevant record should be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Participate go back home. 2.3.1 Participants continue to take entacapone or placebo as&#xD;
      the physicians and researchers have instructed and make a record in a standard form; 2.3.2&#xD;
      Participants continue to carry out the diet and exercise regime, measure their bodyweight&#xD;
      everyday and take a record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data should be recorded in a standard case report form and the accuracy, completeness&#xD;
      and timeliness be regularly checked by an appointed clinical research associate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is calculated by the software PASS 11.0. The alternative hypothesis set as&#xD;
      Mean 1&lt;Mean 2, which means that the participants in the entacapone group loss more weight&#xD;
      than the participants in the placebo group. Because this is a pilot study, the error is set&#xD;
      as (1-β)=0.8 and α=0.1. According to the results of the study on tesofensine, another weight&#xD;
      loss drug, participants in the entacapone and placebo group are estimated to loss 2 kg and 10&#xD;
      kg respectively. The estimated sample size is 30, 15 in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis is conducted by the computer software SPSS 17.0.0 (SPSS Inc,&#xD;
      Chicago, Ill). All analyses are performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. The&#xD;
      occurrences of the primary and secondary end points are compared between the entacapone and&#xD;
      placebo groups. The categorical data are reported as numbers with proportions, and the&#xD;
      quantitative data are reported as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) or means with&#xD;
      standard deviation. The categorical data were compared using the Chi-squared or Fisher exact&#xD;
      test where appropriate. For the continuous data, the Mann-Whitney U-test were used for the&#xD;
      group comparisons as appropriate. A two-sided p value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
