      The objective of this study is to explore the efficacy of brief motivational interventions&#xD;
      (BMIs) for treatment of youth with alcohol and other drug problems after at least 3 months.&#xD;
      The results of previous studies indicate that brief interventions for unhealthy alcohol use&#xD;
      have been shown to be effective in primary care settings, with most studies focusing on&#xD;
      adults and few studies focusing on youth. To date, no BMI studies have been conducted in the&#xD;
      Ukraine among youth with alcohol or other drug use. Of particular concern are emerging adults&#xD;
      ages 18-25 who may be at particularly high risk for alcohol problems given historical events&#xD;
      related to the fall of the Soviet Union and the subsequent economic down turn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of BMI by comparing BMI and no BMI conditions among two&#xD;
      samples of youth screening positive on the prescreen survey for risky drinking. The subject&#xD;
      pool will come from the Psychoneurological Department: the first location is located in the&#xD;
      Railway Clinical Hospital, its clinical base, and the second in classes in the department at&#xD;
      Kiev National Medical University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total sample of 120 will be broken down to 1.) 60 patients from Railway Clinical&#xD;
      Hospital; and 2.) 60 students from Kiev National Medical University. Participants will be&#xD;
      stratified by recruitment site and randomized to condition: BMI and control, with follow-up&#xD;
      assessment at 3 months. In addition to being the first of study to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      BMI on substance use problems among youth in Ukraine, this study will examine BMI&#xD;
      intervention processes in relation to alcohol and other drug outcomes. Findings will inform&#xD;
      research and clinical practice to enhance early identification and prevention of problematic&#xD;
      alcohol use trajectories among emerging adults&#xD;

      Research Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The rates and correlates of alcohol and other drug use, abuse and dependence, among&#xD;
           young adults age 18-25 presenting to a Psychoneurological Department in the Railway&#xD;
           Clinic Hospital in Kiev and Kyiv National Medical University will be high on the&#xD;
           prescreen survey and may not be related to self-identification of problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The quality of life of young people with alcohol and substance use problems can be low&#xD;
           compare to people without these problems. The quality of life can be improved after&#xD;
           Brief Motivational Interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The rates of intentional and unintentional injury (e.g., motor vehicle, violence related&#xD;
           (fighting), sports injury, and other non-suicidal self-injury behavior) will be higher&#xD;
           among emerging adults with greater alcohol and other drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The Brief Motivational Interventions will help young people with alcohol and substance&#xD;
           use problems and will be more effective for those with drinking motives that are social&#xD;
           enhancement/externalizing and for those with less depression, anxiety levels, sleep&#xD;
           disorders, impulsivity, sensation seeking, and aggression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The Brief Motivational Interventions will help young people with alcohol and substance&#xD;
           use problems and will found to be effective in reducing primary outcomes (alcohol and&#xD;
           other drug use, as well as substance use related consequences) and secondary outcomes&#xD;
           (depression and anxiety levels, sleep disorders, aggression, and quality of life).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background According to the World Health Organization (WHO), youth in the Ukraine have the&#xD;
      greatest level of alcohol consumption in the world, with typical age of initiation being 10 -&#xD;
      13 years old. When examining poisoning among youth in the Ukraine, 60% is caused by alcohol&#xD;
      3. Although the legal drinking age in the Ukraine is 18 for wine and liquor, beer is not&#xD;
      legally classified as an alcoholic beverage and thus has no minimum drinking age. In 2011WHO&#xD;
      ranked the Ukraine as 5th in the world in capita alcohol consumption. Recently, attempts have&#xD;
      been made to address these issues. For example, in 2010 legislation was passed restricting&#xD;
      access to low alcohol content beverages (e.g., beer) to youth, prohibiting access in various&#xD;
      settings (i.e., public transportation, education, playgrounds, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young adults are a particularly interesting cohort to examine in Ukraine, as these youth were&#xD;
      raised following the downfall of the Soviet Union in 1991, during a socio-economic downturn.&#xD;
      For example, data from the Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey shows about 4 in 10 males&#xD;
      and 1 in 10 females drank alcohol in the last month. Despite these alarming statistics, a&#xD;
      paucity of data exists which examines correlates of alcohol use among young adults in&#xD;
      Ukraine. Consistent with problem behavior theory, a variety of studies from the U.S. and&#xD;
      Europe show that alcohol use and other problem behaviors tend to cluster during adolescence&#xD;
      and young adulthood, likely due to shared risk and protective factors, with some researchers&#xD;
      and clinicians viewing alcohol misuse as a self-harm behavior. Although commonly, self-harm&#xD;
      has the connotation of an intentional, self-inflicted, physical injury or suicide attempt,&#xD;
      substance use and eating disorders may be also considered non-suicidal self-harm behavior.&#xD;
      Further, some researchers assign the choice of involvement with HRO (e.g., increased risk of&#xD;
      injury including unintentional death) and the non-observance of safety rules during work as&#xD;
      self-harm behaviors. The boundaries between suicide and non-suicidal self-harm behaviors are&#xD;
      not always clearly defined, and in some cases behaviors that usually fall outside the&#xD;
      boundaries of self-harm may indeed represent self-harm if performed with explicit intent to&#xD;
      cause tissue damage. Self-harm is listed in the DSM-IV-TR as a symptom of borderline&#xD;
      personality disorder or it can be a comorbid disorder. The motivations for self-harm vary, as&#xD;
      it may be used to fulfill a number of different functions. For example, it may function as a&#xD;
      coping mechanism, which provides temporary relief of intense feelings (e.g., anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, stress, and emotional numbness), a sense of failure or self-loathing, or other&#xD;
      mental traits including low self-esteem. Self-harm is most common during adolescence and&#xD;
      young adulthood, usually first appearing between the ages of 12 and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early intervention for emerging adults with risky drinking may be a more effective use of&#xD;
      resources than exclusive focus on treatment of those with alcohol use disorders (Nathan,&#xD;
      1988). A pilot study conducted in Ukraine survey emerging adults in an inpatient hospital and&#xD;
      found that most did not think they had an alcohol problem. Further, our data found that&#xD;
      common motives for alcohol use were related to coping with negative affect (e.g., stress,&#xD;
      anxiety) and social influences (e.g., because my friends use alcohol). These findings are&#xD;
      similar to that of American studies with college students, in which common motives for&#xD;
      drinking included: coping-anxiety, coping-depression, social, enhancement, and conformity&#xD;
      (Grant et al., 2007). In this regard, brief motivational interventions (BMIs) may be useful&#xD;
      to enhance desire to change behavior and address motives for use in order to reduce risk of&#xD;
      future alcohol problems. The need for early intervention may be particularly important for&#xD;
      young adults with alcohol use and co-morbid anxiety and/or depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of the available literature data about the problem of alcohol consumption there is&#xD;
      the lack of information about efficacy of BMIs to reduce alcohol and other substance use&#xD;
      among emerging adults in Ukraine. Among emerging adults in the U.S., studies suggest BMI&#xD;
      approaches are promising among emerging adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Europe, studies also showed the high efficacy of BMI in youth and adults. The goal of a&#xD;
      German study was to gain knowledge about the target group of medically referred alcohol&#xD;
      intoxicated adolescents and young adults, and to identify the utility of the administered&#xD;
      BMI. Namely, researchers tried to find out more about the age and gender structure of&#xD;
      participants, their alcohol and drug use history and their history of previous incidents of&#xD;
      acute alcohol intoxication, their risky substance use and symptoms of psychopathology. Also,&#xD;
      they assessed how many participants of the BMI took advantage of recommended further&#xD;
      counseling regarding their alcohol use. Third, it was examined in what characteristics the&#xD;
      group of &quot;help accepters&quot; differs from the group of &quot;help avoiders&quot; with regard to&#xD;
      socio-demographic characteristics and substance use patterns. Yet, this research faced&#xD;
      several limitations. First, the BMI was only semi-structured. It was uncontrolled stage-&#xD;
      1-design (there was not a control group); thus, researchers were not able to demonstrate the&#xD;
      efficacy of the BMI. It remains unclear, if the BMI initiated change motivation or had the&#xD;
      effect of motivational enhancement. The efficacy of the subsequent youth-specific counseling&#xD;
      services was not examined. Another European study illuminates the existing evidence&#xD;
      concerning the efficacy of brief motivational intervention [20]. Thus, there remain&#xD;
      unanswered questions around the effectiveness of brief alcohol intervention across different&#xD;
      settings, different population groups including emerging adults, about the optimal&#xD;
      intervention content, and the longevity of intervention effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, a recent U.S. study in primary care used the Composite International&#xD;
      Diagnostic Interview Alcohol Module to identify adults with alcohol problems in 3 randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials comparing BMI with no BMI. These were conducted in the USA in order to&#xD;
      identify key intervention components. This study examined 3 sets of audio-recorded BMIs (2&#xD;
      from null studies - no difference in drinking between BMI and no BMI groups; and 1 from a&#xD;
      positive study - less drinking in BMI group compared with no BMI group). The drinking&#xD;
      decreased among participants in all 3 studies. Intervention characteristics that are&#xD;
      considered as central to efficacious BMIs (such as changes in self- or other reports of&#xD;
      drinking quantity and/or frequency, drinking intensity and drinking within recommended&#xD;
      limits) were not strong predictors of drinking outcome. The quality of the BMI processes was&#xD;
      not predictive in these studies and may require attention to factors beyond constructs&#xD;
      typically examined. Therefore, more detailed analysis and prospective studies are necessary.&#xD;
      For example, the varying efficacy of BMI may depend on different factors such as drinking&#xD;
      motives, impulsivity, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and aggression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Over a one year period, this Psychoneurological Department based study will use&#xD;
      a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. Also, the Psychological Faculty of Kyiv National&#xD;
      Medical University. Eligible young adults will complete a screening survey. Given the fact&#xD;
      that we plan to include patients and students, we chose this subject pool for the study&#xD;
      because it combines the psychiatric ward and base of students at the university. Those with&#xD;
      risky drinking will be enrolled in the RCT and randomized to conditions and stratified by&#xD;
      patient/student and given either the brief motivational intervention or the control brochure.&#xD;
      A follow-up assessment will be conducted at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPSS software version 18 will be used for data analysis. A regression model will be applied&#xD;
      according to the distribution of the data.&#xD;

    <description>Motivational interviewing is a technique which aims to be both non-judgmental and non-confrontational. Its success depends largely on the presentation of objective feedback based on information provided by an individual. The technique involves acknowledgement that individuals who attend a counselling session, assessment or prevention program may be at different levels of readiness to change their alcohol consumption patterns, including:&#xD;
No perception of any alcohol consumption problem&#xD;
Realization of alcohol consumption problem with no corresponding action</description>
