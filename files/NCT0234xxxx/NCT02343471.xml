  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the most important and frequent causes of death.&#xD;
      Postprandial lipidemia (PPL) is an independent risk factor for CVD, besides the traditional&#xD;
      risk factors e.g. hypertension, high LDL-cholesterol, family disposition of CVD and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2D). A high PPL is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and&#xD;
      stroke. Reduction of increased PPL, as a part of CVD prevention, is therefore pivotal.&#xD;
      Especially in groups with increased risk of CVD, like the metabolic syndrome (MeS) and T2D.&#xD;
      Identification of a simple diet-related method will possibly result in reduction of CVD in&#xD;
      healthy as well as high-risk subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to investigate the effect whey protein consumed as pre-meal prior&#xD;
      to a fat-rich meal on responses of triglycerides and apolipoprotein B48 (ApoB48) in subjects&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes compared to healthy subjects. Secondarily the aim is to study the&#xD;
      responses of glucose, insulin, glucagon, amino acids, inflammatory markers, incretins, rate&#xD;
      of gastric emptying and metabolomics. Also satiety feeling will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that whey protein consumed 15 minutes prior to a fat-rich&#xD;
      isocaloric meal reduces triglyceride- and ApoB48 responses more in type 2 diabetic subjects&#xD;
      compared to healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of how PPL can&#xD;
      be modified in a simple manner. It will promote innovation to the food industry for&#xD;
      development and production of healthy food products, which can be applied in the fight&#xD;
      against CVD in the background population in general and high-risk people in particular. Thus,&#xD;
      the results of this project can impart knowledge of great importance both to the national and&#xD;
      international food industry as well as the healthcare systems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a randomised, cross-over design 12 healthy subjects and 12 subjects with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes will consume a test meal prior to a fat-rich meal. The test meals contain 2&#xD;
      different meal types; on where whey protein is consumed as a pre-meal and another where water&#xD;
      is the pre-meal. In the second meal type whey protein is instead consumed as a part of the&#xD;
      fat-rich meal. Blood samples are collected before consumption of the pre-meal and after&#xD;
      consumption of the fat-rich isocaloric meal during 360 minutes. The fat-rich isocaloric meal&#xD;
      is a breakfast containing 1043 kcal (15 E% protein, 65 E% fat and 20 E% carbohydrates). The&#xD;
      main-meal is composed of white bread, rye bread, butter, cheese (45 %), salami, egg, bacon,&#xD;
      milk (1.5 % fat) and coffee (decaffeinated) and should be consumed over 15 min. Visual Analog&#xD;
      Scale (VAS) will be used for determination of subjective satiety feeling.&#xD;
