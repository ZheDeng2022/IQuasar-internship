      Studies show that family members share as much or more of the composition of their microbiota&#xD;
      (the trillions of micro-organisms in our guts) with their dogs as they do with each other&#xD;
      (Song et. al. 2013). This shows that the introduction of dogs into home environments has a&#xD;
      profound impact on the human microbiota. Additionally, many studies show that children raised&#xD;
      with dogs are less likely than others to develop a range of immune-mediated disorders,&#xD;
      including asthma and allergies (Ownby, Johnson, and Peterson 2002; Almqvist et al. 2003;&#xD;
      Havstad et al. 2011). This suggests that dogs can serve as probiotics for children by&#xD;
      appropriately training their immune systems not to produce inflammation in response to&#xD;
      harmless stimuli. What is not known, however, is whether the same is true for elderly&#xD;
      populations and dogs. Thus, this study seeks to explore whether dogs might also improve the&#xD;
      physical and mental health of elderly adults by improving the structure and function of their&#xD;
      microbiota. The investigators propose a pilot/proof of concept study to investigate whether&#xD;
      dogs might improve the physical and mental health of elderly adults via changing (improving)&#xD;
      the structure and function of their microbiota (gut flora). The investigators propose a&#xD;
      pre-post study design that among 20 elderly individuals (aged 50 and older) to investigate&#xD;
      the probiotic effect that dogs might have on these individuals. The investigators are&#xD;
      particularly interested to know whether introducing a dog into a home where one has not lived&#xD;
      in the recent past increases the &quot;positive&quot; microorganisms in the guts of the humans living&#xD;
      with them. The investigators will also measure the changes in markers of inflammation (from&#xD;
      blood samples) as well as the changes in self-reported scores of depression, frailty,&#xD;
      physical activity, and general health and well-being mobility among human participants. In&#xD;
      order to assess any effects in the animal study participants, the investigators will also&#xD;
      collect and analyze fecal and blood samples as well as conduct home visits to observe canine&#xD;
      and human interactions and bonding and conduct assessments of canine well-being using&#xD;
      questionnaires/observational techniques that have been validated for these purposes in other&#xD;
      studies. Additionally, the investigators will assess the interactions between of the&#xD;
      participants with the dog and how having a dog in the home may influence an individual's&#xD;
      relationship with the dog and his/her thoughts about the microbiota, human and canine health&#xD;
      and human-animal interactions through monthly semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously received IACUC approval for this study, approval number&#xD;
      14-537.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most amazing scientific discoveries of the last decade has been the important&#xD;
      roles that the trillions of micro-organisms in our guts (called the &quot;microbiota&quot;) play in&#xD;
      promoting good physical health and emotional well-being. Unfortunately, many aspects of the&#xD;
      modern world conspire to alter the composition and function of the gut microbiota in ways&#xD;
      that damage health, especially in the elderly where strong correlations have been seen&#xD;
      between microbiota composition and frailty. Work from our research group and others suggests&#xD;
      that one very important factor that damages the microbiota in the modern world is our&#xD;
      separation from many micro-organisms with which the investigators co-evolved and which have&#xD;
      the ability to lower the types of chronic inflammation that are ubiquitous in the modern&#xD;
      world and that contribute to the development of most of our most pressing health issues, from&#xD;
      diabetes and heart disease to depression and dementia (Huang et al., 2013; Mayer et al, 2014;&#xD;
      Naseribafrouei, 2013). While much has been written about the positive psycho-social impacts&#xD;
      that animal-human relationships have on human psychological health (Allen et al, 1991; Allen&#xD;
      et al.; 2002; Collins et al, 2006; Kwong &amp; Bartholomew, 2011; Kurdek, 2008; Wells, 2007),&#xD;
      less is known about the direct physical effects that animals have on human health. What is&#xD;
      known, however, is largely related to animals' effects on stress reduction (Allen et al,&#xD;
      1991; Allen et al., 2002) anxiety (Foster &amp; McVey Neufeld, 2013), mood (Collins et al, 2006)&#xD;
      and cardiovascular disease (Allen et al., 2002) What has been largely unexplored, however, is&#xD;
      the mechanism by which these interactions and positive impacts on human health are taking&#xD;
      place. Thus, working with colleagues who are world leaders in studying links between the&#xD;
      microbiota and health, the investigators propose to conduct a study designed to explore the&#xD;
      potential of dogs to serve as &quot;probiotic delivery systems&quot; to enhance the physical health and&#xD;
      cognitive and emotional functioning of at-risk elderly persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this novel approach to enhancing health and well-being in the elderly comes&#xD;
      from several lines of evidence. First, one recent study shows that family members share as&#xD;
      much or more of the composition of their microbiota with their dogs as they do with each&#xD;
      other (Song et al. 2013). This shows that the introduction of dogs into home environments has&#xD;
      a profound impact on the human microbiota. Second, many studies show that children raised&#xD;
      with dogs are less likely than others to develop a range of immune-mediated disorders,&#xD;
      including asthma and allergies (Ownby et al. 2002; Almqvist et al. 2003; Havstad et al.&#xD;
      2011). This suggests that dogs can serve as probiotics for children by appropriately training&#xD;
      their immune systems not to produce inflammation in response to harmless stimuli. Thus, what&#xD;
      is not known, and what this study is designed to explore, is whether dogs might also improve&#xD;
      the physical and mental health of elderly adults by improving the structure and function of&#xD;
      their microbiota. This is a proof of concept / pilot study. Should results from this study&#xD;
      suggest that there is indeed a positive benefit/relationship to canine companionship to the&#xD;
      microbiota of elderly human companions, the investigators plan to implement a larger,&#xD;
      full-scale clinical trial to investigate this phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that the introduction of a canine companion into&#xD;
      the home of an elderly individual (defined as aged 50 and older) will result in an increase&#xD;
      in protective or 'positive' gut micro-organisms and that this increase will correspond with&#xD;
      improved immune functioning in the elderly human study participants.&#xD;
