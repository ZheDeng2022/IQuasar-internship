    <textblock>
      Randomized trial of low-dose amiodarone therapy versus catheter ablation (CA) in older&#xD;
      patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To compare amiodarone to catheter ablation in patients aged 50 to 80 years&#xD;
      with symptomatic AF for the composite outcome of hospitalization for cardiovascular cause or&#xD;
      emergency department visit for atrial arrhythmia&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre vanguard phase prospective randomized open label study with blinded&#xD;
      outcome adjudication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized by a central randomization system (1:1) to amiodarone or catheter&#xD;
      ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Amiodarone will be started at a dose of 400 mg/day. After one month the dose will be&#xD;
           lowered to 200 mg per day. Patients will be seen every six months. At each visit the&#xD;
           dose of amiodarone will be lowered by 100 mg per week if the patient is having a good&#xD;
           clinical response to treatment. Good clinical response will be a a clinical assessment&#xD;
           that takes into account not only actual or possible arrhythmia recurrence but also&#xD;
           side-effects and patient acceptability of treatment. A minimum dose of 700 mg/week will&#xD;
           be allowed. If patient symptoms recur, the amiodarone dose may be increased but not&#xD;
           above a dose of 200 mg/day .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Catheter ablation of persistent AF will be done within two months using pulmonary vein&#xD;
           isolation in all subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient not in sinus rhythm at time randomization will undergo DC cardioversion after at&#xD;
           least 1 month of amiodarone Rx or during CA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: Clinical assessment will include a medical history and physical examination to be&#xD;
      performed at baseline, and every 3 months. This will also include 12-lead ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. At 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months: QOL questionnaire (AFEQT- Atrial Fibrillation Effect on&#xD;
      QualiTy of life) c. Thyroid and liver function tests, chest X-ray will be obtained at regular&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d. Arrhythmia will be monitored using a 2-week event monitors at 6, 12, 18, 24 months.&#xD;

    <description>Known potential side effects of catheter ablation include vascular access complications such as hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, or AV fistula. Less common but more serious include cardiac perforation (0.5%-1%) and thromboembolism (0.5%-1%), and fatal complications occur in approximately 1:1000 cases.&#xD;
Known potential side effects of amiodarone include amiodarone toxicity, corneal micro-deposits, photosensitivity, thyroid abnormalities. pulmonary toxicity, abnormal liver function, and skin discolouration.</description>

    <description>Amiodarone treatment. Amiodarone will be given at a loading dose of 400 mg per day for two week and then lowered to 200 mg daily for 6 months at which point the dose will be lowered to 1000 mg per week. The dose of amiodarone will then be lowered every six, as long as the patient has a satisfactory response. The minimum dose will be 700 mg per week.</description>
