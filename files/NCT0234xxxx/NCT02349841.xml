      To evaluate the early bactericidal activity (EBA), safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of meropenem administered intravenously three times a day, plus amoxycillin/CA administered&#xD;
      orally three times a day; and of faropenem administered orally three times a day, plus&#xD;
      amoxycillin/CA administered orally three times a day; for 14 consecutive days, in adult&#xD;
      participants with newly diagnosed, smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis, in order to help&#xD;
      establish proof-of-concept for carbapenem antibiotics as antituberculosis agents and to&#xD;
      select the appropriate agent and route of administration for later stage clinical&#xD;
      development.&#xD;

      A single-centre, open-label clinical trial including a total of 45 male or female&#xD;
      participants (2 groups of 15 participants receiving an IMP and 1 group of 15 participants&#xD;
      receiving Rifafour e-275), aged between 18 and 65 years (inclusive), with newly diagnosed,&#xD;
      smear-positive, pulmonary tuberculosis will be enrolled into this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be administered for 14 consecutive days in the following dosing schemes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Meropenem 2g intravenously 8-hourly; plus amoxycillin/CA 500mg/125mg orally 8- hourly on&#xD;
           days 1-14.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Faropenem 600mg orally 8-hourly; plus amoxycillin/CA 500mg/125mg orally 8-hourly on days&#xD;
           1-14.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The third arm will receive standard first line TB treatment as per the South African TB&#xD;
           guidelines (Rifafour e-275) and is included as a control for the EBA quantitative&#xD;
           mycobacteriology and to evaluate whether HRZE gives similar EBA results to that&#xD;
           demonstrated in prior studies with this combination. The mycobacteriology laboratory&#xD;
           will remain blinded until closure of the EBA results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the in hospital facility for a period of up to 24 days.&#xD;
      During this period they will await their screening results after which they will receive 14&#xD;
      day of IMP. on day 14 intensive PK sampling will be done. They will be discharged on day 15&#xD;
      to the clinic where they will continue on the national TB programme treatment regime.&#xD;
      Participants will return to the clinical trial site 14 days after receipt of their last study&#xD;
      drug. for a safety evaluation.&#xD;
