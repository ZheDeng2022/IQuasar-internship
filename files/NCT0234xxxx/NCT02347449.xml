  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to characterize whether the results of the Oncotype DX® assay&#xD;
      affect the physician's treatment recommendations for the adjuvant treatment of women with&#xD;
      ER-positive (ER+), early breast cancer (EBC) with 1-3 positive lymph nodes who are potential&#xD;
      candidates for chemotherapy, but for whom the benefits of chemotherapy may be uncertain.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Oncotype DX assay has been commercially available in the U.S. since 2004 as a tool to aid&#xD;
      a physician's treatment recommendation for a breast cancer patient. While the Oncotype DX&#xD;
      assay is currently reimbursed by the Ontario Health Ministry for node-negative EBC, it is not&#xD;
      reimbursed for node-positive (N+) patients although the assay has been shown to be both&#xD;
      prognostic and predictive of chemotherapy benefit for patients with N+ disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to characterize how the results of the Oncotype DX® assay impact&#xD;
      the decision making processes of physicians and patients in a large academic medical center&#xD;
      in Ontario by evaluating recommendations for adjuvant therapy within a population of ER+, N+&#xD;
      EBC patients with 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes for whom the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      is not certain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon consent, the patient will be assigned an ID number. The physician will discuss the&#xD;
      patient's treatment alternatives prior to ordering the Oncotype DX assay. After discussion&#xD;
      with the patient, the physician will complete a baseline questionnaire indicating the&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy he/she would recommend to the patient based upon the available clinical&#xD;
      and pathologic data. In addition, the patient will also complete a baseline questionnaire&#xD;
      indicating her treatment preference, based on the previous discussion with the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Oncotype DX assay will be ordered after receipt of the Registration and Confirmation of&#xD;
      Eligibility Form and assignment of patient study number. Once the results of the Oncotype DX&#xD;
      assay are available, the physician will discuss the results with the patient. Both the&#xD;
      physician and the patient will complete separate follow-up post-assay questionnaires after&#xD;
      the results of the Oncotype DX assay are known and shared with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One last form completed by a study manager or coordinator after a treatment plan has been&#xD;
      initiated will register the actual treatment administered to the patient.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have undergone surgical treatment for breast cancer with adequate&#xD;
             evaluation of lymph node status with a sentinel lymph node procedure or full axillary&#xD;
             dissection, with positive involvement of 1-3 axillary lymph nodes as confirmed by&#xD;
