&#xD;
          4. Subject is in good health based on medical history and physical examination findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female subject is surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or, if of childbearing&#xD;
             potential, agrees to use at least 2 acceptable methods of birth control (e.g.&#xD;
             prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, contraceptive patch,&#xD;
             intrauterine device, barrier methods, abstinence) or male partner sterilization alone&#xD;
             for the duration of the study until 60 days after study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject agrees to abstain from caffeine and theobromine containing products and the&#xD;
             consumption of Seville oranges, grapefruit (including grapefruit juice), broccoli,&#xD;

             current trial.&#xD;
&#xD;

             medications for the duration of the study (except the above mentioned&#xD;
             acetaminophen/paracetamol). Birth control or other hormone replacement is also&#xD;
             permitted as long as it has been taken at a stable dose for at least three months&#xD;
             before the Screening Visit and remains stable for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Females who are pregnant or nursing or who have a positive pregnancy test result at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Inflammatory Bowel Disease or conditions which may decrease the absorption of&#xD;
             warfarin.&#xD;
