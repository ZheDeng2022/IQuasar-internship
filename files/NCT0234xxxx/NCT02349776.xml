  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allograft transplants are offered to people with haematological cancers sometimes as the best&#xD;
      chance of a cure. However, the survival rates for these procedures can be quite poor, as the&#xD;
      transplant, in itself, can be lifethreatening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, these procedures usually involve a period of lengthy hospitalisation accompanied&#xD;
      by a host of debilitating conditions which patients must cope with in isolation due to their&#xD;
      increased risk of serious infection. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there is considerable evidence&#xD;
      that mood plays a role in the way people recover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I wish to investigate the psychological impact of providing testimonies from survivors of&#xD;
      transplants to patients undergoing the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan is initially to collect about 10-15 testimonials from past transplant patients using&#xD;
      a videotaped structured interview then to collate these testimonials into a booklet format&#xD;
      and DVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This booklet and DVD would be used as an intervention where 40 consecutive patients who are&#xD;
      going ahead for transplant are invited to receive the testimonial intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to complete one mood measure (the HADS), the Life Orientation Test&#xD;
      (LOT), and a questionnaire about expectations of treatment in clinic once a decision to&#xD;
      proceed to transplant has been made. Patients will receive the testimonies upon admittance to&#xD;
      the transplant unit and then receive the HADS and a structured interview within the first&#xD;
      week of being admitted to the transplant ward (just prior to receiving the transplant) and&#xD;
      within the first two weeks following the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparative analyses of the measures between the three time points would be performed and&#xD;
      qualitative analysis of the structured interview data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 80 people undergo transplant each year, it is estimated that the project will be&#xD;
      completed by September 2016. The intention would be to publish following completion.&#xD;
