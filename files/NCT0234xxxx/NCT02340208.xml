  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this research study is to evaluate how safe, how well tolerated and&#xD;
      how effective a range of doses of L-DOS47 in patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer when given as a monotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited into cohorts, with a minimum of three and a maximum of six&#xD;
      patients per cohort. All patients at a given dose level must complete Cycle 1 (3 week period)&#xD;
      before escalation in subsequent patients can proceed. The decision for dose escalation to the&#xD;
      next dose level will be made after the safety and available pharmacokinetic (PK) data have&#xD;
      been reviewed by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Escalation of L-DOS47 will continue until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the MTD of L-DOS47 has been determined in Phase I, up to 20 patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      (taken forward from Phase I) to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of L-DOS47 (i.e., response&#xD;
      rate using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours [RECIST] version 1.1 criteria,&#xD;
      disease progression and survival); monitoring will include radiologic evaluations every&#xD;
      second cycle. The safety and tolerability of L-DOS47 will also be further evaluated.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic information will be collected as well as relevant observations on the&#xD;
      activity of L-DOS47.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients, treatment with L-DOS47 will continue either until the patient experiences&#xD;
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, the patient withdraws consent or has completed&#xD;
      four treatment cycles and does not wish to continue with additional cycles, whichever occurs&#xD;
      first. After four cycles, patients may continue to receive L-DOS47 for as long as there is&#xD;
      sustained clinical benefit and it is well tolerated, in the opinion of the Investigator.&#xD;
