  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that hypoglycaemia affects various domains of cognitive function. One aspect of&#xD;
      cognitive function is 'social cognition', which is our ability to interpret facial&#xD;
      expressions, gestures and speech. It is an approach to understanding human judgement and&#xD;
      behaviour. There is anecdotal evidence for negative behavioural responses such as&#xD;
      aggressiveness and argumentativeness during hypoglycaemia and while research has shown that&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia can cause significant changes in mood, little information exists regarding its&#xD;
      effect on social cognition. It is therefore not known whether hypoglycaemia affects this&#xD;
      aspect of cognitive function but, if it did, it could explain why people with low blood sugar&#xD;
      due to insulin treatment are often resistant to offers of help (for example, they may&#xD;
      misinterpret a friendly gesture as being threatening). Knowledge of this effect of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia can be used to educate relatives and carers of people with diabetes who may&#xD;
      suffer this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycaemia is also known to have an effect on the electrical rhythm of the heart. This is&#xD;
      thought to be secondary to adrenaline secretion during hypoglycaemia which provokes a fall in&#xD;
      the blood level of potassium, a type of electrolyte. Other electrolyte imbalances are known&#xD;
      to predispose to heart rhythm abnormalities or arrhythmias in other situations and it is not&#xD;
      known if the levels of these other electrolytes are affected during hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using specific tests of social cognition and continuous electrocardiographic (ECG)&#xD;
      monitoring, this study aims to find out whether social cognition is affected by an hour of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia and how hypoglycaemia affects blood electrolyte levels and the&#xD;
      electrophysiology of the heart.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoglycaemia is a very common side-effect of insulin treatment in people with diabetes.&#xD;
      Anglo-Danish studies have confirmed the high frequency of hypoglycaemia affecting people with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes. The rate of severe hypoglycaemia is as high as 0.35 episodes per&#xD;
      patient-year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human brain requires a constant supply of glucose for normal functioning, which is&#xD;
      impaired by hypoglycaemia. As a consequence, cognitive and motor function can deteriorate&#xD;
      rapidly with significant consequences. This has been studied extensively and it is known that&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia affects various domains of cognitive function including short-term and working&#xD;
      memory, attention, non-verbal intelligence, visual and auditory information processing,&#xD;
      psychomotor function, spatial awareness, and executive functioning. However, to our&#xD;
      knowledge, the effect of acute hypoglycaemia on social cognition has not been studied&#xD;
      previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social cognition examines the higher cognitive functions involved in interpreting facial&#xD;
      expressions, gestures or speech. It is an approach to understanding human judgement and&#xD;
      behaviour. There is anecdotal evidence for negative behavioural responses such as&#xD;
      aggressiveness and argumentativeness during hypoglycaemia and while research has shown that&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia can cause significant changes in mood, little information exists regarding its&#xD;
      effect on social cognition. It is therefore not known whether hypoglycaemia affects this&#xD;
      aspect of cognitive function but, if it did, it could explain why people who are&#xD;
      hypoglycaemic are often resistant to offers of help (for example, they may misinterpret a&#xD;
      friendly gesture as being threatening). Knowledge of this effect of hypoglycaemia can be used&#xD;
      to educate relatives and carers of people with diabetes who may suffer this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycaemia is known to have an effect on the electrophysiology of the heart. It can cause&#xD;
      prolongation of the QT interval(represents the interval between the Q wave and T wave in an&#xD;
      ECG), demonstrable with electrocardiography which may predispose some individuals to an&#xD;
      increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Studies have shown this QT interval prolongation to be&#xD;
      associated with adrenaline secretion secondary to sympathoadrenal activation during an acute&#xD;
      episode of hypoglycaemia and this provokes a fall in plasma potassium. Electrolyte imbalances&#xD;
      are known to predispose to arrhythmias and it is not known if other electrolyte disturbances&#xD;
      during hypoglycaemia may also affect the QT interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp technique, tests of social cognition will be&#xD;
      administered during one hour of hypoglycaemia in 20 adults with type 1 diabetes. The study&#xD;
      participants will act as their own controls by performing the same tests during euglycaemia&#xD;
      on a separate study session separated by at least two weeks, using the same hyperinsulinaemic&#xD;
      glucose clamp technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Holter monitor will be used to perform continuous ECG monitoring throughout the duration of&#xD;
      the study. Blood will be taken to measure plasma potassium, magnesium and calcium&#xD;
      concentrations at various time-points during the study to seek any acute changes in these&#xD;
      electrolytes during hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effect of hypoglycaemia on social cognition in adults with type 1&#xD;
           diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effect of hypoglycaemia on blood electrolyte levels and QT interval on&#xD;
           ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo modified hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamps and initially will be&#xD;
      maintained at euglycaemia, followed by an experimental condition of either hypoglycaemia or&#xD;
      euglycaemia for 60 minutes. Euglycaemia will be restored before the clamp is discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests of social cognition will be administered within one hour of the experimental phase of&#xD;
      the study. In addition, continuous ECG monitoring will be undertaken and plasma electrolyte&#xD;
      concentrations will be measured at different time points during the baseline, experimental&#xD;
      and recovery phases of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and procedures Each participant will take part in two sessions separated by at&#xD;
      least two weeks: the control and experimental conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session will commence at 08.00 hours after an overnight fast. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      not to administer their usual morning insulin dose on study days. Female participants will be&#xD;
      asked to have a pregnancy test to exclude any pregnant individual. Studies will take place in&#xD;
      the Clinical Research Facility of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be asked whether they have experienced or recorded any episode of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia in the preceding 24 hours. This is because antecedent hypoglycaemia is known to&#xD;
      modify the counterregulatory and symptomatic responses to subsequent hypoglycaemia. The study&#xD;
      will be postponed if any hypoglycaemia (symptomatic or biochemical) has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be seated/reclined on a hospital bed with a table in front of them which&#xD;
      will be used for the various computer and paper based tests of social cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Holter monitor, which will continuously record a 3-lead ECG during the study, will be&#xD;
      attached once the participant is seated. A baseline 12-lead ECG will also be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravenous cannula will be inserted into the non-dominant hand vein for regular sampling&#xD;
      of blood glucose. Samples will be arterialised by inserting the cannula in a retrograde&#xD;
      manner and a heated blanket will be used for warming the hand as is standard practice. A&#xD;
      second cannula will be inserted into a vein in the antecubital fossa of the same arm for&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of glucose and insulin. A modified hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp will&#xD;
      be performed. After a run-in period, arterialised blood glucose will be maintained at 4.5&#xD;
      mmol/L for 30 minutes. Blood glucose will then either be maintained at 4.5 mmol/L throughout&#xD;
      (euglycaemia), or lowered over 20 minutes to 2.5 mmol/L (hypoglycaemia), and maintained at&#xD;
      this level for 60 minutes. At the end of this experimental phase, euglycaemia (4.5 mmol/L)&#xD;
      will be restored and maintained for a further period of 20 minutes. The glucose clamp will&#xD;
      then be discontinued and the subjects will be given a meal. Subjects will be advised&#xD;
      regarding adjustment of doses and times of insulin administration for the rest of the day by&#xD;
      the study doctor who is experienced in the management of insulin-treated diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will not be informed which condition of the study is being performed, and will&#xD;
      undergo the control (i.e. euglycaemic) and experimental (i.e. hypoglycaemic) conditions in a&#xD;
      randomised and counter-balanced fashion. Alternative forms of the social cognition test will&#xD;
      also be performed in a counter-balanced fashion. Every participant will receive the same&#xD;
      intervention and randomisation is limited to the order in which these interventions are&#xD;
      received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests of social cognition: These will be performed once during the experimental phase of the&#xD;
      study, with the exception of the National Adult Reading Test which will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline as a measure of pre-morbid intelligence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Faux pas test: A faux pas occurs when someone says something they should not have said,&#xD;
           not realising that they should not say it. In this test of faux pas detection, 10 very&#xD;
           short stories will be read out to the participant. They will also be presented with the&#xD;
           story in written form so they can read along while it is being read aloud to them. Out&#xD;
           of the 10 stories, 5 contain a faux pas. After each story, the participant will be asked&#xD;
           questions based on the story in order to help determine if they have recognised the faux&#xD;
           pas or not. The remaining 5 stories work as controls as they do not contain any faux&#xD;
           pas. This test will take up to 10 minutes to deliver.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Since the participants act as their own controls, a different set of 10 stories; 5&#xD;
           containing faux pas and 5 controls, will be used in the same manner as described above&#xD;
           during the second visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reading the mind in the eyes: This is a validated test which identifies subtle&#xD;
           impairments in social intelligence in otherwise intelligent adults. In this test the&#xD;
           participant is presented with a series of 18 photographs (printed on paper) of the&#xD;
           eye-region of the face of different actors, and is asked to choose which one word&#xD;
           describes best what the person in the photograph is feeling. The participant is given a&#xD;
           choice of 4 words. The participant is provided with a glossary of all terms that they&#xD;
           will come across during this test and is asked to read through the glossary and the&#xD;
           meanings of any words that they may not be familiar with during the baseline phase of&#xD;
           the study. The participant is also advised that this glossary remains available to them&#xD;
           for reference throughout this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Since participants act as their own controls, a different set of 18 photographs is shown&#xD;
           during the second visit with the same instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The awareness of social inference test (TASIT): This test is designed to assess the&#xD;
           ability to &quot;read&quot; individual social cues and to assimilate them and make judgements&#xD;
           about the speaker's intention, attitude, feeling, etc. The participant will be shown&#xD;
           multiple short videos on a laptop, each lasting 15-60 seconds and then asked questions&#xD;
           about the actor's intention, attitude and meaning. Each video will be played and will be&#xD;
           followed by questions relating to the scene that has just been played in the video. The&#xD;
           test contains 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Social inference (minimal) The participant is required to determine the speaker's&#xD;
                meaning and intentions based on the dialogue, emotional expression and other&#xD;
                paralinguistic clues of each of the performers in the video. The participant is&#xD;
                tested on the ability to differentiate between a sincere exchange and a sarcastic&#xD;
                exchange in order to look for any changes in social inference during the&#xD;
                hypoglycaemic period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Social inference (enriched) This uses a series of vignettes, all of which contain a&#xD;
                message that is literally untrue. Half of these represent sarcastic exchanges.&#xD;
                However the other half use the same script as the sarcasm vignettes but in each one&#xD;
                the speaker is lying, i.e., he/she intends the literal message to be accepted but&#xD;
                it is contrary to what he/she believes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since each participant acts as his or her own control, a similar number of recorded vignettes&#xD;
      will be played during the second visit with the same instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Edinburgh Hypoglycaemia Symptom Scale: This validated questionnaire is used to assess the&#xD;
      hypoglycaemic symptoms. This will be applied at baseline, at the start and end of the&#xD;
      experimental phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General tests of cognitive function: The following tests of cognitive function have&#xD;
      repeatedly been shown to be affected by hypoglycaemia and are quick to administer. They will&#xD;
      therefore be used to confirm that the glucose nadir has been sufficient to impair cognitive&#xD;
      function. They will be administered at the same time points as the Edinburgh Hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      Symptom Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trail Making B. This test assesses visual conceptual and visual motor tracking. The subject&#xD;
      is given a hand held tablet with a stylus and is presented with a grid containing randomly&#xD;
      positioned numbers and letters, which are to be connected in alternating numerical and&#xD;
      alphabetical order by them tapping with the stylus (ie 1 - A - 2 - B - 3 - C and so on.) The&#xD;
      test score is the time taken to tap all the letters and numbers on the screen in the correct&#xD;
      order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digit Symbol Test. This test measures sustained attention, response speed and visuo-motor&#xD;
      co-ordination. Rows of blank squares are displayed on a piece of paper. Each blank square is&#xD;
      paired with a number from one to nine. A printed key pairs each number with a different&#xD;
      symbol, and the participant fills the blank squares with the symbols that match the numbers.&#xD;
      The score is the number of successful codings within the 120 second time limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choice reaction time. Subjects are presented with a laptop and are asked to press one of four&#xD;
      keys as quickly as they can in response to the appearance of 4 'X' symbols on the computer&#xD;
      screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Holter monitoring and ECG recording: In addition to looking for changes in social cognition,&#xD;
      continuous ECG monitoring using a 3 lead ECG Holter monitor will be used to look at QT&#xD;
      interval changes. The monitor will be attached to the participant at the start of the study&#xD;
      and removed at the end of the 20 minute recovery phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to Holter monitoring, 12-lead ECGs will be taken at baselines, 30 minutes into&#xD;
      the experimental phase, at the end of the experimental phase and end of the clamp on both&#xD;
      occasions. If there are any persisting QT changes at the end of the clamp, the participant&#xD;
      will be invited to attend for a repeat ECG the next day to ensure that any ECG changes have&#xD;
      resolved. There is a single case report of persisting QT interval prolongation for up to 48&#xD;
      hours after a period of hypoglycaemia in a 75 year old lady with end-stage renal disease in&#xD;
      the context of acute myocardial ischaemia. Since we are recruiting from a younger population&#xD;
      with no significant co-morbidities, we would not anticipate any lasting ECG changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QT interval will be determined by the tangent or slope-intersect method. This will be an&#xD;
      automated measurement produced by the Holter machine itself. If U waves are identified at any&#xD;
      point, then a rhythm strip will be printed out and the QT interval determined manually by the&#xD;
      researcher. This will be from the start of the QRS complex(represents the 'QRS complex' on&#xD;
      the ECG which corresponds to the depolarization of the ventricles of the heart) till the&#xD;
      nadir between the T and U wave. The QT interval will also be measured manually once (taken&#xD;
      from the start of the QRS complex till the end of the T wave) on the baseline ECG. QTc&#xD;
      (corrected QT interval) will be calculated using Bazett's formula which is calculated by&#xD;
      dividing the QT interval with the square root of the RR interval. While there are a number of&#xD;
      formulas to calculate QTc, there is no recommended standard formula for this. Bazett's&#xD;
      formula is the most commonly used clinically. It is often criticised as it is thought to be&#xD;
      inaccurate in extremes of heart rate, in particular tachycardia. However, since it is widely&#xD;
      used in clinical practice to calculate QTc, and since we do not expect our subjects to&#xD;
      exhibit extremes of bradycardia or tachycardia during the study as the blood glucose will not&#xD;
      be allowed to fall below 2.5 mmol/L, we have chosen to use Bazett's formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of electrolytes: Blood samples for measurement of plasma electrolyte&#xD;
      concentrations (potassium, magnesium, calcium) will be taken at baseline; at the beginning,&#xD;
      middle (30 minutes and end (60 minutes) of the experimental phase; at the point when&#xD;
      euglycaemia is restored and after euglycaemia has been maintained for 20 minutes. The blood&#xD;
      samples will be spun down immediately after obtaining them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of hypoglycaemia on cognitive function will be assessed by repeated measures&#xD;
      analysis of variance, with experimental condition as a within-subjects factor, and order of&#xD;
      session (euglycaemia-hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemia-euglycaemia) as a between-subjects&#xD;
      factor. This means that performance on cognitive tests will be compared for each patient&#xD;
      between their hypoglycaemia and euglycaemia study sessions. Statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). A p value of less that&#xD;
      0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deterioration in test scores of 0.5 standard deviations or more between the euglycaemia and&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia study sessions would be considered a clinically relevant change. With 20&#xD;
      subjects, the power of the study to detect a 0.5 standard deviation change in any test&#xD;
      (assuming α=0.05, reliability of test=0.8) is 94.&#xD;
