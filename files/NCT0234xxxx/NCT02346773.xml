  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is considerable interest in the possibility that dietary supplementation&#xD;
      with fatty acids, mostly omega-3 fatty acids, will have potential benefits for brain&#xD;
      development. Epidemiological and clinical studies support the idea that relative&#xD;
      disappearance of omega-3 diet from the diet in developed countries has been linked with&#xD;
      increases in both physical and mental disorders. Omega-3 deficiency may lead to cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, motor dysfunction and visual acuity problems. It is further known that families&#xD;
      with lower socioeconomic status may have poorer diet and, consequently, may not realize their&#xD;
      full potential regarding their cognitive abilities. The aim of this project is to evaluate&#xD;
      effectiveness of a diet intervention rich in omega-3 acid in healthy children 9-to-12 years&#xD;
      old from less well-off families.&#xD;

      Background It has been established that a safe environment, adequate stimulation, and&#xD;
      parental care play a major role in brain development. An adequate diet is also critically&#xD;
      important for brain development in growing children. It has been suggested that omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids are essential to human health as well as cognitive development. Omega-3 acid is&#xD;
      important during prenatal human brain development, especially for synaptogenesis. Levels of&#xD;
      omega-3 amino acids in during prenatal and early postnatal (breastfeeding) periods depend on&#xD;
      their levels in maternal circulation. Later on, omega-3 must be present in the child's diet.&#xD;
      It seems that omega-3 deficiency may associated with impaired visual acuity, cognition,&#xD;
      cerebellar dysfunction and other neurological disorders (Haag, 2003; Review). Thus, omega-3&#xD;
      supplementation may be beneficial in children with poor diet, often associated with a lower&#xD;
      socioeconomic level (Northstone et al. 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Design We assessed effects of Omega-3 supplementation on brain and behaviour of 40&#xD;
      healthy children 9-to-12 years old. Since diet supplementation may be beneficial in&#xD;
      particular to children with poor diet, we recruited children in less well-off neighbourhoods,&#xD;
      as determined by the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2007. Our aim was to examine differences&#xD;
      on cognitive performance pre and post diet supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain structure was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cognitive abilities&#xD;
      as well as behavioural problems were assessed using a comprehensive battery of tests and&#xD;
      questionnaires. To evaluate the effectiveness of the supplementation, we collected a blood&#xD;
      sample to investigate the fatty acids level in the blood. The above assessments were carried&#xD;
      out twice: before and after a 3-month dietary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dietary intervention included a daily use, for a period of three months, of margarine&#xD;
      enriched (Experimental group) or not (placebo group) with Omega-3 fatty acids. We&#xD;
      hypothesized that this intervention will improve some cognitive deficits (such as attention,&#xD;
      processing speed) and behavioural symptoms (e.g. depression, aggressiveness, impulsivity)&#xD;
      together with an impact on brain structure (e.g. white-matter properties related to&#xD;
      myelination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Protocol Each participant participated in two phases: a clinical assessment&#xD;
      phase (to assure exclusion and inclusion criteria) and an experimental phase. The&#xD;
      experimental phase consisted of the baseline (pre-intervention) assessment, the diet&#xD;
      intervention (3 months) and the post-intervention assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, both groups (enriched diet and placebo) underwent a cognitive assessment and&#xD;
      MRI. Parents were asked to complete a questionnaire about the child's behaviour and some&#xD;
      demographical data such as number of children, education etc. Children were also asked to&#xD;
      provide a blood sample, which was taken by a fully trained and licensed team member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline assessment, experimental group (n=20) and control group (n=20) followed a&#xD;
      diet supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids or placebo diet respectively. The intervention&#xD;
      lasted for three months and then the tests were re-administered for both groups (cases and&#xD;
      controls). Parents were also asked to complete a brief questionnaire to measure children's&#xD;
      behaviour.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention product was a full fat (80%) margarine.Participants were provided with one-month supply of the intervention product (including reserve products) at the onset of the intervention and received a new supply monthly. The intervention products were provided in neutral serving-sized cups, each containing 10 grams of margarine.The child's parents were instructed to have their child consume one complete portion pack (10 g) of margarine per day. The margarine had to be consumed as spread on sandwiches, crackers or bread rolls.The intervention product could be consumed on various periods over the day or all at one occasion. Every day a new portion pack had to be used, even if there was margarine left in the package of the previous day.</description>
