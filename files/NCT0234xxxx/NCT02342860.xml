      The investigators will conduct a cluster-randomized trial to assess the impact of a&#xD;
      school-based water, sanitation and hygiene program on health and educational outcomes of&#xD;
      school children in Saravane Province, Laos. The intervention will include an improved water&#xD;
      supply (borehole), a sanitation block that includes three pour-flush latrines with rainwater&#xD;
      harvesting to be used for flushing and a urinal, and sinks for handwashing with soap. The&#xD;
      school will also receive a facility for group handwashing (large pipe where many children can&#xD;
      wash hands at once. United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) will&#xD;
      additionally provide behavior change education. Our key outcome of interest is pupil absence,&#xD;
      which will be measured longitudinally using roll-call on days of schools visits. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include self-reported absence, diarrhea and respiratory infection of a random&#xD;
      selection of students. The investigators will also monitor the fidelity of the intervention&#xD;
      and assess school conditions and pupil sanitation and handwashing behaviors using structured&#xD;
      observation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Though limited, research suggests school-based water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)&#xD;
      improvements are capable of reducing pupil absence from 35-42%. However, few studies have&#xD;
      rigorously evaluated the impact of comprehensive WASH in Schools (WinS) improvements on pupil&#xD;
      absenteeism; to date, no research on the impact of WinS has been conducted in Lao PDR. This&#xD;
      study will use longitudinal data collection to quantify the impact of UNICEF's WinS program&#xD;
      on pupil learning and health in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research activities will take place Saravane Province, Lao PDR. Schools are eligible if they&#xD;
      are a primary, non-Community-Built Construction (CBC) school, and lacking WASH facilities. A&#xD;
      total of 136 schools will be randomly selected from a pool of all eligible schools, and&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either the intervention or comparison group (68 schools each). Directors&#xD;
      of the selected schools will be contacted and informed about procedures prior to the start of&#xD;
      the study, and they will provide permission to conduct the study at their schools if they so&#xD;
      choose. At each school the investigators will randomly select up to 60 pupils in grades 1-5.&#xD;
      Research staff will approach selected pupils at school to request informed oral assent for&#xD;
      participation. The informed assent process and data collection will be conducted by local&#xD;
      trained enumerators in the child's preferred language of Laotian or a local dialect. Oral&#xD;
      rather than written assent was chosen due to varied literacy capabilities and to limit&#xD;
      paperwork that identifies participants. A waiver of parental consent for pupil interviews has&#xD;
      been secured from the Ministry of Education and Sports. At each school, school directors will&#xD;
      be asked to sign in loco parentis (&quot;in the place of parent&quot;) on behalf of the pupil&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will take place at each school once every six to eight weeks for the duration&#xD;
      of up to three school years. The investigators will conduct school observations and an&#xD;
      interview with the school director about school conditions, handwashing behavior observations&#xD;
      of children, and a review of aggregate school-wide academic record data including percentage&#xD;
      of children obtaining a passing average, advancing to the next class, and drop-outs. None of&#xD;
      these school activities collect personal data or identifiers. Data collection with pupils&#xD;
      will be done with the same pupils every six to eight weeks and will entail a five-minute&#xD;
      interview asking about recent absence, symptoms of diarrhea or respiratory illness, age, and&#xD;
      grade. Select pupils in a subset of schools will undergo testing for cognition, attention,&#xD;
      and hydration. Select pupils in a subset of school will provide a stool sample for analyses&#xD;
      of helminth infection prior to school-wide de-worming. Data collection will also take place&#xD;
      at the household of select pupils in a subset of schools. The investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      household survey once at the beginning of each school year to assess the range of household&#xD;
      WASH access among pupils in study selected schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collection will occur at the school or the household, will be conducted by trained&#xD;
      local enumerators, and will be stored on password-protected mobile data collection devices.&#xD;
      Data will be uploaded to a password-protected server and will not contain personal&#xD;
      identifying information, but rather a pupil identification . Enumerators will maintain a&#xD;
      separate form that links identifications with names of pupils, which will be kept&#xD;
      confidential. There are no direct benefits other than contribution to general knowledge that&#xD;
      will inform future school WASH projects. There are no risks to participation other than a&#xD;
      small amount of class time missed by pupils, and great efforts will be made to minimize time&#xD;
      outside of class.&#xD;
