  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the best dose of vinblastine that can be given with&#xD;
      a new drug, temsirolimus.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vinblastine is already approved in the treatment of some types of cancer in children and&#xD;
      temsirolimus is already used to treat some adult cancers in Canada. Temsirolimus has been&#xD;
      shown to slow the growth of tumours in animals but it is not known if it can also slow tumour&#xD;
      growth in children. Laboratory studies suggest that giving both vinblastine and temsirolimus&#xD;
      may offer better results than giving vinblastine alone.&#xD;
