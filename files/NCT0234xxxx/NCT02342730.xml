      This pilot clinical trial studies whether obese stage I-II endometrial cancer survivors or&#xD;
      patients with atypical hyperplasia (abnormal cells in the lining of the uterus) would go see&#xD;
      a weight loss specialist if it was recommended by their cancer doctor. Excess body weight or&#xD;
      obesity is one of the most common contributors to (causes of) endometrial cancer. Over&#xD;
      two-thirds of women who have survived endometrial cancer are obese. Complications of obesity,&#xD;
      such as heart disease are often more dangerous than the cancer itself. A weight loss of even&#xD;
      5-10% of excess body weight is associated with improved health. Often, meeting with a doctor&#xD;
      or person who is an expert in weight loss (bariatric specialist) is the best way to lose&#xD;
      weight and keep it off. Endometrial cancer survivors or patients with atypical hyperplasia&#xD;
      who go see a weight loss specialist recommended by their doctor may be able to achieve a&#xD;
      healthier body weight.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I.Our primary outcome for the purposes of the pilot study will be to describe recruitment in&#xD;
      terms of accrual (number of subjects who agree to participate) and compliance (number of&#xD;
      patients who follow up with the obesity referral). This will be described in terms of a&#xD;
      specific number as well as a rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accrual rate is the number of women accrued divided by the number of women approached&#xD;
           for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compliance rate is the number of women who comply with the referral divided by the&#xD;
           number of women accrued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several secondary outcomes will be described:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight loss at 12 &amp; 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obesity interventions implemented (medical, surgical, behavioral, and selfguided)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of obesity related comorbidities at baseline and 12 and 24 months&#xD;
           (myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, stroke, diabetes and hypertension.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer specific outcomes (recurrence rate, progression free survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality otucomes (Overall survival, cause of death)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients with diabetes, we will record the number of diabetic medications required&#xD;
           and the most recent hemoglobin A1C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients with hypertension, we will record the number of antihypertensive medications&#xD;
           required&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will assess the level of functioning, quality of life and symptomatology of women at&#xD;
           baseline, 12 and 24 months using the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-EN24.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary and secondary outcomes will be compared in relation to the timing of the&#xD;
                referral by the gynecologic oncologist (within 1 year or greater than 1 year out&#xD;
                from the endometrial cancer/hyperplasia diagnosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary outcomes of subjects included in this study will be compared to a&#xD;
                historic cohort matches for age, stage and BMI in a 2:1 fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are referred to a weight loss specialist for assistance with weight loss and chart&#xD;
      reviews are performed at baseline and every 3 months for 24 months. Patients complete the&#xD;
      European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (QLQ)-Cancer (C)30 and EORTC-QLQ-Endometrial Cancer (EN)24 at baseline, 12, and&#xD;
      24 months. Patients are also contacted at 90 days to determine whether they have initiated&#xD;
      any weight loss interventions.&#xD;
