      This randomized, double-blind, adaptive design study aims to prove that the&#xD;
      Methylsulfonylmethane study product improves nasal breathing and &quot;stuffy nose&quot; symptoms after&#xD;
      exposure to environmental allergens. Endpoints include percent change in Peak Nasal&#xD;
      Inspiratory Flow, VAS Nasal Symptom Score, number of sneezes and number of used tissues in&#xD;
      response to allergen exposure.&#xD;

      Allergic rhinitis, or nasal allergy, is a common condition throughout the world which affects&#xD;
      both adult and children alike. It is a group of symptoms characterized by red, itchy eyes, a&#xD;
      blocked, itching, runny nose, rhinorrhea, and sneezing. Other reported symptoms include&#xD;
      throat clearing, headaches, facial pain, ear pain, itchy throat and palate, snoring, and&#xD;
      sleep disturbances. Nasal allergy commonly occurs when an individual's immune system reacts&#xD;
      to allergens such as grass, weed, or tree pollens, house dust, mites, mold, and animal dander&#xD;
      [1, 2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic rhinitis is considered to have a substantial effect on the quality of life of a&#xD;
      person. Due to the significant effects it demonstrated when left untreated, the disease has&#xD;
      gone from being labelled simply as a nuisance to being a serious illness that has to be&#xD;
      accounted and medicated. More importantly, such illness was proven to cause asthma and&#xD;
      sinusitis [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the popular nutritional supplements used in treating allergies such as allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis, allergic sinusitis, inhalant allergens, and environmental allergens is&#xD;
      Methylsulfonylmethane [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), also known as dimethyl sulfone and methyl sulfone, is an organic&#xD;
      compound containing sulfur that occurs naturally in a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains,&#xD;
      and animals, including humans [5]. It is also used in treating arthritis pain,&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain, parasitic infections, rosacea, stretch marks, and alopecia among others&#xD;
      [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of MSM was found to be effective in reducing symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis&#xD;
      (SAR). It improves the frequency of upper respiratory signs and symptoms such as runny nose,&#xD;
      nasal obstruction, and paroxysmal sneezing after a week of oral intake. Furthermore, few side&#xD;
      effects were observed, but were not deemed to be of great significance. Thus, MSM was&#xD;
      evaluated as a safe medication for SAR [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likewise, MSM administration in rats displayed no adverse events or mortality. No&#xD;
      pathological lesions or changes in organ weights were observed [4, 7]. It is proved that MSM&#xD;
      is well tolerated in rats and can be a dietary supplement for allergies [4]. In addition,&#xD;
      pregnant rats orally administered with MSM showed no adverse effects as well [8]. MSM can be&#xD;
      rapidly absorbed, well distributed, and completely disposed from the body 120 hours after&#xD;
      initial administration [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, double-blind, adaptive design study aims to prove that the&#xD;
      Methylsulfonylmethane study product improves nasal breathing and &quot;stuffy nose&quot; symptoms after&#xD;
      exposure to environmental allergens. Endpoints include percent change in Peak Nasal&#xD;
      Inspiratory Flow, VAS Nasal Symptom Score, number of sneezes and number of used tissues in&#xD;
      response to allergen exposure.&#xD;
