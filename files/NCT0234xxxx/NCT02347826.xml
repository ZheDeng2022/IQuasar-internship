      243 patients underwent non-surgical coned wires (silhouette soft) facial and cervical lift&#xD;
      between October 2013 and November 2014. The procedures has been executed in our aesthetic&#xD;
      clinics in Milan, Bologna, Turin, Genoa, Rome, Asti, San Remo and Palermo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the 243 patients, 217 were females and 26 males, with age ranging from 19 to 76 years.&#xD;
      103 patients underwent only facial lift, of which 12 only in the frontal area, 61 only on&#xD;
      cheek and malar area, and 30 on both the areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      39 patients underwent only cervical lift, of those 14 by means of appliance of 1 or 2 wires,&#xD;
      25 by means of appliance of more than 2 wires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      101 patients underwent both facial and cervical non surgical lift. We sent to every patient a&#xD;
      email questionnaire1 week, 1 month, 6 months and 1 year after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the questionnaire, patients has been asked to enter a value between 1 and 5 about&#xD;
      subjective satisfaction regarding the aesthetic improvement (ranging from 1, poor, to 5,&#xD;
      excellent), and discomfort related to treatment (ranging from 1, no perceived discomfort, to&#xD;
      5, impossibility to execute working and social activities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data has been analyzed and related to other factors such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of wires applied on each patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  other aesthetic or regenerative medicine treatments executed on the same patient on the&#xD;
           same year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  total expenditure related to aesthetic treatments in the same year&#xD;
