  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, randomized, open-label, two cohorts, 3-way cross-over design&#xD;
      in 36 subjects to assess the oral bioavailability of four new cabotegravir (CAB) sodium salt&#xD;
      tablet formulations relative to the current CAB sodium salt formulation being used in the&#xD;
      phase IIb studies under fasting conditions. All treatments will be administered as single 30&#xD;
      mg doses of CAB. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected during each&#xD;
      treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 10 - 14 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
      drug. Treatment period doses will be separated by a 14 day washout. Participation in this&#xD;
      study will be approximately 12 weeks.&#xD;

             study medication and until after the last dose of study medication and completion of&#xD;
             the follow-up visit. GSK Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding&#xD;
             Pregnancy in FRP are as follows. This list does not apply to FRP with same sex&#xD;
             partners, when this is their preferred and usual lifestyle or for subjects who are and&#xD;
             will continue to be abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse on a long term and&#xD;
             persistent basis. a) Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets the&#xD;
             standard operating procedure (SOP) effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of&#xD;
             failure per year, as stated in the product label. b) Male partner sterilization with&#xD;

             spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository) only for the following 3&#xD;
             situations when there is a very low risk for developmental toxicity: Vaccines;&#xD;
             Monoclonal antibodies when there is no target biology concern; Compounds that have a&#xD;
             complete reproductive toxicology package and have not shown any signal for&#xD;
             developmental toxicity. These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when&#xD;
             used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The&#xD;
             investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use&#xD;
             these methods of contraception. Sexual inactivity by abstinence must be consistent&#xD;
             with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g.&#xD;
             calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not&#xD;
             acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;

             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of clinically significant cardiovascular disease including: a) Exclusion&#xD;
             criteria for screening Electrocardiogram (ECG) (a single repeat is allowed for&#xD;
             eligibility determination) Heart rate: Males: &lt;45 and &gt;100 beats per minute, Females:&#xD;
             &lt;50 and &gt;100 beats per minute; QRS duration: &gt;120 millisecond (msec), QTc interval&#xD;
             (B): &gt;450 msec; b) Evidence of previous myocardial infarction (pathologic Q waves, S-T&#xD;
             segment changes (except early repolarization). c) History/evidence of symptomatic&#xD;
             arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery or&#xD;

             seconds. f) Any significant arrhythmia which, in the opinion of the principal&#xD;
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor, will interfere with the safety for the&#xD;
             individual subject. g) Non-sustained (&gt;=3 consecutive ventricular ectopic beats) or&#xD;
             sustained ventricular tachycardia. NOTES: The QTc is the QT interval corrected for&#xD;
             heart rate according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), and/or&#xD;
             another method, machine-read or manually over-read. The specific formula that will be&#xD;
             used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an individual subject should be&#xD;
             determined prior to initiation of the study. In other words, several different&#xD;
             formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an individual subject and then the&#xD;
             lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the subject from the trial. For&#xD;
             purposes of data analysis, QTcB, QTcF, another QT correction formula, or a composite&#xD;
             of available values of QTc will be used as specified in the Reporting and Analysis&#xD;

             of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80 proof distilled spirits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical&#xD;
             Monitor, contraindicates their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test&#xD;
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
