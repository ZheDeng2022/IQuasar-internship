  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of humanized IgG4&#xD;
      (kappa) isotype monoclonal antibody against CEACAM1 (CM-24 [MK-6018]), administered&#xD;
      intravenously as monotherapy and in combination with Pembrolizumab (MK-3475), in participants&#xD;
      with selected advanced or recurrent malignancies. Escalating multiple doses will be evaluated&#xD;
      to determine the recommended dose for Phase 2 clinical studies.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will be enrolled in a staggered manner starting at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg of CM-24 (MK-6018) and continuing to 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10 mg/kg to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The dose will be escalated after a 6- to 8-week DLT window. Participants will be treated for 12 weeks during Cycle 1. Afterwards participants with clinical benefit and no dose-limiting toxicites (DLTs) are treated for up to 6 cycles.</description>

    <description>Participants will be enrolled at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CM-24 (MK-6018), determined by escalation studies, minus 1 dose level of MK-6018 in combination with a fixed dose of 200 mg pembrolizumab. Participants will be escalated to the RP2D of MK-6018 + 200 mg pembrolizumab. If the RP2D of MK-6018 + 200 mg pembrolizumab is not tolerated, the dose of MK-6018 will be de-escalated but will not fall below 1 mg/kg. Participants will be treated for 6 weeks during Cycle 1 and 2. Afterwards participants with clinical benefit and no DLTs are treated for up to 35 cycles.</description>
