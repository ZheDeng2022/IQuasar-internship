      LAY SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clostridium Difficile (C.difficile) is a bacterial infection that can cause an inflammation&#xD;
      of the colon, (C.difficile colitis). This sometimes progresses to a sudden and severe&#xD;
      illness. The present treatment for fulminant colitis is a total abdominal colectomy with end&#xD;
      ileostomy. This means, a surgery is performed which removes the entire diseased colon. The&#xD;
      end of the small intestine is then brought out to the front of the abdomen as a stoma, and&#xD;
      the patient wears a bag. Despite this invasive treatment, there remains a significant rate of&#xD;
      death (38-50%). In addition, patients have a long recovery after this long operation and many&#xD;
      (67%) will not be fit for a second big operation to remove the stoma (that is to reconnect&#xD;
      the intestine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our study is to determine if a loop ileostomy with colonic lavage will result&#xD;
      in better outcomes. A loop ileostomy is when a loop of small intestine is brought out to the&#xD;
      abdomen and the colon remains in the abdomen. The diseased colon, which is preserved, is&#xD;
      washed with a warm solution (like the solution used in a colonoscopy preparation) and then&#xD;
      treated with an antibiotic via this ileostomy. So far, one study has been done using a loop&#xD;
      ileostomy with colonic lavage. 42 patients who underwent this treatment were compared to 42&#xD;
      patients that underwent the standard of care (complete removal of the colon with end&#xD;
      ileostomy). The 42 patients who underwent a loop ileostomy showed a significant decrease in&#xD;
      rate of death compared to the standard of care. Also, in the study, patients who underwent a&#xD;
      loop ileostomy had a much higher rate of reconnection of the intestine (closing the stoma).&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if a loop ileostomy with colonic lavage can treat&#xD;
      patients with fulminant colitis with less risk of death than the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient is diagnosed with fulminant colitis and meets the eligibility criteria,&#xD;
      he/she will be asked by the surgeon on-call if they would like to participate in this&#xD;
      research study. If they agree to be in this study, they must first sign a consent form. They&#xD;
      may be asked by the surgeon to enroll in either the investigational arm (loop ileostomy) or&#xD;
      the standard of care arm. After surgery, all patients will receive the same standard routine&#xD;
      care. During the hospital stay, information will be taken from their chart for purposes of&#xD;
      the study. Routine follow up visits with their surgeon will be at 2, 3, 6, and 12 months&#xD;
      after surgery. If the patient decides to be in the study, the patient will be expected to&#xD;
      complete all the follow up study visits. The patient will not be required to do anything&#xD;
      extra or have any extra tests if they decide to be in the study at any of these visits.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study purpose and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Specific Aim and Hypothesis: The objective of this study is to determine if loop&#xD;
           ileostomy and colonic irrigation reduces 30 day all-cause mortality compared to the&#xD;
           current standard of care for fulminant Clostridium difficile colitis (FCDC), total&#xD;
           abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy. We hypothesize that loop ileostomy and colonic&#xD;
           irrigation (ileostomy) will significantly reduce 30 day all-cause mortality compared to&#xD;
           total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy (TAC). Furthermore, we hypothesize that&#xD;
           this intervention will reduce 30-day morbidity, 90 day all-cause mortality and improve&#xD;
           gastrointestinal restoration rates compared to TAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. Significance: With the emergence of a hypervirulent toxin-producing NAP1/027 strain&#xD;
           of C. difficile in 2003, C.difficile colitis has become an increasingly common problem&#xD;
           (1). Up to 10% of patients with C.difficile infection progress to FCDC with a mortality&#xD;
           of 36-80% (1-3). The standard of care for FCDC is a timely TAC; however despite this&#xD;
           intervention mortality rates remain high (38-55%) (2,3). The standard of care for FCDC&#xD;
           is a TAC. This includes end ileostomy, which becomes permanent in over 65% of patients&#xD;
           as reversal necessitates an extensive operation (5). Neal et al. proposed a new surgical&#xD;
           approach for FCDC which includes creation of a loop ileostomy, intraoperative colonic&#xD;
           lavage with warmed polyethylene glycol via the ileostomy and postoperative antegrade&#xD;
           instillation of vancomycin flushes into the diseased colon via the ileostomy. In a&#xD;
           single-institution series, this alternative approach for 42 patients was compared to 42&#xD;
           historical controls that underwent TAC (4). While demographics and severity of illness&#xD;
           in the control and intervention groups were comparable, the 30 day mortality was&#xD;
           significantly decreased in ileostomy compared to TAC groups (19% vs. 50%). To date, this&#xD;
           is the only report of this new alternative procedure for FCDC. Neal et al.'s work is a&#xD;
           single center, single surgeon series of loop ileostomy cases compared to a historical&#xD;
           series of patients treated with TAC. To further investigate their promising results and&#xD;
           innovative treatment, we propose a multi-center national (Canadian) prospective cohort&#xD;
           study for the evaluation of this intervention compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Description of study population&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Basic study design: This is a national, multi-center prospective cohort study to&#xD;
           evaluate loop ileostomy and colonic lavage to the standard of care, total abdominal&#xD;
           colectomy with end ileostomy. This study will consist of a prospective registry (from&#xD;
           2014 to 2017) with 2 prospective arms: the loop ileostomy group and the control (TAC)&#xD;
           group. In addition, we will concurrently perform a retrospective chart review at all&#xD;
           participating sites from (from 2010 to 2014) to serve as a third group of historical&#xD;
           controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study population and assembly of patients: Subjects will be drawn from 20 participating&#xD;
           adult, tertiary Canadian hospitals. All patients with Clostridium difficile infection&#xD;
           who are being evaluated for surgery are eligible for this study. Subject identification&#xD;
           will be carried out by the attending surgeon on call, eligibility will be evaluated, and&#xD;
           patients will be approached for study participation. Consent for the study will be&#xD;
           obtained from the subject or a legally authorized representative (the legal&#xD;
           representative must be a court-appointment mandatory, curator or tutor). Vulnerable&#xD;
           patients with pre-existing incapacity to consent and who do not have a legally&#xD;
           authorized representative will be excluded. In contrast, some subjects may have a late&#xD;
           presentation of FCDC and therefore may lack the physical and mental capacity to provide&#xD;
           an independent informed consent. At this time, the consent for the study will be&#xD;
           obtained by the next of kin (next of kin will be defined as in Civil Code of Québec).&#xD;
           When and if the subject recovers, consent will be obtained by him/her at that time.&#xD;
           Enrolment into the trial will be in accordance with the Civil Code of Québec (articles&#xD;
           15, 20, 21) (6) QC notation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As this disease process and surgery only occur on an emergency basis, the surgeon&#xD;
           on-call (pre-determined by each hospital's call schedule) will assess the patient and&#xD;
           he/she will invite the patient to enrol in the study. The decision to undergo loop&#xD;
           ileostomy or TAC will be left up to the discretion of the surgeon and the patient. In&#xD;
           either case, the patient will be will be given the option to enrol in the study either&#xD;
           in the investigational arm (loop ileostomy) or the control arm (TAC). We will&#xD;
           concurrently perform a retrospective chart review at all participating sites from&#xD;
           01/2010 to 01/2014 to serve as a historical comparative control group (180 patients&#xD;
           estimated). These patients will be identified from hospital databases by discharge and&#xD;
           procedure codes. Chart review will be conducted using the same inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
           criterias used for the prospective patients. The stable nature and incidence of&#xD;
           C.difficile infection in Canada since 2009 and the well-established standard surgical&#xD;
           approach (TAC) for FCDC (6) justify the comparison to a historical control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample size and how it was determined&#xD;
&#xD;
           We estimate that 60 colectomies for FCDC will be performed per year (at 20 institutions)&#xD;
           (5). Neal et al. report an absolute risk reduction of 31% in 30 day mortality. However,&#xD;
           given that this was a single surgeon experience and that our current 30-day mortality is&#xD;
           38% (5) (in contrast to 50% for TAC in Neal et al.'s series), we anticipate an absolute&#xD;
           risk reduction of 22%. For this reduction, with a type I error rate of 0.05, a power of&#xD;
           80%, a 1:1 control to intervention ratio, 63 patients are required in each arm, and are&#xD;
           estimated to be accrued over 2 years. We will also cluster by surgeon and institution,&#xD;
           however as each surgeon and institution are only expected to contribute very few&#xD;
           (approximately 1-3) cases, we are estimating a small intraclass correlation coefficient&#xD;
           and design effect close to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Design and description of methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Exposures and their measurement: The exposure is the treatment strategy. The&#xD;
           intervention being evaluated is loop ileostomy with intra-operative colonic lavage.&#xD;
           Ileostomy and colonic lavage is not considered standard of care at our institutions.&#xD;
           Patients managed with ileostomy and colonic lavage who do not respond as expected may be&#xD;
           converted to TAC, intra- or post-operatively, at the discretion of the surgeon. These&#xD;
           patients will be analyzed in the ileostomy group (similar to an intention to treat&#xD;
           analysis) since this was the original treatment strategy assigned. A subgroup analysis&#xD;
           of these patients who had to be converted to TAC, and their impact on the overall&#xD;
           results, will also be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. Confounders and their measurement: Fortunately, FCDC is managed on an emergency&#xD;
           basis only; thus the surgeon on-call (based on the on-call schedule) is the one who will&#xD;
           care for the patient and the patient does not choose their surgeon, nor is the surgeon&#xD;
           choosing their patient. This eliminates any referral bias, that is, surgeon assignment&#xD;
           can be considered random and there is no bias for different surgeons to be treating&#xD;
           different types of patients. All general and colorectal surgeons are equally qualified&#xD;
           to make the clinical decision to operate for FCDC (inclusion criteria for the study) and&#xD;
           to perform the both proposed operations, TAC and loop ileostomy. However, individual&#xD;
           surgeon bias may exist towards one procedure. This will be examined by a short&#xD;
           qualitative questionnaire requesting the rationale for the choice of operation. Due to&#xD;
           the infrequency of the operation for FCDC and the need to recruit multiple participating&#xD;
           surgeons, each surgeon may only contribute 1-3 patients. Variability in individual and&#xD;
           institution clinical practice will be accounted for by clustering by surgeon and&#xD;
           institution in the analysis. Institution and surgeon variability may introduce may&#xD;
           reflect differences in technical skill, hospital infrastructure, degree of adoption of&#xD;
           early surgical consultation for FCDC, and operating room availability. Due to the&#xD;
           severity of FCDC requiring surgery and the critically ill nature that patients reach&#xD;
           prior to surgical consultation, the patient population entered into the trial will be&#xD;
           relatively homogenous. This remarkable homogeneity within the patient population&#xD;
           presenting for surgical management of FCDC was observed in our hospitals (2,5) and in&#xD;
           Neal et al.'s study (4). Nonetheless, we will anticipate and account for confounding&#xD;
           patient factors in the analysis including older age, immunosuppression, elevated pre-op&#xD;
           white blood cell count, lactate, intubation and vasopressors (2,3,5). Earlier time to&#xD;
           surgery is associated with improved survival and may also be a confounder as surgeons&#xD;
           may be more inclined to offer loop ileostomy and lavage earlier than they would offer&#xD;
           TAC given its minimally invasive nature. Similarly due to the new intervention's less&#xD;
           invasive nature, older patients with co-morbidities may be more inclined to consent to&#xD;
           surgery than they would be if offered TAC; introducing confounding by indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Definition of end-points&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary outcome is 30 day all-cause mortality. This binary outcome is the most&#xD;
           suitable and reported outcome for FCDC. The secondary outcomes are: 1) 30 day morbidity,&#xD;
           a composite binary outcome to include all Clavien-Dindo grade 2-5 (serious)&#xD;
           complications (6) which also includes death (Clavien grade 5); 2) 90 day all-cause&#xD;
           mortality (binary) in order to capture those who survive the first month but have a long&#xD;
           and complicated hospitalization with poor outcome; 3) restoration of gastrointestinal&#xD;
           continuity by ileostomy closure (binary) which serves as a surrogate for excellent&#xD;
           recovery; 4) length of hospital stay, a censored outcome, using time to discharge as the&#xD;
           outcome censoring by death (patients who die during hospitalization will contribute&#xD;
           towards length of stay for the days that they survived).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Measurements and study instruments (including questionnaires, data collection forms,&#xD;
           etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prospective data collection will be performed during the hospitalization daily for 30&#xD;
           days, and then patients will be followed at 3, 6 and 12 months post-operatively with a&#xD;
           phone follow-up . If these time points coincide with a visit to the surgeon's office,&#xD;
           the data can be collected at that time. The patient will not be required to do any extra&#xD;
           tests or hospital visits if they participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Data analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
           The distribution of each measured variable will be assessed graphically and with&#xD;
           diagnostics. Descriptive variables and confounders will be compared between ileostomy&#xD;
           and TAC groups using two sample t-tests, Wilcoxon rank sum, and fisher exact tests for&#xD;
           normal, right-skewed and categorical variables, respectively. A logistic regression&#xD;
           model predicting exposure (TAC vs. ileostomy) will be created with potential confounders&#xD;
           outlined above (surgeon and patient factors) and a propensity score will be created for&#xD;
           each individual. A logistic regression model will then be fit for the main outcome, with&#xD;
           the main predictor being intervention, and the propensity score included as a second&#xD;
           co-variate to control for confounding. Alternatively, we may choose to match on the&#xD;
           propensity score. The impact of ileostomy on mortality will be expressed as an odds&#xD;
           ratio (95% CI). Secondary analyses (considered exploratory) will compare 30 day&#xD;
           morbidity, 90 day all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay and rate of GI&#xD;
           restoration for ileostomy and TAC. A subgroup analysis will be performed for ileostomy&#xD;
           patients who were converted to TAC. The historical control arm will be analyzed&#xD;
           separately and should they be similar to both groups will be compared to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Recruitment procedures including copies of advertisements;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject identification will be carried out by the attending surgeon on call, eligibility will&#xD;
      be evaluated, and patients will be approached for study participation. A consent for the&#xD;
      study will be obtained from the subject or a legally authorized representative. As this&#xD;
      disease process and surgery only occur on an emergency basis, the surgeon on-call&#xD;
      (pre-determined by each hospital's call schedule) will assess the patient and he/she will&#xD;
      invite the patient to enrol in the study. The decision to undergo loop ileostomy or TAC will&#xD;
      be left up to the discretion of the surgeon and the patient. In either case, the patient will&#xD;
      be will be given the option to enrol in the study either in the investigational arm (loop&#xD;
      ileostomy) or the control arm (TAC). The patient will be given a consent form as soon as they&#xD;
      are identified as a potential candidate by the surgeon-on-call. Once the patient and/or the&#xD;
      legal representative have signed the consent form, the patient will be considered accrued to&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details on confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data will be linked to a hospital ID number and a study ID number. Once the patient&#xD;
      has completed the follow-up period, their hospital ID number will be removed such that they&#xD;
      are de-identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be maintained in a secure web-based registry (Redcap). This will be used only&#xD;
      by the research team and will always be accessed from a password protected hospital computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be kept in a de-identified manner for 5 years following study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted according to ethical principles stated in the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki (2013), ethics approval will be obtained before initiating study. Also, consent&#xD;
      forms will take into consideration the well-being, free-will and respect of the participants,&#xD;
      including respect of privacy.&#xD;
