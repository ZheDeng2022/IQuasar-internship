  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research project is to investigate the ability to affect cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD) risk factors through a novel, easily implemented functional food-based&#xD;
      approach. The goal of the proposed project is to evaluate the effect of a range of&#xD;
      proprietary products specifically formulated to deliver convenient pre-packaged&#xD;
      condition-specific foods to positively impact blood cholesterol levels in statin intolerant&#xD;
      and/or statin unwilling participants. The specific aim of this project is to evaluate the&#xD;
      changes in serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, triglyceride (TG) glucose,&#xD;
      insulin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentrations over a 4 week regimen&#xD;
      using healthy tasty foods which are self-selected by a statin intolerant patient group.&#xD;
