  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      National guidelines recommend 15-20% weight loss for severe and complicated obesity. Weight&#xD;
      loss maintenance can be achieved in around 33% of patients at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BEYOND study will administer Counterweight Plus; a nutritionally replete Total Diet&#xD;
      Replacement Plan (TDR) of 800+ Calories followed by structured Food Reintroduction, and&#xD;
      Weight Loss Maintenance programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will incorporate three work packages with the aim of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. examining changes in body composition with substantial (target &gt;15kg) non-surgical&#xD;
           weight loss (work package 1, WP1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. characterizing the metabolic adaptations during weight loss and maintenance (work&#xD;
           package 2, WP2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. examining Rescue Packages as a method of weight re-gain prevention (work package 3,&#xD;
           WP3).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive the Counterweight Plus dietary intervention. This consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-20 weeks 800+ calories/day Total Diet Replacement Plan, followed by&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-8 weeks Food Reintroduction, followed by&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  up to 104 weeks Weight Loss Maintenance, based on maintaining daily calorie restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo the following investigations at baseline and at regular&#xD;
      intervals throughout the study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  height (baseline only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whole body MRI scans: total-body skeletal muscle volume and fat mass will be measured&#xD;
           using whole-body multi-slice MRI (baseline and 12 weeks only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  functional assessment: completion of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities&#xD;
           Arthritis Index (WOMAC) (baseline and 12 weeks only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gait and muscle strength assessment: biomechanical gait analysis will be carried out&#xD;
           using an 8 camera VICON system during flat walking to determine maximum flexion and&#xD;
           extension moments for both limbs and maximum adduction and abduction moments. Muscle&#xD;
           strength will also be directly measured of both the upper (grip strength) and lower&#xD;
           (quadriceps and hamstrings) limb using a dynamometer and myometer (baseline and 12 weeks&#xD;
           only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anthropometric measurement: body weight; waist, hip, thigh, arm and calf circumferences&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  indirect calorimetry: resting metabolic rate will be measured by a computerised&#xD;
           open-circuit ventilated hood system&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fasting blood sampling: for measurement of HbA1C, lipid profile, leptin, thyroid&#xD;
           hormones&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gut microbiota analysis from faecal samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Binge Eating Disorder and Quality of Life (EQ-5D) questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive regular support/advice from a research dietician/ nutritionist&#xD;
      during the two year study period.&#xD;
