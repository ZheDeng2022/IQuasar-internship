  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 open-label study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a&#xD;
      personalized polyepitope DNA vaccine strategy. The personalized polyepitope DNA vaccines will&#xD;
      be formulated as naked plasmid DNA vaccines. The hypothesis of this study is that&#xD;
      personalized polyepitope DNA vaccines will be safe for human administration and capable of&#xD;
      generating measurable CD8 T cell responses to mutant tumor-specific antigens.&#xD;

    <measure>Safety of the personalized polyepitope DNA vaccine strategy, measured by both clinical observation and laboratory evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of plasmid DNA safety will include both clinical observation and laboratory evaluation. Safety will be closely monitored after injection with eight or more clinical and laboratory assessments in the first 24 weeks of the trial. The following parameters will be assessed following vaccination:&#xD;
Local signs and symptoms&#xD;
Systemic signs and symptoms&#xD;
Laboratory evaluations, including blood counts and serum chemistries&#xD;
Adverse, and serious adverse events</description>

    <measure>Immunogenicity of the personalized polyepitope DNA vaccine strategy, measured by ELISPOT analysis, a surrogate for CD8 T cell function, and multiparametric flow cytometry</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity will be measured by ELISPOT analysis, a surrogate for CD8 T cell function, and multiparametric flow cytometry. In both assays the quantity and quality of antigen-specific CD8 T cells is determined; the ELISPOT analysis is based on measuring the frequencies of IFN-γ producing T cells in response to polyepitope antigen, whereas the multiparametric flow cytometry assesses phenotypic as well as functional characteristics of epitope-specific CD8 T cells. In the proposed study, blood samples will be collected at multiple time points (n=8) and PBMC isolated and cryopreserved. Upon completion of the vaccination protocol, all samples will be analyzed simultaneously in order to minimize assay-to-assay variation.</description>

             complicated by study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Individuals in whom a skinfold measurement of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue&#xD;
             for eligible injection sites (left and right medial deltoid region) exceeds 40 mm.&#xD;
