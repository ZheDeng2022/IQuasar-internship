  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this study protocol is to develop and test a culturally sensitive,&#xD;
      community-based intervention, ESENCIAL Para Vivir (Essential for Life) to promote weight loss&#xD;
      and diabetes prevention among overweight or obese Latina immigrants. We chose to focus on&#xD;
      Latinas because Latinas are at especially high risk for developing diabetes and currently&#xD;
      there are not Spanish programs available in our area that provide education about weight&#xD;
      management and diabetes prevention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 8-week weight loss program, ESENCIAL Para Vivir (Essential for Life), is comprised of 6&#xD;
      groups sessions and 2 individual sessions delivered by a bilingiual, bi-cultural Community&#xD;
      Health Advisor. All sessions are interactive with activities that build on educative content&#xD;
      and most contain an interactive DVD component. We propose an innovative approach that will&#xD;
      employ the DVD in tandem with our education sessions delivered by a Community Health Advisor&#xD;
      to maximize buy-in from participants as well as provide access to community health leaders&#xD;
      (medical professionals - endocrinologists, internists, nutritionists). Participants will be&#xD;
      over 19 years of age, self-identifying as Hispanic women without diabetes, not pregnant or&#xD;
      have given birth within the previous six months. The participants will be recruited from&#xD;
      Jefferson County through community agencies and organization. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      and screened with an initial contact sheet to ensure that they meet our criteria, then they&#xD;
      will be consented and complete baseline measurements. At the completion of the program,&#xD;
      participants will repeat measures done at baseline, and 6 months post program completion.&#xD;
