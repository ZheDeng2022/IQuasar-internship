  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will study the impact of Irreversible electroporation (IRE) on immune response&#xD;
      in patients diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancers smaller than 5.0 cm. It will&#xD;
      profile the immune response to IRE of unresectable pancreatic cancers. The intra-tumoral and&#xD;
      systemic immune response to IRE will be determined and compared to pre-ablated pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer specimens and historical control specimens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty patients with histologically confirmed locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      (≤5.0cm) will undergo percutaneous irreversible electroporation of the tumor using CT and&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance. Blood will be drawn for research before IRE. Blood and tissue samples&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After IRE, patients will be carefully monitored and systemic immune responses are registered.&#xD;
      Follow-up will consist of frequent CT and MRI scanning, as well as serum CA19.9 tumor marker&#xD;
      and quality of life questionnaires and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that IRE in the pancreas will induce good symptom palliation&#xD;
      without causing severe complications as well as perfect systemic immune response.&#xD;

    <description>Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a new, minimal-invasive image-guided treatment method for tumors not amenable for surgical resection or thermal ablation, due to vicinity near vital structures such as vessels and bile ducts. With IRE, multiple electrical pulses are applied to tumorous tissue. These pulses alter the existing transmembrane potential of the cell membranes, and create 'nanopores', after which the cell dies through loss of homeostasis.</description>
