      The purpose of this study is to look for markers of how Ra-223 improves the lives of men with&#xD;
      prostate cancer. This study makes use of Ra-223 in the standard FDA-approved way, but adds&#xD;
      non-standard testing in an attempt to gain insight about how the drug works and how best to&#xD;
      track patients who are receiving the drug.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is designed to examine a treatment strategy that is standard but still&#xD;
      relatively new. Ra-223 consists of a series of six infusions given once every 4 weeks. It was&#xD;
      FDA approved in 2013 for the treatment of prostate cancer that has spread to bone and has&#xD;
      grown despite ADT (&quot;hormonal therapy&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ra-223 was approved because it was shown to improve the length of the lives of the men with&#xD;
      prostate cancer who received it. Despite that important benefit, it is not known to improve&#xD;
      other standard markers of prostate cancer such as PSA blood tests (a blood marker that is&#xD;
      used to track cancer activity in men who have prostate cancer) and standard imaging scans&#xD;
      such as bone scans and computed tomography (CT) scans. If participants and their doctors do&#xD;
      not have good markers of whether or not the cancer is responding to therapy, it is harder to&#xD;
      make decisions about whether to continue that therapy. This is a current problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study makes use of Ra-223 in the standard FDA-approved way, but adds non-standard&#xD;
      testing in an attempt to gain insight about how the drug works and how best to track patients&#xD;
      who are receiving the drug.&#xD;
