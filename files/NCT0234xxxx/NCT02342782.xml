    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of yttrium Y 90 basiliximab when&#xD;
      given together with standard combination chemotherapy before a stem cell transplant in&#xD;
      treating patients with mature T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Radioactive substances linked to&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium Y 90 basiliximab, can bind to cancer cells and give&#xD;
      off radiation which may help kill cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      carmustine, cytarabine, etoposide, and melphalan (BEAM), work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Giving yttrium Y 90 basiliximab and chemotherapy before a stem&#xD;
      cell transplant may help kill any cancer cells that are in the body and help make room in the&#xD;
      patient's bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow. Stem cells that were&#xD;
      collected from the patient's blood and stored before treatment are later returned to the&#xD;
      patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if administration of 90Y-basiliximab/DOTA (yttrium Y 90 basiliximab), when&#xD;
      given in combination with standard dose BEAM, as conditioning for autologous hematopoietic&#xD;
      cell transplant (AHCT), is safe, by evaluation of toxicities, including type, frequency,&#xD;
      severity, attribution, time course and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 90Y-basiliximab/DOTA when given in&#xD;
      combination with standard dose BEAM, in patients with T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T-NHL) as&#xD;
      part of conditioning for AHCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize and evaluate hematologic recovery in terms of neutrophil and platelet&#xD;
      engraftment time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate radiation doses to the whole body and normal organs through serial imaging&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate overall survival, progression-free survival, non-relapse mortality and&#xD;
      cumulative incidence of relapse/progression at 100-days (non-relapse mortality [NRM] only),&#xD;
      1-year and 2-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 basiliximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive yttrium Y 90 basiliximab intravenously (IV) on days -21 and -14, carmustine&#xD;
      IV over 1-2 hours on days -7 and -6, cytarabine IV twice daily (BID) on days -5 to -2,&#xD;
      etoposide IV BID on days -5 to -2, and melphalan IV on day -1. Patients undergo autologous&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 100, and 180 days and 1,&#xD;
      1.5, and 2 years.&#xD;
