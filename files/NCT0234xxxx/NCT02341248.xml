    <textblock>
      Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) is the liquid diet given to children with active Crohn's&#xD;
      Disease (CD). EEN has previously been shown to induce changes in major bacterial metabolites&#xD;
      and dominant bacterial species which are more profound in children that clinically improve.&#xD;
      This study aims to determine whether it is possible to maintain these bacterial changes with&#xD;
      prolonged supplementary enteral nutrition (SEN) while returning to normal diet and if this&#xD;
      can reduce risk of subsequent relapse for children with CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New technologies will allow measurement of a broad range of bacteria and metabolites, to test&#xD;
      if the clinical response to EEN and changes in gut inflammation are associated with bacterial&#xD;
      composition and chemical products; and if maintenance of changes using SEN reduces the risk&#xD;
      of relapse over a 12 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will aim to recruit all potential Crohn's disease children coming to a tertiary&#xD;
      paediatric centre for colonoscopy. Once consented, an initial blood, urine and faecal sample&#xD;
      will be requested along with 8 mucosal biopsies during the routine endoscopy session. If&#xD;
      diagnosed with CD, and if the clinician prescribes treatment with EEN, an additional blood&#xD;
      sample will be requested at the end of EEN, and 5 faecal and urine samples spread over 12&#xD;
      months; as well as some dietary information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be collected from up to 42 children with CD and 42 age- and sex-matched healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. Initial samples taken from children who were not diagnosed with CD will be&#xD;
      compared with CD samples to look for potential metabolic disease markers. Characterisation of&#xD;
      faecal bacteria and metabolites in both faeces and urine; as well as measurement of blood&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers will be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The null hypothesis is that the clinical response to exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) and&#xD;
      reduction of colonic inflammatory markers are not associated with a characteristic bacterial&#xD;
      taxonomy (composition) and metabolites (functionality); and that maintenance of any bacterial&#xD;
      changes with supplementary enteral nutrition (SEN), while returning to habitual diet, does&#xD;
      not reduce the risk of disease relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will build on previous work by looking at differences in both the gut&#xD;
      bacteria (faecal and mucosal) and bacterial metabolic activity at different stages of disease&#xD;
      activity. Changes in bacterial composition between disease groups will be examined; between&#xD;
      Crohn's disease children on different treatments; and between different sites in the gut.&#xD;
      Crohn's disease biomarkers in faeces and urine will also be assessed by analysing bacterial&#xD;
      metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to a total of 42 children with Crohn's Disease will be recruited. 42 healthy children will&#xD;
      also be recruited to provide a faecal and urine sample, to show the normal variety of gut&#xD;
      bacteria and metabolites in healthy children for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children who underwent colonoscopy but did not have Crohn's disease will be used as a&#xD;
      comparison group to try and identify Crohn's disease bacterial signatures from faeces and&#xD;
      urine, and as a non-Crohn's disease control group for comparison of mucosal biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Three groups of children will participate in this study. A. Children undergoing&#xD;
      endoscopic investigations (colonoscopy) for colonic inflammation including Crohn's disease&#xD;
      [children who are found not to have Crohn's disease will not participate in the follow up&#xD;
      aspect (during treatment with EEN) of this study].&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Previously diagnosed patients with Crohn's disease due to start an 8 week standard course&#xD;
      of treatment with EEN due to disease flare up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Healthy children unrelated to Crohn's disease patients will be used as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups A and B: an initial blood, urine, faecal sample followed by 5 further faecal and urine&#xD;
      samples over 12 months; and dietary information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Group A will also have 8 mucosal biopsies taken during routine endoscopy]. During treatment&#xD;
      with EEN (clinical decision), an additional blood sample will be requested during routine&#xD;
      blood sampling at start and end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: 1 urine and faecal sample will be requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All groups will have height, weight and grip strength measured at baseline. Participant&#xD;
      receiving EEN will have this repeated 60 days after start of treatment and 60 days after end&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed Methods Preliminary health check by means of a short health questionnaire - basic&#xD;
      health information, age, any medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucosal samples: in newly diagnosed patients having a colonoscopy for diagnostic purposes, an&#xD;
      additional 6 mucosal biopsy samples; 2 from the terminal ileum when possible, 2 from the&#xD;
      proximal colon and 2 from the distal colon will be taken (14-16 are collected at normal&#xD;
      colonoscopy). An additional 2 biopsy samples will also be collected from the duodenum during&#xD;
      upper endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary information: habitual dietary intake and eating patterns assessed using validated&#xD;
      Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ); a 5 step multiple pass 24 hour dietary recall&#xD;
      questionnaire for data on actual diet at time of faecal and urine sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEN compliance (groups A&amp;B only): completion of short EEN compliance questionnaire at 28 day&#xD;
      and 56 day time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication and Disease History: information on disease activity, medication and medical&#xD;
      history collected from medical notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lab Assays Bacterial diversity: The gut bacterial diversity and composition from stool&#xD;
      samples will be measured using molecular techniques such as quantitative polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (PCR) from bacterial ribosomal DNA and next generation sequencing (metagenomics).&#xD;
      These techniques will also be used to look at the composition of bacteria associated with&#xD;
      mucosal tissue biopsies. Changes in overall gut bacteria composition using standard numerical&#xD;
      indices will be measured across the 6 faecal samples collected over the 12 month period, as&#xD;
      well as between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial metabolism: A large number of different products from bacterial metabolism, such as&#xD;
      short chain fatty acids, sulphide, and ammonia will be measured using a range of techniques&#xD;
      including gas chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) (metabolomics).&#xD;
      Faecal pH, a marker of bacterial fermentation, will also be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease markers: Other disease markers and metabolites such as faecal calprotectin, will be&#xD;
      measured from faecal samples .&#xD;
