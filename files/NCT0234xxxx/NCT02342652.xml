    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 stage study design with 2&#xD;
      multiple dose cohorts of healthy elderly subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be in a 3:1 ratio to ensure that 6 subjects receive ASLAN003 and 2&#xD;
      subjects receive placebo in a fed condition. Up to a maximum of 16 subjects (two cohorts) are&#xD;
      planned in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomised to receive ASLAN003 100mg or matched placebo once daily for 14&#xD;
      consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 8 subjects have completed 14 days of dosing, the Investigator, and the Sponsor will&#xD;
      review the available safety and PK data from all subjects before deciding to proceed with&#xD;
      stage 2 of the study. In Stage 2, a further 8 subjects will be randomised to receive ASLAN003&#xD;
      100mg or matched placebo once daily for 14 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a screening visit that must fall within 28 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
      Investigational Product (IP) for both parts, subjects who qualify (according to the&#xD;
      protocol-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria) will be admitted to the study centre on&#xD;
      Day -1. Dose administration for each study part will commence on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will stay at the study centre throughout the 14 days of dosing (D-1 toD15). Full&#xD;
      PK blood collection will be done on D1, D8 and D14, and single trough PK blood collection on&#xD;
      D4 and D11. All subjects will be discharged on D15 and asked to return for single PK blood&#xD;
      sampling on D16, D17, D18, and D19 (+5days post-dose), with full outpatient visit including&#xD;
      safety follow up and lab test on Day 19.&#xD;
