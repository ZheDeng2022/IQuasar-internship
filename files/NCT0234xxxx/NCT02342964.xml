    <textblock>
      Non-invasive methods of the quantification of fibrosis may help to assess the development of&#xD;
      fibrosis at a specific moment of the evolution of the disease, in the order to decide the&#xD;
      initiation of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid which may slow the progression to hepatic&#xD;
      cirrhosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FibroTest,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ultrasound impulse elastography, Fibroscan (FS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound Elastography by ShearWave (SWE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). The purpose of this study is to assess the&#xD;
           contribution of these methods in the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis during the evolution&#xD;
           of the cystic fibrosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of hepatobiliary disease in cystic fibrosis in the first 10 years of life is&#xD;
      2.5 to 1.8 / 100 patient-years, significantly decreasing during the second decade; generally&#xD;
      30-40% of children develop hepatic disease before 12 years. However, the hepatobiliary damage&#xD;
      varies in its clinical and histological expression. The typical histological appearance of&#xD;
      the liver is the focal biliary cirrhosis (or fibrosis) characterized by a heterogeneous&#xD;
      distribution of portal fibrosis in the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications of cirrhosis are responsible for 2.5% of deaths in patients with cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis and represent the second cause of death after lung disease if we exclude deaths&#xD;
      secondary to lung transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of hepatic disease at an early stage of development and the assessment of the&#xD;
      progression of fibrosis are so difficult in the absence of sensitive and specific&#xD;
      non-invasive diagnostic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis is an important topic of study in recent years,&#xD;
      because of the emergence of biological methods and quantitative elastography methods using&#xD;
      ultrasound or Magnetic Resonance Imagery (MRI) and allowing quantification of the hepatic&#xD;
      elasticity, which is assumed to be a reflection of fibrosis. The advantages of these methods&#xD;
      are numerous:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The assessment of wider hepatic parenchyma then hepatic biopsy, allowing overcome the&#xD;
           sampling bias&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Painless and non-invasive methods for the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simple to make&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not require hospitalization and can be performed as outpatient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediately known results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can be repeated as often as necessary during the patient's follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lower cost, morbidity and mortality compared to hepatic biopsy. Several non-invasive&#xD;
           methods of fibrosis diagnosis have been studied in adults primarily for viral diseases&#xD;
           and helped to limit the indications of hepatic biopsy. However, no method is now&#xD;
           validated for the early diagnosis of hepatic disease and monitoring of children with&#xD;
           cystic fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to assess the contribution of FibroTest, the ultrasound&#xD;
      impulse elastography, Fibroscan (FS), the ultrasound elastography by ShearWave (SWE) and&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE ) in the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis in cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are following :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the correlations between the fibrosis quantitative results obtained through the&#xD;
           four techniques of measurement and the matches between the results of four techniques&#xD;
           using the standards available at t0 and after a year (t1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the correlations between clinical, biological and ultrasound endpoints of hepatic&#xD;
           disease and various non-invasive measurement methods of fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the area under the ROC curve of the different tests and the diagnostic&#xD;
           performance tests using analytical methods without gold standard by classifying the&#xD;
           children into two groups: the presence of advanced fibrosis (stages F2 to F4 ) or not&#xD;
           (F0 and F1 stages), contracting by a committee according to the results of any biopsy,&#xD;
           clinical, laboratory and ultrasound endpoints independent on the tests.&#xD;
