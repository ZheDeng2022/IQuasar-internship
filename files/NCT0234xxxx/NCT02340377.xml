      The primary objective of the proposed study is to determine the use of a wireless method to&#xD;
      monitor and record core body temperature during a Whole Body Hyperthermia treatment, compared&#xD;
      to an indwelling rectal thermometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is intended to study the differences between a rectal temperature probe and an&#xD;
      approved wireless and indigestible thermometer during a WBH session. The current standard in&#xD;
      monitoring core body temperature is the usage of an indwelling rectal thermometer. Many&#xD;
      patients and potential study subjects, however, decline receiving the treatment, due to the&#xD;
      discomfort of using this measuring method and a wireless measuring device would open the&#xD;
      possibility for those patients to receive a treatment. The primary endpoint for example of a&#xD;
      treatment for MDD is currently defined with reaching a rectal temperature of 38.5 C. However,&#xD;
      due to the proximity of the probe to the body's surface, the core body temperature will vary&#xD;
      from the rectal temperature and the comparison between the two methods with a validation of&#xD;
      the wireless device is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will monitor subject's physiological outcome from a single Whole Body&#xD;
      Hyperthermia treatment in an open fashion (no placebo/control condition). This study will&#xD;
      include safety assessments 7 days several days prior to or same day as the WBH, and include&#xD;
      follow-up assessments 1 day and 1 week later.&#xD;

      This protocol will allow for the evaluation of a wireless measuring device for core body&#xD;
      temperature and a comparison to the data taken with a rectal thermometer, during a Whole Body&#xD;
      Hyperthermia (WBH) in various subject populations. The primary objective of the proposed&#xD;
      study is a potential change from wired core body temperature measurement with a rectal&#xD;
      thermometer to an indigestible thermometer with wireless technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent standard for measuring core body temperature during WBH procedures is the use of&#xD;
      an indwelling rectal thermometer to constantly monitor the temperature for safety and for&#xD;
      research reasons. Experiences from different clinics and research groups, including ours,&#xD;
      show a high drop-out rate of potential study participants and patients, because of the&#xD;
      discomfort of self-inserting a rectal thermometer for the treatment in a Whole-Body&#xD;
      Hyperthermia. A wireless and reliable measuring technology would open this treatment for&#xD;
      participants, who are declining their participation due to the indwelling thermometer. This&#xD;
      device will exit the subject's body via bowel movement 1-5 days following ingestion and will&#xD;
      not be reused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the proximity of the indwelling thermometer to the surface of the body, the&#xD;
      temperature does not reflect the real core body temperature and preliminary data, taking by&#xD;
      our group, suggest a significant, but stable difference between core body temperatures&#xD;
      measured with an indigestible device, compared to the temperature taken with the rectal&#xD;
      probe. WBH treatments, currently studied by our group at the University of Arizona, are of&#xD;
      mild nature and the constant infra-red heating is stopped, as soon as a patient reaches the&#xD;
      rectal temperature of 38.5 C. Due to the fact, that the bodies surface is heated up through&#xD;
      the infrared exposure, the investigators assume, that the core body temperature will be&#xD;
      lower, compared to the rectal temperature. A validation study in 20 subjects therefore is&#xD;
      necessary to determine the differences in the measuring methods. This is especially&#xD;
      important, as the end-point of the treatments is defined by the core body temperature, and&#xD;
      different endpoints by switching from one measuring method to the other, without validation,&#xD;
      would potentially bias the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Receiving a treatment in the WBH machine is of non-significant risk and can be compared to&#xD;
      e.g. a sauna visit or an intense exercise, in terms of the physiological reaction. It is&#xD;
      currently studied by our group for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder, PTSD and other&#xD;
      chronic illnesses. This trial however will not be limited to only include individuals with&#xD;
      MDD or PTSD, but will allow for an expanded use in all populations (while still excluding&#xD;
      subjects based on safety parameters). The investigators will monitor subject's physiological&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes (if applicable) from a single Whole Body Hyperthermia treatment in an&#xD;
      open fashion (no placebo/control condition). This study will include safety assessments&#xD;
      several days prior to or same day as the WBH, and include follow-up assessments 1 day and 1&#xD;
      week later.&#xD;
