      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increasing number of adolescents report recurrent functional somatic symptoms. Some&#xD;
      experience persistent symptoms and may receive functional somatic syndromes (FSS) diagnoses&#xD;
      (i.e. symptoms not attributable to any known conventionally defined physical disease),&#xD;
      characterised by severe disability and reduced quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)-based group intervention for&#xD;
           adolescents with severe FSS (conceptualized as Bodily Distress Syndrome (BDS), see&#xD;
           detailed description).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the efficacy of group based ACT in adolescents (aged 15-19 years) with severe&#xD;
           FSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ACT-based treatment, with 9 sessions of group therapy and one follow up meeting is&#xD;
      compared to standard treatment/enhanced usual care, which is one single advisory&#xD;
      consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes approximately 120 patients.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increasing number of adolescents report daily physical symptoms, with a current prevalence&#xD;
      of 25%. A substantial proportion of these young people is examined in the health care system,&#xD;
      most often with the conclusion that their symptoms cannot be explained in terms of a&#xD;
      well-defined medical disease and are hence &quot;stress-related&quot; or &quot;functional&quot;. Typically, the&#xD;
      symptoms remit spontaneously after the patient is reassured. However, approximately 5-10%&#xD;
      experience persistent symptoms and reduced functioning. They may receive diagnoses for&#xD;
      functional somatic syndromes (FSS) such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia (FM),&#xD;
      recurrent abdominal pain/irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or idiopathic pain syndrome. These&#xD;
      adolescents are at risk of social isolation, long term school-absence and reduced quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aetiology of FSS is assumed complex, with interacting biological, psychological and&#xD;
      environmental factors. Recent studies suggest that dysfunction of the stress-axes (e.g. the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system) and activated&#xD;
      inflammatory response are likely to play a role in the development and perpetuation of the&#xD;
      symptoms in various FSS. Besides common pathophysiological mechanisms, FSS also show&#xD;
      similarities in patient characteristics and treatment response, which speaks in favour of a&#xD;
      common family of disorders. Recently, the unifying diagnostic category Bodily Distress&#xD;
      Syndrome (BDS) was introduced. BDS is conceptualized as a (patho)physiologic response to&#xD;
      prolonged or severe mental and/or physical stress in genetically susceptible individuals, and&#xD;
      the diagnosis has been shown to encompass the majority of FSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FSS in adults can be managed effectively be means of psychological treatment, but the&#xD;
      evidence for adolescents with severe FSS is sparse. Family based cognitive behavioural&#xD;
      therapy (CBT) and internet-delivered CBT has proven effective for young patients with&#xD;
      particular symptom profiles. However, the development of various specific treatments for each&#xD;
      FSS or symptom profile is not an efficient strategy. Recent studies suggest that adult&#xD;
      patients with various FSS sampled by the BDS diagnosis can feasibly be treated together,&#xD;
      regardless of their main somatic complaint. The same may be true for adolescents, and hence&#xD;
      the development of a common treatment for adolescents with various FSS or BDS may be&#xD;
      advantageous, and facilitate further implementation in routine clinical care if the treatment&#xD;
      is found effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which derives from CBT, has shown promising results&#xD;
      in children with chronic functional pain. Improvement could be demonstrated by less avoidance&#xD;
      of important activities, better emotional wellbeing and less health care utilization. The aim&#xD;
      of this project is to develop an ACT-based group intervention for adolescents with a range of&#xD;
      FSS, i.e. conceptualised as severe BDS, and to evaluate its efficacy in a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population: 120 adolescents with BDS referred to The Research Clinic for Functional&#xD;
      Disorders and Psychosomatics (FFL), Aarhus University Hospital. Patients are referred from&#xD;
      general practitioners, specialists and hospital wards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic assessment: BDS will be diagnosed after a diagnostic work-up by a physician based&#xD;
      on: 1) a review of former medical discharge letters, medical records and other relevant&#xD;
      information, 2) SCAN (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry) which screens for&#xD;
      general psychopathology and contains a detailed section on BDS 3) screening for ADHD, autism&#xD;
      and conduct disorder with screening questions from the child and adolescent psychiatric&#xD;
      interview DAWBA (Development and Well Being Assessment), 4) a physical/neurological&#xD;
      examination and 5) standard blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Eligible patients, meeting all study criteria, are asked to participate in the&#xD;
      RCT. The outcome measures will be filled in at baseline (T0), (i.e. at clinical assessment),&#xD;
      before start of therapy (T1), (i.e. two months after baseline), after 8 sessions of therapy&#xD;
      (T2), (i.e. 4 months after baseline), two weeks after 9 sessions of therapy (end of&#xD;
      treatment, T3) (i.e. 5½ months after baseline) and at eight (T4) and twelve months (T5) after&#xD;
      baseline. A physiological assessment of stress response and inflammatory response will be&#xD;
      performed at T0 and T5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis: Patients randomized to ACT-based group therapy will report statistically&#xD;
      and clinically significant better self-reported physical health twelve months after baseline,&#xD;
      compared to patients receiving a standard psychiatric consultation only (SPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses: Compared to the control group (SPC), patients receiving ACT-group&#xD;
      therapy will at eight and twelve months after baseline: 1. Report statistically and&#xD;
      clinically significant reductions in somatic symptoms. 2. Report statistically and clinically&#xD;
      significant lower symptom interference and at twelve months after baseline: 3. Show&#xD;
      significant improvement in alterations of stress response and inflammatory response. The&#xD;
      patients receiving ACT-group therapy will show good feasibility regarding treatment.&#xD;

The ACT treatment is manualized and given in groups of 7-8 patients with 9 3-hour sessions (i.e. 27 hours in total) over a period of 3 months and one follow up meeting (3 hours) three months after end of treatment. The parents and other relevant close relatives (e.g. siblings, boy/girlfriends) to the patient participate in a workshop where ACT principles are applied. One individual consultation with the adolescent and parents will be offered at the end of 8 sessions of group therapy.</description>
