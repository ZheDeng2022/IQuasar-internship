  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial designed to translate and deliver programs via social media for a&#xD;
      healthy body weight to university students. Specifically, in this trial, we will randomly&#xD;
      assign 450 overweight/obese (BMI between 25-45kg/m2) university students (ages 18-35)&#xD;
      enrolled at two colleges (George Washington University and University of&#xD;
      Massachusetts-Boston) to one of two social media weight loss treatments (personalized or&#xD;
      generic) or a contact control. The social media treatments consist of Facebook groups to&#xD;
      provide social support, connectedness and intervention content, as well as daily text&#xD;
      messages. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months post baseline, with&#xD;
      the primary outcome being weight loss at 18 months. We hypothesize that: a) Tailored Social&#xD;
      Media will lose significantly more weight at the above time points compared with Targeted&#xD;
      Social Media. b) Both the Tailored Social Media and Targeted Social Media groups will have&#xD;
      greater weight loss at the 6, 12, 18 month follow-ups than Contact Control. The secondary aim&#xD;
      is to evaluate changes in metabolic risk factors among those participants who have maintained&#xD;
      at least 5% weight loss at 18 months. We hypothesize that participants who achieve a 5%&#xD;
      weight loss at 6 and 18 months will have significantly lower triglycerides, higher HDL&#xD;
      cholesterol, and lower blood pressure than those who do not achieve and maintain that weight&#xD;
      target. Finally, we will conduct additional formative work to evaluate the implementation&#xD;
      feasibility of this intervention on college campuses, including an assessment of costs as&#xD;
      well as the sustainability infrastructure using the PRISM (Practical, Robust Implementation&#xD;
      and Sustainability Model) model as a guide. The results of this study have the potential to&#xD;
      significantly impact the delivery of obesity treatment services on college campuses.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomly assigned to this treatment arm will receive weight loss materials via text messages, Facebook postings, on-line videos, and weekly reports. The topics relate to relate to behavioral and lifestyle changes associated with weight-loss (e.g., nutrition, exercise, social support, and self-monitoring). Calorie and physical activity targets also are set. Participants will receive a suggestion to track diet, physical activity, and weight.</description>

    <description>Participants randomly assigned to this treatment arm receive all of the same weight loss materials (as well as weight, calorie, and physical activity targets) as the Targeted group above. Weekly reports will be more personalized to help participants track diet, physical activity, and weight. Additionally, participants will be asked to report on their weight, exercise and calorie goals, and receive feedback.</description>

Participants will receive a suggestion to track stress, body image, and energy levels.</description>

    <description>Each of the three intervention groups offers information that has been shown to be important for college students to have a healthy body weight. All three groups provide information on topics that we know are related to having a healthy body weight, like managing stress, keeping track of how you spend your time, and increasing self-awareness of certain health behaviors. Two of the three programs are focused on weight loss for a healthy body. The third group focuses on having a healthy mind, body and having energy during college.</description>
