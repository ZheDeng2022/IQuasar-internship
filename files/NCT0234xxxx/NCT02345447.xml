  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study whether a herbal-based medication is superior to&#xD;
      placebo for prevention of acute otitis media in pre-school children with upper respiratory&#xD;
      tract infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, controlled parallel-group comparison for superiority of Otovowen®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be identified by screening of patient cards. Patients with recurrent AOM aged 12&#xD;
      to 59 months will be randomly assigned either to Otovowen® or placebo. Randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified by age at enrolment (12-35 versus 36-59 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observation period per subject will be 6 months. Data collection and documentation will&#xD;
      be performed weekly via online diary by the parents/legal representative(s) and by the&#xD;
      investigator via eCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen by the doctor at baseline and at end of study. Unscheduled visits in&#xD;
      case of AOM or severe URI or any other disease are initiated by the parents/legal&#xD;
      representative(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication will be sent to the patient/parents/legal representative(s) after&#xD;
      randomization. and will be administered at first signs or symptoms of URI (e. g. elevated&#xD;
      temperature, common cold, influenza, coughing, sore throat, hoarse voice, frequent sneezing,&#xD;
      running or stuffy nose, sinusitis, fever, headache, etc.) until resolved (maximally 8 weeks&#xD;
      of continuous application).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AOM will be diagnosed during unscheduled visits according to the criteria detailed in the&#xD;
      study protocol. An AOM will be considered as resolved through confirmation by the&#xD;
      investigator only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance will be assessed by weighing contents of bottles of IMPs.&#xD;
