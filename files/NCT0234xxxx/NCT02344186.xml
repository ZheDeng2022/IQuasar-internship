  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study will be to test the hypothesis that treatment with&#xD;
      Liraglutide will decrease ER stress and adipose tissue in obese patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Experimental Approach: The investigators will use a prospective, single blind,&#xD;
      placebo controlled study design to study 12 obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (T2DM). 6 patients will first receive Liraglutide for 24 weeks followed by placebo for 12&#xD;
      weeks. The other 6 patients will first receive placebo for 12 weeks followed by Liraglutide&#xD;
      for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: The investigators will determine glycemic control (with HbA1c), body&#xD;
      composition (bioelectric impedance analysis), insulin sensitivity (with&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps), insulin secretion (with oral glucose tolerance testing),&#xD;
      energy balance (calories in vs. calories out), plasma lipid levels and obtain subcutaneous&#xD;
      fat biopsies to determine ER stress response markers before and after placebo and before and&#xD;
      after Liraglutide treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This will be a prospective, single-blind, placebo-controlled study with a crossover design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit Procedures: After a 1 month run-in period during which there will be no changes in&#xD;
      medications, physical activity or diet, patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups of 6&#xD;
      patients each. Subjects have a 50:50 chance of being randomized to either group 1 or group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group 1, (n=6), liraglutide will be started first with 0.6 mg/d for 1 week, then increased&#xD;
      to 1.2 mg/d from week 2 to week 12, followed by 1.8 mg/d from week 12 to week 24. Group 1&#xD;
      patients will then be switched from liraglutide to placebo injections for another 12 weeks.&#xD;
      For subjects in Group 1 the placebo period (weeks 24 to 36 will be the washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 patients (n=6) will be started with placebo for 12 weeks and then switched to&#xD;
      liraglutide for the next 24 weeks (0.6 mg/d for 1 week, 1.2 mg/d for 11 weeks and 1.8 mg/d&#xD;
      for 12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the entire study, all patients (Groups 1 and 2) will perform home glucose monitoring 7&#xD;
      times/day (pre and ~ 2 h post breakfast, lunch and dinner and bedtime) and will be seen at&#xD;
      Temple University Hospital as outpatients at 4 week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week before the first, second or third and final inpatient visit, patients will undergo a&#xD;
      75, gram 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatient visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients (Groups 1 and 2) will be studied in our Clinical Research Center (CRC) at Temple&#xD;
      University Hospital in the morning after an overnight fast, at the end of the run-in period&#xD;
      (Week 0 ) and again at Weeks 12, 24 and 36. All study patients will be admitted to the CRC&#xD;
      the evening before their study and discharged in PM of the following day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the inpatient visits, the following procedures will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At baseline and again at weeks 12 and 36, subcutaneous fat biopsies will be obtained&#xD;
           from the lateral aspect of one thigh by a surgeon as described (8) for determination of&#xD;
           ER stress markers. In brief, the skin will be cleaned with betadine and anesthetized&#xD;
           with 1% lidocaine without epinephrine in a field block pattern (at 2 X 3 in). (We have&#xD;
           found that injection of lidocaine too close to the biopsy site interfered with the&#xD;
           measurement of acetyl-CoA). After an incision (~ 1 in.) will be made through the skin, ~&#xD;
           300 mg of fat will be mobilized and excised. The fat will be dropped immediately into&#xD;
           isopentane, kept at its freezing point (-160°C) by liquid nitrogen. The frozen fat will&#xD;
           be stored at -70°. To screen for changes in unfolded protein response (UPR) genes, we&#xD;
           will first perform an UPR PCR microarray (SA Biosciences, Frederick, MD) using pooled&#xD;
           fat biopsy extracts. This array profiles expression of 84 key genes recognizing and&#xD;
           responding to misfolded protein accumulation in the ER. Significant changes (&gt; 1.5 fold&#xD;
           comparing post vs. pre drug biopsies) will then be confirmed by real time RT-PCR of the&#xD;
           UPR mRNAs. Thus, mRNAs of the identified UPR markers (for instance, GRP78, XBP-1s, ATF4,&#xD;
           ATF6, PDI, calreticulin, calnexin) will be measured by real time RT-PCR in triplicate&#xD;
           and normalized against 18s and β-actin mRNAs and will be expressed as arbitrary units.&#xD;
           The respective proteins will be analyzed by Western blots.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Glycemic control will be assessed by&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. measurement of HbA1c&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. patients home glucose monitoring records&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determination of insulin resistance will be determined (with euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic&#xD;
           clamping with use of stable isotopes for determination of peripheral (GRd) and hepatic&#xD;
           (GRa) insulin action as described (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. . Determination of energy balance, which will be calculated as change in fat mass (by&#xD;
           bioelectric impedance analysis) plus total energy expenditure (determined with indirect&#xD;
           calorimetry and the doubly labeled water method) (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Postabsorptive blood samples will be obtained for determination of plasma lipids (total&#xD;
           cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assessment of changes in insulin secretion will be determined with Oral Glucose&#xD;
           Tolerance Testing.&#xD;
