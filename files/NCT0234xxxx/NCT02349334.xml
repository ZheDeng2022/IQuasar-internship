  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Faecal incontinence occurs when a person passes faeces (stools) without the usual control. It&#xD;
      is a distressing condition that is actually very common although under-reported because of&#xD;
      embarrassment. Milder symptoms may be managed by treatments such as dietary change, drugs and&#xD;
      bowel retraining, but many patients still resort to surgery to improve symptoms. Although&#xD;
      several operations exist to treat incontinence e.g. those aiming to repair damaged anal&#xD;
      sphincter muscles, it is now clear that these often have poor results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two relatively new treatments called sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) and percutaneous tibial&#xD;
      nerve stimulation (PTNS) involve sending pulses of electricity to the nerves controlling the&#xD;
      bowel and muscles of the anus (anal sphincter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SNS does this by inserting electrodes in the lower back just above the tailbone and&#xD;
      connecting them to an implanted electrical stimulator which is buried in the buttock and acts&#xD;
      a bit like a heart pacemaker. SNS is a relatively well-established treatment in specialist&#xD;
      centres, which has been used for over 10 years. It has been shown in studies to be successful&#xD;
      for faecal incontinence achieving some improvement in at least three quarters of patients. In&#xD;
      Europe, this procedure is fast becoming first treatment offered when non-surgical treatments&#xD;
      fail. Nevertheless, SNS is not a miracle cure for all, requiring 2 operations, with potential&#xD;
      complications and expensive equipment (&gt; £10,000 approx).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTNS is a newer treatment, which involves electrically stimulating a nerve at the ankle,&#xD;
      using a very small needle, as an outpatient (a bit like acupuncture). This sends signals back&#xD;
      to the spine region to try and improve symptoms of faecal incontinence. Since this is a newer&#xD;
      treatment, fewer studies have been performed to quantify how successful it is, but early&#xD;
      results of PTNS suggest that it may be as good as SNS. If this is true, this is very&#xD;
      important because it is much less invasive and considerably cheaper than SNS (equipment £500&#xD;
      per patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will for the first time determine how effective PTNS is in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with faecal incontinence, by comparing it to sham (fake stimulation). This study is&#xD;
      a properly designed clinical trial of 212 patients in at least 14 UK Specialist Centres.. The&#xD;
      results of this trial will lead to direct benefits for patients and the NHS.&#xD;
