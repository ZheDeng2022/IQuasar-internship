&#xD;
          -  Healthy male subjects according to the investigator's assessment, based on a complete&#xD;
             medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR), 12-lead ECG,&#xD;
             and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 18 to 50 years (incl.)&#xD;

             accordance with GCP and local legislation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) is deviating from&#xD;
             normal and judged as clinically relevant by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,&#xD;
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the&#xD;
             range of 50 to 90 bpm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be&#xD;
             of clinical relevance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,&#xD;
             immunological or hormonal disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cholecystectomy and/or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with&#xD;
             the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy and simple hernia&#xD;
             repair)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of&#xD;
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts&#xD;

             halflives of the respective drug prior to administration of trial medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Within 10 days prior to administration of trial medication, use of drugs that might&#xD;
             reasonably influence the results of the trial or that might prolong the QT/QTc&#xD;
             interval&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered&#xD;
             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial&#xD;
             medication or intended donation during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to&#xD;
             administration of trial medication or during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are&#xD;
             repeatedly greater than 450 ms) or any other relevant ECG finding at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,&#xD;
             hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,&#xD;
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a&#xD;
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study&#xD;
