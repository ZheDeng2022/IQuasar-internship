      Beta-blockers should be administered to all patients with heart failure stage II to IV&#xD;
      according to NYHA.Beta-blockers reduce mortality and hospitalizations and improve the&#xD;
      operational phase for all categories of patients with heart failure. Since beta-blockers,&#xD;
      only carvedilol, metoprolol, bisoprolol and recently nevimpololi have shown these benefits&#xD;
      and so, only they have evidence to be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eplerenone is indicated, in addition to conventional therapy, for reducing the risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in stable patients with left ventricular dysfunction&#xD;
      (LVEF ≤ 40%) and clinically proven heart failure after recent myocardial infarction.&#xD;

      Heart Failure (HF) As heart failure is defined as a complex clinical syndrome that can result&#xD;
      from any structural or functional cardiac disorder and affects the ability of the ventricle&#xD;
      to accept or eject blood. Its incidence is increasing in recent years in the Western world.&#xD;
      It is estimated that 6% - 10% of the population over 65 suffers from heart failure. The&#xD;
      clinical picture of heart failure is shortness of breath, fatigue tolerance restriction and&#xD;
      fluid retention that can lead to pulmonary congestion or peripheral edema. These symptoms and&#xD;
      signs are not required to appear all at once in each patient. Some patients simply have a&#xD;
      reduced exercise tolerance, while others dominate the swelling and do not report dyspnea or&#xD;
      fatigue. For the diagnosis of heart failure is necessary apart from the existence of symptoms&#xD;
      objective confirmation cardiac dysfunction, preferably by echocardiography, or more&#xD;
      specialized and less available methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging heart and&#xD;
      radionuclide ventriculography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary heart disease is nowadays the dominant cause of heart failure, as 65-70% of patients&#xD;
      with heart failure suffer from coronary disease. The cardiomyopathies and especially dilated,&#xD;
      is the cause of heart failure in 20% of cases. The myocarditis, hyperthyroidism and abuse of&#xD;
      ethanol, are responsible for a significant number of patients with type distending heart&#xD;
      failure. Hypertension and valvular dominated in the past, occupy small percentage today as&#xD;
      heart failure causes. The heart failure can be divided into right or left, depending on&#xD;
      whether the predominant symptoms resulting from congestion of systemic or pulmonary veins,&#xD;
      respectively. Moreover, heart failure is separated into systolic or diastolic depending on&#xD;
      whether systolic or diastolic performance of the left ventricle is affected. In most patients&#xD;
      with systolic heart failure and diastolic dysfunction coexist. However, in 30% of patients&#xD;
      with heart failure is pure diastolic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the diagnosis of heart failure with diastolic dysfunction criteria require:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the presence of signs and symptoms of heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ejection fraction of the left ventricle&gt; 45%&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the presence of one of three types of abnormal left ventricular filling during diastole&#xD;
           (relaxation extension, restrictive type).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four operating stages depending on the symptoms of patients with heart failure,&#xD;
      according to the classification in NYHA (New York Heart Association). At the operational&#xD;
      stage I patients have symptoms of heart failure at a high level of exercise, beyond the&#xD;
      ordinary. In stage II, the symptoms appear in a regular exercise level at stage III in small&#xD;
      fatigue, while in stage IV symptoms occur at rest, so that patients are unable to look after&#xD;
      themselves. Medication and diet can alter the operating phase which is the patient, without&#xD;
      any significant change occurs in ventricular performance. It is particularly interesting that&#xD;
      there is little correlation between symptoms and systolic left ventricular performance as&#xD;
      expressed by the ejection fraction. Thus, patients with low ejection fraction &lt;25% can be&#xD;
      virtually asymptomatic, while others slightly influenced ejection fraction have serious&#xD;
      discomfort. Changes of abdominal diatasimotitas of pericardial voltage, any valvular&#xD;
      deficiencies and especially the function of the right ventricle are those factors which&#xD;
      together with systolic left ventricular performance determine the occurrence or not of the&#xD;
      symptoms of heart failure patients. In heart failure the function of the left ventricle is&#xD;
      gradually worsening even in the absence of new effect damaging agent. This is the famous&#xD;
      remodeling (Cardiac Remodeling) of the left ventricle, during which the investigators&#xD;
      dilatation, hypertrophy and more spherical the shape. Thus, the mechanical performance of the&#xD;
      ventricle decreases, increasing the mitral insufficiency due to distension of the mitral&#xD;
      annulus, and increases the parietal stress. Ventricular remodeling contribute to continuous&#xD;
      deterioration of symptoms, despite any treatment. The activation of the neurohormonal system&#xD;
      proved to be the most important factor in why the cardiac remodeling and the unfavorable&#xD;
      development of heart failure. Patients with heart failure have in their plasma levels of&#xD;
      noradrenaline, angiotensin II, aldosterone, endothelin and cytokines which may act&#xD;
      deleteriously on the structure and functioning of the heart. The mobilization of&#xD;
      neurohormonal mechanisms in heart failure causes fluid retention and sodium, peripheral&#xD;
      vasoconstriction, myocardial fibrosis and toxic effect on myocardial cells, creating a&#xD;
      vicious cycle of deteriorating architecture and performance of the failing heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ejection Fraction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relation between stroke volume, which is extruded from the left ventricle and the&#xD;
      starting end diastole filling volume gives a measure of the contractile function of the left&#xD;
      ventricle. Each patient with known cardiovascular disease should be subject to assessment of&#xD;
      left ventricular function by measuring ejection fraction. Several studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that when the ejection fraction (LVEF), which measures the ability of the heart to eject&#xD;
      blood into the aorta, not exceed 40% (natural rate ^ 50%) increased dramatically&#xD;
      postinfarction mortality. The ejection fraction is a reliable prognostic indicator can be&#xD;
      calculated by ultrasonography. The reduced ejection fraction is associated with an increased&#xD;
      risk of life-threatening arrhythmias, heart failure and death. A low ejection fraction,&#xD;
      particularly after myocardial infarction, is a strong indication for the administration of&#xD;
      beta-blockers, as many studies have shown that administration of these drugs significantly&#xD;
      reduces cardiovascular mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to recruit within 6 months of clinical practice in the Greek reality&#xD;
      regarding the data administration of eplerenone in addition to standard therapy including&#xD;
      beta-blockers, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in stable&#xD;
      patients with dysfunction left ventricle (LVEF ≤ 40%) and clinically proven heart failure&#xD;
      after recent myocardial infarction.&#xD;
