      The study is designed as a three arm randomized Phase III, multicenter trial comparing two&#xD;
      calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-free strategies for Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) prophylaxis&#xD;
      to standard tacrolimus and methotrexate (Tac/Mtx) in patients with hematologic malignancies&#xD;
      undergoing myeloablative conditioning hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) is a complication that affects many hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplant (HSCT) survivors; it occurs when the new cells from a transplant attack&#xD;
      the recipient's body. The current standard GVHD prophylaxis regimen for patients with&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies undergoing HSCT involves a combination of immunosuppressive agents&#xD;
      given for the first 6 months after transplant. Often, patients develop GVHD and continue on&#xD;
      these agents for much longer periods. The combination of calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus&#xD;
      and cyclosporine A) with methotrexate (MTX) is the most common GVHD prophylaxis used&#xD;
      worldwide in the context of myeloablative conditioning transplants. This regimen demonstrates&#xD;
      better control of acute GVHD, but is less effective against chronic GVHD. Management of&#xD;
      chronic GVHD remains a challenge and it has become a significant health problem in transplant&#xD;
      survivors with more frequent use of mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. Additionally,&#xD;
      several issues arise with the standard approach including various toxicity symptoms and side&#xD;
      effects, increased risk of thrombotic microangiopathy due to CNI, no prevention of other&#xD;
      infectious diseases, and no prevention for disease relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This standard strategy of Tac/MTX will be used as a control in comparison to two other&#xD;
      treatment plans both utilizing CNI-free methods: CD34 selected T-cell depletion in peripheral&#xD;
      blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts, and infusion of bone marrow (BM) grafts followed by&#xD;
      post-transplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy). Study participants will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      these three treatment arms.&#xD;

Subsequent dosing will be based on blood levels, with a target of 5-15 ng/ml. If patients are on medications which alter the metabolism of tacrolimus (e.g. azoles), the initial starting dose and subsequent doses should be altered as per institutional practices. Tacrolimus taper can be initiated at a minimum of 90 days post HSCT if there is no evidence of active GVHD. The rate of tapering will be done according institutional practices but patients should be off tacrolimus by Day 180 post HSCT if there is no evidence of active GVHD.</description>

The Day +1 dose of methotrexate should be given at least 24 hours after the hematopoietic stem cell infusion. Dose reduction of MTX due to worsening creatinine clearance after initiation of conditioning regimen, high serum levels or development of oral mucositis is allowed according to institutional practices.
