  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure (BP) is the leading attributable risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).&#xD;
      In rural South Asia, hypertension remains to be a significant public health issue with&#xD;
      sub-optimal rates of case finding and management. A trial to investigate integrated primary&#xD;
      care strategies to control hypertension is planned. Packaged interventions for the planned&#xD;
      full-scale study are varying combinations of 1) home health education (HHE) by trained&#xD;
      community health workers (CHW), 2) trained government primary health centre mid-level&#xD;
      providers (MLP) led care and 3) trained private practitioners. The goal of the full-scale&#xD;
      study is to test which combination of the above interventions is the most effective in&#xD;
      lowering blood pressure among adults with hypertension in rural communities. In addition, the&#xD;
      full-scale study aims to quantify the incremental cost- effectiveness of each approach in&#xD;
      terms of cost per projected cardiovascular disease (CVD) disability adjusted life-years&#xD;
      (DALYs) averted.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The rationale for conducting the feasibility study in 3 proposed South Asian countries is&#xD;
      strong. The South Asian countries are in a unique stage of epidemiological transition with a&#xD;
      double burden of communicable and NCDs, the latter increasing rapidly. (2) These countries&#xD;
      also share cultural habits and social structure with an extended family system, and have&#xD;
      largely similar population characteristics and health seeking behaviours. (10)Moreover, the&#xD;
      rural health system in all South Asian countries relies on cadres community health workers.&#xD;
      At the same time there are some differences. Bangladesh and Pakistan have a high proportion&#xD;
      of people living in extreme poverty (purchasing power parity &lt;US $1.25/day, 49.6% and 22.6%,&#xD;
      respectively) compared to Sri Lanka (14%) which has relatively better development indicators&#xD;
      in terms of life expectancy and literacy rates (World Bank 2010). However age-standardized&#xD;
      death rates from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are uniformly high in all 3 countries. The&#xD;
      feasibility will allow direct comparison of some of these population (individual) and health&#xD;
      systems characteristics among countries relevant for hypertension care. Thus, data from the&#xD;
      feasibility will inform the future design of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to optimize the trial design of the full study, a mixed-methods feasibility study&#xD;
      with quasi-experimental pre- and post- evaluation of &quot;triple approach&quot; with all 3 components&#xD;
      of intervention, survey of pharmacies, and focus group discussions and individual in-depth&#xD;
      interviews to better inform the strategies for the full-scale trial in rural settings in&#xD;
      Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.&#xD;
