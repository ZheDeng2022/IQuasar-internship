    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase Ib/IIa study of patients with relapsed/refractory B- and T-cell&#xD;
      lymphomas who are treated with carfilzomib, lenalidomide and romidepsin in a 3+3 design. The&#xD;
      phase IIa portion of the study will involve a dose expansion at the MTD to better&#xD;
      characterize the efficacy and to inform further disease specific studies.&#xD;

    <description>All patients will be treated with romidepsin administered intravenously on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Lenalidomide will be taken orally daily for days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle. The carfilzomib will be given weekly on days 1, and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Once a MTD is determined this dosing level will be used for the phase IIa portion. Cycles will be continued as above until the patient's wishes to be removed from the study, unacceptable toxicity develops, disease progression, treating physician recommends removal, or termination of study occurs.</description>
