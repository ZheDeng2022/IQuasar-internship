  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The background of the present clinical trial is the overall aim of the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) to obtain eradication of polio in the world. As part of this overall plan,&#xD;
      inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, at an affordable price,&#xD;
      needs to be available in low resource third world countries. The intention of the present&#xD;
      phase II clinical trial is to determine if reduced dose(s) of IPV-Al SSI are safe in the&#xD;
      target population and do not decrease the immunogenicity clinically significantly compared to&#xD;
      full dose IPV Vaccine SSI. The infants will receive three doses of one of the trial vaccines&#xD;
      according to the WHO Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) schedule of 6, 10 and 14 weeks of&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 824 healthy infants will be included in the trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a phase II, dose investigation, parallel and multi-group, observer-blind,&#xD;
      randomised, controlled, multicentre and non-inferiority trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three investigational reduced dose adjuvated IPV-Al SSI vaccines and full dose IPV SSI&#xD;
      vaccine will be investigated in four parallel groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1/3 IPV-Al SSI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1/5 IPV-Al SSI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1/10 IPV-Al SSI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IPV Vaccine SSI (comparator)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1 (screening and 1st vaccination visit), written informed consent is obtained and&#xD;
      the subject's eligibility is assessed according to the pre-specified in-/exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      including measurement of axillary temperature. If the subject is included, a pre-vaccination&#xD;
      blood sample is taken for polio antibody determinations, and the subject is randomly&#xD;
      allocated into one of the four groups to be vaccinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject is observed for ½ an hour after the injection of the investigational medical&#xD;
      product (IMP) and any immediate adverse events observed are to be recorded. A diary,&#xD;
      thermometer and ruler are handed out to the parents/guardians so that they can measure daily&#xD;
      the injection site reactions and the axillary temperature the first 3 days and record any&#xD;
      adverse event until the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2 (2nd vaccination visit), 28-42 days after Visit 1, contraindications are reviewed,&#xD;
      the 2nd vaccination is given, the diary is collected and adverse events and concomitant&#xD;
      medications are recorded in the eCRF. A new diary is handed out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 3 (3rd vaccination and blood sample visit), 28-42 days after Visit 2, a blood sample&#xD;
      for immunogenicity assessment is taken, contraindications are reviewed, the 3rd vaccination&#xD;
      is given, the diary is collected and adverse events and concomitant medications are recorded&#xD;
      in the eCRF. A new diary is handed out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 4 (blood sample visit), 28-42 days after Visit 3, a blood sample for immunogenicity&#xD;
      assessment is taken, the diary is collected, and adverse events and concomitant medications&#xD;
      are recorded in the eCRF. The trial termination form is completed.&#xD;
