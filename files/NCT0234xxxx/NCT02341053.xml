      Non-ambulatory children with a neuromuscular disability such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)&#xD;
      are at significant risk for poor bone health as defined by low bone mineral density (BMD) and&#xD;
      increased propensity to fracture. Poor bone health is thought to be related, at least in&#xD;
      part, to abnormally low levels of load experienced by the skeleton. A common physical&#xD;
      approach for increasing bone density is to stimulate the musculoskeletal system by increasing&#xD;
      the amount and duration of weight-bearing in the lower extremities. For non-ambulatory&#xD;
      individuals, this takes the form of using an assisted standing device to enable the child to&#xD;
      spend time in a standing position with some degree of weight placed on the lower limbs. Some&#xD;
      of these physical interventions demonstrate variable improvement in BMD in children with&#xD;
      neuromuscular conditions, and some do not. A serious limitation in the previous work in this&#xD;
      area is a failure to objectively measure the magnitude and duration of the loading&#xD;
      experienced by the lower extremities. Thus, a lack of change in BMD may be due to the&#xD;
      extremities experiencing only a fraction of the body weight (due to load-sharing with the&#xD;
      assistive device) for an inadequate duration of standing time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to investigate the efficacy of standing treatment for increasing BMD, the&#xD;
      investigators will develop a simple, portable and inexpensive transducer that will measure&#xD;
      the magnitude and time course of the load experienced by the lower extremities of individuals&#xD;
      with SMA who use a stationary assisted standing device. The specific goal of this proposed&#xD;
      project will be to develop, validate and establish the initial feasibility of such a&#xD;
      measurement device.&#xD;

      Background: Non-ambulatory children with a neuromuscular disability such as spinal muscular&#xD;
      atrophy (SMA) are at significant risk for poor bone health as defined by low bone mineral&#xD;
      density (BMD) and increased propensity to fracture. Poor bone health is thought to be&#xD;
      related, at least in part, to abnormally low levels of load experienced by the skeleton. A&#xD;
      common physical approach for increasing bone density is to stimulate the musculoskeletal&#xD;
      system by increasing the amount and duration of weight-bearing in the lower extremities. For&#xD;
      non-ambulatory individuals, this takes the form of using an assisted standing device to&#xD;
      enable the child to spend time in a standing position with some degree of weight placed on&#xD;
      the lower limbs. Some of these physical interventions demonstrate variable improvement in BMD&#xD;
      in children with neuromuscular conditions, and some do not. A serious limitation in the&#xD;
      previous work in this area is a failure to objectively measure the magnitude and duration of&#xD;
      the loading experienced by the lower extremities. Thus, a lack of change in BMD may be due to&#xD;
      the extremities experiencing only a fraction of the body weight (due to load-sharing with the&#xD;
      assistive device) for an inadequate duration of standing time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In order to investigate the efficacy of standing treatment for increasing BMD, we&#xD;
      will develop a simple, portable and inexpensive transducer that will measure the magnitude&#xD;
      and time course of the load experienced by the lower extremities of individuals with SMA who&#xD;
      use a stationary assisted standing device. This transducer will consist of an array of&#xD;
      sensors embedded within a mat that will be placed under an individual's feet while they are&#xD;
      in assisted standing. A prototype will be validated by comparing the output of this&#xD;
      load-sensing mat against known loads that will be applied to the surface of the mat&#xD;
      statically. The specific characteristics of the loading in the lower extremities of subjects&#xD;
      can then be correlated with changes in their BMD to obtain a true outcome assessment. As a&#xD;
      demonstration of this approach, we will recruit 3 children with SMA from Gillette Children's&#xD;
      Specialty Healthcare who are currently participating in a standing program. Once enrolled and&#xD;
      informed consent is obtained, the participants will use the mat provided to them to collect&#xD;
      load and duration data during a baseline period where they will continue their standing&#xD;
      program, and during a subsequent intervention period where they will increase the duration of&#xD;
      their standing. The specific goal of this proposed project will be to develop, validate and&#xD;
      establish the initial feasibility of such a measurement device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications: Successful completion of this proposed project will provide the necessary&#xD;
      groundwork to move forward with a multicenter clinical trial on a large number of subjects&#xD;
      with a variety of neuromuscular conditions. The measurement device will allow us to correlate&#xD;
      change in BMD with the specific load history for each participant, thereby allowing us to&#xD;
      determine whether physical interventions can lead to increased BMD in individuals with&#xD;
      neuromuscular disabilities. Analysis of the data will help define a dose-dependent&#xD;
      relationship between load, duration and changes in BMD, thereby guiding providers and&#xD;
      therapists in prescribing standing interventions.&#xD;
