      The overall objective is to determine whether a bundled In-hospital Newborn Resuscitation&#xD;
      Edu-cation intervention (INSPIRE-D) improves process of care associated with improved newborn&#xD;
      survival and neurologic outcomes.&#xD;

      This prospective interventional trial will be conducted in the delivery unit at OUS. The&#xD;
      planned studies consist of five distinct phases with step-wise interventions; 1) baseline&#xD;
      data collection, 2) introducing educational debriefing, 3) intensive run-in/rolling-refresher&#xD;
      phase, 4) INSPIRE-D phase and lastly 5) evaluation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: The baseline data collection phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Needs assessment/questionnaires from participating healthcare providers will be&#xD;
           collected which include demographic data such as sex, age, education, and work&#xD;
           experience, as well as exposure to resuscitation training, simulation, self-perceived&#xD;
           confidence and suggestions for further training/educational topics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Observations of the newborn in the resuscitation bays will be done by video recordings&#xD;
           and supplemented by resuscitation records, hospital quality improvement data and medical&#xD;
           records. Data points to be collected of the newborn are demographics, gestational age,&#xD;
           physiological parameters such as heart rate and respirations/oxygenation, Apgar score,&#xD;
           interventions performed, and outcomes during and at discharge from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The healthcare providers adherence to guidelines in neonatal resuscitation (both&#xD;
           technical and non-technical skills like team collaboration) will be evaluated by&#xD;
           examining the video recordings and scored by validated scoring systems formerly tested&#xD;
           with good intra- and inter-rater reliability. The scoring systems is adapted to&#xD;
           guidelines from the Norwegian Council of Resuscitation and retested for intra- and&#xD;
           inter-rater reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Intervention Phase with Educational Debriefings&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Educational debriefings of healthcare providers involved in clinical situations with&#xD;
           newborn resuscitation: Selected resuscitation events will be debriefed facilitated by a&#xD;
           study team member with special competence in facilitation and an instructor in neonatal&#xD;
           resuscitation. The debriefing will be held depending on clinical schedule and&#xD;
           availability, to discuss process of care, performance, and provide education to&#xD;
           multidisciplinary staff with advocacy/inquiry debriefing techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For healthcare providers; contÂ¬inued needs assessment and prospective observations by&#xD;
           video-recordings in resuscitation bays to document quality of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Baseline skills assessment will be collected using a novel manikin, the Newborn Lung&#xD;
           Simulator. Healthcare providers will be presented for a mini-simulation with a&#xD;
           compromised newborn and asked to perform high quality resuscitation. The performance and&#xD;
           adherence to guidelines will be evaluated and retested after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 - Intensive run-in of high frequency training and team reflection: &quot;The rolling&#xD;
      refresher phase&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In this phase training triggers are identified at the start of each day shift. A careful&#xD;
           consideration of perinatal factors of both mother and infant will identify &quot;high risk&quot;&#xD;
           deliveries with babies who may need resuscitation. If no risk deliveries are identified,&#xD;
           a random Healthcare Provider team among the present staff will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &quot;Just-in-time&quot; and &quot;just-in-place&quot; training; the novel &quot;Rolling refresher&quot;, will be&#xD;
           introduced (target &gt;80% of staff) at the beginning of day shifts. Health Care Providers&#xD;
           caring for labouring mothers with training triggers will be identified and exposed to&#xD;
           &quot;low dose&quot; simulation-based &quot;just-in-time&quot; and &quot;just-in-place&quot; skills training. The&#xD;
           short training session (&lt;10 minutes) will take place on-site in the resuscitation bay&#xD;
           with relevant topics such as; timely assessment of need for intervention, effective&#xD;
           assisted ventilations on a Newborn Lung Simulator. We will use observations from the&#xD;
           video-films to target training with focus on rapid evaluation of respiratory distress,&#xD;
           correct ventilation technique and use of pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Continued simulation training will be based on problem areas identified from baseline.&#xD;
           Performance during simulation training will be evaluated and registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Educational debriefings will continue, as in Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Continued needs assessment and prospective observations in resuscitation bays to&#xD;
           document provider confidence, simulation performance and quality of care during&#xD;
           implementation of the INSPIRE-D bundle described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: Continued INSPIRE-D bundle. After successful implementation defined as &gt;80% of staff&#xD;
      having been through at least one &quot;just-in-time and just in place&quot; training session, all&#xD;
      interventions above (phase 2 and 3) will continue on routine basis. Continued needs&#xD;
      assessment of confidence and performance are repeated as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 5: Evaluation. Evaluation of the INSPIRE-D bundle to identify and define key factors&#xD;
      and processes that we prove necessary to ensure timely and effective neonatal resuscitation&#xD;
      associated with improved newly born survival and neurologic outcomes.&#xD;
