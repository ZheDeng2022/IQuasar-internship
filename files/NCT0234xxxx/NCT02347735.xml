      Rationale: Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide,&#xD;
      estimated to be responsible for almost 610,000 deaths in 2008. Surgery remains the&#xD;
      predominant curative treatment type for colorectal cancer, but has a major impact on the&#xD;
      patient's wellbeing by demanding large amounts of metabolic reserves. This can lead to the&#xD;
      development of frequently observed and severe postoperative complications. The most important&#xD;
      complication after colorectal surgery is anastomotic leakage (AL), which has an incidence of&#xD;
      8-15% in the Netherlands. AL is associated with high short-term mortality rates of up to 40%.&#xD;
      Even though many attempts have been made to reduce the incidence of this dreaded&#xD;
      complication, none of these interventions have been successful so far. Despite proper patient&#xD;
      selection and improvement in surgical techniques, the percentage of AL has been stable for&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To investigate whether recently identified patient-specific factors can predict&#xD;
      the occurrence of anastomotic leakage in patients undergoing elective surgery for colorectal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective observational study Study population: Adult colorectal cancer&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective surgery. Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary endpoint: AL&#xD;
      within 30 days postoperatively Secondary endpoints: Intestinal microbiome in fecal sample,&#xD;
      I-FABP, SM22, Calprotectin, C-reactive protein(CRP), Citrullin, complement factors in blood,&#xD;
      VOCs in exhaled air, COX-2 &amp; MBL polymorphisms in buccal smear, L3-index &amp; atherosclerosis&#xD;
      measurements on CT-scans, SNAQ &amp; MUST scores&#xD;

      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide, estimated&#xD;
      to be responsible for 610,000 deaths in 20081. The number of CRC patients is concomitantly&#xD;
      increasing due to a higher incidence, population growth, aging of the population and the&#xD;
      recently established nationwide screening. Surgery remains the predominant curative treatment&#xD;
      type for CRC, but has a major impact on the patient's wellbeing by demanding large amounts of&#xD;
      metabolic reserves. This can lead to the development of frequently observed and severe&#xD;
      postoperative complications. Anastomotic leakage (AL) is the most important complication&#xD;
      after colorectal surgery and has an incidence of 8-15% in the Netherlands. AL is associated&#xD;
      with high short-term mortality rates of up to 40%. Even though many attempts have been made&#xD;
      to prevent this dreaded complication, none of these interventions have been successful so&#xD;
      far. Despite proper patient selection, reduction of known preoperative risk factors and&#xD;
      improved surgical techniques as well as introduction of 'fast track' protocol, AL incidence&#xD;
      has not decreased in the past decade(s). AL is associated with a decreased disease-specific&#xD;
      survival and an increased recurrence rate of CRC. The aim of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      potential strategies to prevent AL, to be able to diagnose AL in time and therefore start&#xD;
      treatment as early as possible in the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of anastomotic healing in the human gastrointestinal tract is not fully&#xD;
      elucidated. Risk factors that are associated with anastomotic leakage have been identified,&#xD;
      such as patient characteristics (age, malnutrition, tumor distally localized) and surgical&#xD;
      factors (insufficient perfusion of the anastomosis, tension on the anastomosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies performed at our surgical research department of the School for Nutrition,&#xD;
      Toxicology and Metabolism (NUTRIM) were focused on these risk factors individually. We&#xD;
      revealed the consequences of intestinal ischemia both in small and large human intestines in&#xD;
      a unique experimental model and described the recovery mechanism of the intestine after&#xD;
      ischemic injury. The crucial role of Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL), an important complement&#xD;
      factor of the immune system was shown as well as the fact that small proteins present in&#xD;
      mature enterocytes (Intestinal-Fatty Acid Binding Proteins, I-FABP) can act as adequate&#xD;
      markers in plasma for intestinal damage13-14. Furthermore, with the use of cyclooxygenase-2&#xD;
      (COX-2) knockout mice, it was shown that COX-2 is essential in the healing process of colonic&#xD;
      anastomoses (manuscript submitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another previous study showed that frailty (defined with the Groningen Frailty Index,&#xD;
      sarcopenia (determined by measuring the skeletal muscle mass at L3 level at the CT-scan) and&#xD;
      malnutrition (assessed with Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire (SNAQ) en Malnutrition&#xD;
      Universal Screening Tool (MUST)) is associated with the occurrence of sepsis and mortality in&#xD;
      273 patients. In a pilot study with 90 patients, preoperative I-FABP plasma levels and&#xD;
      postoperative inflammatory plasma concentration (C-reactive protein &amp; calprotectin) were&#xD;
      identified as predictive markers for anastomotic leakage after elective colorectal surgery.&#xD;
      In addition, composition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath varies&#xD;
      depending on health status. Various metabolic processes within the body produce volatile&#xD;
      products that are released into the blood and will be passed on to the airway once the blood&#xD;
      reaches the lungs. Moreover, the occurrence of chronic inflammation and/or oxidative stress&#xD;
      can result in the excretion of volatile compounds that generate unique VOC patterns. In this&#xD;
      study, we will measure the total amount of VOCs in exhaled air, to see if this is an eligible&#xD;
      tool for early clinical diagnosis of anastomotic leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on all these results, we aim to combine and translate observational results from&#xD;
      individual studies into one multicentre prospective study in which several aspects of&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage will be investigated. With the results of this study, we expect to be&#xD;
      able to provide patients an adequate risk estimation regarding anastomotic leakage. This will&#xD;
      help surgeons to make the decision to create a stoma instead of performing a primary&#xD;
      anastomosis and to detect anastomotic leakage at an earlier stage. Furthermore, this study&#xD;
      may provide new insights that can lead to potential new treatment.&#xD;
