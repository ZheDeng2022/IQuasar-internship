  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be carried out to provide supportive clinical data on the feasibility,&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, and PK of LPV based therapies in routine treatment setting and will be&#xD;
      based on the existing LPV/r pellets which already represent a clear advantage in comparison&#xD;
      with the liquid formulation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of LPV/r pellets in addition to&#xD;
      AZT/3TC (or ABC/3TC) paediatric fixed dose combination (FDCs) tablet under routine treatment&#xD;
      conditions in HIV infected infants and young children who cannot swallow tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document the safety of LPV/r pellets and AZT/3TC or ABC/3TC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the population pharmacokinetics of LPV/r and NRTIs when administered as LPV/r&#xD;
           pellets plus AZT/3TC or ABC/3TC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure adherence to the new formulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate children acceptability of the LPV/r pellets and associated dual NRTIs as well&#xD;
           as ease of use by the care giver.&#xD;

             on a second sample by any one of the following assays: rapid test (a third&#xD;
             manufacturer), licensed EIA, Western blot, chemi-luminescence assay, or plasma RNA&#xD;

        treatment initiation/treatment switch,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In case the test is RNA PCR viral load), the sample should be taken before treatment&#xD;
             initiation and analyzed as soon as possible thereafter,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In case the child is already on treatment, the test should be DNA PCR based, the blood&#xD;
             sample can be taken while on treatment and the results be made available as soon as&#xD;
             possible.&#xD;

             according to study entry point (naïve, first line, failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned or concurrent use of NNRTIs, integrase inhibitors, entry inhibitors, or PIs&#xD;
