  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare an enhanced intervention that includes narrative and&#xD;
      game components to a standard intervention that only targets self-monitoring. These&#xD;
      approaches will be tested among postmenopausal breast cancer survivors who are sedentary and&#xD;
      overweight.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Habitual physical activity decreases risk of multiple negative health outcomes, including&#xD;
      breast cancer recurrence and mortality. It is also associated with better quality of life and&#xD;
      reducing negative effects of cancer and cancer treatment. However, most breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors do not engage in sufficient physical activity. Behavior change interventions&#xD;
      produce short-term increases in activity but have difficulty motivating sustained active&#xD;
      lifestyles over longer periods and are not equally effective in women of different&#xD;
      races/ethnicities. The purpose of this study is to test a novel intervention that uses video&#xD;
      games and storytelling to increase motivation. Video game mechanics increase enjoyment and&#xD;
      feelings of autonomy (control), competence, and relatedness to others. All of these feelings&#xD;
      are associated with motivation for activity and, in turn, sustained activity over time.&#xD;
      Additionally, narrative storytelling is an effective method of persuading individuals to&#xD;
      change their behavior. We propose that play of active video games that include compelling&#xD;
      storylines will increase physical activity among a diverse sample of postmenopausal breast&#xD;
      cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a clinical trial that compares the enhanced&#xD;
      intervention (story-based video games) to a standard intervention in 90 sedentary, overweight&#xD;
      postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. Participants in the enhanced group will receive a&#xD;
      mobile device and accessories with two story-based video game applications installed. The&#xD;
      games incorporate behavior change strategies such as self-monitoring and feedback while also&#xD;
      using game mechanics and a lengthy storyline to motivate physical activity. Participants in&#xD;
      the standard group will receive the same mobile device with an electronic activity monitor&#xD;
      and its companion feedback application. Both groups will receive brief weekly telephone&#xD;
      counseling. By comparing two groups that both receive typical behavior change intervention&#xD;
      components (counseling) and a novel electronic intervention, we will be able to investigate&#xD;
      the specific effects of game mechanics and storytelling on motivation and physical activity.&#xD;
      We will measure changes in physical activity, fitness, function, and quality of life from the&#xD;
      beginning of the study to 6 months. We will also investigate further changes during an&#xD;
      additional 6 month follow-up period in which participants keep their intervention tools but&#xD;
      do not receive any counseling, to measure maintenance of activity. This project will develop&#xD;
      and test a promising, innovative intervention that has the potential to be used on a&#xD;
      widespread basis in clinical and community settings.&#xD;
