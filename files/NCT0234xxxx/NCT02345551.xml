      This project will assess the feasibility of a 12-week physical activity program developed&#xD;
      specifically for females exposed to a known occupational carcinogen - shiftwork. Physical&#xD;
      activity has been shown to decrease cancer risk, but the investigators research has found&#xD;
      that female shift workers face unique barriers to participating in physical activity. This&#xD;
      project will use a combination of telephone-based behavioural counseling sessions with a&#xD;
      physical activity coach, and innovative web-based physical activity tracking software using a&#xD;
      Fitbit and website or smartphone app to address commonly reported barriers to physical&#xD;
      activity in female shift workers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently 4.1 million Canadians are employed in shiftwork. Shiftwork, defined as the&#xD;
      organization of working time to cover more than the usual 8-hour workday and up to a 24-hour&#xD;
      period, is prevalent in health care, emergency services, manufacturing, retail and&#xD;
      hospitality. Given the growing demand for goods and services at all hours in today's society,&#xD;
      the number of shift workers is unlikely to decrease. There is emerging evidence that&#xD;
      shiftwork has many negative health implications, including a higher risk of cancer and other&#xD;
      chronic diseases. A recent systematic review by members of the investigators study team&#xD;
      reported preliminary evidence that changes in shift scheduling, timed exposure to bright&#xD;
      light during a night shift, and pharmacological therapy for sleep, help to improve sleep and&#xD;
      markers of circadian rhythm dysfunction in shift workers. However changes in shift schedules,&#xD;
      and exposure to bright light may be difficult to implement in certain workplaces (i.e.,&#xD;
      specific hospital environments, police patrol cars) and long-term effects of pharmacological&#xD;
      therapy are unknown. To date there is very limited research on effective health promotion&#xD;
      strategies in this occupational group, who face unique challenges to engaging in health&#xD;
      behaviour change. There is an urgent need to develop and evaluate interventions to improve&#xD;
      health and reduce cancer risk in this high-risk population. Participation in regular physical&#xD;
      activity is known to decrease risk of cancer and other chronic diseases, and may be a simple&#xD;
      and cost-effective intervention that could be implemented in workplaces and by individual&#xD;
      workers to mitigate this increased risk. Shift workers have unique barriers to participating&#xD;
      in physical activity; therefore the feasibility of implementing such interventions must first&#xD;
      be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To assess the feasibility of a 12-week telephone and web-based physical activity&#xD;
      intervention in female shift workers, including recruitment, retention, adherence and&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To explore changes in physical activity (min/week), health behaviours (i.e.,&#xD;
      sedentary time, sleep), and quality of life that may occur during the intervention in&#xD;
      preparation for a full randomized controlled trial (RCT) if the intervention is found to be&#xD;
      feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the aim of the study is to evaluate feasibility, the investigators will use a single-group&#xD;
      pre-post intervention design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The behaviour change intervention to promote an increase in min/week of moderate-vigorous&#xD;
      physical activity will be guided by the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) model. This&#xD;
      model aims to promote behaviour change through increasing self-efficacy for intention,&#xD;
      planning and maintenance of physical activity. The goal is for participants to meet Canada's&#xD;
      Physical Activity Guidelines for adults of 150 min/week of moderate-vigorous physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a compliment to the behavioural counseling sessions, participants will be asked to track&#xD;
      their physical activity. All participants will be given a FitBit wrist-worn activity monitor&#xD;
      (www.fitbit.com) which monitors step counts, distance covered, and active minutes and also&#xD;
      tracks sleep. The FitBit synchronizes wirelessly to the participants' computer and/or&#xD;
      smartphones, thus minimizing the need for daily data entry tracking by participants.&#xD;
