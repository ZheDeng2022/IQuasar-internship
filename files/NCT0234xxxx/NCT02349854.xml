    <textblock>
      Seborrheic dermatitis is a common, inflammatory skin condition that causes flaky, white to&#xD;
      yellowish scales to form on oily areas such as the scalp or inside the ear. These scales can&#xD;
      occur with or without underlying reddened skin. In addition to causing psychological&#xD;
      distress, low self esteem, and embarrassment, seborrheic dermatitis is associated with scalp&#xD;
      pruritus (itch). Treatment modalities exist to control scalp flaking and itch associated with&#xD;
      seborrheic dermatitis, although such therapies often lose efficacy over time. As seborrheic&#xD;
      dermatitis is a chronic (life-long) condition, better treatments are needed. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to better characterize in subjects with seborrheic dermatitis involving&#xD;
      the scalp versus normal scalp controls: (a) the clinical characteristics of the associated&#xD;
      itch and (b) the pattern of nerve innervation to the scalp. In this way, the investigators&#xD;
      hope to get a comprehensive understanding of the factors causing scalp itch with the aim that&#xD;
      this information will create new candidates to which treatment modalities can be designed. At&#xD;
      least 12 (up to 20) subjects and similar number of control subjects without disease will have&#xD;
      one clinic visit including questionnaires, testing of sensation on the scalp, and biopsy of&#xD;
      the scalp.&#xD;

      Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a common skin disorder that mainly affects the scalp, causing&#xD;
      scale, itch, and red skin. Dandruff, a subset of SD, shows scale and itch in the absence of&#xD;
      associated red skin. Seborrheic dermatitis can occur on many different body areas, including&#xD;
      the scalp, eyebrows, eyelids, creases of the nose, lips, behind the ears, in the outer ear,&#xD;
      and middle of the chest. On the scalp, SD is commonly associated with pruritus (itch).&#xD;
      Multifactorial theories have been proposed regarding the pathogenesis of SD, and these&#xD;
      include irritation from a skin-based yeast called malessizia, overproduction of sebum by&#xD;
      sebaceous glands in the affected skin areas, and individual variability. Specifically,&#xD;
      malassezia produce free fatty acids from sebaceous gland-produced triglycerides, and these&#xD;
      free fatty acids have an &quot;irritant&quot; (ie, non-immunologic) effect in those patients with a&#xD;
      &quot;susceptible predisposition.&quot; Other factors associated with flares of SD include stress,&#xD;
      fatigue, weather extremes, infrequent shampoos or skin cleaning, use of lotions that contain&#xD;
      alcohol, skin disorders (such as acne), obesity, neurologic conditions (including Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease, stroke, and head injury), and HIV infection. What role, if any, such factors play in&#xD;
      the etiology of scalp pruritus in patients with SD is not known. Furthermore, itch is&#xD;
      signaled by specific subsets of nerves in the skin and whether pruritus of SD results from&#xD;
      alteration of these nerves by the underlying inflammatory state is unknown. Moreover,&#xD;
      pruritus from the skin can be a result of peripheral sensitization, where skin-derived&#xD;
      signals activate nerves in the skin to send increased nerve signals into the central nervous&#xD;
      system. Pruritus sensed in the skin can also be a result of altered central-nervous system&#xD;
      processing of skin-derived nerve signals, such as when skin-derived touch or pain is&#xD;
      misperceived as itch by the central nervous system. Whether itch in patients with SD is a&#xD;
      result of peripheral and/or central sensitization is also not unknown. Understanding this&#xD;
      distinction has therapeutic implications, in that itch that is a result of misprocessing by&#xD;
      the central nervous system will not be adequately treated, in the short term, by&#xD;
      skin-administered topical therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand the etiology of scalp pruritus in subjects with SD, we will determine&#xD;
      the clinical characteristics of scalp pruritus in subjects with SD compared with normal&#xD;
      controls, as well as to determine the relationship between scalp pruritus and changes in&#xD;
      cutaneous innervation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exploratory and pilot study has only a single planned visit to the outpatient&#xD;
      Dermatology clinic in Shapiro center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who carry the diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis and scalp itch, or controls who&#xD;
      don't, (either internally referred through routine visits to outpatient Dermatology clinics&#xD;
      at BMC or externally referred from outside providers or who respond to recruitment&#xD;
      techniques) will undergo an initial phone screening to review inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. This screening will involve anonymous screening questions without collection of&#xD;
      personal health information. Subjects/controls that meet the criteria to be eligible for the&#xD;
      study will then be asked if they are willing to come to BMC for the single study visit. Those&#xD;
      subjects/controls that then agree to be scheduled will next be told that we are seeking&#xD;
      informed consent by phone for the following minimal risk procedures in preparation for the&#xD;
      study visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to place a unique patient code identifier on the screening form and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. if they are willing to stop using any topical scalp treatments for seborrheic&#xD;
           dermatitis/dandruff as well as (c) to stop any prn or elective use of prescribed or&#xD;
           over-the counter antihistamines for at least 3 weeks before their scheduled visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (d) if they are willing not to wash their hair for at least 48 hours prior to the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consent process will include highlighting that the individual can stop the &quot;washout&quot; at&#xD;
      anytime. Those subjects/controls, after undergoing informed consent process read to them over&#xD;
      the phone, that agree to (a) and (b) and (c) above, will then be scheduled for a one hour&#xD;
      visit at the outpatient Dermatology floor during a non-clinic time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this visit, all subjects/controls will first undergo the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visual and non-invasive inspection of the scalp&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Completion by the patient of a visual analogue scale (VAS) score to measure degree of&#xD;
           scalp pruritus over the past week. This VAS form will have no identifiable health&#xD;
           information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Review of the inclusion/exclusion criteria answers they provided over the phone, that&#xD;
           after informed consent by phone at the time they gave those answers, they agreed to&#xD;
           allow us to store with a unique subject/control identifying code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above 3 minimal risk procedures (one of which the patients have already provided informed&#xD;
      consent for), will happen before &quot;study visit screening&quot; (described in detail in Screening&#xD;
      Section 20.0 below) and the second informed consent process is performed. This order is to&#xD;
      respect the patient's time. If they no longer meet inclusion/exclusion criteria based on the&#xD;
      above minimal risk screening, they will not be eligible for the study and so would then have&#xD;
      unnecessarily undergone additional screening as well as an informed consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining written informed consent to participate in the study, the following will&#xD;
      occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Female subjects of child-bearing potential will take a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects/controls will fill-out a questionnaire for pruritus and a questionnaire that&#xD;
           contains additional targeted questions related to their scalp itch and hair care&#xD;
           practices&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigators will assess scalp to identify involved, pruritic sites along EEG lead axis&#xD;
           T3-O1 or, secondarily, along EEG lead axis C3 to Pz. EEG testing is a standard&#xD;
           non-invasive neurologic test in which scalp electrodes are placed in well-defined and&#xD;
           specified positions on the scalp. We will not be doing an EEG or using electrodes. We&#xD;
           are simply using the anatomic landmarks specified for EEG placement to allow uniform&#xD;
           selection of scalp areas to test and biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Digital photographs of the patient's head, focusing on the scalp will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. At the selected scalp site, an investigator will perform the following tests for central&#xD;
           sensitization, at the selected scalp site (see below for methods for these tests):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Warm heat (methods section below explains this procedure) to assess it is or is not&#xD;
                felt as itch using 3 mm diameter metal probe&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Alloknesis (brush to itch: if possible on scalp with hair)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hyperknesis (enhanced sensation of itch to pinprick)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of itch elicited by insertion of a cowhage spicule into the scalp (if&#xD;
                possible on scalp with hair). This procedure is described in detail below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The investigator will then perform a single scalp biopsy procedure at the site of&#xD;
           central sensitization testing, according to standard of care practices. The 2mm specimen&#xD;
           will be placed into formalin for routine paraffin-embedding. The 3mm specimen will be&#xD;
           placed into a special fixative that optimizes immunohistochemistry on frozen sections to&#xD;
           detect antigens expressed by nerves. These specimens will be labeled with the&#xD;
           subjects/control's unique identifying code only and without personal health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This one visit completes the subjects/control's entire participation in the study. No&#xD;
      additional visits will be scheduled (unless the individual has opted for suture option and&#xD;
      removal of these sutures at BMC) but the subject/control will be provided the contact&#xD;
      information of the investigator in the rare event that the subject/control requires further&#xD;
      care as a complication of the biopsy procedure, such as bleeding, persistent pain, infection,&#xD;
      and/or failure to heal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all biopsies, the density and distribution of different subsets of cutaneous nerve fibers&#xD;
      will be determined by immunohistochemistry in the frozen-fixed tissue and the presence or&#xD;
      absence of histopathologic features of seborrheic dermatitis will be evaluated in the&#xD;
      paraffin-embedded tissue. Left over tissue from either the frozen and/or the&#xD;
      paraffin-embedded tissue will be saved in a repository if the individual consents, and the&#xD;
      storage of these tissues and safeguards are described in detail in the tissue banking section&#xD;
      of the BMC approved IRB protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated Duration of Enrollment (how long will it take to recruit the required sample size):&#xD;
      One year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated Duration of Entire Study (estimated duration from initial IRB approval through data&#xD;
      analysis to close of study): Two years Sample Size- Total=60 patients with scalp itch and&#xD;
      seborrheic dermatitis =30&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  consent and/or fully participate in study = 20&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  expected drop outs withdrawal and terminations = 5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  screened and not enrolled = 5 patients without scalp itch and without seborrheic&#xD;
           dermatitis =30&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  consent and/or fully participate in study = 20&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  expected drop outs withdrawal and terminations = 5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  screened and not enrolled = 5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the proposed study is exploratory in intent and does not require a formal power&#xD;
      statement, we can nonetheless estimate power for the primary outcome of no central&#xD;
      sensitization in patients with seborrheic dermatitis versus controls for the planned sample&#xD;
      size of 20 subjects. The expected average mean score for a patient with central sensitization&#xD;
      is 3 out of 10 and for a control patient 1 out of 10 with a standard deviation of 1.&#xD;
      Therefore, for there to be no difference between both groups, we would expect both groups to&#xD;
      have a mean score of 1 with a standard deviation of 1. In this case, if there is truly no&#xD;
      difference between the control and experimental group (ie, no central sensitization), then 36&#xD;
      total patients (18 per group) are required to be 80% sure, 40 total patients (20 per group)&#xD;
      are required to be 85% sure, and 44 total patients (22 per group) are required to be 90%&#xD;
      sure, that the 90% two-sided confidence interval will exclude a difference in means of more&#xD;
      than 1. We feel that in this instance, certainty over 80% will be clinically meaningful and&#xD;
      have opted for 40 instead of 36 to better ensure the date achieves at least 80% certainty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the total number per cohort, some number of patients will contact us and undergo&#xD;
      anonymous screening questions without collection of personal health information. This number&#xD;
      is difficult to predict, and those patients that do not meet eligibility criteria based on&#xD;
      the answers to these anonymous screening questions, are not included in either cohort as&#xD;
      there is no risk to them, again because no personal health information is being collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study design is one in which for each one of the three specific aims described&#xD;
      above, there is one dependent variable (outcome) and 1 independent variable (2 independent&#xD;
      populations: subjects with seborrheic dermatitis and scalp itch and controls without scalp&#xD;
      itch or seborrheic dermatitis). For non-normal data, we intend to use a non-parametric test,&#xD;
      such as the Mann Whitney or Wilcoxon rank sum test to assess for statistical differences&#xD;
      between the medians between these populations. In addition, we will use non-parametric&#xD;
      analysis, such as the Spearman correlation to correlate results of the skin testing with&#xD;
      results of the immunohistochemical counts of nerves. If in fact distributional assumptions&#xD;
      are met to allow parameteric analysis, we will use a 2 independent sample t-test to assess&#xD;
      for statistical differences between the means.&#xD;

First, the site will be anesthetized and within this area, 2 immediately adjacent (ie contiguous) punch biopsies will be taken-2mm &amp; 3mm. Both will be closed simultaneously using either (i) non fast-absorbing gut sutures, requiring a 10-14 day follow-up visit for suture removal; (ii) fast absorbing gut sutures that will not require a subsequent suture removal visit, or (iii) gel foam without stitches that also does not require a suture removal visit. Wound care instruction will be discussed with patient. The patient will be instructed to apply petroleum jelly at least 3 times per day to the biopsy site, reflecting standard of care clinical care at BMC.</description>
