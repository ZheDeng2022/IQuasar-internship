    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of Iodine-impregnated self-adhesive plastic drapes (IIAD) on&#xD;
      the quantity of skin bacteria, which is a known factor in the development of surgical site&#xD;
      infections in orthopedic surgery. 16 patients scheduled for total knee replacement surgery&#xD;
      (TKA) are recruited for participation in an intervention performed at the orthopedic ward of&#xD;
      Odense University Hospital, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right or left patient knee is randomized to receive draping with IIAD, while the other knee&#xD;
      is not draped. Local standard preoperative procedure for knee surgery is then simulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 75 minutes both knee are sampled for bacterial quantity using the cup scrub method and&#xD;
      samples are aerobically incubated. The bacterial growth of the IIAD and no-drape group are&#xD;
      then compared using nonparametric statistics.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical site infection (SSI) is a serious complication to orthopaedic surgery, resulting in&#xD;
      re-operation and prolonged recovery (1, 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prevent SSI, prophylactic methods have been introduced as part of procedure in many types&#xD;
      of surgery. Prophylactic strategies such as preoperative disinfection using chlorhexidine or&#xD;
      iodine solutions with alcohol have been shown to decrease the number of skin bacteria prior&#xD;
      to surgical incision or intravenous catheter insertion. (3-7). Creating a completely aseptic&#xD;
      environment for the duration of surgery is however impossible, due to the inability of&#xD;
      preoperative disinfection to completely sterilize the skin, combined with re-colonization of&#xD;
      the patients endogenous flora from hair follicles, sebaceous glands and sweat glands.(6) (8,&#xD;
      9)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of self-adhesive plastic drapes was introduced to prevent contamination of the&#xD;
      surgical site due to re-colonizing skin flora, by blocking the translocation of bacteria from&#xD;
      the skin adjacent to the surgical site into the surgical wound. Self-adhesive plastic&#xD;
      incision drapes are in this way designed to work as a barrier, containing skin flora during&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These types of drapes have however been found to be inferior in preventing bacterial SSI,&#xD;
      compared to newer drape types that incorporates an antiseptic iodine-complex into the drape&#xD;
      adhesive, facing the skin (10, 11) This outcome might be explained by a drape-induced&#xD;
      &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; supported by evidence of increased bacterial colonization-rate with the&#xD;
      intraoperative use of non-iodine self-adhesive plastic drapes (12, 13). This effect may be a&#xD;
      result of relative occlusion of the skin leading to an increase in skin hydration.(14) This&#xD;
      increase in bacterial growth has never been demonstrated in iodine impregnated self-adhesive&#xD;
      incision drapes (IIAD) and has been contradicted in studies reporting a reduction in&#xD;
      re-colonization rate of skin bacteria on the abdomen when IIAD was compared to no draping and&#xD;
      non-iodine drapes while other authors reported decrease in surgical wound contamination when&#xD;
      IIAD was used preoperatively in abdominal surgery (3, 15)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of the superiority of IIAD to non-iodine drapes, it has recently been concluded by&#xD;
      a meta-analysis, that the use of IIAD does not reduce SSI incidence compared to no draping&#xD;
      (10). This conclusion has been criticized for being due to type 2 error resulting from the&#xD;
      relatively low rate of SSI in clean surgery (16) The review does, however, contain minimal&#xD;
      data from the use of IIAD in orthopaedic surgery. The transferability of its conclusions to&#xD;
      an orthopaedic setting is therefore questionable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin flora, predominately staphylococci, is the primary course of SSI in orthopaedic surgery&#xD;
      (17, 18) and has also been shown to constitute the majority of the recolonizing species on&#xD;
      the skin (8, 19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIAD has therefore become a part of standard preoperative procedure in many orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgical setting in the hospitals of Southern Denmark, including Odense University Hospital&#xD;
      and Svendborg Hospital. This decision may be justified by in-vitro studies concluding marked&#xD;
      bactericidal effect of IIAD on a broad range of bacterial species, especially staphylococci.&#xD;
      (16) The bactericidal effect of IIAD has also been evaluated in-vivo in hip surgery, where&#xD;
      bactericidal effect and significant reduction in wound contamination was reported when IIAD&#xD;
      was applied 24 hours prior to skin sampling (20). The bactericidal effect has however not&#xD;
      been evaluated when IIAD is applied at the surgical start prior to incision, as is normal&#xD;
      practice in orthopaedic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-colonization of skin bacteria following disinfection has been shown to occur completely or&#xD;
      partially within 7 days when the skin is disinfected with a chlorhexidine or iodine solution&#xD;
      and covered with a polyurethane dressing, not containing antimicrobials.(21-24)&#xD;
      Re-colonization may however already be detectable within few hours following disinfection.&#xD;
      This has however not been associated with a significant increase in SSI rates.(3, 13) It is&#xD;
      worth noting that some evidence suggests that skin preparation solutions containing&#xD;
      chlorhexidine, may reside on the skin and provide residual antiseptic action on its own.&#xD;
      (25-27)&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIAD has not been shown to improve the incidence of SSI in non-orthopaedic surgery and some&#xD;
      retrospective evidence suggest similar findings in hip surgery (28). It is therefore of great&#xD;
      relevance to shine further light on the effect of IIAD in an orthopaedic surgical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motivation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iodine impregnated self-adhesive plastic drapes have been used in many types of surgery for&#xD;
      years. Despite of this, its use has not been proven to decrease the incidence of SSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SSI resulting in intraarticular infections with skin bacteria is a well-known and serious&#xD;
      complication to orthopaedic surgery. The evaluation of prophylactic measures such as IIAD is&#xD;
      therefore desperately needed. In spite is this, orthopaedic surgery is poorly represented in&#xD;
      the current literature on the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the goal of our study to add to the knowledge on the effect of the use of IIAD on&#xD;
      dermal bacterial growth in an orthopaedic surgical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of intraoperative application of&#xD;
      iodine impregnated self-adhesive drapes on the bacterial quantity (colony forming units) of&#xD;
      the skin in patients scheduled for total knee replacement surgery (TKA). We wish to&#xD;
      investigate if intraoperative draping with an IIAD increases re-colonization with skin&#xD;
      microbes compared to no drape use during simulated TKA surgery. Primary outcome is microbial&#xD;
      quantity, while secondary outcome is identification of viable organisms on the skin. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that IIAD increases re-colonization of skin microbes compared to no drape use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as an experimental randomized controlled trial performed in a parallel&#xD;
      setting. Patients will serve as their own control and allocation ratio is therefore equal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are recruited in a prospective manner through the outpatient clinic for&#xD;
      osteoarthritis of the knee, Odense University Hospital. The attending physician screens&#xD;
      patients for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are eligible for inclusion if they are scheduled for total knee replacement surgery&#xD;
      through Odense University Hospital. Reasons for exclusion are listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      A difference in bacterial quantity of a factor 10 (1.0 log10) between intervention and&#xD;
      control group is judged to be of clinical significance in the development of SSI. To detect a&#xD;
      difference of 1.0 log in bacterial quantity with a power level of 80%, a significance level&#xD;
      of 5% and a standard deviation 1.0 log10, a sample size of 16 knees in each group is&#xD;
      required, necessitating the inclusion of 16 patients . To recruit this number of patients, an&#xD;
      inclusion period of 6 months is anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee allocation to the draping vs. non-draping group will be randomized. Randomization&#xD;
      ensures that difference in bacterial flora between the patients knees has minimal effect on&#xD;
      outcome. Potential allocation bias is minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the allocation will be assigned using envelopes containing numbered paper&#xD;
      sheets. The quality of the envelopes is assessed to ensure that allocation cannot be&#xD;
      determined without opening the envelopes. 30 envelopes will be prepared, determining&#xD;
      allocation. An external party will prepare the envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even numbers allocates the participant to draping of the right knee, while odd numbers&#xD;
      allocate to left-side draping. The envelopes will contain even quantity of even and odd&#xD;
      numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We do not suspect that knowledge of knee allocation is important for study outcome. It is&#xD;
      therefore not deemed necessary to blind participants or researchers from the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will take place in the surgical section of the orthopaedic ward of Odense&#xD;
      University hospital. Patients are greeted and asked to change to local patient clothing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are positioned supine in a standard operating theatre, with active laminar flow and&#xD;
      surgical lamps . An operating drape will be set up at the level of the patient's waist to&#xD;
      ensure minimal contamination by the patients breathing. Both knees are disinfected using a&#xD;
      curcumin coloured solution of 0,5% chlorhexidine in 96% ethanol applied in a painting motion&#xD;
      in 2 sessions of 10 seconds separated by a 30 second drying period. The disinfected area is&#xD;
      then left to completely dry. Disinfection is followed by standard covering of the areas&#xD;
      adjacent to the surgical site using surgical drapes. One knee is subsequently draped with an&#xD;
      iodine plastic adhesive drape (Ioban 2), while the other knee is left uncovered. Application&#xD;
      of the drape is done in accordance with 3M guidelines.(11) If the participant has long hair&#xD;
      on the legs, these are trimmed using electrical clippers prior to the intervention. The&#xD;
      patient is then asked to remain supine on the operating table for 75 minutes. Following&#xD;
      disinfection and subsequent draping of both knees, the operating table is placed the&#xD;
      beach-chair position and the patient is offered a pillow to support their knees. This is&#xD;
      placed under the surgical drapes. The beach-chair position minimizes the discomfort of having&#xD;
      to stay supine by elevating the patient's head and ensuring some flexion of the knees. The&#xD;
      patient is allowed to move their legs in a controlled manner, so as not to contaminate the&#xD;
      contralateral knee. Both knees must be moved equally to ensure equal stress on the skin of&#xD;
      the sampling site during intervention. The patient´s torso is covered with a &quot;Bair Hugger&quot;&#xD;
      blanket to prevent hypothermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher and nurse will be wearing hairnet, sterile operation garments, sterile gloves&#xD;
      and facemask during disinfection and application of draping. The project nurse, with&#xD;
      experience in applying the draping, will do so in conformity with standard hospital&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many methods of bacteriological skin sampling have been used in earlier studies. Since the&#xD;
      outcome of this study is to compare mean bacterial quantity, we decide to use a modified&#xD;
      version of the cup-scrub technique/cylinder sampling method, which is a standard method for&#xD;
      testing preoperative skin preparation.(21, 29, 30)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This method samples the skin using a cylinder restricting the area of sampling to a small&#xD;
      area covered by the drape. 1 ml of the sampling solution is applied to the sampling cylinder.&#xD;
      The sample site is then rubbed with moderate pressure in an even grid formation with at&#xD;
      sterile, plastic inoculation loop for 1 minute. After rubbing, the sampling solution is&#xD;
      collected in a sterile test tube using a sterile pipette. The sampling process is then&#xD;
      repeated, yielding another sample, which is pooled with the former.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using two scrubs instead of one, the percentage of organisms removed from the sample site&#xD;
      is increased, while scrubbing the cutaneous surface appears to be a vital part of the&#xD;
      sampling process. Even though the majority of organisms are located on or near the surface of&#xD;
      the skin, some have adherent properties, while others are situated in deeper parts of the&#xD;
      horny layer and hair follicles. This might explain why washing of the sample site without&#xD;
      scrubbing is inferior to the scrub-method, only yielding under half of the organisms sampled&#xD;
      by scrubbing (30). The efficiency of this method has been evaluated by other authors and is&#xD;
      seen as an appropriate approach to skin sampling when the goal is to evaluate both&#xD;
      superficial and resident/&quot;hidden&quot; flora.(5, 6, 31)&#xD;
&#xD;
      We acknowledge that sampling of skin bacteria will only yield a fraction of the total flora&#xD;
      due to the relative inaccessibility of the deep residing flora. (6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin samples are taken bilaterally from the distal anterior thigh prior to disinfection to&#xD;
      assess normal bacterial quantity. Following disinfection and complete evaporation of any&#xD;
      alcohols, baseline samples will be taken from both knees in order to document equal bacterial&#xD;
      quantity prior to draping. After the duration of the intervention (75 minutes),&#xD;
      post-intervention samples will be taken from the no-drape knee, followed by opening of the&#xD;
      Ioban draping over he sampling areas using sterile a scissor and surgical forceps. The skin&#xD;
      is then sampled. Samples will be taken from a suprapatellar skin area, corresponding to the&#xD;
      skin covering the borders of the quadriceps femoris muscle tendon and from an infrapatellar&#xD;
      area of skin covering borders of the patellar ligament. These areas correspond to the skin&#xD;
      bordering the incision line of the medial para-patellar approach commonly used in TKA&#xD;
      surgery. The precise area for sampling in these regions is chosen at sampling time to enable&#xD;
      minimal leakage between the skin and the sampling cylinder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 plates containing 5% blood agar are placed on a table in a distance of maximum 1 m from the&#xD;
      knees. These plates will be uncovered and open to inoculation by the microorganisms in the&#xD;
      air of the operating theatre at the start of the intervention time of 75 minutes following&#xD;
      draping. The plates are covered at the end of the intervention, following final knee&#xD;
      sampling. An unused sample of the sampling fluid is plated in duplicate and will serve as a&#xD;
      negative control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same researcher will perform all sampling, thereby ensuring consistency in the sampling&#xD;
      routine. A nurse aids in the sampling process. The control knee will be sampled first to&#xD;
      prevent pre-sampling contamination of the contralateral knee, when the self-adhesive draping&#xD;
      is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher and nurse will be wearing hairnet, sterile operation garments, sterile gloves&#xD;
      and a facemask during sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample solution and neutralizer system&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin is sampled using a sampling solution consisting of phosphate buffer solution (PBS)&#xD;
      containing 10% polysorbate 80 (Tween 80), 1% lecithin, 0,5% Sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate&#xD;
      and 0,1% Triton-x 100 with pH adjusted to 7,9. (21, 32-35)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neutralizer system is to be validated in accordance to the American Society for Testing&#xD;
      and Materials (ASTM) standard E-1054-08 &quot;Standard test methods for evaluation of&#xD;
      in-activators of antimicrobial agents&quot; using Staph. epidermidis as the challenge organism&#xD;
      with an exposure time of 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample handling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following sampling, pooled samples are immediately plated in the operating theater. This&#xD;
      ensures optimal bacterial viability in the presence of triton-x and carry-over contamination&#xD;
      of the skin antiseptics, which has been shown to inhibit bacterial growth even in very small&#xD;
      concentrations(33, 36-38). A validation study on properties of the sampling fluid showed no&#xD;
      inhibition of microorganism growth when plating was performed within 30 minutes of sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inoculated plates are then transported to the microbiological department of OUH for&#xD;
      incubation after the end of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee samples will be serially diluted in a sterile phosphate buffer in ten-fold dilutions to&#xD;
      10-3 for pre-disinfection samples and 10-1 for post-disinfection samples. Aliquots of 100-200&#xD;
      microliters of each diluted and undiluted specimen is then spread in duplicate on 5% blood&#xD;
      agar plates. All plates are then aerobically incubated for 36-48 hours at 35 degrees Celsius.&#xD;
      The air-inoculated plates and negative control plates are incubated along with the knee&#xD;
      samples for 36-48 hours at 35 degrees Celsius.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be marked in accordance to the coding system described in the data management&#xD;
      section of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of colony forming units, CFUs, in the samples is then determined. N. Milandt will&#xD;
      perform CFU counting with assistance from staff of the microbiological department of OUH. All&#xD;
      plates will be photographed so that subsequent recounting can be performed if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facilities&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Orthopaedic ward of The Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Odense University Hospital&#xD;
      (OUH), will supply operating theatres for the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Department of Clinical Microbiology, OUH, supplies laboratory facilities for microbial&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate no complications or side effect to the intervention of this study. Being&#xD;
      positioned in a supine position for 75 minutes may produce minor discomfort and can result in&#xD;
      back pain for some patients. Removal of the Ioban draping can be associated with discomfort&#xD;
      caused by adherence to the hair of the lower extremity. Application of disinfection solution&#xD;
      containing curcumin, may result in staining on the skin that can be difficult to remove&#xD;
      completely immediately following the intervention. This discolouration will however disappear&#xD;
      within a few days with normal shedding of the epidermis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information regarding the project and its intervention will be presented to the participants&#xD;
      verbally and in writing. Patients will first be contacted verbally and handed written&#xD;
      information about the project. Patients expressing interest in participating will later&#xD;
      receive verbal information, given by the main researcher. If the patient needs additional&#xD;
      information regarding the project, they are supplied with the contact information of the&#xD;
      project nurse and main researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Undergraduate N. Milandt has taken the initiative for the project in cooperation with&#xD;
      Professor, MD, S. Overgaard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No members of this researcher group have any financial ties to any enterprises that sell or&#xD;
      produce Iodine-impregnated self-adhesive draping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of this study will not receive any compensation for their participation.&#xD;
      Participants will however be offered fruit, snacks and a non-alcoholic beverage following the&#xD;
      intervention and will be eligible for reimbursement of transportation expenses for&#xD;
      transportation up to 100 km round-trip in conformity with current regional agreements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol has been submitted to The Regional Scientific Ethical Committees for Southern&#xD;
      Denmark, and was accepted in June 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data registration&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient data is registered and saved using Epidata. One document contains all patient&#xD;
      information linked to a unique identification (ID) number. This key-file will contain the&#xD;
      social security number and name of all participants along other variables of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from the microbiological analysis are recorded in a separate document only containing&#xD;
      ID numbers. The analysis result will be assigned a code that designate patient ID nr&#xD;
      (1,2,3...), Sample time (Pre- (0), 10 minutes (10) or 75 minutes (75) following&#xD;
      disinfection.). The code will also contain information about leg randomization ((Drape (D) /&#xD;
      No-drape (N)) and sampling site (Suprapatellar (S) / Infrapatellar (I)). All samples are&#xD;
      plated in duplicate and an additional number will therefore be assign to identify the unique&#xD;
      plate and the dilution step for the plate. The unique code is assigned to corresponding plate&#xD;
      with sticker labels and will have a corresponding variable in the data entry form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will by recorded without arithmetic alteration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All entry variables are documented in a codebook.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Encryption&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data is encrypted using the integrated Epidata encryption module based on Advanced&#xD;
      Encryption Standard encryption protocols. The key-file linking ID numbers to social security&#xD;
      numbers will be encrypted using this standard. Plate photographs are saved only containing&#xD;
      the patients assigned code and cannot be linked to an identifiable individual without&#xD;
      unlocking the main data files. The sample data file will not contain any person sensitive&#xD;
      information and will therefore not be encrypted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Backup&#xD;
&#xD;
      Back up of all project documents and files are performed weekly to a secure server of the&#xD;
      computer system of Odense University Hospital. N. Milandt will have sole access to the backed&#xD;
      up data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N. Milandt will serve as contact person and will have the main responsibility for the project&#xD;
      data. All Data will be stored and published in accordance with the decisions of The Danish&#xD;
      Data Protection Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and statistical inference&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cleaning of data&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure valid outcomes when data is log transformed, the minimal value of&#xD;
      measurement is set to 1 resulting in 0 log10 following transformation. A duplicate mean of &lt;1&#xD;
      colony forming units (CFU)/plate is set to 0 log10 as a result. The sensitivity of the spread&#xD;
      plate analysis may be lacking in distinguishing between 0 and 1 CFU and merging these values&#xD;
      as a common flooring value of log10 = 0 may therefore be appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial density of the samples performed after disinfection is not expected to exceed the&#xD;
      sample density prior to disinfection. If this is the case the observation is likely due to&#xD;
      contamination and is excluded from analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is the number of CFU grown on the agar plates. This number&#xD;
      includes all viable organisms. Raw data will be converted to CFU/cm2 of skin and then log10&#xD;
      transformed in order to allow assumption of linearity. A mean, representing the entire knee&#xD;
      will be calculated from the infrapatellar and suprapatellar samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean surviving CFU/cm2 are then compared. Comparison will be performed within the same&#xD;
      knee and between knees in the same patient. Samples from one knee are compared at different&#xD;
      sampling times (baseline, 10 minutes after disinfection and 75 minutes after start of&#xD;
      simulated surgery). Analysis between knees will be performed between the drape group and the&#xD;
      non-drape group at all sampling times. Finally, a mean bacterial regrowth will be calculated&#xD;
      as a variable representing the increase in bacterial density between sampling performed&#xD;
      before and after the use of Ioban drape. The regrowth of bacteria in the two settings are&#xD;
      then compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is examined using an exploratory data analysis to justify the assumption of Gaussian&#xD;
      distribution. If this is the case, the analysis will be performed using a two-tailed students&#xD;
      t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the data does not approximate normal distribution, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test&#xD;
      will be used. P ≤0,05 is interpreted as significant. Statistical analysis will be performed&#xD;
      using the data analysis and statistical software, STATA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analytical processes are documented in a data management logbook and a STATA do-file&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of organism present on the skin following the disinfection and the use of Ioban&#xD;
      draping is also of interest in clinical practise. It is, however, not the scope of this study&#xD;
      to produce at detailed quantitative analysis of the frequency of various organisms on the&#xD;
      skin. We will however perform a minor descriptive examination of the skin flora following the&#xD;
      use of Ioban draping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The undiluted growth plates from the 75 min samples of every participant will be&#xD;
      macroscopically examined for unique colonies. Both the draped knee and undraped knee is&#xD;
      analysed. The colonies are then identified using Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization&#xD;
      Time of Flight analysis (MALDI-TOF). Findings will be listed as a prevalence of growth of&#xD;
      specific organisms in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned project start is September 1, 2014. The project will be initiated by a data&#xD;
      collection period of 9 months. During this period a minimum of 16 patients will be recruited&#xD;
      and subjected to project intervention. The last 3 months of the project period will be&#xD;
      dedicated the analysis of data and to production of an article and preparation of a project&#xD;
      presentation. The project is scheduled to end August 31, 2015.&#xD;
