  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II clinical trial is an open label, single arm, multicenter study of the&#xD;
      combination of intravenously administered SGT-53 and oral temozolomide in patients with&#xD;
      confirmed glioblastoma who have proven tumor recurrence or progression. The objective of this&#xD;
      trial is to assess 6 month progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity, safety and possibly to evaluate, nanoparticle delivery to tumor site, and the&#xD;
      induction of apoptosis in the tumor..&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The p53 is a vital human tumor suppressor gene. Loss of p53 suppressor function is present in&#xD;
      the majority of human cancers. The p53 protein has a diverse range of functions including&#xD;
      regulation of cell cycle checkpoints, cell death (apoptosis), senescence, DNA repair,&#xD;
      maintenance of genomic integrity, and control of angiogenesis. Abnormalities of the p53 gene&#xD;
      may impact the efficacy of standard anticancer treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy.&#xD;
      P53 mutation and pathway dysfunction are associated with poor clinical outcomes and the&#xD;
      presence of the p53 mutation correlates with resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. The&#xD;
      development of somatic gene therapy has created the potential to restore wild type function&#xD;
      of p53. SGT-53 is a complex of cationic liposome encapsulating a normal human wild type p53&#xD;
      DNA sequence in a plasmid backbone. This complex has been shown to efficiently and&#xD;
      specifically deliver the p53 cDNA to the tumor cells and to cross the blood-brain barrier.&#xD;
      Introduction of the p53 cDNA sequence is expected to restore wtp53 function in the apoptotic&#xD;
      pathway. P53 restoration has been shown most effective in enhancing cytotoxicity in&#xD;
      combination with an agent which results in DNA damage or initiates apoptosis. The primary&#xD;
      mechanism of resistance to current standard chemotherapeutic agent Temozolomide (TMZ) is&#xD;
      overexpression of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyl transferase (MGMT), which repairs the&#xD;
      TMZ-induced DNA lesion by removing the o6-guanine adducts. Thus, a means to down modulate&#xD;
      MGMT activity would enhance the therapeutic effect of TMZ. A number of reports have indicated&#xD;
      that increasing wtp53 expression can down-regulate expression of DNA repair genes such as&#xD;
      MGMT and increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to alkylating agents. This is a Phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial of the tumor-targeted SGT-53 nanocomplex in combination with chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agent, temozolomide which is the standard of care for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) brain&#xD;
      tumors. We propose to test the combination of SGT-53 and standard temozolomide to determine&#xD;
      efficacy and safety in patients with confirmed glioblastoma who have proven tumor recurrence&#xD;
      or progression.&#xD;

    <description>SGT-53, at 3.6 mg DNA/infusion, will be administered twice weekly in a 28 day cycle starting on Day 1 (cycle 1), Day 29 (cycle 2) and Day 57 (cycle 3). Temozolomide (TMZ) will be administered by mouth daily on days 9-13 of each cycle. Patients who are responding to treatment may receive three additional cycles of SGT-53/TMZ therapy or continue on TMZ alone at investigator's discretion. Surgical resection of recurrent or progressive tumor for tumor analysis is an optional procedure. In these individuals SGT-53, at 3.6 mg DNA/infusion, will be administered twice (on days -1 and -3) in the week prior to surgery. Surgical resection is Day 0. 14-21 days post operatively and having recovered from the effects of surgery, the patients will then start cyclical TMZ with SGT-53 as described above.</description>

        <description>As an indicator of nanoparticle delivery to the tumors, DNA PCR was used to determine the presence of SGT-53 delivered exogenous wt p53 in the tumors. This analysis will be performed on any tumors resected 3 days after the first SGT-53 infusion (optional procedure)</description>
