      The purpose of this pilot study is to test the safety of oral ketamine to treat acute pain&#xD;
      after amputation surgery. The objective of the proposed research is to conclusively determine&#xD;
      if oral ketamine is a safe alternative analgesic to opioid for acute pain in subjects&#xD;
      undergoing elective amputation of the lower extremity. All participants will receive oral&#xD;
      ketamine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective open-label clinical trial to decrease the incidence of expected side effects of&#xD;
      oral ketamine dose administered presurgery and postsurgery, in 10 subjects undergoing&#xD;
      elective amputation of the lower extremity. The primary outcome measure is the incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events. Secondary outcome measures are decreased acute pain levels and decreased&#xD;
      incidence of stump and phantom limb pain at 6 months. Enrollment of participants will occur&#xD;
      at Rush University Medical Center (Rush), Chicago, Illinois. Consented participants will be&#xD;
      included in the study undergoing elective amputation of the lower extremity from all causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for using oral ketamine for acute pain after amputation surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The common analgesic, morphine, has a narrow therapeutic window and numerous side effects.1&#xD;
      Ketamine, is a chemically stable compound, non-opioid with analgesic properties at low doses.&#xD;
      In addition, ketamine stimulates the cardio-respiratory system which is of great benefit in&#xD;
      injured patients.2-4 Ketamine is generally administered by the intravenous (IV) route and&#xD;
      provides analgesia via antagonism of the N-Methyl-D-Asparate (NMDA) receptor. Ketamine has&#xD;
      the added benefit of a wide therapeutic safety index. IV ketamine has been shown to provide&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia in many clinical trials; in particular to reduce opioid consumption.5&#xD;
      Severe acute pain has been shown to progress to chronic pain due to central sensitization.6&#xD;
      Perioperative IV ketamine has been shown in limited studies to decrease the incidence of&#xD;
      chronic pain after surgery. However, the IV route of administration of ketamine has&#xD;
      limitations due to difficulties with IV placement in certain tactical situations. Therefore,&#xD;
      the use of oral ketamine (non-opioid) for the purpose of acute pain management after trauma&#xD;
      or surgery is highly desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic studies: Oral ketamine may seem disadvantageous because of 17%&#xD;
      bioavailability, mainly due to first-pass drug metabolism in the liver. However, there is not&#xD;
      a wide variability in bioavailability from patient-to-patient (mean 16.6%, Standard Error&#xD;
      (SE) = 2.8%) and hence a predictable oral dosing can be achieved. Although investigators have&#xD;
      tested formulations with sublingual or buccal transmucosal administration of ketamine, in&#xD;
      practice they fail to increase the ketamine bioavailability versus oral ketamine. Ketamine as&#xD;
      nasal spray is problematic for acute use, since the amount of drug is difficult to control&#xD;
      using an atomizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 (day of surgery) Before Surgery: An analgesic dose of the oral ketamine (1.0 mg/kg)&#xD;
      will be administered one hour before surgery in the preoperative holding area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject is experiencing any adverse events (e.g. hallucinations) from the 1.0 mg/kg&#xD;
      pre-surgery dose of ketamine, then any further ketamine dosing will be delayed until the&#xD;
      following day (Day 2). In addition, subsequent subjects will receive a 33% reduction of the&#xD;
      pre-surgery dose (i.e. 0.67 mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Surgery: In the recovery room, when subjects are able to swallow, and if there were no&#xD;
      adverse events from the pre-surgery ketamine dose, oral ketamine (1.0 mg/kg) will be&#xD;
      administered (but no earlier than 8 hours after the pre-surgery dose). No doses will be&#xD;
      administered after midnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If adverse events have not resolved by the next morning (Day 2), then oral ketamine will be&#xD;
      discontinued. In addition, subsequent subjects will receive a 33% reduction in the recovery&#xD;
      room dose and/or the last dose of Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2 (first post-op day) Subjects will receive oral ketamine (1.0 mg/kg) 3 times/day. The&#xD;
      first dose will be administered at 6 AM .If a subject experiences any adverse events after&#xD;
      the first dose, but one that resolves within 8 hours after that dose, the second dose will be&#xD;
      reduced by 33% (1.0 mg/mg to 0.67 mg/kg). If a subject experiences any adverse events after&#xD;
      the second dose, but one that resolves within 8 hours, the dose will be reduced again by 33%&#xD;
      (0.67 mg/kg to 0.45 mg/kg). If this dose reduction protocol does not eliminate adverse&#xD;
      events, then oral ketamine will be discontinued. In addition, subsequent subjects will&#xD;
      receive a 33% reduction in the Day 2 oral ketamine doses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 3 (second post-op day) (Tapering Down Period) Subjects will receive oral ketamine at half&#xD;
      of the previous day final dose (0.5 mg/kg if no dose reductions have occurred), 3 times a&#xD;
      day. For example, if the subjects' dose is already at 0.45 mg/kg from the previous day&#xD;
      reductions, then the third day dose will be 0.23 mg/kg. The first dose will be administered&#xD;
      at 6 AM. Even on the third day if there are adverse events after any dose, but one that&#xD;
      resolves within 8 hours after that dose, we will continue to reduce the dose by 33%. If this&#xD;
      dose reduction protocol does not eliminate adverse events, then the subject will not receive&#xD;
      any more ketamine. In addition, subsequent subjects will receive a 33% reduction in the Day 3&#xD;
      oral ketamine doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While in the hospital for 3 days, should breakthrough pain occur, all subjects will receive&#xD;
      standard of care pain control medication. All subjects will be discharged according to&#xD;
      standard discharge protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Adverse Events If a subject experiences adverse events, subjects will be closely&#xD;
      monitored every hour until the event resolves. Adverse event duration and resolution time&#xD;
      will be recorded. If the adverse event resolves, the next scheduled dose will be reduced by&#xD;
      33%. Each adverse event will be assessed by the Principal Investigator and a clinical&#xD;
      relevance determination will be made.&#xD;
