  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Running is a natural part of human locomotion and humans have been running for million of&#xD;
      years. In modern society, running has become a popular way of exercise and is undertaken by&#xD;
      many people worldwide, possibly because it provides a cheap and easily accessible form of&#xD;
      exercise, and the positive effects of running on health and fitness are well known.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, running is also associated with a high risk of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to investigate how a running schedule which focuses either on&#xD;
      running distance or running speed influence the overall risk of injury and the types of&#xD;
      injury sustained in recreational runners.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trails directed at investigating differences in injury risk in relation to the focus of the&#xD;
      running schedule have been conducted without any firm conclusions. People engaged in&#xD;
      recreational running or choosing running as a new and active lifestyle needs guidance on&#xD;
      which running schedules minimize the injury risk, aiding their chance of an active lifestyle&#xD;
      and possibly reversing the increase in people developing a lifestyle disease. To develop&#xD;
      running schedules minimizing the risk of injury, an understanding of the mechanisms that the&#xD;
      different training variables impose on the human body is necessary. The existing literature&#xD;
      on running intensity and the development of injuries show conflicting result. More studies&#xD;
      are necessary to ascertain if there is a relationship between the intensity of running. In&#xD;
      such studies, it is important to include other training variables in the analysis and to&#xD;
      quantify running exposure using an objective method of measuring the relative intensity and&#xD;
      absolute volume.&#xD;
