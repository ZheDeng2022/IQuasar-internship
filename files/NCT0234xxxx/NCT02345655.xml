  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, General Practitioners (GPs) are widely involved in opiate maintenance treatment&#xD;
      (OMT) by initially prescribing buprenorphine and monitoring patients under buprenorphine and&#xD;
      methadone. Number of treated patients is around 150,000 with 75% of them treated by&#xD;
      buprenorphine. Among the guidelines for improving OMT, urine testing is mandatory for&#xD;
      initiating methadone, whereas it is recommended for initiating buprenorphine and during&#xD;
      follow-up. Urine drug tests are based on immunoassay techniques and enable a qualitative&#xD;
      analysis of the recent drug consumption, with detection based on designated thresholds, allow&#xD;
      a better appraisal of drug exposure, before initiating and during OMT. While intrinsic&#xD;
      diagnostic value of these tests is already demonstrated, the consequences of carrying out&#xD;
      these tests on OMT have not been clearly established. Some studies suggest that patients&#xD;
      exposed to drug tests may have a better OMT retention and in patients treated by methadone,&#xD;
      performing urine screening tests has been shown to be associated with a mortality risk&#xD;
      reduction in a Scottish retrospective cohort of opioid addicts. Actually, despite the&#xD;
      recommendations to perform these tests, few GP prescribe tests, and few patients are&#xD;
      regularly screened. Availability of commercial kits for urine drug testing in the medical&#xD;
      office should improve their utilisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The widespread of urine drug screening tests use in ambulatory care is a reality for some GPs&#xD;
      working in addictology networks. Despite a global benefit reported in the literature with a&#xD;
      better control in prescribing OMT and a better patients' adherence, as far as the&#xD;
      investigators know, no study has yet explored the impact of the use of urine drug screening&#xD;
      test in decision making in general practice with an intervention study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a retrospective cohort study of methadone users performed through data obtained from a&#xD;
      primary care prescription registry in Tayside, Scotland, McCowan et al examined the&#xD;
      interaction of patient related factors and prescribing factors at the individual level and&#xD;
      assess their independent impact on the risk of both all-cause mortality and drug dependent&#xD;
      cause specific mortality (McCowan, Kidd et al. 2009). Overall, 181 (8%) people died among&#xD;
      2378 subjects with a median follow-up of 4.38 years. Overuse of methadone, history of&#xD;
      psychiatric admission, and increasing comorbidity were all associated with an increase in&#xD;
      all-cause mortality. Longer duration of use (adjusted hazard ratio 0.95, 0.94 to 0.96),&#xD;
      history of having urine tested (0.33, 0.22 to 0.49), and increasing time since last filled&#xD;
      prescription were protective in relation to all-cause mortality. These factors are likely to&#xD;
      be markers of people who are stabilised on maintenance treatment and engaged in monitoring&#xD;
      procedures or who have successfully completed a methadone treatment reduction programme. This&#xD;
      community based study gives a clear indication of the prescribing, monitoring, and management&#xD;
      of patients in OMT and the subsequent impact on all cause and drug dependent mortality. This&#xD;
      study provides evidence that recommendations on best practice (including specifically&#xD;
      performing UDS) improve patients' outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using data from the French &quot;Methaville&quot; trial, Roux et al (Roux, Michel et al. 2012; Roux,&#xD;
      Lions et al. 2013) investigated the effect of pre-treatment and in-treatment factors on&#xD;
      long-term non-adherence to this OMT. Four pre-treatment predictors of non-adherence were&#xD;
      identified: being female, not having stable housing, alcohol consumption and cocaine use.&#xD;
      These findings highlight the need to appropriately assess psychoactive drug use when starting&#xD;
      OMT, and urine drug testing should be consider as a way to reach this aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of the literature, one would suppose that carrying out UDS would provide an&#xD;
      improvement in the management of patients with abuse or addiction and would be helpful,&#xD;
      particularly in community office-based settings, as office-based management of opioid&#xD;
      dependence grows up (Walley, Alperen et al. 2008). Despite the lack of significant evidence&#xD;
      of efficacy, UDS are recommended to assess the use of psychoactive substances when abuse or&#xD;
      addiction is suspected.&#xD;
