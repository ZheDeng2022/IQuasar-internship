    <textblock>
      The investigators will study the immune cell subpopulations in follicular fluid of patients&#xD;
      undergoing In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment in our clinic. The investigators will&#xD;
      corelate the presence of immature myeloid cells to the ovarian stimulation response as&#xD;
      indicated by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and number of follicles or estradiol level&#xD;
      developed on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration.&#xD;

      The study will be an observational study using discarded material from patients undergoing&#xD;
      IVF treatment. On the day of ovum pick up, the fluid aspirated from the first follicle in&#xD;
      each ovary will be saved and analyzed for cellular content by fluorescence-activated cell&#xD;
      sorter (FACS) analysis and cytokine and hormone by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#xD;
      and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In addition, a total of 5cc of blood will&#xD;
      be drawn from the patient when introducing the intravenous line for analysis of immune cell&#xD;
      composition,hormones and cytokine levels. During the whole study number of oocytes&#xD;
      retrieved,number of mature oocytes,number of fertilizations,implantation rates and clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy rates will be documented as well.&#xD;

    <description>In order to define the poor response in IVF, at least two of the following three features must be present: (i) advanced maternal age or any other risk factor for poor ovarian response; (ii) a previous poor ovarian response; and (iii) an abnormal ovarian reserve test . Two episodes of poor ovarian response after maximal stimulation are sufficient to define a patient as poor responder in the absence of advanced maternal age or abnormal ovarian reserve test. By definition, the term poor ovarian response refers to the ovarian response, and therefore, one stimulated cycle is considered essential for the diagnosis .</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Good responders</arm_group_label>
    <description>Total number of antral follicles : 22-35 Normal (good) antral count, should have an excellent response to ovarian stimulation.Likely to respond well to low doses of FSH drugs.&#xD;
Very low risk for IVF cycle cancellation. Some risk for ovarian overstimulation if a Lupron trigger is not used for final egg maturation injection.&#xD;
Excellent pregnancy success rates.</description>
