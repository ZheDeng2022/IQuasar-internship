    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 clinical study is designed to examine the safety and feasibility of using&#xD;
      anti-CD3/CD28 activated marrow infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs) as treatment of relapse after&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) for patients with hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies with bone marrow involvement of their relapsed disease. These MILs will be&#xD;
      derived from the bone marrow of the relapsed patient who had previously received&#xD;
      post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis&#xD;
      (PTCy-MILs). A bone marrow aspiration will be performed on the patient to collect ~200ml of&#xD;
      marrow for ex vivo expansion. During this expansion process, T cells will be activated and&#xD;
      expanded by co-stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies covalently attached&#xD;
      to super-paramagnetic microbeads. Patients will be treated with salvage therapy while this ex&#xD;
      vivo expansion is ongoing. After the simultaneous salvage therapy and ex vivo expansion, the&#xD;
      activated PTCy-MILs will be reinfused. Patients will be monitored with the primary objective&#xD;
      being the feasibility of expanding to targeted dose levels activated PTCy-MILs that do not&#xD;
      cause grade III-IV acute GVHD within the first 90 days after PTCy-MIL infusion.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feasibility of generating activated PTCy-MILs in patients with relapsed disease&#xD;
           involving the bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Toxicity of PTCy-MILs, specifically the rate of grade III-IV acute GVHD within the first&#xD;
           90 days after PTCy-MIL infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determination of an optimal safe dose for PTCy-MILs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Immunologic characterization of the PTCy-MIL product before and after expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Immune reconstitution after treatment with PTCy-MILs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Incidence and severity of chronic GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Clinical responses (complete remissions, partial remissions, stable disease) as measured&#xD;
           by criteria specific for the particular disease type.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Progression-free and overall survival.&#xD;

    <description>Feasibility is measured as the number of participants who achieve: 1) The successful obtaining of PTCy-MILs; 2) The expansion of PTCy-MILs to at least 70% of the assigned dose level; 3) Successful infusion of PTCy-MILs; 4) The absence of grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) for 90 days after PTCy-MILs infusion. Acute GVHD is defined by the Modified Keystone Criteria.</description>
