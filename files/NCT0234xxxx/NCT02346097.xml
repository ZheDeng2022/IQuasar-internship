      The purpose of this study is to investigate if &quot;optimal electrical resynchronization&quot;&#xD;
      achieved by targeting left ventricular lead placement to the myocardial region with the&#xD;
      latest electrical activation combined with post-implant pacemakersettings for narrowing the&#xD;
      paced QRS width causes an excess improvement in the pumping function of the heart (the left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction) in Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an established therapy in patients with a left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) &lt; 35 %, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) with prolonged&#xD;
      QRS duration (1). The treatment is implemented by implanting a pacemaker with three pacing&#xD;
      leads: One in the right atrium, one in the right ventricle (RV) and one in an epicardial vein&#xD;
      through the coronary sinus, thereby establishing atrial-synchronized biventricular pacing to&#xD;
      coordinate RV and LV contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the convincing effect of CRT on survival, symptoms, and LV function (2,3,4) as much&#xD;
      as 30-40 % of the patients do not benefit clinically from the treatment, so-called&#xD;
      non-responders (5,6). Annually around 600 CRT-systems are implanted in Denmark and about 3000&#xD;
      patients live with a CRT. The risk of complications associated with CRT-treatment is&#xD;
      considerable (7), and a conservative estimate of the expenses for implanting a CRT-device is&#xD;
      DKK 80.000. Consequently, the costs of CRT in non-responders are high, both for the patients&#xD;
      and for the health economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential correctable reasons for non-response to CRT are non-optimal LV lead positioning and&#xD;
      non-optimal pacemaker programming (5). At the Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University&#xD;
      Hospital, Skejby, the clinical practice is to place the LV lead in the non-apical&#xD;
      postero-lateral region aiming towards a myocardial segment with electrical activation&#xD;
      occurring in the second half of the QRS complex in the surface ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective studies have documented an improved response rate to CRT when the LV lead is&#xD;
      placed in a myocardial region with late electrical activation and without scar tissue (8,9).&#xD;
      Furthermore, lack of electrical resynchronization after CRT illustrated by unchanged or&#xD;
      prolonged QRS duration is associated with poor clinical outcome (10) and programming the&#xD;
      interventricular (VV) delay to obtain the narrowest QRS-complex has been suggested to&#xD;
      increase CRT response rate (11,12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent randomized controlled trial (ImagingCRT) conducted at our institution demonstrated&#xD;
      that an imaging guided LV lead placement strategy targeting the latest mechanically activated&#xD;
      myocardial segment (assessed by pre-implant echocardiography) and separate from scar tissue&#xD;
      (determined by pre-implant myocardial scintigraphy) improves clinical response rate to CRT&#xD;
      (data not yet published). This method has the potential to become routine clinical practice&#xD;
      for LV lead placement at our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to investigate if optimal electrical resynchronization achieved by targeting LV lead&#xD;
      placement to the myocardial region with the latest electrical activation determined by&#xD;
      systematic electrical mapping of all available epicardial veins combined with post-implant VV&#xD;
      electrical optimization for narrowing the paced QRS width causes an excess improvement in&#xD;
      LVEF after CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that this will cause an excess increase in LVEF of 4 %, to an absolute&#xD;
      increase in LVEF of 12 % as compared to an absolute increase in LVEF to 8 % using an imaging&#xD;
      guided CRT-implantation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients referred to CRT at Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby will be assessed for&#xD;
      eligibility. Eligibility criteria and outcomes measures elsewhere at clinicaltrial.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Course:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After written informed consent the patient will follow the study course as specified below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day before implantation of the CRT the following investigations are scheduled:&#xD;
      Echocardiography (to asses LV function and dimensions), cardiac CT-scan (to localize all&#xD;
      available epicardial veins), myocardial scintigraphy (82Rubidium positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (Rb-PET)), to determine the extent and distribution of scar tissue and LVEF (13,14)), blood&#xD;
      samples and clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are randomized to EITHER imgaging guided placement of the LV lead targeting the&#xD;
      myocardial region with the latest mechanical activation and VV-interval settings programmed&#xD;
      with simultaneous biventricular pacing (routine CRT-strategy arm) OR LV lead placement guided&#xD;
      by procedural electrical mapping of all available cardiac veins targeting the myocardial&#xD;
      region with the latest electrical activation combined with VV electrical optimization the day&#xD;
      after implantation to achieve the narrowest paced QRS width (intervention arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day after the implantation all patients undergo a high-pitch cardiac CT to verify LV lead&#xD;
      position (15), pacemaker test, programming of VV-intervals and echocardiographic&#xD;
      atrioventricular (AV) optimization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month after the implantation all patients have their pacemaker tested by a research nurse&#xD;
      according to standard clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months after CRT implantation the following investigations are repeated:&#xD;
      Echocardiography, clinical evaluation, pacemaker test and blood samples. Rb-PET is also&#xD;
      repeated to determine potential changes in myocardial perfusion and LVEF. Thereafter the&#xD;
      patient will attend standard controls of the pacemaker every six month according to standard&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Calculations and statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that a CRT-strategy targeting optimal electrical resynchronization will result&#xD;
      in an excess increase of 4 % in LVEF compared with the routine CRT-strategy, where an 8 %&#xD;
      increase is expected. To identify this absolute increase in LVEF and to achieve a statistical&#xD;
      power of 80 %, the study will need a sample size of 98 patients, given a standard deviation&#xD;
      (SD) of 7 % in both groups, and a two-sided alpha value of 0.05. Furthermore, to achieve a&#xD;
      statistical power of &gt; 80 % with a margen of noninferiority of 20 % for the secondary&#xD;
      endpoint of clinical non-response to CRT (assuming a 75 % clinical response rate in the&#xD;
      control group) we will need a sample size of 116 patients (given a two-sided alpha value of&#xD;
      0.05 %). Taking into consideration an expected loss of follow-up in approximately 5 % of the&#xD;
      patients, we will include 122 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. Differences&#xD;
      between groups will be tested using Students t-test, when normality is demonstrated;&#xD;
      otherwise a non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney) is used. Categorical variables will be&#xD;
      analyzed by Ï‡2 test. A two-sided P- value of &lt;0.05 is considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital, have the capacity and equipment to&#xD;
      conduct this trial. The group of investigators contributes with a deep and long-lasting&#xD;
      experience in CRT-treatment and 150 de-novo CRT-devices are annually implanted at our&#xD;
      institution. We plan to enroll the patients during a two and a half-year period. This study&#xD;
      is planned to start in February 2015 as a PhD program for Charlotte Stephansen, MD. Charlotte&#xD;
      Stephansen will be the prime investigator in charge of including the patients and she will&#xD;
      perform all clinical evaluations and image acquisitions during the admission for CRT&#xD;
      implantation and at the six month follow-up. She will also be in charge of analyzing data&#xD;
      after study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be published in peer-reviewed international journals, and are expected to&#xD;
      result in at least three papers. None of the investigators have any conflicts of interest to&#xD;
      declare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted according to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration II. The&#xD;
      study will be approved by The Central Denmark Region Committees on Health Research Ethics,&#xD;
      reported to the Danish Data Protection Agency, and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No prospective randomized trials have previously investigated the effect of a CRT&#xD;
      treatment-strategy targeting optimal electrical resynchronization achieved by guiding LV lead&#xD;
      placement to the myocardial region with the latest electrical activation combined with&#xD;
      post-implant VV electrical optimization for narrowing the paced QRS width.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that this method improves the response to CRT. The human and economic costs of&#xD;
      CRT in non-responders are therefore expected to be reduced. If an excess increase in LVEF is&#xD;
      achieved in this study, it will be possible to prevent and relieve invalidating symptoms and&#xD;
      reduce mortality in selected heart failue patients in the future. The utility and potential&#xD;
      benefits of participating in this study are expected to equalize the risks of exposure to&#xD;
      ionizing radiation, possible side effects and inconvenience to the patient.&#xD;
