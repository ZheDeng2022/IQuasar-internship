    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and initial effectiveness of MRI-guided&#xD;
      focused ultrasound thermal ablation of a designated area in the brain of patients suffering&#xD;
      from medication-refractory MDD, using the ExAblate transcranial system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ExAblate system is a medical device that involves a focused ultrasound system and an MRI&#xD;
      scanner. ExAblate delivers a pulse of focused ultrasound energy, or sonication, to the&#xD;
      targeted tissue. For MDD Patients: one or more thermal lesion will be created on Bilateral&#xD;
      Anterior Limb of internal Capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment begins with a series of standard diagnostic MR images to identify the location&#xD;
      and shape of target to be treated. The ExAblate computer uses the physician's designation of&#xD;
      the target volume to plan the best way to cover the target volume with small spots called&#xD;
      &quot;sonications&quot;. These treatment spots are cylinder shaped. Their size depends on sonication&#xD;
      power and duration. During the treatment, a specific MR scan, which can be processed to&#xD;
      identify changes in tissue temperature, provides a thermal map of the treatment volume to&#xD;
      confirm the therapeutic effect. The thermal map is used to monitor the treatment in progress,&#xD;
      and confirm that the ablation is proceeding according to plan, thus closing the therapy loop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ExAblate transcranial operates a helmet-shaped transducer (currently utilizing&#xD;
      1000-element phased array transducer) positioned above the subject head. The ExAblate&#xD;
      transcranial system also includes means to immobilize the subject head, cool the interface&#xD;
      water, and software for CT analysis and phase correction computation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent and screening, eligible subjects will proceed to the treatment. All&#xD;
      subjects will be followed at Day 1, 7 days, 1 month , and 6 months . At follow up visits,&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated for general health, neurological changes (including MMSE exam),and&#xD;
      efficacy measurements as well as for device/procedure related adverse events that may have&#xD;
      occurred during the follow-up period. Six (6) month follow up visit will also include Full&#xD;
      Battery Cognitive/Neurological Testing&#xD;
