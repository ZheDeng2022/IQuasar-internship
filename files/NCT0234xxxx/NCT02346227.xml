      1. Introduction Cervical cancer (CC) is a major public health problem in Low-income&#xD;
           countries (LICs), particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where the&#xD;
           estimated number of cases is 3839 per year. (WHO, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Persistent infection with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is recognized as the necessary&#xD;
           cause for the development of CC. Thus, CC is a disease that is easily preventable&#xD;
           primarily by vaccination against HPV and secondarily through screening and treatment of&#xD;
           precancerous lesions of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In LICs, the high incidence of CC is due to both high rates of infection with HPV, a&#xD;
           failure to initiate and sustain effective screening programs based on cytology and the&#xD;
           non-availability of vaccination against HPV. These situations highlight the need to&#xD;
           implement simple and inexpensive screening and treatment methods suitable for LICs.&#xD;
           These methods include screening by visual inspection of the cervix after application of&#xD;
           acetic acid (VIA) and treatment with a topical antiviral drug (AV2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluate the clinical efficacy of AV2 as a treatment for HPV-associated lesions of&#xD;
                the uterine cervix;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Identify HPV genotypes found in Kinshasa;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determine the cost-effectiveness of an algorithm combining screening by VIA and AV2&#xD;
                and that combining VIA and cryotherapy treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods After basic training of local health workers on VIA, on collection of cervical&#xD;
           samples for HPV testing (quantitative Polymerase Chain reaction, qPCR) and liquid-based&#xD;
           cytology (LBC) and on application of AV2, a screening and treatment program will be&#xD;
           offered to women aged 25 and older who will give their informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women with lesions on VIA will be randomized into one of two groups to receive either&#xD;
      treatment by AV2 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women with lesions on VIA will be monitored and reviewed after two months and after six&#xD;
      months for repeat tests (VIA and LBC for lesions, qPCR for viral load, conversion and&#xD;
      reinfection rates).&#xD;

      CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1.1. BACKGROUND Cervical cancer (CC) is the third most common cancer&#xD;
      in women, and the seventh overall, with an estimated 530 000 new cases per year. More than&#xD;
      85% of the global burden occurs in low-income countries (LICs). It is responsible for 275 000&#xD;
      deaths per year, about 88% of which occurring in LICs. Overall, the mortality: incidence&#xD;
      ratio is 52. (Ferlay et al, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The link between genital high-risk Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and CC was first&#xD;
      demonstrated in the early 1980s by Harold zur Hausen, a German virologist. (Gissmann, L et&#xD;
      al, 1983) HPV infection may be transient or persistent. When it persists, HPV induces changes&#xD;
      in cells of the cervix, precisely in the transformation zone. These changes constitute the&#xD;
      precursor lesions of cervical cancer. These precursor lesions are either called precancerous&#xD;
      lesions, dysplasia or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Left untreated, they can&#xD;
      progress from mild (CIN1) to moderate (CIN 2) to severe (CIN 3) dysplasia, and then to&#xD;
      cancer. It appears that dysplasia is asymptomatic and progresses to cancer over a prolonged&#xD;
      period of time, usually 7 to 20 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CC is then a potentially preventable and curable cancer. It can be prevented by vaccination&#xD;
      against HPV and by screening. The latter involves the detection and treatment of precursors&#xD;
      lesions on asymptomatic women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several tests can be used for CC screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cytology (conventional or liquid-based) also called Pap test or Pap smear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual inspection of the cervix after application of 5% acetic acid or vinegar (VIA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HPV-DNA testing. In LIC, the method of screening with low-cost test such as VIA and&#xD;
           treating women with positive result with such treatment as cryotherapy in one single&#xD;
           visit is known as the &quot;see-and-treat approach&quot;. This would minimize loss to follow up,&#xD;
           delay in treatment and missed cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 ISSUES In HICs, cytology has been introduced as a screening test and reduced markedly the&#xD;
      incidence of CC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In LICs such screening has not been feasible. The high incidence and high mortality for&#xD;
      cervical cancer in LIC is due to both high rates of infection with high-risk HPV, a failure&#xD;
      to initiate or sustain effective cervical cancer screening programs based on cytology and the&#xD;
      non-availability of region-specific HPV vaccine programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For that reason, VIA and HPV testing have been recommended for LICs. VIA involves the naked&#xD;
      eye inspection of the uterine cervix after application of 3 to 5 % acetic acid. Its&#xD;
      sensitivity and negative predictive value are very high, reaching 95% in most of the studies&#xD;
      (Sarian, 2005; Sankaranarayanan, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only limited data are available on the prevalence and the distribution of HPV variants among&#xD;
      women in the general population in DRC. Cytology has been proposed as a screening tool, but&#xD;
      it's very opportunistic because there is no organized cervical cancer screening program based&#xD;
      on it. On the other hand, most of the Congolese women, living on less than 1 dollar a day&#xD;
      can't afford it. Vaccination against HPV infection has not been introduced yet in DRC. It&#xD;
      holds promise for the prevention of cervical cancer, yet its impact will not be fully&#xD;
      realized until many years after a vaccination program is instituted. To best understand the&#xD;
      impact of large-scale vaccination programs, one must first appreciate baseline prevalence of&#xD;
      HPV subtypes. Thus, secondary-level prevention i.e. screening is crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryotherapy has been proposed as the way to choose for treating cervical precancerous lesions&#xD;
      in low-resource settings but it is hampered by major logistic problems (such as availability&#xD;
      of carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide); Thus, VIA for screening combined with a simple single&#xD;
      treatment with a vaginal spray of AV2 might offer logistical advantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To contribute to the amelioration of cervical cancer prevention in the Democratic Republic of&#xD;
      Congo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of the local AV2 antiviral drug in the treatment of&#xD;
           HPV-associated cervical lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the genotypes of HPV found in the Kinshasa region.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test the impact of HPV screening followed by virucide treatment in a see-and-treat&#xD;
           setting on HPV infection and associated cervical lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to model the cost-effectiveness of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  VIA screening test and virucide treatment algorithm&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  VIA screening test and cryotherapy treatment algorithm 1.4 Hypothesis - The&#xD;
                viricidal spray is more effective than placebo in the treatment of HPV-associated&#xD;
                cervical precancerous lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHAPITRE 2: MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study type and sites: randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. Sites: Centre Hospitalier du Mont-Amba and Centre de sant√© Lisungi in Kinshasa, D.R.&#xD;
      Congo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory testing will be performed in a laboratory based in Antwerp, Belgium. 2.2.&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women aged 25 and over: There is no upper limit in the study population as for the&#xD;
           majority of women this will be the first screening contact for HPV and cervical cancer&#xD;
           screening. Testing is not performed in women younger than 25 years old as it can be&#xD;
           expected that the prevalence of HPV is very high at a younger age and most women will&#xD;
           eliminate the virus after some years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size and power calculations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to have enough power in both the HPV-positive group with and&#xD;
      without lesions Assuming a HPV clearance rate of 50% in the non-interventional group and 70%&#xD;
      in the virucide group at 2 months post-treatment, a minimum sample size of 163 patients&#xD;
      (i.e., 124/site) is needed to show with 95% power and 95% certainty a difference between both&#xD;
      groups. To allow for up to 10% drop-outs or unevaluable patients, the investigators will&#xD;
      recruit at least 190 patients in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is supposed that 50 % of those HPV-positive will demonstrate some lesion on VIA,&#xD;
      signifying that our secondary randomization on positive lesion will have approximately the&#xD;
      same sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect 20% of the women to be HPV positive, of whom 10% with and 10%&#xD;
      without lesions, indicating that over 1900 ((190*2)/20%) women will have to be enrolled to&#xD;
      obtain the required sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the investigators can screen approximately 50 women per week of whom 70% will be willing&#xD;
      and eligible to participate, we expect the study recruitment to last 30 weeks and the time&#xD;
      between first recruitment and last patient visit to be 56 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Basic training of doctors working in peripheral health centers where no formal&#xD;
           laboratory facilities are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Training will involve VIA and taking cervical swabs for HPV testing and for LBC, not&#xD;
           needing any special technical skills; health workers can be trained for these within 1&#xD;
           hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A local screening program based on VIA will then be offered by these trained doctors to&#xD;
           all women aged 25 and over; Samples for qPCR HPV DNA detection, viral load and&#xD;
           genotyping and for LBC will also be collected at the same time just before the&#xD;
           application of acetic acid. The results of these lab tests will not be available at the&#xD;
           moment of randomization and will serve for later analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The results of the cervical cytology will be reported according to the 2001 Bethesda&#xD;
           system terminology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Women showing lesions on VIA will be randomized to one of two groups to receive either&#xD;
           AV2 virucide treatment or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Women without lesion on VIA will not receive any treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. All women with lesions will be followed-up and rechecked after two months with VIA, qPCR&#xD;
           and LBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. In those testing positive with VIA at the control after 2 months, cryotherapy will be&#xD;
           offered as per WHO criteria (Annex 4). It will be performed according to 2011 and 2012&#xD;
           WHO Guidelines and Technical Specifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. In case cervical cancer is detected the patient will be treated according to the local&#xD;
           protocol and resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Six months after the first test, an evaluation including VIA, qPCR and LBC will be&#xD;
           performed on all subjects who tested positive at the beginning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Those women with persistent precancerous lesions will be offered appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those women without lesion at the beginning but whose HPV test or cytology results will be&#xD;
      pathologic will be recalled for appropriate management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further treatment will be as per local protocol as at this stage the study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4. Statistical analyses Data will be double-entered and cleaned in EpiInfo (version 6.04b,&#xD;
      Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proportions will be compared using the x2 or Fisher's exact tests (when required); Student's&#xD;
      t test will be used for continuous variables. A paired t test will be used for within-patient&#xD;
      comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-normally distributed variables will be transformed, or nonparametric tests (Wilcoxon or&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The log-rank test and the proportional hazard will be estimated (after the Schoenfeld test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of a proportional hazard regression, all patients will be censored at the time of&#xD;
      the last recorded visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stepwise multivariate analyses will be performed, and all possible interactions up to order 2&#xD;
      will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All reported P values will be 2-sided. For all statistical analyses a P value of ‚â§ 0.05 will&#xD;
      be considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be performed using the STATA statistical analysis software package (at&#xD;
      present version 12; Stata Corp.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5. Ethical issues Regulatory Authorities and Ethical Review Committee This protocol will be&#xD;
      submitted for approval by the Institutional ethical committee or Institutional review board&#xD;
      (IEC/IRB) of the University of Antwerp and of The Kinshasa School of Public Health and will&#xD;
      be registered in an international randomized trial registry before starting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can be enrolled only after formal approval from the EC&#xD;
