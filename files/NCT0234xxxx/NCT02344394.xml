      The overall objective of the study is to compare and assess the clinical outcomes of the&#xD;
      standard of care hybrid ablation using epicardial ablation in conjunction with endocardial&#xD;
      PVI alone versus epicardial ablation in conjunction with endocardial ablation using PVI with&#xD;
      additional RF ablation in a randomized, prospective population of patients with persistent AF&#xD;
      of at least 6 months duration. All devices that are used are being utilized under the&#xD;
      approved labeling of the devices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the leading causes of stroke and heart failure. It is also&#xD;
      a major cause of hospitalizations and mortality (Stewart, Wattigney, and Wolf). Patients with&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation (AF) who are intolerant to Class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs often&#xD;
      require endocardial ablation, which can include pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using&#xD;
      radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation or cryoballoon ablation (Medtronic, MN) and reported&#xD;
      success rates vary (Calkins et al). In patients with persistent and long standing persistent&#xD;
      AF success rates may not be as high (Akoum et al) and there is little data analyzing outcomes&#xD;
      for patients in this population (Calkins et al). Using an epicardial-endocardial, or hybrid,&#xD;
      approach Gehi et al describes a 66% 12 month arrythmia-free survival rate following the&#xD;
      procedure, with 37% patients still on antiarrythmic drug therapy at 12 months. Furthermore, a&#xD;
      paper by Anderson et al reports that the hybrid ablation results in lower costs and higher&#xD;
      quality adjusted life years for patients with non-paroxysmal AF as reported by the studie's&#xD;
      results of fewer repeat ablations and maintenance of sinus rhythm at 5 years. Conflicting&#xD;
      reports exist on how much endocardial catheter ablation is needed for patients in persistent&#xD;
      and long standing persistent AF. Verma et al reports results for patients in persistent AF&#xD;
      having endocardial PVI compared to P VI plus additional linear lesions. Eighteen month&#xD;
      success rates for these patients were 59% and 46% respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success of surgical hybrid ablation using epicardial ablation cocontaminent with endocardial&#xD;
      PVI alone versus the hybrid approach using epicardial ablation with endocardial ablation&#xD;
      consisting of PVI ablation and RF ablation has not been studied using a randomized,&#xD;
      prospective approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it is found that the PVI alone is as effective as PVI plus additional catheter ablation&#xD;
      for patients receiving a hybrid ablation, it may reduce the need for extensive catheter&#xD;
      ablation, thereby reducing the radiation exposure, procedure time, and radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation time.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is success or failure in patients with persistent AF of at least 6 months duration to be AF/Atrial tachycardia (AT)/Atrial flutter (AFL) free and free of class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) except for a previously failed or intolerant AAD in the same class following the 3 month blanking period through the 12 months post procedure follow-up visit. A failed AAD is defined as recurrence on that particular AAD.&#xD;
Crossover: After the three month blanking period, if the patient is in persistent AF, the patient may undergo DCCV and antiarrhythmic medication started. The follow up will start after this date.</description>
