      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose of TL32711&#xD;
      (smac mimetic TL32711) in combination with gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the toxicity and safety profile of TL32711 in combination with gemcitabine in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of TL32711 and gemcitabine when administered in&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the preliminary efficacy of the study combination in patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the relationship between predictive biomarkers and clinical activity using&#xD;
      archival tumor tissue samples for biomarker analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of smac mimetic TL32711.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and smac&#xD;
      mimetic TL32711 IV over 30 minutes once weekly for 2 weeks. Courses repeat every 21 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
