    <measure>Dynamics of the Quality of Life According to the SF-36 Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>On baseline and after 4, 12, 24 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Based on medical records. The short version of the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire is completed at visits 1, 2, 4, 7. The SF-36 questionnaire form consists of 11 sections, in each of which it is required to circle one number on each line. The SF-36 determines participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health. Items 1-4 primarily contribute to the physical activity score of the SF-36. Items 5-8 primarily contribute to the mental health score of the SF-36. Scores on each item are summed and averaged (range: 0=worst to 100=best). Increases from baseline indicate improvement. The 'overall' estimate is the average change from baseline</description>

        <title>Dynamics of the Quality of Life According to the SF-36 Questionnaire.</title>
        <description>Based on medical records. The short version of the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire is completed at visits 1, 2, 4, 7. The SF-36 questionnaire form consists of 11 sections, in each of which it is required to circle one number on each line. The SF-36 determines participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health. Items 1-4 primarily contribute to the physical activity score of the SF-36. Items 5-8 primarily contribute to the mental health score of the SF-36. Scores on each item are summed and averaged (range: 0=worst to 100=best). Increases from baseline indicate improvement. The 'overall' estimate is the average change from baseline</description>
