      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis (OA) has a major impact on mobility, disability and loss of productivity of&#xD;
      patients. Patients can become disabled early in life by OA.(1,2,3) Osteoarthritis is&#xD;
      primarily a genetic disease but can be triggered by trauma, intra-articular fractures, axis&#xD;
      deviations and joint overloading, including overweight / obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perhaps the most common type of disease is hand OA, as debilitating to the patient as the&#xD;
      changes generated by rheumatoid arthritis. On the other hand, among the most debilitating, is&#xD;
      knee OA, that greatly diminish the quality of life of the affected patients. (4) At the Knee&#xD;
      Surgery Group of Instituto de Ortopedia e Traumatologia do Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade&#xD;
      de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (IOT-HCFMUSP) - Orthopedics and Trauma Institute of&#xD;
      University of São Paulo's General Hospital - there is a large number of young adult patients&#xD;
      who were economically active, until the advent of a joint trauma, which led to early OA.&#xD;
      There is also a large number of people seeking our group for a Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)&#xD;
      without been offered all non-surgical alternatives of treatment. As there are also patients&#xD;
      who underwent surgical treatment but suffer from consequences of OA and clinical treatment is&#xD;
      their current need. These patients do not receive an appropriate OA clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients should be reabsorbed by the basic health network. But the patient is returned&#xD;
      by the social services at IOT-HCFMUSP, because there is no such reference in the Unified&#xD;
      Health System The OARSI is concerned to publish guidelines with the respective levels of&#xD;
      evidence on the various forms of treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee and hip. Those&#xD;
      guidelines show the importance of education, phone calls, non-drug methods such as physical&#xD;
      therapy, exercise, acupuncture, mind and body therapies, the use of insoles and orthotics,&#xD;
      canes, crutches and knee pads, and finally the drugs for pain and to slow the progression of&#xD;
      the disease. (5,6) It is believed that an education program has a positive impact on quality&#xD;
      of life of patients with OA. In England, the simple delivery of educational material showed&#xD;
      no different from a course associated with the delivery of educational material. But in&#xD;
      countries like Sweden, primary care is concerned to give courses on OA. In France, teaching&#xD;
      about the pathology associated with medical consultation was superior to simple medical&#xD;
      consultation to improve patients' symptoms and treatment adherence. (6) No paper on only&#xD;
      telephone follow-up was performed, but the addition of patient care by phone, always shows&#xD;
      better results than a single intervention. (6) The Osteometabolic Diseases Group of&#xD;
      IOT-HCFMUSP, initially focused on the care of osteoporosis and other diseases of bone&#xD;
      metabolism such as thalassemia and osteogenesis imperfecta. More recently took over the care&#xD;
      and research in the treatment of OA, starting with the knee OA, since it's among the most&#xD;
      prevalent and debilitating types of OA.(3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity and knee OA are the most frequent comorbidities in the elderly in the United States&#xD;
      (U.S.). Although not presenting the same level of obesity of U.S. patients, our patients with&#xD;
      OA also are overweight, and often have diabetes and hypertension. Changing the habits of&#xD;
      those patients is imperative for clinical improvement. Those patients should incorporate&#xD;
      healthier eating habits as well as daily physical activity. But to change behavior, it is&#xD;
      necessary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to perceive the problem as important and serious.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to perceive that behaviour change is beneficial. Patients are more prone to health&#xD;
           information when it is presented in terms of potential gain (11) and when these gains&#xD;
           are presented in patients of the same sex and race. (12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have a diverse population of patients with level of education ranging from illiterate&#xD;
      patients at university level. With this diversity of patients, and a number of patients who&#xD;
      can easily reach four digits, and the total lack of possibility of referral of patients to&#xD;
      primary or secondary care in the city of São Paulo, we designed a pilot program in three&#xD;
      phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - Creation of an educational program consisting of various health professionals so&#xD;
      that we can educate the patients about OA disease, and their role in treatment. This program&#xD;
      will be administered in a single day and reviewed / reinforced after an interval of time.&#xD;
      Half the patients will be monitored monthly by phone when questions specific to each health&#xD;
      area will be made to participants. This way we will evaluate the strength of the telephone&#xD;
      follow-up. We're going to create educational printed an audiovisual materials for patients,&#xD;
      so they can access the information given in the theoretical course at home. Calculation of&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness and presentation of data to the authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - If we can demonstrate effectiveness in improving the quality of life of patients,&#xD;
      we will hold training courses for health professionals from the West Region Project to create&#xD;
      a system of reference and cross-reference with the primary and secondary care centers.&#xD;
      Patients who have been through the course and demonstrate improved quality of life, will be&#xD;
      accompanied closer to their homes in the western region of São Paulo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 - Expansion to all the city of São Paulo and other cities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot, we focus exclusively on Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables that can interfere with patient compliance to the program and, therefore, to&#xD;
      the final result, are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of Interval between interventions (1, 2 or 3 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phone follow-up or not&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attending the course or just receiving the educational material&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL OBJECTIVES To assess the improvement of quality of life of patients with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis exposed to an education program multi-professional and / or telephone&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Develop knowledge, experience and indicators that support the expansion of the project to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      West Region Project Municipal Programs, State and National.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subprojects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social Work - improving the quality of life by the introduction of leisure Nutrition -&#xD;
      Decrease in body mass index (BMI) by improving the quality and quantity of diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Therapy - Improves the autonomy, function and pain for the introduction of daily&#xD;
      exercise habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occupational Therapy - Improves autonomy, function and pain by improving the ergonomics&#xD;
      and-administration of daily tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Education - Improvement of autonomy, function and pain for the introduction of daily&#xD;
      exercise habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychology - Improving quality of life for the patient and behavior change induced by the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred and forty patients from the public, healthcare at IOT-HCFMUSP, already identified&#xD;
      with OA of the knees&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the inclusion criteria, patients undergo pre-assessment by the group composed of&#xD;
      multi-professional teams of physicians, orthopedic surgeons, nutritionists, psychologists,&#xD;
      physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social worker, and physical educators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthopedics - We treat patients according to the OARSI guidelines, offering everything at our&#xD;
      disposal for the treatment of OA at IOT-HCFMUSP. Thus, the orthopedic surgeon:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - request and evaluate exams, and classify the disease by knees x-rays,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - prescribe medications to delay the disease (we work with diacerein in our service),&#xD;
           analgesics, muscle relaxants, and Non-Steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), if&#xD;
           necessary,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - prescribe orthotics (insoles, knee pads, sticks and crutches, braces);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - will report to Social Security and Departamento de Transportes (DETRAN) - Transports&#xD;
           Department (this, if the social services confirm the need);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. - Apply evaluation questionnaires SF 36, Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS), Western Ontario&#xD;
           and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) in the first visit and after six&#xD;
           months, will make the referral to physiotherapy and physical activity on the network&#xD;
           offered by the government, refers to acupuncture and / or dry needling physiatry in the&#xD;
           IOT-FMUSP for cardiac evaluation and clearance for physical activity. Apply the Consent&#xD;
           Report to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the professional staff will assess the effects of its intervention in a personalized&#xD;
      way through a subproject:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritionist - anthropometric Social Worker - Level of education, autonomy and limited&#xD;
      mobility to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychologist - assess cognitive ability, application of World Health Organization Quality of&#xD;
      Life (WHOQOL) Physical Therapist - assess range of motion, pain, strength and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occupational Therapy - range of motion and quality of life. Physical Educator - Evaluate the&#xD;
      physical capacity and prescribe appropriate exercise for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 240 patients will be randomly assigned to 4 groups of 60. 3 groups will be subjected to 2&#xD;
      interventions, varying the time interval between each intervention: Group 1 to 3 months apart&#xD;
      Group 2 - 2 months apart Group 3 - 1-month interval&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4 will only receive the printed material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Flow&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions take place on Saturdays at IOT-HCFMUSP, using the classrooms and the&#xD;
      dependencies of physiotherapy. We will have a &quot;home simulation&quot; to teach ergonomics in the&#xD;
      home. The course will take place between 8:00 and 17:00 hours.&#xD;
