      Background This phase II study will assess the efficacy and safety of a radiotherapy dose&#xD;
      complement (boost) in the treatment of hypoxic lesions, measured by F-miso PET/CT, in&#xD;
      patients with stage III NSCLC not amenable to surgery and candidate for chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a strong theoretical rationale supporting a radiotherapy dose increase in patients&#xD;
      with hypoxic pulmonary tumour. F-miso PET enables in vivo identification and localisation of&#xD;
      hypoxic tumoral areas, which constitute a target for an increased total dose of radiation&#xD;
      therapy. Preliminary studies in head and neck cancers have demonstrated the feasibility and&#xD;
      support the medical benefit of this novel approach. To date, no studies investigating&#xD;
      non-small-cell lung cancer patients have been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the methodological constraints, we propose a Gehan plan optimizing the number of&#xD;
      subjects to be enrolled and the budget.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project team has been working on imaging of radiotherapy targets for NSCLC for many years&#xD;
      within a research group identified by the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) in 2005,&#xD;
      and part of the axis 3 of Northwest Canceropole (Prof. Gregoire - Prof. Lartigau - Prof.&#xD;
      Vera)2. This project was presented at an EORTC meeting &quot;Imaging and radiotherapy&quot; (organised&#xD;
      by Dr. Nestlé) on May 28th 2010. It has been approved by the President of ESTRO (Prof.&#xD;
      Gregoire) and the members of SFMN (French Society of Nuclear Medicine) and of the SFRO&#xD;
      (French Society of Radiation Oncology) during an &quot;Imaging and Hypoxia&quot; Meeting in September&#xD;
      8th, 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of a radiotherapy dose complement&#xD;
      (boost) in this difficult medical condition for which only limited treatment options are&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective(s) of the clinical study Main objective: to evaluate the rate of local control&#xD;
      after dose complement in hypoxic lesions [maximum dose without the fraction of total lung&#xD;
      volume receiving more that 20 Gy exceeding 30% of the lung (V20)], as determined by F-miso&#xD;
      PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 months and 1 year toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients for whom the RT dose could be increased&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simultaneous variation of the glucose metabolism and hypoxia during radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Predictive value on 1-year survival probability of the variations in glucose metabolism&#xD;
           and hypoxia during radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer candidate for curative&#xD;
           radio-chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The final inclusion is granted after completion of a dosimetric study confirming that&#xD;
           the dose objectives (minimum dose of 60 Gy in 99% of target volume) and constraints to&#xD;
           organs at risk can be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main assessment criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Percentage of local control as evaluated by CT (RECIST criteria) and FDG PET/CT at 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment criteria for hypoxia Visual analysis: centralized via SFMN net with 3 blinded&#xD;
      readers within 8 days (Richin, JCO 2006). Definition of hypoxia and decision about boost&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative analysis: hypoxic fraction determined retrospectively (secondary endpoints and&#xD;
      ancillary study). The Gross Target Volume (GTV) will be delineated on FDG PET/CT images using&#xD;
      an adaptive method (Vauclin, PMB 2009). The contour of the GTV will be copied onto F-miso PET&#xD;
      images after registration. Voxels with a signal to noise ratio greater than 1.2 will be&#xD;
      considered as the hypoxic volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental plan Assumption: to increase the local control rate at 3 months from 17% to 40%.&#xD;
      A two-staged Gehan plan will be implemented. The assumption of therapeutic efficacy is π =&#xD;
      0.4 - In the first stage, 6 patients will receive a radiotherapy dose boost on the hypoxic&#xD;
      lesions. If no local control is observed in these 6 patients, the trial will be stopped&#xD;
      (power 0.95). In a second stage, the number of patients to be included will be determined&#xD;
      according to the number of local controls in stage 1, the desired precision being set to ε =&#xD;
      0.10 (n=19 maximum).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects required 60 patients with significant uptake on FDG-PET imaging after&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (75 pre-inclusion) will be included. Only half of these 60 patients&#xD;
      (30) are expected to be definitely eligible with F-miso PET identifying hypoxic areas. Out&#xD;
      these 30 eligible patients, we assume that 5 will not be evaluable, so that a total of 25&#xD;
      evaluable patients will be assessable.&#xD;
