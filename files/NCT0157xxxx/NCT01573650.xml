      1. To analyse the outcome of different treatment options of peripheral nerve repair with no&#xD;
           gap (group 1) and with a critical sized (&gt;5mm) defect (group 2) in order to optimize&#xD;
           peripheral nerve repair&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To reduce morbidity with the same outcome&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients planned to undergo peripheral nerve repair after traumatic nerve injury with either&#xD;
      no gap (group 1) or with a critical sized defect (&gt;5mm, group 2) of the finger providing&#xD;
      written informed consent to this investigation will be randomised in two groups:.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: nerve repair with no gap Group 1a (standard): Epineural Suture Group 1b&#xD;
      (experimental): Epineural Suture and Fibrin Wrap Group 2: Nerve repair with a critical sized&#xD;
      (&gt;5mm) defect Group 2a (standard): Epineural suture and autologous nerve transplantation from&#xD;
      lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LACN) Group 2b (experimental): Epineural suture and&#xD;
      Fibrin Conduit&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all groups an epineural suture will be performed (suture enhancement). The outcome of&#xD;
      fibrin enwrapment and fibrin conduit will be compared to the standard treatment option to&#xD;
      date (direct nerve repair and autologous nerve graft, respectively). Randomization will be&#xD;
      performed using a computer-base algorithm (www.randomizer.at). Ambulatory follow up of&#xD;
      patients is carried out by the Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery,&#xD;
      Handsurgery, University Hospital Basel. The outcome-assessor as well as the patient will be&#xD;
      blinded for analysis and the outcome-assessor will have no access to the surgery report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's aim is to analyse 48 patients within 12 months. Since 100 patients undergo&#xD;
      peripheral nerve repair annually in the Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic&#xD;
      Surgery, Handsurgery at the University Hospital Basel, patient accrual appears unproblematic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion, statistical analysis focusing on the comparison of the different types of&#xD;
      surgery concerning the clinical parameters 2-Point Discrimination (PD), Semmes Weinstein&#xD;
      test, and electroneurography will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After six months, no difference will be expected between group 1a and 1b or 2a and 2b,&#xD;
      respectively. In the investigator's experience there will be no confounders which may&#xD;
      influence nerve regeneration. A similar patient satisfaction will be expected between the&#xD;
      groups. The investigator expect a higher patient satisfaction in group 2b than in group 2a&#xD;
      due to nerve tissue harvest. Between group 1a and 1b no difference is expected regarding MHQ.&#xD;
