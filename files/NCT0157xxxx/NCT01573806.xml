      Pharmacology of Exenatide in Pediatric Sepsis, PEPS is a phase 1-2 research study that will&#xD;
      examine drug safety, drug metabolism, drug action and preliminary drug clinical effects of&#xD;
      four does of exenatide injected every 12 hours to children with shock from infection (septic&#xD;
      shock). The investigators hypothesize that exenatide can be safely dosed to children with&#xD;
      sepsis to achieve blood levels of drug similar to that achieved in teenagers with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. The investigators further hypothesize that injection of exenatide to children with&#xD;
      septic shock will normalize blood glucose levels and decrease levels of inflammation proteins&#xD;
      in the blood during the early course of sepsis.&#xD;

      Pharmacology of Exenatide in Pediatric Sepsis, PEPS is a phase 1-2 investigation that will&#xD;
      examine safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical efficacy of 4&#xD;
      subcutaneous doses of exenatide administered every 12 hours to children with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      septic shock. The investigators' long term goal is to explore the potential benefit of&#xD;
      exenatide on: early immunomodulation and glucose homeostasis, organ dysfunction, and&#xD;
      clinically meaningful outcomes associated with pediatric sepsis. The current study objectives&#xD;
      are to conduct a &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation study, and then examine a &quot;best exenatide allometric&#xD;
      dose&quot; to generate safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and initial efficacy data in a&#xD;
      larger cohort. In Phase 1 (three allometric doses; three age strata)the investigators will&#xD;
      identify an exenatide dosing regimen that mimics area under the exenatide concentration curve&#xD;
      for exenatide dosing among adolescents with type 2 diabetes with minimal or no adverse&#xD;
      events. A total of 18 subjects are expected to be enrolled in Phase 1. In Phase 2 the&#xD;
      investigators will utilize this &quot;best exenatide allometric dose&quot; to further clarify exenatide&#xD;
      safety (adverse event occurence: e.g. nausea, abdominal pain, delayed gastric emptying,&#xD;
      hypoglycemia, pancreatitis, renal dysfunction), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (glucose&#xD;
      homeostasis; inflammatory cytokine serum concentrations), and effect on clinical outcomes&#xD;
      (AUC of Saturation Index, AUC Vasoactive-Inotropic Score, AUC RIFLE Criteria, Pediatric&#xD;
      Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score; changes in health-related quality of life and functional&#xD;
      status). In Phase 2, 30 subjects in each age strata in the ratio of 4:1, exenatide: vehicle,&#xD;
      are expected to be enrolled.&#xD;
