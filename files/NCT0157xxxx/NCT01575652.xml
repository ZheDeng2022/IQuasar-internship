      The objective of this study was to examine the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme&#xD;
      inhibitors on peritoneal membrane transport, peritoneal protein loss, and proteinuria in&#xD;
      peritoneal dialysis patients.&#xD;

      This prospective cohort study was conducted at the Unit of Nephrology of Sisli Etfal&#xD;
      Education and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. Prior to subject recruitment, the study&#xD;
      protocol was reviewed and approved by the local ethics committee, in accordance with the&#xD;
      ethical principles for human investigations, and written informed consents were obtained from&#xD;
      all patients. Between june 2008 and january 2009, 54 age and gender matched continuous&#xD;
      ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients were included in the study consecutively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were divided into 2 groups according to decision of the physician; group 1 (n=34)&#xD;
      was consisted of patients treated with ACE-Is and group 2 (n=30) was not treated with ACEs.&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were chronic PD patients between 18 and 85 years who had not received&#xD;
      any antihypertensive drugs within prior 12 months. All patients were on standard CAPD program&#xD;
      (2-2.5 L; 4 exchanges/day). Icodextrin is not used. The exclusion criteria were as follows;&#xD;
      patients who had a history of antihypertensive treatment with ACE-Is or angiotensin-receptor&#xD;
      blockers or aldosterone antagonists for prior 12 months from the study time; intolerance to&#xD;
      the ACE-Is; CAPD-related peritonitis within 6 months prior to or during the study period;&#xD;
      history of malignant hypertension or hypertensive encephalopathy or cerebrovascular accident&#xD;
      within the 6 months prior to the study; chronic liver diseases, and recent acute illness&#xD;
      and/or history of any overt chronic inflammatory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic variables including etiology of CKD, age, and gender were obtained from patients'&#xD;
      clinic charts. All blood samples were taken after 10 hours of overnight fasting. Serum urea,&#xD;
      creatinine, and albumin levels were analyzed. Creatinine clearance [(CCr) dialysate, urine,&#xD;
      and total], Kt/V (dialysate, urine, and total) were calculated weekly. Daily volumes (UF),&#xD;
      24-hour protein, and albumin losses (dialysate, urine) were recorded also. Parameters at the&#xD;
      beginning of study and at the end of 6th month were evaluated. During the study, the dialysis&#xD;
      regime remained same in all patients. In both groups, investigators analyzed blood, 24-hour&#xD;
      urine (in patients with residual diuresis &gt;100mL daily), peritoneal effluent fluid at 4&#xD;
      hours' and 24 hours' dwell time. Peritoneal effluent fluid at 24 hours' dwell time was used&#xD;
      to determine total protein, albumin, and at 24 hours' dwell time to determine urea and&#xD;
      creatinine. The urea kinetic test in closest time proximity to the PET was used in the&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the subject had rested in the supine position for at least 15 minutes blood pressure&#xD;
      was measured with a standard mercury sphyngomanometer for the three times with the half of a&#xD;
      cuff around the right arm. Patients' blood pressure measurements were performed on a regular&#xD;
      basis every month. The mean values were calculated. All patients received standard&#xD;
      35-cal/kg/day carbohydrate, 1-2 g/kg/day protein, and salt restricted diet. Patients did not&#xD;
      use essential amino acid and peritoneal dialysis solutions containing amino acids. Serum&#xD;
      urea, creatinine, and albumin levels were assessed by enzymatic colorimetric assay. Dialysate&#xD;
      adequacy (Kt/V urea: dialysis and residual), and peritoneal transport (4-hour D/PCr) were&#xD;
      measured using standard procedures (PD Adequest 1.4, 1994: Baxter Healthcare Corporation,&#xD;
      Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.). Dialysate albumin loss was measured with the Bromo Cresol Green (BCG)&#xD;
      method. Dialysate total protein loss was measured by the Biuret method. Urine protein&#xD;
      concentration was determined by an immunoturbidimetric method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS 13.0 software package (SPSS Inc, Chicago,&#xD;
      IL, USA). Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to test the normality of data distribution. Data&#xD;
      were expressed as arithmetic means and standard deviations. Chi-square test was used to&#xD;
      compare the categorical variables between groups. Independent sample T-test and Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      U tests were used respectively between groups in normally and abnormally distributed&#xD;
      continuous variables. Paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to analyze&#xD;
      changes within each group. Two-sided p value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
