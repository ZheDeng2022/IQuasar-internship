      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Anemia occurs commonly and is associated with poor outcomes in the elderly. In about a&#xD;
      third of anemia cases in older people (over age 65), the cause of anemia is unexplained.&#xD;
      Anemia in older adults may be caused by the bone marrow's inability to produce red blood&#xD;
      cells fast enough to replace older red blood cells that have died. Researchers want to look&#xD;
      at unexplained anemia by studying the life span of red blood cells in younger adults and&#xD;
      older adults. To do so, a vitamin called Biotin will be used as a marker on the red blood&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To investigate possible causes of unexplained anemia in older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals in the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men and women between 18 and 50 years of age who do not have anemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men and women at least 70 years of age who do not have anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men and women at least 70 years of age who have iron-deficiency anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men and women at least 70 years of age who have anemia with no known cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an overnight stay for the first study visit. They will provide a&#xD;
           blood sample to which Biotin will be added. The blood sample with Biotin will then be&#xD;
           returned to the participant. Twenty-four hours later, another blood sample will be&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have up to 14 additional study visits. At each visit, blood samples&#xD;
           will be collected to measure the amount of Biotin remaining in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may also provide a separate blood sample for genetic testing. These tests&#xD;
           may provide more information about genetic causes of unexplained anemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia occurs commonly and is associated with adverse outcomes in the elderly. In&#xD;
      approximately one third of anemia cases in patients over the age of 65 years, the cause of&#xD;
      anemia is not readily apparent (unexplained anemia or UA). Of the various causes of anemia in&#xD;
      young adults, overt hemolysis (either acute or chronic) is very uncommon. However, we&#xD;
      speculate that older persons tend to develop a low grade hemolytic process which&#xD;
      significantly reduces RBC survival, and when this is not adequately countered by increased&#xD;
      bone marrow RBC production, anemia (UA) is the consequence. This hypothesis is supported by a&#xD;
      few clinical observations. For example, red cells in patients with UA are generally not small&#xD;
      and when the peripheral blood smear is examined microscopically, anisocytosis (varying cell&#xD;
      size) is observed, as is typical in patients with hemolytic anemia. Similarly, UA is&#xD;
      frequently associated with an elevated red cell distribution width (RDW) on electronic&#xD;
      measurement. Furthermore, serum erythropoietin levels gradually rise with advancing age (1),&#xD;
      and this would be consistent either with a smoldering hemolytic process or a decreased&#xD;
      responsiveness to erythropoietin. To address the hypothesis that UA is due, at least in part,&#xD;
      to shortened RBC survival, we propose to directly measure red blood cell survival and to&#xD;
      correlate this with aspects of red blood cell physiology that may increase susceptibility to&#xD;
      the hemolytic process.&#xD;
