    <textblock>
      Background: In patients with chronic HCV-related liver damage, coffee is associated with a&#xD;
      reduced risk of progression and of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Aim: This&#xD;
      prospective trial is aimed at assessing the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of&#xD;
      coffee on evolution in cirrhosis and HCC. Trial design/methods: Forty patients with&#xD;
      HCV-related hepatitis will be recruited and randomized into two groups: the first will&#xD;
      consume 4 coffee cups/day/1 month, while the second will remain coffee &quot;abstinent&quot;. At day&#xD;
      30, the two groups will be switched over and exposed to coffee or not for a second month.&#xD;
      Before entering the study (time 0), during coffee exposure and during abstinence we will&#xD;
      evaluate the following parameters: liver function tests, viral load, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine&#xD;
      (a marker of oxidative DNA damage), telomere length, apoptosis and collagen deposition.&#xD;

      Patients Forty patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease referring to the&#xD;
      Gastroenterology Unit of Padua out-patient clinic will be prospectively recruited and will&#xD;
      enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients the presence of anti-HCV antibodies will be assayed by a third-generation&#xD;
      immunoenzymatic test (Ortho Diagnostic Systems, Raritan, NJ) and by confirmatory test&#xD;
      (recombinant immunoblotting assay, Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA). A standardized genotyping&#xD;
      assay (Inno-Lipa HCV III, Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients who fulfill the following inclusion criteria will be recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HCV-related chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, with bioptic (within the previous 24 months)&#xD;
           confirmation or a clinical diagnosis in case of cirrhosis; (Prothrombin Time - PT, White&#xD;
           Blood Cells - WBC and platelets - PLT, Ultra Sound - US examination);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anti-HCV and HCV-RNA positivity with Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/Alanine&#xD;
           aminotransferase (ALT) at least 1.5x;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age range 30-80 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no ongoing interferon treatment, previous treatment with no response or relapse was&#xD;
           accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is approved by the Hospital Ethical Committee (Prot. 1755 P, Azienda Ospedaliera di&#xD;
      Padova), the patients' participation is voluntary and each patient signs an informed consent&#xD;
      to participation, an information note being delivered to each patient's attending general&#xD;
      practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the beginning of the intervention phase, for each patient, demographical data will be&#xD;
      collected, together with information on coffee and smoking habits, alcohol, fruit, vegetable,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs consumption, energy and nutrients intake, as potential bias. All&#xD;
      these data will be assessed by using a quantity-frequency questionnaire designed for use in&#xD;
      the present study. At time 0 (T0) the patients will be categorized into two groups in&#xD;
      relation to their routine coffee intake: 0-2 cups/day and 3-5 cups/day. This cut-off was&#xD;
      chosen because in most papers an effect of coffee consumption is observed for over 2&#xD;
      cups/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to maintain, throughout the study, their alimentary and voluptuary&#xD;
      habits, while the use of other caffeine-containing beverages is forbidden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be investigated for all the markers at the beginning of the study (T0) and then&#xD;
      randomized using a computer-generated list (StatsDirect statistic program) in two groups,&#xD;
      with either 4 coffee cups/day intake for 1 month or abstinence for the same time period.&#xD;
      Obviously, blinding is not possible and we decided not to prescribe any wash-out period,&#xD;
      being the T0 sampling examined in relation to the patients' routine coffee consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 30 days, the patients will be re-tested, and then shifted over to the opposite&#xD;
      &quot;treatment&quot; (into the coffee arm those who were abstinent in the first month and vice versa&#xD;
      those who consumed coffee) and again checked after the second time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient is therefore tested three times, at T0, when he/she enters the study, after&#xD;
      coffee and following abstinence, being each patient the control of himself in the two phases.&#xD;
      For seek of simplicity all data obtained following coffee consumption will be compared with&#xD;
      all the data obtained during abstinence, irrespective of the time sequence of&#xD;
      exposure/abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering (on the basis of published data) an expected coffee effect in at least 40% of&#xD;
      exposed subjects, with 1 control for case, with 5% alpha error and with 80% power, the sample&#xD;
      size required (20 cases and 20 controls) corresponded to the selected sample for the study.&#xD;
      Additionally, in this study, given the cross over design in which each patient is&#xD;
      investigated twice, once during coffee exposure and once during abstinence, the actual number&#xD;
      of patients investigated is of 40 per arm, twice as high therefore, than required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be given a form in which they registered any deviation and compliance with&#xD;
      respect to coffee intake and appropriate telephone contacts to report immediately any side&#xD;
      effect. To reduce the risk of any bias due to inter-individual changes in the preparation of&#xD;
      coffee, the patients will be provided with typical Italian-style coffee machine of the&#xD;
      stove-top type (MokaTMBialetti), the required amount of coffee for the preparation of the 4&#xD;
      coffee cups/day (8 g for each coffee preparation) and instructions on how to prepare it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coffee brand is a 100% Coffea arabica product from the shelf. We also want to analyze the&#xD;
      product we use. The analyses will be performed by a contract lab (Eurofins analytic GmbH -&#xD;
      Hamburg-Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are instructed not to drink any differently prepared coffee and had to report in&#xD;
      an appropriate form any deviation from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Blood samples will be collected and stored at -20°C for no longer than 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the following parameters will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AST/ALT, gammaglutamyl-transpeptidase (γGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. viral load (HCV-RNA titer),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. markers of oxidative damage: 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), nitric oxide (NO),&#xD;
           Advanced Oxidation Protein Products (AOPP),&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. marker of genomic stability: Telomere Length (TL),&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. markers of cell death: M30 and M30/M65,&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. markers of liver fibrosis and angiogenesis: Procollagen Type III (PIIINP) and Vascular&#xD;
           Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver Function Tests determination Serum levels of AST and ALT, gammaGT and ALP will be&#xD;
      determined as part of the routine clinical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCV-RNA determination The presence of HCV-RNA in the serum will be assessed by amplification&#xD;
      with PCR of the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) of HCV, the most conserved region of the&#xD;
      virus. The test is performed in all subjects positive for anti-HCV antibodies (screening&#xD;
      test). The amplification will be performed in two steps, by 'nested PCR'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8-OHdG determination This assay will be carried out as follows: in brief, this assay consists&#xD;
      of 3 steps: (i) genomic DNA extraction using a Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega&#xD;
      Italia, Milano); (ii) nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase hydrolysis of DNA; (iii) 8-OHdG&#xD;
      determination using an HPLC equipped with an electrochemical detector (HPLC-ED) (ESA&#xD;
      Coulochem II 5200 A, Bedford, MA). The 8-OHdG levels are expressed as the number of 8-OHdG&#xD;
      adduct/105 dG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NO determination Serum NO levels will be spectrophotometrically assayed by measuring the&#xD;
      accumulation of its stable degradation products, nitrate and nitrite (Oxford Biomedical&#xD;
      Research, USA). NO levels will be expressed as µmol/L, as a marker of nitric oxide synthase&#xD;
      activation and nitrosation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AOPP determination Plasma AOPP levels will be measured by spectrophotometric method performed&#xD;
      by Witko-Sarsat. AOPP concentrations are expressed as µmol/L of chloramines-T equivalents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TL analysis by quantitative PCR Genomic DNA extracted will be used also to measure TL by&#xD;
      using method developed by Cawthon. Two 96-well plates were prepared for each experiment, one&#xD;
      containing telomere primers and the other for 36B4, encoding acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein&#xD;
      P0 used as the single copy gene .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each 25 µl PCR reaction included 40 ng of DNA, SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems,&#xD;
      Foster City, CA) and primers at final concentrations 270 nM Tel-1 and 900 nM Tel-2 or 300 nM&#xD;
      36B4u and 500 nM 36B4d respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCR amplification is performed in a ABI PRISM 7900 (Applied Biosystem). In each plate, a&#xD;
      standard curve is produced ranging from 4 to 80 ng of human reference DNA (Applied&#xD;
      Biosystem). The thermal cycling profile for the telomere amplification is 95°C for 10 min,&#xD;
      followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, 56°C for 10 s and 72°C for 60 s or 30 cycles of 95°C&#xD;
      for 5 s, 58°C for 10 s and 72°C for 40 s. Following amplification, a dissociation curve is&#xD;
      performed in order to confirm the specificity of the reaction. All samples are assayed in&#xD;
      triplicate to test the reproducibility of assay and in each assay a negative control is&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescence signals and dissociation curves are analyzed by ABI 7900 SDS 2.3 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell death determination The M30-Apoptosense ELISA (Peviva, USA) is a one step in vitro&#xD;
      immunoassay for the quantitative determination of the apoptosis-associated CK18Asp396 (M30)&#xD;
      neo-epitope in plasma. The concentration of the antigen that quantifies ongoing apoptotic&#xD;
      cell death, is expressed as U/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The M30-Apoptosense ELISA is used in combination with M65 ELISA (Peviva, USA), for the&#xD;
      quantitative determination of total soluble CK18 released from dead cells (necrotic and&#xD;
      apoptotic). The concentration of the antigen is expressed as U/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PIIINP and VEGF determination Plasma PIIINP levels will be determined using ELISA kit (USCN,&#xD;
      China). PIIINP levels are expressed as ng/mL as a marker of tissue collagen deposition and&#xD;
      fibrosis. Serum VEGF will be determined as a marker of neo-angiogenesis and tissue&#xD;
      re-modeling using an ELISA kit (Bender MedSystems, Austria), data being expressed in ng/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic Data will be analyzed using one-way ANOVA, paired t-test, Student's t-test for&#xD;
      unpaired data, linear regression (SPSS, STATSDIRECT) with statistical significance set at p&#xD;
      &lt;0.05 (2-tailed). All comparison regarding coffee exposure and abstinence will be carried&#xD;
      within patients and not within groups, using, as said, a pair data approach.&#xD;
