  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some vaccines may work better when given together with another substance known as an adjuvant&#xD;
      or when given with an experimental procedure called electroporation (EP). EP is a method&#xD;
      where an electric pulse is administered to the same muscle where the vaccine injection is&#xD;
      given. The addition of the adjuvant to the vaccine and the delivery with EP may increase a&#xD;
      person's immune response to the vaccine. Combination approaches such as a DNA vaccine&#xD;
      followed by live vector boost may also increase a person's immune response to the vaccine&#xD;
      components. All of these interventions will be tested in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of and immune response to an HIV DNA&#xD;
      vaccine with or without plasmid IL-12 adjuvant, when given by EP and followed by a live&#xD;
      vector vaccine given IM by needle and syringe in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of a vaccine may be increased when combined with an adjuvant and/or when&#xD;
      given with EP. The addition of an adjuvant or EP may increase a person's immune response to a&#xD;
      vaccine. Furthermore, the immune response to HIV antigens may be improved by giving a DNA&#xD;
      vaccine boosted with a live vector vaccine. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an HIV DNA vaccine (HIV-MAG) alone or in&#xD;
      combination with an IL-12 pDNA adjuvant, delivered IM via EP followed by a Vesicular&#xD;
      Stomatitis Virus (VSV) HIV gag vaccine boost given IM by needle and syringe in healthy,&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled into the study in one of four groups. Each of the four groups&#xD;
      will receive 3 mg of the HIV-MAG vaccine alone or combined with one of three different doses&#xD;
      of the IL-12 pDNA adjuvant, followed by the VSV HIV gag vaccine boost. Within each of the&#xD;
      four groups, participants will be randomly assigned to receive the study vaccines or placebo.&#xD;
      At study entry (Day 0), all participants will undergo a physical examination and blood&#xD;
      collection. Female participants will also take a pregnancy test. Participants will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires and receive counseling on HIV risk reduction. They will also receive their&#xD;
      first vaccination. Participants will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes after the&#xD;
      vaccination for observation and monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional vaccination study visits will occur at Months 1, 3, and 6. At Months 1 and 3,&#xD;
      participants will receive the same vaccine or placebo they received at study entry; at Month&#xD;
      6, participants will receive the VSV HIV gag vaccine or placebo. For 3 days after the study&#xD;
      entry and Months 1 and 3 vaccination visits, participants will record their symptoms in a&#xD;
      diary. After the Month 6 vaccination visit, participants will record their symptoms for 7&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Groups 1 and 3 will attend additional study visits on Days 1, 3, 14, 42, 91,&#xD;
      98, 169, 171, 175, 182, 273, and 364. Participants in Groups 2 and 4 will attend additional&#xD;
      study visits on Days 14, 42, 98, 182, 273, and 364. Most study visits will include a physical&#xD;
      examination, blood collection, oral mucosa examination, interviews and questionnaires, and&#xD;
      oral mucosa examination. If participant has any oral sores, oral swabs may be collected.&#xD;
      Saliva also may be collected. Select study visits will include a mini mental state exam,&#xD;
      urine collection, HIV testing, and risk reduction counseling. Study researchers will contact&#xD;
      participants at Months 15, 24, and 36 for follow-up health monitoring.&#xD;
