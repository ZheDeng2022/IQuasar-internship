  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate survival in inoperable stage III Non-small Cell Lung&#xD;
      Cancer patients following chemo-radiotherapy followed by GV1001 vaccination plus best&#xD;
      supportive care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer (both small cell and non-small cell) is the second most common cancer in both men&#xD;
      (after prostate cancer) and women (after breast cancer). It accounts for about 15% of all new&#xD;
      cancers. Lung cancer is the world's leading cause of cancer death with more than 1.6 million&#xD;
      new cases diagnosed each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 85 percent of lung cancer patients have Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC ) and are&#xD;
      usually diagnosed with advanced disease and have few treatment options and a very low&#xD;
      survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice in the successful treatment of stage III NSCLC.&#xD;
      However, the 5-year survival for stage III patients treated with radiotherapy alone is less&#xD;
      than 10%. Several types of chemotherapy treatments have been investigated, however, progress&#xD;
      has been limited. Most patients die from relapsed disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peptide telomerase vaccine, GV1001, is under development for use as active immunotherapy&#xD;
      in the treatment of cancer. Normally, the immune system is tolerant to self-proteins and&#xD;
      peptides, while being able to react to foreign pathogens. However, cancer cells are&#xD;
      degenerated cells and many of their peptides and proteins are self-proteins or peptides. By&#xD;
      using vaccination, the immune tolerance towards a specific peptide or protein can be&#xD;
      circumvented.&#xD;
