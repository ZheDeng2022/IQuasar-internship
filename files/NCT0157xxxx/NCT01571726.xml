      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of malignant blood cancer. It affects the plasma cells,&#xD;
      which help produce antibodies and fight infection. MM is nearly always preceded by a&#xD;
      pre-malignant state, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering&#xD;
      multiple myeloma (SMM). Currently, it is not possible to predict when someone with MGUS or&#xD;
      SMM will develop MM. Also, the disease changes in those early states are not well understood.&#xD;
      Researchers want to look at imaging studies of people with MGUS, SMM, and MM. They will study&#xD;
      whether the growth of blood vessels can be used to predict disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To use imaging studies to evaluate disease progression in multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have MGUS, SMM, or newly diagnosed MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also&#xD;
           have blood and urine tests, and provide bone marrow samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have positron emission tomography (PET) scans with the new contrast&#xD;
           agent [18]F-Fluciclatide. The contrast agent is intended to show patterns of increased&#xD;
           vessel growth in the bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. This scan will be&#xD;
           done according to standard procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will compare these scans with blood tests and other clinical information to&#xD;
           study disease progression of MGUS, SMM, and MM.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell neoplasm with a median survival of 3-4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma (SMM)&#xD;
           are premalignant plasma cell proliferative disorders characterized by elevated&#xD;
           monoclonal protein and bone marrow plasma cells. MGUS affects 3.2% of Caucasians over&#xD;
           the age of 50 and has a 1% annual risk of progression to MM. Approximately 3,000 cases&#xD;
           of SMM are diagnosed annually with a 10% annual risk of progression to MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently, it is not possible to predict which patients will progress to MM, and the&#xD;
           biological changes occurring in those precursor states remain poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Angiogenesis is a hallmark of multiple myeloma and its precursor disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiogenesis has been measured using microvessel density. In a prior study, we have&#xD;
      demonstrated increased microvessel density using CD34 immunohistochemistry in patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma, compared to SMM or MGUS, suggesting that there is increased vascular&#xD;
      density as the disease progresses. A correlation between MM disease stage and prognosis has&#xD;
      been reported for several serum angiogenic factors and myeloma cells and bone marrow&#xD;
      endothelial cells have been shown to secrete and respond to angiogenic modulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI is a noninvasive way to evaluate angiogenesis. In a&#xD;
           prior NIH study, we have demonstrated that the kep (a measure of contrast influx in&#xD;
           vessels in the bone marrow microenvironment) to be gradually higher in MM&gt;SMM&gt;MGUS,&#xD;
           however it was limited to imaging a single field of view (i.e. the lumbar spine). This&#xD;
           is also highly correlated with microvessel density.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluciclatide is a small cyclic peptide containing the RGD tri-peptide, which&#xD;
           preferentially binds with high affinity to Alpha(v)Beta(3) integrins, which are&#xD;
           up-regulated in angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alpha(v)Beta(3) integrins are also expressed on certain types of tumor cells and on&#xD;
           activiated osteoclasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (18)Fluciclatide (previously known (18)F-AH111585) is a new radiopharmaceutical&#xD;
           developed for PET imaging, which targets Alpha(v)Beta(3) receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Novel imaging modalities using tracers specific for angiogenesis, using&#xD;
           (18)F-Fluciclatide whole-body PET/CT imaging may improve our ability to predict patients&#xD;
           who are at high risk of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary objective of the study is to explore the distribution of (18)F-Fluciclatide&#xD;
           PET/CT in bone marrow microenvironment in patients with multiple myeloma and its&#xD;
           precursor disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary objectives are to preliminarily evaluate the distribution of&#xD;
           (18)Fluciclatide PET/CT with respect to DCE-MRI and bone marrow vascularity determined&#xD;
           by immunohistochemistry (CD34) on the bone marrow biopsy specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To preliminarily evaluate the distribution of (18)F-Fluciclatide PET/CT with respect to&#xD;
           established clinical markers of progression from MGUS/SMM to MM, including serum&#xD;
           M-protein, percentage of plasma cells in the bone marrow, serum free light-chain&#xD;
           abnormalities and immunoparesis, and ratio of normal/abnormal plasma cells in the bone&#xD;
           marrow by flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A confirmed diagnosis of MGUS, SMM or MM (based on IMWG diagnostic criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status in the range of 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a cross-sectional pilot study of patients with MGUS, SMM or MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with frank multiple myeloma will be enrolled first. If the (18)F-Fluciclatide&#xD;
           PET/CT is negative in the first 5 subjects, the study will be aborted and we will not&#xD;
           proceed with MGUS or SMM patients. However if the 18F-Fluciclatide PET/CT is positive in&#xD;
           MM patients, then we will proceed with MGUS and SMM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subsequently (18)F-Fluciclatide PET/CT and DCE-MRI imaging will be done in all the&#xD;
           patients. When feasible, an optional non-contrast wholebody MR may also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 MM, 10 SMM and 10 MGUS patients will be enrolled on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may donate cellular products or tissues as appropriate for research purposes.&#xD;
