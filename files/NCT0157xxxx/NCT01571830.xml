      -  Hypothesis 1: Food allergies are associated with poor growth which can be corrected with&#xD;
           nutrition intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  More than 10% of children with multiple food allergies will have a weight-for-age&#xD;
                z-score less than - 2 at diagnosis. The z-score is a measure of the distance from&#xD;
                the mean value, or 50th percentile on the growth chart. A z-score of less than - 2&#xD;
                indicates that the child is underweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Growth parameters of children with multiple food allergies will improve after&#xD;
                intervention by a team that includes a dietitian and an allergist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2: Food allergies are associated with low micronutrient intake which can be&#xD;
           corrected with nutrition intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o More than 30% of children with multiple food allergies will consume less than 67% of&#xD;
           the Dietary Reference Intake for at least one macronutrient or micronutrient at&#xD;
           diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Macronutrient and micronutrient intake will increase after intervention by a team that&#xD;
           includes a dietitian and an allergist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      o&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Hypothesis 3: Food allergies are related to behavioral feeding problems which can be&#xD;
      corrected with nutrition intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 25% of children with multiple food allergies will have behavioral feeding&#xD;
           problems at diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevalence of behavioral feeding problems will decrease after nutrition intervention.&#xD;

      This is a prospective observational study with repeated measure design. All participants aged&#xD;
      6 months to 6 years diagnosed with two or more food allergies will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in the research study. At least one of the two food allergies must be milk, egg, wheat, or&#xD;
      soy, which are nutritionally important food allergies. Inclusion criteria include diagnosis&#xD;
      of two or more food allergies confirmed with skin prick testing or serum specific IgE&#xD;
      (SIgE)testing. Participants aged 12 months or older will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      Mealtime Behavior Questionnaire (MBQ) and Feeding Strategies Questionnaire (FSQ).&#xD;
      Participants with developmental delay, genetic syndromes or other chronic medical conditions&#xD;
      will be excluded from the study. Participants with two or more food allergies that do not&#xD;
      have at least one nutritionally important food allergy (milk, egg, wheat, soy) will not be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study. We will also exclude participants with a history of&#xD;
      digestive surgery, non English-speaking patients, and patients currently receiving nutrition&#xD;
      support (enteral or parenteral nutrition). Patients will be excluded if they received greater&#xD;
      than one week of oral steroids in the previous three months. Exclusively breastfed infants&#xD;
      will be excluded from the study as their nutrient intake cannot accurately assessed (must&#xD;
      consume at least some foods or formulas). We will include patients if they have asthma,&#xD;
      eczema, or both. There will be no control group recruited for the study as comparisons will&#xD;
      be made within the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from the Asthma, Allergy, &amp; Immunology Clinic at the main campus&#xD;
      of Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. At the first visit with the dietitian, subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled and consent will be obtained. Height, weight, and head circumference (until 2 YO)&#xD;
      will be measured and recorded using standard procedures. The Mealtime Behavior Questionnaire&#xD;
      (MBQ) and Feeding Strategies Questionnaire (FSQ) will be filled out by the parent or&#xD;
      guardian. Demographic data and medical history will be obtained. Height/length, weight, and&#xD;
      head circumference from the first allergist visit will be obtained from the medical record&#xD;
      and recorded for use in the study. A multiple-pass 24-hour recall will be completed. In&#xD;
      addition, they will receive standardized nutrition intervention to include nutrition&#xD;
      assessment, food allergy education, and general nutrition education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will attend a second visit with the dietitian. Height, weight, and head&#xD;
      circumference will be measured and recorded using standard procedures. A multiple-pass&#xD;
      24-hour recall will be completed. The participant's parent or guardian will complete the MBQ&#xD;
      and FSQ. Follow-up nutrition intervention will include nutrition reassessment, food allergy&#xD;
      education as needed, and general nutrition education as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All aspects of this study, with the exception of MBQ, and FSQ, are the current standard of&#xD;
      care in the Asthma, Allergy, and Immunology clinic for patients with multiple food allergies.&#xD;
