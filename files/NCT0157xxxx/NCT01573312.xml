    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blinded, controlled, Phase I, small targeted&#xD;
      prospective study in healthy male and non-pregnant female subjects, 18 to 49 years old,&#xD;
      inclusive, designed to determine the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an&#xD;
      intramuscular subvirion inactivated monovalent influenza A/H5N1 (HA of A/Indonesia/05/2005)&#xD;
      virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur administered at 3.75 mcg per dose given with or&#xD;
      without AS03 adjuvant manufactured by GSK. In the study, each subject will receive two doses&#xD;
      administered 28 days apart. This study will use a systems biology approach to assess the&#xD;
      human early gene and protein signatures expressed at Days 1, 3, 7, and 28 after the first&#xD;
      vaccination. The systems data will be integrated with immunogenicity and reactogenicity data&#xD;
      to develop a systems model of the human immune response to A/H5N1 vaccine with or without&#xD;
      AS03 adjuvant.&#xD;

      The long term goals of this project are to identify RNA or protein biomarkers within 1 to 7&#xD;
      days after vaccination in peripheral blood that will predict a successful immune response and&#xD;
      protection against disease. Adjuvants are used to boost the response of vaccines by&#xD;
      stimulating the innate immune response. However, the exact mechanism and safety of adjuvants&#xD;
      is still debated. Systems biology is the study of complex biological processes as integrated&#xD;
      systems with many interacting components. The goal of systems biology is to make biology more&#xD;
      predictive. This proposal will use a systems biology approach to identify successful&#xD;
      immunization biomarkers. The study will use fresh blood samples and patient data collected in&#xD;
      the proposed VTEU-funded study. At selected time points, volunteers' blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected and immediately processed. Using these specimens, we will identify and quantify&#xD;
      changes in the whole transcriptome and proteome of the major immune cells to identify and&#xD;
      quantify changes in gene expression. We will integrate the changes in gene expression with&#xD;
      the changes in the immune cells response. We will use mathematical modeling of the&#xD;
      accumulated data to identify RNA or protein biomarkers that significantly correlate with the&#xD;
      observed serum hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) response,cytokine/chemokine response,&#xD;
      and cell mediated immunity (CMI) responses. Ultimately, the predictive biomarkers will be the&#xD;
      foundation for a simple, rapid, inexpensive test to quickly show protection against a&#xD;
      pathogen or foreign agent after vaccination. This is a single center, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blinded, controlled, Phase I, small targeted prospective study in healthy male and&#xD;
      non-pregnant female subjects, 18 to 49 years old, inclusive, designed to determine the&#xD;
      safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an intramuscular subvirion inactivated&#xD;
      monovalent influenza A/H5N1 (HA of A/Indonesia/05/2005) virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi&#xD;
      Pasteur administered at 3.75 mcg per dose given with or without AS03 adjuvant manufactured by&#xD;
      GSK. In the study, each subject will receive two doses administered 28 days apart.&#xD;

             appropriate sub-investigator, would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of&#xD;

             the interpretation of results.&#xD;

          -  Participated in an influenza A/H5 vaccine study in the past in a group receiving&#xD;
