      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People with writer s cramp develop tightness in arm muscles and abnormal hand posture when&#xD;
      writing, which makes writing difficult or impossible. At present, there is no suitable rating&#xD;
      scale to measure the symptoms of or disability associated with writer s cramp. Researchers&#xD;
      want to videotape people performing simple writing tasks. They will then compare the&#xD;
      performance of people with writer s cramp on these tasks to those of people without writer s&#xD;
      cramp. This information will help develop a rating scale to evaluate writer s cramp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To develop a new rating scale for writer s cramp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have writer s cramp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have one outpatient study visit that will last about 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will perform tasks related to writing, such as writing passages and drawing&#xD;
           spirals and loops. They will be videotaped during these tasks. They will repeat some of&#xD;
           the writing tasks three more times; on paper attached to a writing tablet, directly on&#xD;
           the writing tablet, and on a computer tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The angles made by the joints will be measured at rest not while writing&#xD;
&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;

      Objective: Writer s cramp (WC) causes significant discomfort and disability to those&#xD;
      afflicted by this condition. Studies on WC have been hampered by the lack of objective,&#xD;
      validated rating scales. In this study, we will test and validate new instruments to rate WC;&#xD;
      the WC impairment scale (WCIS) and a new disability scale (WCDS).We will also collect&#xD;
      exploratory data about biomechanics of the hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study population will consist of 20 subjects. Ten patients with WC and&#xD;
      10 age and handedness matched HVs will constitute the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: 10 patients with WC and 10 age- and handedness-matched HV will be videotaped while&#xD;
      writing. The WCIS scores will be given to each subject by four blinded raters (Drs. Mark&#xD;
      Hallett, Barbara Karp, Katherine Alter, and Camilo Toro) based on the videos. The patients&#xD;
      will complete the WCDS. In addition, each individual will be asked to repeat some basic&#xD;
      elements of the scale while writing on the screen of a tablet PC, and on the surface of a&#xD;
      detached digitizing tablet in order to generate high temporal and spatial resolution pen tip&#xD;
      position samples for further numerical analyses and scoring. The biomechanics of the hand&#xD;
      will be measured using a published scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Using the WCIS, inter and intra-rater reliability, internal consistency&#xD;
      (Cronbach s alpha) face validity, and reproducibility will be measured in addition to other&#xD;
      secondary outcomes. The ease of use by the raters will be assessed for each subject.&#xD;
      Reproducibility of writing on tablet, writing on paper placed on a writing tablet, and&#xD;
      writing on a tablet PC will be assessed. Finally, biomechanics of the hands of patients with&#xD;
      WC will be compared with those of the unaffected healthy volunteers.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion criteria for patients with WC and age and handedness-matched HVs:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must be willing to be videotaped while writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must have regular hand function with the ability to write without an&#xD;
                  assistive device&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with WC:&#xD;

               -  Patients taking oral medications for WC including muscle relaxants or other&#xD;
                  centrally-active medications such as antidepressants which may enhance tremors.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Healthy volunteers taking oral medications that may affect motor function such as&#xD;
                  muscle relaxants or centrally-active medications including medications for&#xD;
