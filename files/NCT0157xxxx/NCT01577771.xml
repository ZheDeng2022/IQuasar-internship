    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of 13-valent pneumococcal&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine among infants, toddlers and children in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.&#xD;
      Infants will be randomized to receive vaccine at 6, 10, 14 weeks or at 6 weeks, 14 weeks and&#xD;
      9 months of age. Serotype-specific serum IgG, OPA and nasopharyngeal colonization will be&#xD;
      assessed at 6 weeks, 18 weeks, 9 months and 10 months of age. Toddlers 12-15 months of age&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive either a single dose of PCV13 or 2 doses 2 months apart.&#xD;
      Serotype-specific serum IgG and OPA will be measured pre-dose 1 and again 3 months later.&#xD;
      Children 2 to 4 years of age will receive a single dose of PCV13 and have IgG and OPA&#xD;
      assessments pre-vaccination and 1 month post-vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunogenicity and reactogenicity of PCV13 in the &quot;standard schedule&quot; groups (e.g. 6, 10,&#xD;
      14 weeks for infants and single dose for toddlers) will be compared to that observed in the&#xD;
      PCV13 licensure trials. Within each age group the alternative schedule will be compared to&#xD;
      the standard schedule in terms of immunogenicity and impact on nasopharyngeal carriage&#xD;
      (infants only).&#xD;
