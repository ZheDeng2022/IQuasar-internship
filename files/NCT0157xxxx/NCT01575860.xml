      This study is being conducted to evaluate the overall safety of lenalidomide (also known as&#xD;
      Revlimid) in patients with lymphoma, and to determine whether it is effective in preventing&#xD;
      this disease from returning after stem cell transplant. This study will also determine the&#xD;
      dose of lenalidomide that can be given without causing severe side effects. Lenalidomide has&#xD;
      not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of&#xD;
      lymphoma. At least 28 people will be enrolled on this study at the University of&#xD;
      Pennsylvania.&#xD;

      Describe succinctly and clearly the past findings which justify the plan for this project. A&#xD;
      summary of the relevant literature in the area of interest and reports of previous studies&#xD;
      should be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For majority of lymphoma patients who relapse after complete response or who are primary&#xD;
      refractory to initial treatment, a combination of salvage chemotherapy followed by high dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy and ASCT is considered the standard of care. Sensitivity to salvage chemotherapy&#xD;
      affects the outcome after ASCT. Traditionally, the response to salvage chemotherapy prior&#xD;
      ASCT was determined by conventional computed tomography (CT) scans using size criteria. In&#xD;
      the past several years, it has been shown that functional imaging with PET scans using&#xD;
      fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) provides additional information to anatomic imaging with CTs.&#xD;
      Recently, PET scans have been incorporated into the response assessment as published by the&#xD;
      Imaging Subcommittee of International Harmonization Project in Lymphoma. These days, most&#xD;
      institutions use PET/CT scans which incorporate functional imaging with PET scan fused with&#xD;
      low dose non-contrast enhanced CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have previously reported the outcome of patients with relapsed/refractory lymphomas who&#xD;
      continued to have residual FDG avid PET (positive) lesions after salvage chemotherapy and&#xD;
      prior to ASCT. This group of patients included those who had excellent anatomic response by&#xD;
      size criteria, but continued to have persistent hypermetabolic FDG activity within the&#xD;
      residual lesions. We found that PET positive patients have an extremely poor chance of&#xD;
      durable remission after ASCT. In the PET negative group, the median PFS was 19 months with&#xD;
      54% of patients without progression at 12 months after ASCT. In the PET positive group, the&#xD;
      median PFS was 5 months with only 7% of patients without progression at 12 months after ASCT.&#xD;
      We concluded that, for patients with PET positive residual disease after salvage chemotherapy&#xD;
      and prior to ASCT, novel therapeutic approaches and agents need to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide is a proprietary IMiD® compound of Celgene Corporation. IMiD® compounds have&#xD;
      both immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic properties which could confer antitumor and&#xD;
      antimetastatic effects. Although the exact antitumor mechanism of action of lenalidomide is&#xD;
      unknown, a number of mechanisms are postulated to be responsible for lenalidomides activity&#xD;
      against hematological malignancies. Lenalidomide has been demonstrated to possess&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic activity through inhibition of bFGF, VEGF and TNF-alpha induced endothelial&#xD;
      cell migration, due at least in part to inhibition of Akt phosphorylation response to bFGF.&#xD;
      In addition, lenalidomide has a variety of immunomodulatory effects. Lenalidomide stimulates&#xD;
      T cell proliferation, and the production of IL-2, IL-10 and IFN-gamma, inhibits IL-1 beta and&#xD;
      IL-6 and modulates IL-12 production. Up-regulation of T cell derived IL-2 production is&#xD;
      achieved at least in part through increased AP-1 activity. The increased levels of&#xD;
      circulating cytokines augment natural killer cell number and function, and enhance natural&#xD;
      killer cell activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical activity of lenalidomide in various lymphoma subtypes has been documented in several&#xD;
      phase II trials. In patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma, the overall&#xD;
      response rate (ORR) was 53% with PFS at 12 month 40%. In patients with aggressive lymphoma&#xD;
      (mostly diffuse large B-cell subtype), the ORR was 35% with PFS at 12 months about 25%. There&#xD;
      also have been many case reports of patients who achieved durable complete response to&#xD;
      lenalidomide after failing multiple cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most clinical studies of lenalidomide in patients with active lymphoma used dose of 25 mg&#xD;
      daily on days 1-21 in 28 day cycle which is the dosing recommended for active multiple&#xD;
      myeloma. While lenalidomide was well tolerated in the lymphoma studies, the dose of 25 mg is&#xD;
      associated with high risk of developing cytopenias including grade 3 neutropenia in 25-40% of&#xD;
      patients and thrombocytopenia in 12-20%. Our group reported that low dose lenalidomide at 10&#xD;
      mg daily (continuous dosing) in combination with weekly dexamethasone can be effective in&#xD;
      patients with active relapsed/refractory low grade and mantle cell lymphomas. The continuous&#xD;
      dose of 10 mg daily has also been used in treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small&#xD;
      lymphocytic lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide has been used as maintenance therapy in multiple myeloma, but there is limited&#xD;
      experience with maintenance lenalidomide in lymphoma patients. Two large clinical trials of&#xD;
      maintenance lenalidomide in patients with multiple myeloma after ASCT have shown benefit in&#xD;
      PFS over observation. These studies used daily dosing of lenalidomide at 10 mg or 15 mg which&#xD;
      were well tolerated over long term administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Revlimid® (lenalidomide) is currently indicated for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes&#xD;
      associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic&#xD;
      abnormalities. Revlimid® is also approved in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment&#xD;
      of patients with multiple myeloma that have received at least one prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most frequently reported adverse events reported during clinical studies with&#xD;
      lenalidomide in oncologic and non-oncologic indications, regardless of presumed relationship&#xD;
      to study medication include: anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia,&#xD;
      abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, dehydration, rash, itching, infections,&#xD;
      sepsis, pneumonia, UTI, Upper respiratory infection, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart&#xD;
      failure, myocardial infarction, chest pain, weakness, hypotension, hypercalcemia,&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, back pain, bone pain, generalized pain, dizziness, mental status changes,&#xD;
      syncope, renal failure, dyspnea, pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis,&#xD;
      CVA, convulsions, dizziness, spinal cord compression, syncope, disease progression, death not&#xD;
      specified and fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete and updated adverse events are available in the Investigational Drug Brochure and&#xD;
      the IND Safety Letters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Treatment in this Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previously reported data and similar studies from other institutions indicate that&#xD;
      patients with PET positive lesions after salvage chemotherapy and prior ASCT do very poorly.&#xD;
      In our study, patients with residual PET positive lesions before ASCT had median PFS of 5&#xD;
      months with only 7% of patients without progression at 12 months after ASCT. It can be&#xD;
      speculated that patients with PET positive lesions prior ASCT harbor chemotherapy resistant&#xD;
      lymphoma cells in their tumors. Since the mechanism of action of lenalidomide differs from&#xD;
      traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, the use of this novel agent in this group of patients is&#xD;
      an attractive concept. The immunomodulary properties of lenalidomide over the maintenance&#xD;
      period of 24 months could improve the overall outcome of patients following ASCT. Since there&#xD;
      is a valid concern that lenalidomide could cause severe cytopenias when used early after&#xD;
      ASCT, we proposed to administer dose 10 mg of lenalidomide daily with an option of dose&#xD;
      modification to 5 mg daily according to previously defined toxicity criteria. The daily&#xD;
      maintenance dosing of lenalidomide at 10 mg has been used in patients with multiple myeloma&#xD;
      after ASCT and improved PFS in two large randomized trials.&#xD;
