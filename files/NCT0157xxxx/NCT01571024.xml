    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and tolerability of BKM120 when combined&#xD;
      with mFOLFOX6 and to define the maximum tolerated dose of BKM120 in this combination in&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors including metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This single arm, multicenter, open-label Phase I clinical trial has been designed to&#xD;
      establish the safety and tolerability of dose escalating BKM120 when combined with mFOLFOX6&#xD;
      and to define the MTD of BKM120 in this combination. Secondary objective will be to estimate&#xD;
      the response rate, Progression Free Survival rate, and Overall Survival rate, after treatment&#xD;
      with the Maximum Tolerated Dose of BKM120 in combination with mFOLFOX6 in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors and metastatic pancreatic cancer. Eligible patients will be treated&#xD;
      with BKM120 orally (PO), once per day (QD) in combination with mFOLFOX6 administered&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle using a standard 3+3 dose&#xD;
      escalation scheme. Each cycle will be repeated every 4 weeks (28 days). FOLFOX6 treatment&#xD;
      will be as follows: Oxaliplatin: 85 mg/m2 IV, Leucovorin: 400 mg/m2 IV, 5FU bolus: 400 mg/m2&#xD;
      IV and 5FU infusion: 2400 mg/m2 IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events (AEs), treatment may continue until:&#xD;
      disease progression, intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,&#xD;
      unacceptable AE(s), patient decides to withdraw from the study, or general or specific&#xD;
      changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in&#xD;
      the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
