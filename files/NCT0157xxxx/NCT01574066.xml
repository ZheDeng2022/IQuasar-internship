      patients with suspected Community-acquired Pneumonia (CAP).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rational: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a frequent infectious disorder in patients&#xD;
      visiting the ED. CAP is responsible for high morbidity and associated-mortality is increasing&#xD;
      in Western countries. CAP corresponds to invasion of the lung by pathogens. Diagnosis depends&#xD;
      on clinical and X-ray assessment. However, these signs and symptoms are poorly specific and&#xD;
      are often lacking. As prognosis depends on precocious and fitted antimicrobial treatment,&#xD;
      making CAP diagnosis in a short time span (4-8 hours) is mandatory. Preliminary studies&#xD;
      suggest that chest CT-scan could over-performed X-ray for diagnosis of CAP. Consensus&#xD;
      conferences suggest the use of CT-scan in patients with uncertain diagnosis and unusual&#xD;
      presentation and outcome. Because CT-scan is currently easily available, its use in a first&#xD;
      intent is questionable for ED patients with suspected CAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: to estimate impact of CT-scan on diagnostic for ED patients with suspected&#xD;
      CAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: to estimate impact of CT-scan on treatment (antimicrobial therapy) and&#xD;
      site of care for ED patients with suspected CAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective multicenter study to measure chest CT-scan impact. 350 patients visiting the ED&#xD;
      of 4 inner tertiary teaching hospitals in Paris, France, with suspected CAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management: Patients will be managed according to current guidelines, including conventional&#xD;
      chest X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation criteria. Attending ED physicians will implement pre- and post-test proforma for&#xD;
      diagnosis (CAP) level of certainty, treatment (antimicrobial agents), site of care, before&#xD;
      and after chest CT-scan. Comparison of ED physician's answers before/after CT-scan. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed until day 28. An adjudication committee (1 pneumologist, 1 infectiologist, 1&#xD;
      radiologist)will review patients' data for gold standard diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations: The investigators hypothesize that chest CT-scan wil modify&#xD;
      diagnosis certainty in 20%. This implies that 300 participants should be enrolled to allow&#xD;
      assessment of changes in 15 % et 25 %. Undue changes will be calculated a posteriori when&#xD;
      diagnosis gold standard will be established by adjudication committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results: Chest CT-scan should improve diagnosis certainty, treatment and&#xD;
      site-of-care in patients visiting the ED with suspected CAP. If this is observed in at least&#xD;
      20%, the investigators will measure impact of chest CT-scan in a prospective randomized&#xD;
      interventional study.&#xD;
