  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatic heart valve diseases are prevalent among the young people in Egypt secondary to the&#xD;
      socioeconomic conditions. The goal of anesthetic management of these patients is maintenance&#xD;
      of sinus rhythm, systemic blood pressure, preload, coronary perfusion, and cardiac output.&#xD;
      Many women still prefer general anesthesia rather than regional techniques at the author's&#xD;
      country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacological modifications of the sympathetic response to tracheal intubation and&#xD;
      surgical stimulation using opioids have adverse effects on the neonatal outcome after&#xD;
      cesarean delivery. The authors have demonstrated in their previous studies the safety of both&#xD;
      perioperative infusion of both of ketorolac and lidocaine in the attenuation of the&#xD;
      hemodynamic and hormonal responses of tracheal intubation and surgery during cesarean&#xD;
      delivery with favorable neonatal outcome and without added risk of perioperative bleeding.&#xD;
      Therefore, the authors reported successful anesthetic management of a parturient with&#xD;
      infective endocarditis on top of rheumatic mitral valve disease with use of&#xD;
      paracetamol-lidocaine-ketorolac-propofol anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the perioperative use of ketorolac-lidocaine would reduce&#xD;
      the maternal hemodynamic responses to intubation and surgery without any harmful effects on&#xD;
      mother or baby during uncomplicated cesarean delivery in the parturients with valvular hear&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are aiming to compare the effects of ketorolac-lidocaine and fentanyl on&#xD;
      surgical stress responses, intraoperative fentanyl and vasoactive drugs consumption and&#xD;
      neonatal outcome during cesarean delivery in the parturients with valvular hear diseases.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All parturients will receive oral ranitidine 150 mg on the night and the morning of surgery&#xD;
      and 30 mL of 0.3 mol/L sodium citrate, 15 min before induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All operations will be performed by the same obstetricians. Voluven 6% solution 7 mL/kg will&#xD;
      be infused over 30 min. Left uterine displacement will be maintained before induction. All&#xD;
      routine medications except angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors will be continued until&#xD;
      the morning of the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be monitored with pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure and five&#xD;
      leads electrocardiography (leads II and V5). A radial artery catheter and a central venous&#xD;
      catheter will be placed under local anesthesia before induction. On-screen pressure tracing&#xD;
      will be used to determine end-expiration, and the CVP will be averaged over three respiratory&#xD;
      cycles to eliminate respiratory artifacts. All staff in the operating room will be unaware of&#xD;
      the randomization code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After pre-oxygenation for 5 min, a rapid sequence induction will be performed with propofol&#xD;
      1-2.5 mg/kg and suxamethonium 1.5 mg/kg. Cricoid pressure will be applied, laryngoscopy will&#xD;
      be performed after the 1-min blood pressure recording, and tracheal intubation will be&#xD;
      completed before the 2-min reading. Anesthesia will be maintained with end-tidal&#xD;
      concentrations of 2-2.5% of sevoflurane, in combination with 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen and&#xD;
      cisatarcurium 0.1-0.2 mg/kg. The patients' lungs will be ventilated to maintain an EtCO2 of&#xD;
      4-4.6 kPa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the umbilical cord was clamped, infusion of 5-10 U oxytocin, midazolam 0.05 mg/kg and&#xD;
      fentanyl 1-2 µg/kg will be given and nitrous oxide will be increased to 70%. Sevoflurane will&#xD;
      be discontinued at the start of skin closure and the nitrous oxide will be discontinued after&#xD;
      the last skin suture will be applied. At the end of surgery, residual neuromuscular block&#xD;
      will be antagonized with neostigmine 50 µg/kg and atropine 20 µg/kg, and trachea will be&#xD;
      extubated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative hypertension, defines as increase in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) &gt;= 25%&#xD;
      of baseline for more than 1 min, with or without associated tachycardia (defined as HR value&#xD;
      &gt; 20% of the baseline value &gt; 2 min) will be treated with IV boluses of fentanyl (1μg/kg). If&#xD;
      blood pressure levels do not reach at least 20% of baseline levels after 5 min, slow&#xD;
      intravenous administration of labetalol 20 mg will be considered. In the presence of&#xD;
      hypotensive episodes (MAP decreased to &lt;= 60 mmHg &gt;= 2-3 min) and CVP &lt; 8 mmHg, 5-7 ml/kg of&#xD;
      6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 will be given. In the presence of MAP ≤ 60 mmHg, and CVP &gt; 10&#xD;
      mmHg, repeated bolus doses of ephedrine 5 mg will be given 5 min apart from each dose.&#xD;
      Tachycardia ≥ 20% from the baseline values for ≥ 1 min will be treated with boluses of&#xD;
      esmolol 20 mg.&#xD;
