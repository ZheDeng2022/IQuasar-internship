  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, GSK356278, is a possible new medicine for the treatment of Huntington's&#xD;
      disease. Huntington's disease, which is often called HD, is caused by a faulty gene that is&#xD;
      passed down through families. HD causes damage to nerve cells in the brain which causes them&#xD;
      to waste away. As the damage progresses patients develop symptoms that affect every aspect of&#xD;
      life. HD reduces people's ability to walk, talk, think, communicate and causes uncontrolled&#xD;
      movements. GSK356278 may slow down the progression of damage to nerve cells in people with HD&#xD;
      and help with their ability to think.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GSK356278 was well tolerated when it was given as a single dose to healthy people. In this&#xD;
      study we want to see what effects, both good and bad, GSK356278 has in people when it is&#xD;
      taken every day. During the study we will look at about 3 different doses of GSK356278 in&#xD;
      about 36 healthy people. The study will also look at how GSK356278 tablets behave in the body&#xD;
      after it is swallowed (this is called pharmacokinetics). The study will also look at effects&#xD;
      of GSK356278 on the body (this is called pharmacodynamics). The study will help to design&#xD;
      future clinical studies with GSK356278.&#xD;
