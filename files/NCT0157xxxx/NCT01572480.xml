    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple myeloma is a blood cancer that affects the plasma cells. These cells help&#xD;
           produce antibodies and fight infection. Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is a related&#xD;
           condition that may develop into multiple myeloma. The current standard of care for SMM&#xD;
           is close follow-up without treatment until multiple myeloma develops. However,&#xD;
           researchers are studying possible treatments for SMM itself. One possible treatment&#xD;
           involves a combination of cancer treatment drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide is a drug that may help reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
           Dexamethasone is a steroid that is often given with other anti-cancer drugs. These two&#xD;
           drugs are an approved treatment for multiple myeloma that has not responded to at least&#xD;
           one other treatment. Carfilzomib is an experimental drug that has been effective in&#xD;
           treating multiple myeloma. Researchers want to combine these three drugs to see if they&#xD;
           are a safe and effective treatment for SMM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone are a safe and effective treatment&#xD;
      for smoldering multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have SMM that is likely to progress to multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also&#xD;
           have blood and urine tests, and baseline bone marrow scans. Bone marrow samples will&#xD;
           also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have eight 28-day cycles of treatment with the three study drugs. The&#xD;
           drugs will be given as tablets or as infusions. Treatment will be monitored with&#xD;
           frequent blood tests and study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the first four cycles, participants who are eligible for a stem cell transplant&#xD;
           will have their stem cells collected and stored for future use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of eight cycles, participants whose disease has not progressed will have up&#xD;
           to 12 more cycles of treatment with lenalidomide tablets alone.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMM is a precursor condition to MM defined by the clinical parameters of M-protein &gt;= 3.0&#xD;
      g/dL or bone marrow plasma cells &gt;= 10% and absence of end organ disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of progression of high risk SMM at 5 years is 72-75% with median time to progression &lt; 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care for SMM is close follow-up without treatment until symptomatic&#xD;
      MM develops. However, IMWG states &quot;Preventive clinical trials need to be considered for&#xD;
      patients with high risk smoldering myeloma&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carfilzomib is a new proteasome inhibitor with potent anti-MM effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the response rate of CRd in patients with high-risk SMM, focusing on the&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRD(-) CR rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMM according to the International Myeloma Working Group definition; i.e.:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum M-protein &gt;=3 g/dl and/or bone marrow plasma cells &gt;=10 % and &lt; 60%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absence of anemia: Hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absence of renal failure: serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absence of hypercalcemia: Ca &lt; 10.5 mg/dl or 2.65 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absence of lytic bone lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Involved/un-involved light chain ratio must be &lt; 100&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-risk SMM per Mayo Clinic, Spanish PETHEMA, or the Rajkumar, Landgren, Mateos criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;=18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate laboratory parameters as defined in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single arm pilot trial of combination therapy (carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone)&#xD;
      for high risk smoldering multiple myeloma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 8 cycles of induction combination therapy of CRd&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle consists of 28-days&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4 cycles of therapy, transplant eligible patients may choose to undergo stem cell&#xD;
      collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 8 cycles of CRd, patients will receive lenalidomide extended dosing (phase I) for 12&#xD;
      cycles. After 12 cycles, patients will have the option to continue extended dosing (phase II)&#xD;
      for one additional year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have routine blood work with SPEP and free light chains monthly during the&#xD;
      induction phase. Laboratory evaluations may be spread out to every 3 months during the&#xD;
      maintenance and follow-up phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment, post-treatment and follow-up bone marrow biopsies will be obtained for&#xD;
      confirmation of diagnosis, response and correlative studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also undergo evaluation for minimal residual disease at regular interval time&#xD;
      points, using multi-parametric flow cytometry and FDG PET-CT&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single arm pilot study will plan on initially enrolling 12 evaluable patients to detect&#xD;
      a VGPR from baseline. A replicate cohort of 16 evaluable patients will then be enrolled in&#xD;
      order to more precisely define the response rate to the CRd regimen in this population.&#xD;
      Accrual will then be extended to a total of 50 evaluable patients in order to estimate the&#xD;
      MRD(-) CR rate with reasonable precision. To allow for a number of inevaluable patients and&#xD;
      screen failures, the accrual ceiling will be set at 63.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed Smoldering Multiple Myeloma&#xD;
        confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI or the Department of Laboratory Medicine, CC&#xD;
        based on the International Myeloma Working Group Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum M-protein greater than or equal to 3 g/dl and/or bone marrow plasma cells&#xD;
             greater than or equal 10% and &lt;60%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of anemia: Hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of renal failure: serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of hypercalcemia: Ca &lt;10.5 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of lytic bone lesion on X-ray, CT, or PET/CT and not more than 1 lesion on&#xD;
             spinal MRI. (NOTE: At the discretion of the investigator, PET/CT may replace MRI in&#xD;
             patients who have a contraindication to MRI.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Involved-un-involved light chain ratio must be &lt;100&#xD;
&#xD;
        Measurable disease within the past 4 weeks defined by any one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum monoclonal protein greater than or equal to 1.0 g/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urine monoclonal protein &gt;200 mg/24 hour&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum immunoglobulin free light chain &gt;10 mg/dL AND abnormal kappa/lambda ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: As of Amendment L (version date 05/17/2018), the primary endpoint is MRD(-) CR rate;&#xD;
        therefore, per the discretion of the Principal Investigator, patients without measurable&#xD;
        disease (e.g., M-spike &lt;1) may also be enrolled. This is in line with the most recent IMWG&#xD;
        MM response criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
        currently available on the use of carfilzomib in combination with lenalidomide in patients&#xD;
        &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but may be eligible for future&#xD;
        pediatric trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to1.0 K/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: At the discretion of the investigator, patients with an ANC of 0.5 K/uL &lt;1.0 K/uL may&#xD;
        also be enrolled if clinically appropriate (e.g., patients with a baseline neutropenia that&#xD;
        is chronic and that does not cause complications)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  platelets greater than or equal to75 K/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8 g/dL(transfusions are permissible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 3.0 times institutional upper limit of&#xD;
             normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 X institutional ULN. If serum creatinine is&#xD;
             above 1.5 X ULN, Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) or eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration&#xD;
             rate) must be greater than or equal to 50 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CrCl will be calculated by Cockcroft-Gault method. CrCl (calculated) = (140 -&#xD;
                  Age) x Mass (in kilograms) x [0.85 if Female] 72 x Serum Creatinine (in mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  eGFR will be calculated by either of the following well established formulas:&#xD;
                  modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) or the chronic kidney disease&#xD;
                  (CKD)-epidemiology collaboration (EPI)(institutional standard) equations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CrCl may also be determined by measuring a 24 hour urine collection. The measured CrCl&#xD;
             must be greater than or equal to 50 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition to having SMM, patients must also be classified as 'high-risk SMM' per Mayo&#xD;
        Clinic or Spanish PETHEMA criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria set forward by Rajkumar, Landgren, Mateos[14] may also be used to define high risk&#xD;
        disease, namely clonal bone marrow plasma cells greater than or equal to 10% and any one or&#xD;
        more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum M protein greater than or equal to 30g/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IgA SMM&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunoparesis with reduction of 2 uninvolved immunoglobulin isotypes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum involved/uninvolved FLC ratio greater than or equal to 8 (but less than 100)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progressive increase in M protein level (evolving type of SMM; increase in serum M&#xD;
             protein by greater than or equal to 25% on 2 successive evaluations within a 6-month&#xD;
             period)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clonal BMPCs 50%-60%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal PC immunophenotype (greater than or equal to 95% of BMPCs are clonal) and&#xD;
             reduction of greater than or equal to 1 uninvolved immunoglobulin isotypes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  t(4;14) or del(17p) or 1q gain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Increased circulating PCs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MRI with diffuse abnormalities or 1 focal lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PET-CT with focal lesion with increased uptake without underlying osteolytic bone&#xD;
             destruction&#xD;
&#xD;
        All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist program, and be&#xD;
        willing and able to comply with the requirements of REMS .&#xD;
&#xD;
        The effects of carfilzomib and lenalidomide on the developing human fetus are unknown. The&#xD;
        immunomodulatory agents used in this trial (i.e., lenalidomide) are known to be&#xD;
        teratogenic. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
        contraception. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
        pregnancy test within 10 - 14 days and again within 24 hours prior to prescribing&#xD;
        lenalidomide for Cycle 1 (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days) and must either&#xD;
        commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable&#xD;
        methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method&#xD;
        AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide. FCBP must also&#xD;
        agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual&#xD;
        contact with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy. All patients must be&#xD;
        counseled at a minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal&#xD;
        exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
        participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. In&#xD;
        regard to carfilzomib, FCBP and their male partners must agree to use at least one method&#xD;
        of effective contraception for at least 30 days after the&#xD;
&#xD;
        last dose of carfilzomib and males must agree to use contraception and not to donate sperm&#xD;
        for at least 90 days after the last dose of carfilzomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
        document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent systemic treatment or prior therapy within 4 weeks for SMM&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Treatment with corticosteroids for other indications is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a diagnosis of MM as defined by the 2014 IMWH diagnostic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraindication to any concomitant medication, including antivirals, anticoagulation&#xD;
        prophylaxis, tumor lysis prophylaxis, or hydration given prior to therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
        composition to carfilzomib or lenalidomide agents used in study, such as bortezomib or&#xD;
        thalidomide, in addition to patients with known allergy to sulfobutyl ether &lt;=-&#xD;
        cyclodextrin (Captisol ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant or lactating females. Pregnant women are excluded from this study. The effects of&#xD;
        carfilzomib on a developing human fetus are unknown. Lenalidomide is teratogenic with&#xD;
        unknown potential for abortifacient effects. Breastfeeding women and women planning on&#xD;
        breastfeeding may not participate. No studies of carfilzomib have&#xD;
&#xD;
        been conducted on breast feeding women and it is not known if it is excreted in milk.&#xD;
        Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
        secondary to treatment of the mother with Carfilzomib/Lenalidomide, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
        discontinued if the mother is treated with Carfilzomib/Lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Significant cardiovascular disease with NYHA Class II, III or IV symptoms, or hypertrophic&#xD;
        cardiomegaly, or restrictive cardiomegaly, or myocardial infarction within 3 months prior&#xD;
        to enrollment, or unstable angina, or unstable arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active hepatitis B or C infection&#xD;

        bowel resection that would prevent absorption&#xD;
&#xD;
        Significant neuropathy &gt;Grade 2 at the time of first dose or within 14 days of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
        arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations within 2 weeks that would limit&#xD;
        compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of other malignancy (apart from basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervix&#xD;
        carcinoma) except if the patient has been free of symptoms and without active therapy&#xD;
        during at least 2 years or if, at the clinical discretion of the investigator, the risks of&#xD;
        this study do not outweigh the potential benefits on a case to case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Major surgery within 1 month prior to enrollment.&#xD;
