  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circulating tumor cells (CTC) are the subject of increasing interest in clinical oncology as&#xD;
      a prognostic factor and predictor of therapeutic response. The detection of CTC by&#xD;
      immunomagnetic method has proved its reliability and its usefulness for monitoring breast&#xD;
      cancer, colon and prostate in the metastatic and immunomagnetic detection system (CellSearch,&#xD;
      Veridex LLC) was approved by the FDA in these indications. However, to date there is no&#xD;
      reliable method to detect CTCs in melanoma (CMC). Studies based on PCR amplification of mRNA&#xD;
      by reverse specific melanoma is disappointing. Recently, a new detection system of CMC&#xD;
      immunomagnetic was presented (CellSearch, Veridex LLC, United States). This system has the&#xD;
      advantage of combining immunomagnetic selection step and a step of identifying by&#xD;
      immunofluorescence. A preclinical study on serial dilutions of melanoma cells has shown&#xD;
      encouraging results. The investigators propose a prospective study of the CellSearch system&#xD;
      in patients with melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To determine the effect of treatment on the number of circulating melanoma&#xD;
      cells in patients with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine the percentage of patients with metastatic melanoma with melanoma cells&#xD;
           circulating&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  seek a relationship between the number of circulating melanoma cells and prognosis in&#xD;
           patients with metastatic melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  seek a relationship between the change in the number of circulating melanoma cells&#xD;
           before / after treatment and tumor response in patients with metastatic melanoma&#xD;
