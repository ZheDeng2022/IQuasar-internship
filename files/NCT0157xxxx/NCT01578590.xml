    <textblock>
      Rationale: The consumption of dietary protein immediately after exercise is necessary to&#xD;
      maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis rates (24, 37). Recent work suggests that the&#xD;
      type of protein consumed (e.g., animal vs. plant-derived proteins) during post-exercise&#xD;
      recovery can affect the amplitude of acute increases in muscle protein synthesis rates (25,&#xD;
      31). Specifically, consumption of bovine milk proteins immediately after a single bout of&#xD;
      resistance exercise stimulates muscle protein synthesis rates greater than consumption of an&#xD;
      isonitrogenous soy-protein beverage (31, 37). Importantly, consumption of milk promotes&#xD;
      greater hypertrophy than soy after resistance training (10). Thus, it is generally assumed&#xD;
      that the acute muscle protein synthetic response predicts long-term training outcomes, such&#xD;
      as hypertrophy. Currently, a great amount of work has been carried out to study the effects&#xD;
      of consuming milk proteins on muscle protein synthesis rates after resistance exercise (5, 7,&#xD;
      26, 32). However, very little is known about the effects of other types of high-quality&#xD;
      animal proteins, such as beef, on stimulating post-exercise muscle protein synthesis rates.&#xD;
      Further describing the muscle protein synthetic response after consumption of other types of&#xD;
      high-quality animal proteins will provide valuable information for individuals with milk&#xD;
      allergies, lactose intolerance, or simply a strong dislike of dairy products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate whether the in vivo post-resistance exercise muscle protein&#xD;
      synthetic response is augmented when minced beef is ingested as compared to an&#xD;
      isonitrogenous-matched milk protein beverage in healthy young men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Crossover, randomized&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 12 healthy young males (18-35 y).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Subjects will perform resistance exercise and consume either a piece of meat&#xD;
      (135 grams, 35 g of protein) or an isonitrogenous-matched milk protein beverage on two&#xD;
      separate test days. In addition, continuous intravenous tracer infusions will be applied,&#xD;
      with plasma and muscle samples collected. A two week 'wash-out' period will be included&#xD;
      between trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints Primary endpoint: Muscle protein synthetic rate, expressed as&#xD;
      fractional synthetic rate (FSR). Secondary endpoints: Rate of protein digestion and&#xD;
      absorption and whole body protein balance.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance exercise and protein ingestion can act separately and synergistically to stimulate&#xD;
      muscle protein synthesis rates. This synergy of muscle contraction and protein ingestion&#xD;
      provides the basis for training-mediated hypertrophy. Many workers have manipulated&#xD;
      post-exercise feeding paradigms in an attempt to define the 'optimal' protein source to&#xD;
      consume to support muscle protein accretion. Original work was performed using intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of mixed amino acids or bolus ingestion of mixtures of crystalline amino acids;&#xD;
      however, consuming free amino acids rarely occurs in normal dietary situations. Currently,&#xD;
      there has been a great deal of interest in studying the capacity of dairy proteins to&#xD;
      stimulate post exercise muscle protein synthesis rates and promote training-mediated&#xD;
      hypertrophy. Dairy proteins represent an attractive protein source for researchers to study&#xD;
      because they are rapidly digested/absorbed and contain a high proportional of essential amino&#xD;
      acid, especially leucine. Both of these characteristics, speed of digestion/absorption and&#xD;
      peak amplitude in leucinemia, are fundamental for the maximal stimulation of muscle protein&#xD;
      synthesis rates after protein ingestion. However, very little is known about the effects of&#xD;
      other types of high-quality animal proteins, such as beef, on stimulating post-exercise&#xD;
      muscle protein synthesis rates. Beef is considered a high-quality and widely consumed protein&#xD;
      source. Importantly, a 113-g serving of beef contains 30 g of protein (~10 g essential amino&#xD;
      acids; ~2 g leucine) and is similar in amino acid composition to that of milk proteins.&#xD;
      Certainly, some evidence suggests that the synergistic effect of exercise and feeding on&#xD;
      muscle protein synthesis rates is still apparent after consumption of beef. However, the&#xD;
      workers did not compare this response to a group that consumed an alternative high-quality&#xD;
      isonitrogenous-matched animal-derived protein source. As a result, it can only be speculated&#xD;
      on the capacity of beef to stimulate muscle protein synthesis rates as compared to milk&#xD;
      proteins during post exercise recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we wish to determine the impact of single meal-like amount of minced&#xD;
      beef or dairy milk on digestion and absorption kinetics and post exercise muscle protein&#xD;
      synthesis rates. This study will be the first to directly compare two commonly consumed&#xD;
      protein-rich food items on muscle protein synthesis rates in healthy young men. This&#xD;
      information will be highly relevant for developing nutritional interventions for maintaining&#xD;
      and accruing muscle mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES &amp; OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypothesis will be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ingestion of minced meat after resistance exercise increases muscle protein synthesis rates&#xD;
      to a greater extent than ingestion of bovine milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine whether the intake of minced beef is more effective than&#xD;
      ingestion of a milk protein beverage in stimulating post exercise muscle protein synthesis&#xD;
      rates in young men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: 1) To assess protein digestion and absorption and whole body protein&#xD;
      balance in healthy young men. 2) To evaluate postprandial aminoacidemia after ingestion of&#xD;
      minced beef or a milk protein beverage in healthy young men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study employs a crossover design. In total, 12 healthy young male subjects will&#xD;
      be included in the study. Subjects will be randomly assigned to consume minced beef or milk&#xD;
      during trial one. During the test day, subjects will perform leg extension exercise and&#xD;
      immediately afterwards consume 35 g of protein either as minced beef or milk. Approximately,&#xD;
      two weeks later subjects will return to the laboratory for the identical experimental&#xD;
      procedures as trial 1, which includes exercise that is worked-match to trial 1 and&#xD;
      consumption of alternative protein source that was not consumed in trial 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in one screening session in which leg volume, body weight and&#xD;
      composition (DEXA) will be assessed. Subjects will be asked to fill in a medical&#xD;
      questionnaire inquiring about their general health, medical history, use of medication and&#xD;
      sports activities. Additionally, all subjects will participate in an orientation session for&#xD;
      familiarization with the exercise equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will arrive at the laboratory at 8.30 AM by car or public transportation. Body&#xD;
      weight and height will be assessed, as well as body fat composition (percentage) via a Dual&#xD;
      Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. In the event of an unexpected medical finding during&#xD;
      the screening, subjects will always be notified. If a subject does not want to receive this&#xD;
      notification he cannot participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the familiarization session with the exercise equipment, proper lifting technique will&#xD;
      be demonstrated for knee extension exercise. A guided-motion exercise machine will be used to&#xD;
      promote proper form and for the subject's personal safety. Prior to the determination of the&#xD;
      subject's one repetition maximum (1RM), they will perform 2 sets of leg extension exercise&#xD;
      for 10 repetitions on the exercise machine at a light load. Thereafter, the load will be&#xD;
      increased after each successful lift until failure. 5 min rest periods will be allowed&#xD;
      between attempts. A repetition is valid if the subject uses proper form and is able to&#xD;
      complete the entire lift in a controlled manner without assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental test day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will participate in 2 experimental test days, separated by 14 days, with each&#xD;
      day lasting 8.5 h. During a test day, subjects perform a single bout of knee extension&#xD;
      exercise and will ingest a 135-gram of minced beef patty containing 35 g of protein or an&#xD;
      isonitrogenous-matched milk protein beverage. The use of a L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine,&#xD;
      L-[ring-2H2]-tyrosine, and [1-13C]-leucine infusion will allow us to assess the digestion and&#xD;
      absorption kinetics of the ingested protein source and the fractional synthetic rate (FSR) of&#xD;
      muscle proteins in the fasting and fed state in an in vivo human setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 8.00 am, following an overnight fast, subjects will arrive at the laboratory by car or&#xD;
      public transportation. Subject will rest in a supine position and a Teflon catheter will be&#xD;
      inserted into an antecubital vein for intravenous stable isotope infusion. A second Teflon&#xD;
      catheter will be inserted in a heated dorsal hand vein of the contralateral arm and placed in&#xD;
      a hot-box (60C) for arterialized blood sampling. Following basal blood collection (8 mL;&#xD;
      t=-210 min), the plasma phenylalanine, leucine, tyrosine pools will be primed with a single&#xD;
      intravenous dose of tracers. Subsequently, a blood sample will be obtained (t=-200) and a&#xD;
      continuous tracer infusion will commence. Arterialized blood samples (8 mL) will be drawn at&#xD;
      t= -185, -170, -120, -60, -30 min and a muscle biopsy will be collected from the vastus&#xD;
      lateralis muscle (t=-30 min). This muscle biopsy will allow us to determine basal muscle&#xD;
      protein synthetic rates. Following the collection of the muscle biopsy, subjects will perform&#xD;
      knee extension exercise on a guided-motion exercise machine for 4 sets at a load they can&#xD;
      lift for 10 - 12 repetitions. Subjects will be allowed to rest 2 minutes in between each&#xD;
      exercise set and the load will be adjusted to maintain the desired 10-12 repetitions.&#xD;
      Immediately after the exercise bout subjects will return to the resting supine position and&#xD;
      arterialized blood sample will be drawn. Afterwards, a muscle biopsy will be collected (t= -5&#xD;
      min) from the opposite leg of the muscle biopsy obtained at t= -30. Subjects will then&#xD;
      receive a minced beef meal containing 35 g of protein or an equivalent protein dose provided&#xD;
      as dairy milk (t= 0). Arterialized blood samples (8 ml) will be collected at t= 15, 30, 45,&#xD;
      60, 90 and 120 min during the postprandial (fed) period. The third muscle biopsy will be&#xD;
      taken from the same leg as the last biopsy and from the same incision. Subsequently,&#xD;
      arterialized blood samples (8 ml) will be collected at t=150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300 min.&#xD;
      Finally, at 300 min a fourth muscle biopsy will be taken from the same incision as the last&#xD;
      biopsies (t= -0.5 and 120 min). In total, four muscle biopsies will be taken through two&#xD;
      separate incisions during each trial. The second and third muscle biopsy (immediately after&#xD;
      and 2 h after exercise) will allow us to measure temporal muscle protein synthetic responses&#xD;
      between the different consumed protein sources (milk vs. meat) after exercise. It is&#xD;
      generally assumed that 'peak' stimulation of muscle protein synthesis rates is more&#xD;
      meaningful in predicting phenotypic outcomes (muscle hypertrophy). However, peak muscle&#xD;
      protein synthesis rates may appear at different time points depending on the protein source&#xD;
      consumed. Obtaining a muscle biopsy at 2 h post-exercise will allow us to determine peak&#xD;
      muscle protein synthesis rates between the different consumed protein sources. However,&#xD;
      resistance exercise-induced muscle protein synthesis rates can extend beyond this 2 h time&#xD;
      point and thus obtaining an fourth muscle biopsy at 5 h will also allow us to obtain&#xD;
      physiological relevant information with regards to the anabolic response of resistance&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
