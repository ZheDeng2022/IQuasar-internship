      Rationale: Age related muscle loss (sarcopenia) is assumed to be related to the impaired&#xD;
      postprandial muscle protein synthetic response to protein and/or amino acid administration in&#xD;
      the elderly vs the young. Co-ingestion of carbohydrate increases post-prandial insulin&#xD;
      secretion. Insulin affects skeletal muscle blood flow and may therefore affect substrate&#xD;
      availability and postprandial muscle protein synthesis. However, it is unclear whether the&#xD;
      response to the combined intake of protein and carbohydrates is different in elderly compared&#xD;
      to young subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Adding carbohydrate to a bolus of protein represents an effective strategy to&#xD;
      overcome the impaired postprandial muscle protein synthesis in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of the study is to investigate whether carbohydrate&#xD;
      co-ingestion augments the in vivo postprandial muscle protein synthetic response after&#xD;
      protein ingestion and whether this response is different between young and elderly subjects.&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to assess the effect of carbohydrate co-ingestion on&#xD;
      insulin levels and microvascular perfusion in young and elderly subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intervention consists of a single test day during which the subjects will&#xD;
      receive a drink containing 20 gram intrinsically labelled casein with or without 60 gram&#xD;
      carbohydrates. In addition, continuous intravenous tracer infusions of labeled amino acids&#xD;
      will be administered. During the test day 18 plasma samples and 4 muscle biopsies will be&#xD;
      collected over a period of 8½ h. Furthermore, muscle skeletal blood flow will be estimated&#xD;
      using sidestream darkfield imaging (SDF) in sublingual position.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With human aging, there is a gradual but progressive decline in skeletal muscle tissue, also&#xD;
      known as sarcopenia . Sarcopenia is accompanied by a reduced physical performance, the loss&#xD;
      of functional capacity, increased risk of falling and increased likelihood of developing&#xD;
      chronic metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Eventually this also results&#xD;
      in increased hospitalisation and institutionalization of elderly in nursing homes, and high&#xD;
      health care costs. Therefore, it is important to investigate approaches to diminish the loss&#xD;
      of skeletal muscle mass during aging. To preserve muscle mass, protein intake is important,&#xD;
      because it provides the building blocks for muscle tissue: amino acids. Since basal muscle&#xD;
      protein synthesis rates do not seem to differ between young and elderly, currently many&#xD;
      research groups focus on postprandial muscle protein synthesis. Skeletal muscle protein&#xD;
      synthesis has been shown to be highly dependent on protein intake. However, recent data&#xD;
      indicate that the muscle protein synthetic response to protein intake is attenuated in the&#xD;
      elderly. A blunted postprandial muscle protein synthetic response over a prolonged period&#xD;
      might result in diminished muscle protein accretion and could eventually contribute to&#xD;
      sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anabolic response to protein intake appears to be mainly mediated by an elevation of&#xD;
      plasma essential amino acids. In addition, ingestion of carbohydrate leads to an attenuation&#xD;
      of muscle protein breakdown by virtue of an elevation in plasma insulin, further promoting&#xD;
      positive net protein balance. This is mediated by insulin's known action of increasing muscle&#xD;
      blood flow and thereby augmenting muscle substrate delivery, which may lead to further&#xD;
      stimulation of muscle protein synthesis. It has been shown that there is an insulin&#xD;
      resistance with respect to muscle protein anabolism in elderly compared to young subjects&#xD;
      during conditions of high plasma amino acid and insulin availability. This suggests that the&#xD;
      reduced ability of insulin to augment muscle microvascular perfusion decreases the amino acid&#xD;
      stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study the investigators will assess the effect of a single meal-like amount of&#xD;
      intact protein with or without carbohydrates on post-prandial muscle protein synthesis in the&#xD;
      elderly (70-85 y) compared to the young (18 - 30 y). Furthermore, the investigators are going&#xD;
      to investigate whether the muscle protein synthetic response is associated with an increase&#xD;
      in the microvascular perfusion after ingestion of the meal using Sidestream Dark Field (SDF)&#xD;
      imaging. SDF measurements will be taken in de oral cavity underneath the tongue, since this&#xD;
      area is easily accessible and is representative for microvascular perfusion. To be able to&#xD;
      measure the effect of protein ingestion on muscle protein synthesis the investigators will&#xD;
      use intrinsically labelled casein. This allows us to determine the true incorporation of&#xD;
      amino acids from the ingested, intact casein into the muscle, taken into account the&#xD;
      influence of digestion and absorption processes of a whole protein. Intrinsically labelled&#xD;
      milk proteins were derived from milk that has been collected from cows that were infused with&#xD;
      L-[1-13C] phenylalanine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypotheses will be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The combined intake of protein and carbohydrates augments post-prandial muscle protein&#xD;
           synthesis in the elderly, but not in the young subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The increased insulin production following the combined intake of protein and&#xD;
           carbohydrates results in an increased microvascular perfusion that is related to the&#xD;
           post-prandial muscle protein synthetic response.&#xD;
