  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As mental health care shifted from state psychiatric hospitals to the community in France and&#xD;
      western countries, the mental health system became inevitably involved in housing as it&#xD;
      strove to meet the broader psychosocial needs of consumers. Simultaneously, as many consumers&#xD;
      found themselves unable to find stable living in the community and struggling with&#xD;
      addictions, they became a significant subgroup within a larger homeless population, which has&#xD;
      received increasing policy attention over the past three decades. There are two distinct&#xD;
      service models for adults who have severe mental illness and are homeless: the residential&#xD;
      continuum model and the Housing First model.&#xD;
