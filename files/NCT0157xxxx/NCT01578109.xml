      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of sorafenib tosylate before and after&#xD;
      donor bone marrow transplantation in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Sorafenib&#xD;
      tosylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the toxicity and safety of incorporation of sorafenib tosylate (sorafenib) into&#xD;
      the pre- or post-transplant maintenance setting for three types of transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Improvement of 2 year disease free survival after bone marrow transplant by 25% based on a&#xD;
      baseline relapse free survival at two years of 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Secondary graft failure is defined as the decline in neutrophil count to &lt; 500/cu mm&#xD;
      after achieving engraftment which is unrelated to infection or drug effect (sorafenib?) and&#xD;
      is unresponsive to stimulation by growth factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) is defined, as death in the absence of competing risks,&#xD;
      relapse or progression of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Survival without relapse or death (disease-free survival [DFS]) or without death (overall&#xD;
      survival [OS]) will be determined and presented as Kaplan-Meier estimates at 1 and 2 years&#xD;
      post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Patients will be evaluated for chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) both as described&#xD;
      in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus project guidelines and by conventional&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LABORATORY CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Patients will undergo serial examinations of bone marrow during the maintenance treatments&#xD;
      evaluating minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry and FLT3 suppression by western&#xD;
      blot analysis and plasma inhibitory assay (PIA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) beginning at least 30 days&#xD;
      after completion of induction therapy and/or transplant but no more than 120 days after&#xD;
      transplant continuing for up to 2 years after transplant in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 24 months.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute myeloid leukemia with a FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) who are in a&#xD;
             complete remission or partial remission (less than 10% blasts in marrow) as documented&#xD;
             by bone marrow biopsy and who plan to undergo a bone marrow transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had count recovery (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &gt; 500,000/mm^3;&#xD;
             non transfused platelet count over 30,000/mm^3) and are at least 30 days after&#xD;
             induction and/or transplantation but no more than 120 days post transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received any prior therapy deemed necessary for induction of&#xD;
             remission except for patients whom have progressed while on sorafenib; patients who&#xD;
             have responded to sorafenib previously are eligible for enrollment on the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than four months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin less than 2 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase&#xD;
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])&#xD;
             =&lt; 5 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73&#xD;
             m^2 for patients with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of sorafenib on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason&#xD;
             and because tyrosine kinase inhibiting agents are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately; contraception should continue for at least 30 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             sorafenib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (i.e., persistent grade 3 while undergoing&#xD;
             treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to sorafenib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active and/or untreated central nervous system (CNS) leukemia will not&#xD;
             be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have any evidence of bleeding diathesis or be on any therapeutic&#xD;
             anticoagulation such as low molecular weight (LMW) heparin or warfarin for deep vein&#xD;
             thrombosis (DVT) treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because sorafenib is chemotherapeutic&#xD;
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with sorafenib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated sorafenib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients are excluded because management&#xD;
             of these patients in the hematopoietic cell transplant setting has not yet been well&#xD;
             defined and is currently the subject of investigation in other studies addressing this&#xD;
             issue&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active acute GVHD who have been initiated on therapy or had therapy&#xD;
             escalation within 21 days are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with lack of engraftment (less than 90% donor deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] in&#xD;
             bone marrow or peripheral blood) after bone marrow transplant as evidence by RFLP&#xD;
             (restriction fragment length polymorphism) are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to swallow pills are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking strong cytochrome P450 family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4)&#xD;
             inhibitors including enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (phenytoin, carbamazepine,&#xD;
             or phenobarbital), rifampin, grape fruit juice, or St. John's wort are not eligible&#xD;
