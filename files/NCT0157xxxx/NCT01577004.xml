      BACKGROUND: Compared to the epsilon 2 or epsilon 3 alleles, the epsilon 4 allele of&#xD;
      apolipoprotein E (ApoE4) is associated with twice the prevalence of late-onset Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD). Epidemiological studies show that risk of AD varies inversely with consumption&#xD;
      of omega-3 fatty acids from fish and seafood. Despite apparently lower fish intake in AD,&#xD;
      pooled analysis of the literature shows that plasma and brain docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is&#xD;
      actually the same in AD as in healthy age-matched controls. Fish oil trials in AD are also&#xD;
      not convincing. We recently shown that ApoE4 carriers have 41% higher fasting plasma EPA and&#xD;
      DHA compared to non-carriers, but the plasma EPA and DHA response to fish oil in ApoE4&#xD;
      carriers was half that seen in non-carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES: (i) Carriers of ApoE4 have altered metabolism of carbon-13 (13C)-DHA as well as&#xD;
      EPA and DHA provided in a dietary supplement. (ii) A dietary supplement of EPA+DHA will&#xD;
      improve cognitive performance but only in non-carriers of ApoE4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: In both carriers and non-carriers of ApoE4, to compare whether- i) ApoE4 alters&#xD;
      incorporation of 13C-DHA into plasma lipids or its beta-oxidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) 13C-DHA metabolism changes while on a dietary supplement of EPA+DHA; iii) Better&#xD;
      cognitive performance occurs while on EPA+DHA and is linked to raising plasma EPA and/or DHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL METHODS: Participants older than 50 y old and not demented were enrolled. DHA&#xD;
      metabolism was evaluated using both 13C-DHA and an EPA+DHA supplement (2.4 g/d for 5 mo; n =&#xD;
      20/gp). Before and in the last month of supplementation, plasma uptake and beta-oxidation of&#xD;
      50 mg of 13C-DHA was followed during one month. Blood omega-3 fatty acids was evaluated&#xD;
      monthly during the supplementation period. Cognitive testing was performed before and 4&#xD;
      months after starting the omega-3 fatty acid supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPLICATIONS: This project will help explain the apparent link that is newly emerging between&#xD;
      ApoE polymorphisms, altered omega-3 fatty acid metabolism and risk of cognitive decline, and&#xD;
      should help in the development of nutraceutical-based clinical trials using fish oil for the&#xD;
      elderly.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MCI will be defined by Winblad et al. (33), with diagnosis confirmed by a geriatrician&#xD;
             through neuropsychological evaluation done within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  if diagnosis was done more than 6 months ago, the subject will be re-evaluated before&#xD;
             inclusion to confirm MCI rather than conversion to AD.&#xD;
