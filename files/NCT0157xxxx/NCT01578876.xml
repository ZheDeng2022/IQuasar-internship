      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of cardiac shock wave therapy&#xD;
      (CSWT) for the treatment of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) in a Chinese cohort.&#xD;

      This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee of 1st&#xD;
      Hospital of Kunming Medical University, and all study subjects signed informed consent for&#xD;
      participation in the study and all treatments performed. Subjects were patients who were&#xD;
      hospitalized at Department of Cardiology of our hospital from December 2008 to December 2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were eligible to be included in the study if they met any of the following criteria:&#xD;
      1) Coronary angiography (CA) or multi-slice CT coronary angiography (CTCA) suggestive of&#xD;
      moderate to severe coronary artery stenosis. 2) Chest tightness, onset of shortness of&#xD;
      breath, and poor exercise tolerance after receiving formal drug treatment (with or without&#xD;
      stent or bypass graft). 3) Hospitalized more than 2 times within 1 year due to the&#xD;
      aforementioned problems. 4) CCS angina grading higher than grade II, and NYHA functional&#xD;
      classification of I-III. 5) More than 1 month after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and&#xD;
      more than 2 weeks after PCI surgery. The diagnosis and treatment in all the patients was in&#xD;
      accordance with the related domestic and European guidelines developed in 2007&#xD;

    <description>CSWT was performed with the MODULITH SLC SW therapy device (Storz Medical, Switzerland).Shock waves were triggered by the R-wave of the ECG when the instrument was activated. The shock wave energy was increased from an initial low level up 0.09 mJ/mm2 if the patient experienced no discomfort such as chest pain. Point-to-point combination treatment for the ischemic areas with 200 pulses delivered to each point was given.</description>
