      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with one anatomical or functional ventricular chamber, which encompasses a&#xD;
      spectrum of rare and complex congenital cardiac malformations, a staged surgical approach in&#xD;
      view of an ultimate Fontan operation has become the procedure of choice. Especially in the&#xD;
      earlier era, perioperative mortality was the leading cause of death. However, many patients&#xD;
      have a long and high-quality life, continuously improved by a better understanding of Fontan&#xD;
      hemodynamics and the refinement of the surgical procedures. Nevertheless, the prospect of&#xD;
      eventual failure of the Fontan circulation remains a major concern. More specifically,&#xD;
      evaluation of the pulmonary circulation becomes particularly important as the failing Fontan&#xD;
      circulation has become a common indication for cardiac transplantation. Although essential,&#xD;
      especially in the preoperative setting, a comprehensive evaluation of the pulmonary&#xD;
      circulation remains difficult in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different types of Fontan circulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atriopulmonary connection&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the atriopulmonary connection, the right atrium is interposed as a valveless contractile&#xD;
      chamber between the systemic venous and pulmonary arterial bed. Although initially believed&#xD;
      to be beneficial, the interposition of such a valveless pulsatile chamber does not contribute&#xD;
      positively to fluid energy. Moreover, pulsation results at the price of higher upstream&#xD;
      pressures, whereas downstream pressures remain unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total cavopulmonary shunts&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure consists of diverting the superior vena cava return into the pulmonary&#xD;
      arteries and connecting the vena cava inferior to the pulmonary arteries. This action is&#xD;
      achieved either by the construction of a composite conduit made of the sinus venarum and a&#xD;
      prosthetic patch (intracardiac total cavopulmonary connection or lateral tunnel) or by an&#xD;
      extracardiac conduit (extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our global hypothesis is that the absence of pulsatile pulmonary flow may lead to the&#xD;
      development of pulmonary vascular lesions after the Fontan operation and that - together the&#xD;
      absence of a subpulmonary ventricle for pressure generation - this increasing afterload will&#xD;
      result in systemic ventricular underfilling and will eventually lead to a failing Fontan&#xD;
      circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fontan attrition&#xD;
&#xD;
      The systemic ventricle&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although preload reduction may lead to inappropriate ventricular hypertrophy, with&#xD;
      concomitant ventricular relaxation problems and a decreased capacity for adaptation to&#xD;
      increased afterload, it is generally accepted that the pulmonary vasculature is more&#xD;
      important than mild ventricular dysfunction in this patient population. Naturally, severe&#xD;
      ventricular dysfunction will affect patient's prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pulmonary circulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The absence of a right ventricular to pulmonary arterial coupling has a profound influence on&#xD;
      systemic venous return and the pulmonary circulation. Several aspects have to be taken into&#xD;
      account when evaluating the pulmonary circulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Systemic venous pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Systemic venous pressures, which are approximately 5 mmHg in healthy controls at rest&#xD;
           and remains unchanged during exercise, are higher in Fontan patients. In Fontan&#xD;
           patients, the absence of a right ventricle for pressure generation, some degree of&#xD;
           congestion is required in order to force transpulmonary flow. However, at rest pressures&#xD;
           above 20 mmHg are rarely seen as such pressures would lead to complications (oedema,&#xD;
           pleural effusions and ascites). Interestingly, pressure change observed during exercise&#xD;
           in normals and Fontan patients is quite similar. In healthy controls, an increase in&#xD;
           mean pulmonary artery pressure from 15 mmHg at rest to 30 mmHg during exercise. In&#xD;
           Fontan patients, mean right atrial pressure increased from 15 mmHg at rest to 25 mmHg&#xD;
           during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Left atrial pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In healthy controls, left atrial pressures shows little variability at rest and is&#xD;
           mainly determined by the atrioventricular valve and ventricular dysfunction. In Fontan&#xD;
           patients, diastolic parameters are more difficult to assess as preload insufficiency&#xD;
           should be considered.8 During exercise, left atrial pressure normally remains stable or&#xD;
           increases somewhat in healthy individuals. However, there are few data available on left&#xD;
           atrial pressures during exercise in Fontan patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pulmonary circulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is still no unequivocal proof, several authors indicated that PVR appears to&#xD;
      be the major determinant of cardiac output in Fontan patients at rest and during exercise. A&#xD;
      low PVR is even more important in these patients as they do not have the possibility for&#xD;
      adapting to a higher afterload, whereas in patients with a subpulmonary ventricle, increased&#xD;
      afterload will be countered by RV hypertrophy. It has been suggested that Fontan patients&#xD;
      having low PVR remain stable for many decades, whereas a high PVR appears to be poor&#xD;
      prognostic factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of PVR and problems in Fontan patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most commonly, PVR is measured using the Fick method based on the principle that a known&#xD;
      amount of a specific indicator is added to a volume of fluid. If the concentration before and&#xD;
      after this addition is known, the volume of fluid can be calculated. The Fick method uses the&#xD;
      physiological uptake of oxygen as an indicator. However, this method may be inaccurate in&#xD;
      this patient population. Other techniques, such as the dye dilution technique or&#xD;
      thermodilution technique suffer from their own limitations, such as reduced reliability in&#xD;
      the presence of shunts or valvular regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to provide a more accurate measurement of PVR, a combined approach of invasive&#xD;
      pressure measurements and velocity-encoded magnetic resonance has become available, and has&#xD;
      proven to be feasible in different patient populations. Cardiac output measured using this&#xD;
      approach has been shown to be accurate and feasible in Fontan patients. Moreover, flow&#xD;
      through to left and right pulmonary artery can be measured separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of PVR and ventricular volumes during exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned earlier, transpulmonary flow in Fontan patients is dependent on the presence of&#xD;
      low PVR and normal behavior of PVR during exercise in order to be able to increase cardiac&#xD;
      output. An increase in PVR during exercise would cause a more pronounced underfilling of the&#xD;
      systemic ventricle with subsequently less increase or even decrease in stroke volume. Both&#xD;
      pressure and flow measurements have been shown feasible in patients with congenital heart&#xD;
      disease at rest and during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of PVR and ventricular volumes after vasodilatation Several studies have shown&#xD;
      that drugs affecting the pulmonary vasculature (sildenafil, bosentan, NO) reduce PVR and&#xD;
      increase cardiac output in selected patients. Especially in patients with elevated PVR, these&#xD;
      drugs have the potential to decrease PVR and increase ventricular volumes, cardiac output and&#xD;
      exercise tolerance. Whether these drugs improve outcome remains to be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
