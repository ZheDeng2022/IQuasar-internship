      This study is being conducted to learn about the effects of SC-PEG, which is a new form of a&#xD;
      chemotherapy drug called asparaginase. Asparaginase is used to treat ALL and lymphoblastic&#xD;
      lymphoma. The standard form of asparaginase, called Elspar, is given in the muscle once a&#xD;
      week for 30 weeks. There are other forms of asparaginase. The investigators will be studying&#xD;
      two of these: Oncaspar and Calaspargase Pegol (SC-PEG). The investigators have previously&#xD;
      studied giving Oncaspar in the vein (instead of the muscle) every 2 weeks in patients with&#xD;
      ALL, and have shown that this dosing did not lead to any more side effects than Elspar given&#xD;
      weekly in the muscle. The study drug, SC-PEG, is very similar but not identical to Oncaspar.&#xD;
      SC-PEG has been given in the vein to children and adolescents with ALL as part of other&#xD;
      research studies, and it appears to last longer in the blood after a dose than Oncaspar. It&#xD;
      has not yet been approved by the FDA. The goal of this research study is to learn whether the&#xD;
      side effects and drug levels of SC-PEG given in the vein every 3 weeks are similar to&#xD;
      Oncaspar given into the vein about every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also help to determine whether changing treatment for children and adolescents&#xD;
      with ALL with high levels of minimal residual disease may improve cure rates. Measuring&#xD;
      minimal disease (MRD) is a laboratory test that finds low levels of leukemia cells that the&#xD;
      investigators cannot see under the microscope. In the past, it has been shown that children&#xD;
      and adolescents with ALL with high levels of MRD after one month of treatment are less likely&#xD;
      to be cured than those with low levels of MRD. Therefore, on the study, the bone marrow and&#xD;
      blood at the end of the first month of treatment will be measured in participants with&#xD;
      leukemia, and changes in therapy will be implemented based on this measurement. It is not&#xD;
      known for sure that changing treatment will improve cure rates. MRD levels can only be&#xD;
      measured if the marrow is filled with cancer cells at the time of diagnosis. Therefore, MRD&#xD;
      studies will only be done in children and adolescents with ALL and not in those with&#xD;
      lymphoblastic lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another part of the study is to determine whether giving antibiotics during the first month&#xD;
      of treatment even to participants without fever will prevent serious infections in the blood&#xD;
      and other parts of the body. About 25% of children and adolescents with ALL and lymphoblastic&#xD;
      lymphoma who receive standard treatment develop a serious blood infection from a bacteria&#xD;
      during the first month of treatment. Typically, antibiotics (medicines that fight bacteria)&#xD;
      are given by vein only after a child with leukemia or lymphoma develops a fever or have other&#xD;
      signs of infection. In this study, antibiotics will be given by mouth or in the vein to all&#xD;
      participants during the first month of treatment, whether or not they develop fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another goal of the study to learn how vitamin D levels relate to bone problems (such as&#xD;
      broken bones or fractures) that children and adolescents with ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma&#xD;
      experience while on treatment. Some of the chemotherapy drugs used to treat ALL and&#xD;
      lymphoblastic lymphoma can make bones weaker, which make fractures more likely. Vitamin D is&#xD;
      a natural substance from food and sunlight that can help keep bones strong. The investigators&#xD;
      will study how often participants have low levels of vitamin D while receiving chemotherapy,&#xD;
      and, for those with low levels, whether giving vitamin D supplements will increase those&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another focus of the study is to learn more about the biology of ALL and lymphoblastic&#xD;
      lymphoma by doing research on blood, bone and spinal fluid bone marrow samples. The goal of&#xD;
      this research is to improve treatment for children with leukemia in the future.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To determine whether or not children and adolescents with ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma are&#xD;
      eligible to participate in this study, screening tests will be performed, which may include&#xD;
      the following: medical history, bone marrow tests, assessment of your tumor, blood tests&#xD;
      and/or an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who enroll in this study will receive with anti-leukemia drugs called&#xD;
      chemotherapy. During study treatment, the study doctors will continue to perform tests on&#xD;
      blood, bone marrow and spinal fluid to assess how the disease is responding to the study&#xD;
      treatment and to look for possible side effects. Scans (for example, x-ray, CT scan or MRI&#xD;
      scan) may also be done after beginning study treatment to look for possible side effects. If&#xD;
      the disease was initially diagnosed by a scan, it will also be repeated during the study&#xD;
      treatment to assess how it is responding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three different treatment groups in which leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma can&#xD;
      be divided and they differ slightly in the types and amounts of chemotherapy drugs used&#xD;
      during the 2-years of therapy. Participants are assigned to the different categories based on&#xD;
      the features of their leukemia or lymphoma, such as their age, white blood cell count, and&#xD;
      results of other tests. The three different treatment groups are called &quot;Standard Risk&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;High Risk&quot; and &quot;Very High Risk&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given several different chemotherapy drugs during many periods of&#xD;
      treatment (called &quot;phases&quot;). These drugs are known to kill lymphoblastic cancer cells. Some&#xD;
      of the drugs are given by mouth, some into the veins (intravenously), and others as an&#xD;
      injection (a shot) into the muscle. Some chemotherapy drugs will be given directly into your&#xD;
      spinal fluid (called intrathecal chemotherapy) during a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). This&#xD;
      treatment helps prevent the cancer cells from coming back in the spinal fluid and brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of treatment is steroid prophase. This phase of treatment is typically given&#xD;
      in the hospital. This phase of treatment will begin immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      after enrolling on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase of treatment is remission induction. This phase will begin immediately after&#xD;
      the steroid prophase and will last four weeks. Participants typically remain in the hospital&#xD;
      for most (sometimes all) of this phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the remission induction phase, participants will undergo tests to determine if&#xD;
      they are in remission. This testing will involve getting samples of blood, bone marrow and&#xD;
      spinal fluid to look for cancer cells under the microscope. This testing will also involve&#xD;
      getting repeat scans if these were not normal at the time of diagnosis. Remission means that&#xD;
      cancer cells cannot be detected under the microscope in the blood, marrow and spinal fluid,&#xD;
      and that any cancer previously seen on a scan has significantly improved or is no longer&#xD;
      seen. Participants must be in remission to go onto the next phases of treatment; alternative&#xD;
      treatments will be discussed with participants who are not in remission at the end of the&#xD;
      induction phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Consolidation I phase begins once it is determined that a participant is in remission.&#xD;
      This phase lasts about three weeks. This phase of treatment is given in the hospital, but&#xD;
      participants may be able to leave the hospital after the first week of the phase. The purpose&#xD;
      of this phase is to further reduce the number of cancer cells in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next phase is the Central Nervous System (CNS) phase, and is usually given in the&#xD;
      outpatient setting. Participants may need to be admitted to the hospital during this phase of&#xD;
      treatment if a complication develops, such as infection. This phase of therapy begins&#xD;
      immediately after the Consolidation I phase and lasts about 3 weeks. Treatment involves a&#xD;
      series of lumbar punctures with anti-leukemia drugs given intrathecally over a two week&#xD;
      period. Anti-leukemia drugs will also be given by mouth and by vein during this phase as&#xD;
      well. Some participants may receive radiation therapy during this phase, although most do&#xD;
      not. The decision to treat with radiation or not is based on characteristics of the cancer at&#xD;
      diagnosis and whether or not cancer cells were seen in spinal fluid at that time. Radiation&#xD;
      therapy is a painless procedure, the purpose of which is to prevent leukemia from coming back&#xD;
      in the brain. For participants who receive radiation therapy, it will be given in either 8 or&#xD;
      10 daily treatments, depending on how many leukemia cells were seen in the spinal fluid under&#xD;
      the microscope at diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next phase of the study is Consolidation II. This phase begins about 3 weeks after&#xD;
      starting the CNS phase and lasts for about 27 weeks. During this phase, chemotherapy is given&#xD;
      in three-week cycles, with some drugs given in clinic and some drugs given by mouth at home.&#xD;
      Participants are typically treated as outpatients during this phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last phase is called Continuation. This is also usually given as an outpatient. The goal&#xD;
      of this phase is to rid the body of all remaining cancer cells. The cycles of chemotherapy&#xD;
      during this phase are repeated every 3 weeks, with some drugs given in clinic and some drugs&#xD;
      given by mouth at home. This phase will ends two years after remission was documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization in this study involves the two forms of asparaginase, Oncaspar and SC-PEG&#xD;
      asparaginase. Because no one knows which of the study options is best, participants will be&#xD;
      &quot;randomized&quot; into one of the study groups: to receive Oncaspar or to receive SC-PEG.&#xD;
      Randomization means that participants are put into a group by chance. Participants who are&#xD;
      placed in the Oncaspar group will receive a single dose of Oncaspar on Day 7 of the Remission&#xD;
      Induction phase, and then every 2 weeks for 30 weeks starting in the CNS phase (16 total&#xD;
      doses of Oncaspar). Participants placed in the SC-PEG group will receive SC-PEG asparaginase&#xD;
      on Day 7 of the remission induction phase and then every 3 weeks beginning in the CNS phase&#xD;
      (11 total doses of SC-PEG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) testing is a way to look for very low levels of leukemia in&#xD;
      the body that cannot be seen under the microscope. These test will be done in a laboratory at&#xD;
      Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. If the MRD results are in the low range on Day 32, thre will be&#xD;
      no change to the treatment program described above. If the MRD results are in the high range,&#xD;
      then it will be recommended that treatment be changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a fluoroquinolone antibiotic beginning during the first phase of&#xD;
      treatment and continuing until the neutrophils and monocytes (two types of white blood cells&#xD;
      in the blood that help fight infection) have increased. The goal of giving the antibiotics is&#xD;
      to prevent infection during the first few weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who agree to have extra blood drawn to test for vitamin D levels in the blood&#xD;
      will have 1 teaspoon of blood drawn at the following times: start of treatment, at the end of&#xD;
      the first month of treatment, at the start of the continuation phase, and at the end of&#xD;
      treatment. Participants will receive the results of these tests. If the vitamin D level is&#xD;
      low, the study doctor will recommend that the participant take a vitamin D supplement.&#xD;
      Participants may choose not to have blood drawn to check vitamin D levels, or may choose not&#xD;
      to take the vitamin D supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked at the time of study entry if they agree to provide additional&#xD;
      blood and bone marrow samples for research. These additional samples will be used to learn&#xD;
      more about the biology of ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma. Stored specimens may also be used&#xD;
      for future research regarding leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing all treatment, participants will be asked to come in for physical exams and&#xD;
      blood work every month for the first six months after the final treatment, then every two&#xD;
      months for the next 6 months, then every four months for the next year, and then every six&#xD;
      months for the next year. After that we will ask you to come in once a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to keep track of the medical condition of all participants for&#xD;
      the rest of their lives. This will be done by reviewing medical records of participants. The&#xD;
      investigators may telephone participants who have finished treatment to see how they are&#xD;
      doing if they have not been seen by their doctor for at least a year.&#xD;
