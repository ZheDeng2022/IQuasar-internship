      As both medications i.e. CC and letrozole have been shown to be effective in inducing&#xD;
      ovulation in PCOS patients, this study was performed in order to evaluate which regime&#xD;
      (whether CC or letrozole) is the best to be used as the first line treatment for PCOS&#xD;
      patients with infertility for local population. The best regime will therefore could be&#xD;
      included in the protocol of management of infertility patients with PCOS so that the quality&#xD;
      of patients' care could be improved.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy among women of&#xD;
      reproductive age group and is one of the leading causes of infertility. It is characterized&#xD;
      by chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism with variable clinical manifestations that&#xD;
      include oligomenorrhea, infertility, hirsutism, and acne (Ehrmann DA 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several methods have been described to induce ovulation in PCOS patients- weight reduction,&#xD;
      laparoscopic ovarian drilling and the use of various induction ovulation agents like&#xD;
      clomiphene citrate (CC), aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and gonadotrophins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clomiphene citrate (CC) has been most widely used and standard drug for the treatment of&#xD;
      infertility. It is known that clomiphene citrate results in an ovulation rate of 60-85%, but&#xD;
      a conception rate of only around 20% (Bayar et al 2006, Sohrabvand et al 2006). About 20-25%&#xD;
      of women are resistant to CC and do not ovulate. Discrepancy between ovulation and pregnancy&#xD;
      rate is related to anti-estrogenic activity on endometrium and cervical mucus is due to CC&#xD;
      has a long half life of 5 to 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of disappointing result of CC treatment with many adverse effect and cost and&#xD;
      possible complication of gonadotrophin, the concept of aromatase inhibition was proposed as a&#xD;
      new method of ovulation that are easy to use, less expensive and more effective drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Letrozole is an oral, potent, reversible, and highly selective aromatase inhobitor that&#xD;
      prevent androgen-to-estrogen (E) conversion. These aromatase inhibitors have a short half&#xD;
      life (45 hours), hence is rapidly eliminated from the body. No adverse effect on E target&#xD;
      tissues is seen with letrozole due to this short half life; furthermore, it does not down&#xD;
      regulate the ER compare to CC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main impetus for the development of aromatase inhibitor as ovulation induction agents was&#xD;
      to avoid the peripheral antiestrogenic effects of CC, especially the frequent occurrence of a&#xD;
      thin endometrial lining (Sohrabvand et al 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of performing the study As both medications i.e. CC and letrozole have been shown&#xD;
      to be effective in inducing ovulation in PCOS patients, this study was performed in order to&#xD;
      evaluate which regime (whether CC or letrozole) is the best to be used as the first line&#xD;
      treatment for PCOS patients with infertility for local population. The best regime will&#xD;
      therefore could be included in the protocol of management of infertility patients with PCOS&#xD;
      so that the quality of patients' care could be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Letrozole is more effective than clomiphene citrate as ovulation agent in PCOS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective To compare the effectiveness of letrozole and clomiphene citrate as&#xD;
      ovulation agent in PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. To identify the ovulation percentage between letrozole and CC ii. To compare the&#xD;
      endometrial thickness between letrozole and CC iii. To determine the pregnancy outcome&#xD;
      between letrozole and CC iv. To study the associated factors that can affect the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the treatment e.g. age, body weight, smoking, duration of marriage, duration&#xD;
      of infertility and types of infertility either primary or secondary)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.0 Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, multicenter, randomized control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Population and sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reference population will be the female patient diagnosed to have polycystic ovarian&#xD;
      syndrome at infertility clinic HSB, Kedah and infertility clinic HUSM, Kelantan and&#xD;
      infertility Clinic, Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan (HTAA), Kuantan, Pahang.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Selection criteria 3.1 Inclusion criteria i. Age &gt; 18 years but &lt; 40 years old ii. Was&#xD;
      diagnosed PCOS iii. Patient is not illiterate. iv. Normal husband's seminal fluid analysis&#xD;
      (SFA) - (Count &gt; 20 million/ml, Motility &gt; 40% and normal morphology &gt; 30%) 3.2 Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria : i. Having medical problem eg- renal disease, tyhroid disorder, hyperprolactinemia,&#xD;
      liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      4.0 Sampling and Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ovulation percentage&#xD;
&#xD;
           From Hananel Holzer 2006&#xD;
&#xD;
           Proportion of ovulation rate by using Clomiphene citrate (Po) = 0.60 Proportion of&#xD;
           ovualtion rate by using Letrozole (P1) = 0.84&#xD;
&#xD;
           P = P1 + Po = 0.83 + 0.64 = 0.72 zα = 1.96 zβ = 0.84 for 80% power 2 2 Significance&#xD;
           level (α) = 5% (0.05) Power of study ( 1 - β )= 80% β =20% ( 0.2 ) n = (zα√2P(1-P) +&#xD;
           zβ√P1(1-P1)+Po(1-Po))2 (P1-Po)2 n = ( 1.96√2(0.72)(1-0.72) + 0.84√0.83(1-0.84) +&#xD;
           0.60(1-0.60))2 (0.75 - 0.50 )2 n = 54 Therefore sample size = 108 + 20 % drop out = 130&#xD;
           By using PS software - sample size : 130&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Endomterial thickness between letrozole and CC From Mosammat Rhasid et al 2008 Letrozole&#xD;
           2.5 mg, mean ± SD ratio -10.37 ± 1.2 CC 100mg, mean ± SD ratio - 9.03 ± 0.89&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  - 0.5 n = 2 α2 (zα + zβ)2&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2 = 2 (1.2)2 ( 1.96 + 0.84) 2 (0.5)2 = 49 per group Therefore sample size = 98 + 20&#xD;
                % drop out Total n = 117 By using software, n = 51 per group, total n = 122&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pregnancy rate between letrozole and CC From Mosammat Rashida Begum 2008 Letrozole 2.5mg&#xD;
           - pregnancy rate - 40.6% CC 100mg - pregnancy rate - 18.7% ( Po ) = 0.18 (P1) = 0.41 P =&#xD;
           P1 + Po = 0.41 + 0.18 = 0.30 zα = 1.96 zβ = 0.84 for 80% power 2 2 Significance level&#xD;
           (α) = 5% (0.05) Power of study ( 1 - β )= 80% β =20% ( 0.2 ) n = (zα√2P(1-P) +&#xD;
           zβ√P1(1-P1)+Po(1-Po))2 (P1-Po)2 n = ( 1.96√2(0.30)(1-0.30) + 0.84√0.41(1-0.41) +&#xD;
           0.18(1-0.18))2 (0.41-0.18 )2 n = 61 Therefore sample size = 120 + 20 % drop out n= 146&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The maximun sample size that were calculated for this study is 146. Therefore&#xD;
                sample size that were decided for the the study = 150 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Sampling frame All PCOS patients attending Infertility Clinic Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah&#xD;

&#xD;
      The study will be conducted after the approval from Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah, Kedah, USM and&#xD;
      HTAA, Pahang ethical committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All PCOS patients, age more than 18 years old at Gynecology Clinic, HUSM were given&#xD;
      information form regarding the study conducted. When the participants agree to involve in&#xD;
      this study, the consent form will be given to them. Participants are required to fill the&#xD;
      social demographic data which includes age, address, occupation, monthly family income,&#xD;

&#xD;
      Randomization PCOS women who are eligible and fulfilling the criteria of the study will&#xD;
      recruit. After they had given inform consent, they will assigned to one of the groups of&#xD;
      sealed opaque envelope labelled as C and L. Women in group C will assigned CC 100mg and those&#xD;
      in L assigned Letrozole 2.5 mg. The randomization will be done by computer- generated&#xD;
      randomization using http://www.randomization.com according to the random sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1- Letrozole group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will be given letrozole 2.5 mg from D5-D9 of menses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Base line TVS at D2 will be done, following spontaneous menses/induction with MPA 10 mg&#xD;
           Daily for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transvaginal scan was done to document the evidence of ovulation only if patient having&#xD;
           menses (D8 -10 onwards ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If dominant follicle (DF) present (DF&gt; 12mm), repeat TVS every 2 days,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ovulation is diagnosed when the mature DF is about 18 to 22 mm and then evidence of&#xD;
           ruptured about 3 to 4 days later&#xD;
&#xD;
           o If dominant follicle (DF) absent (DF&lt;12mm), repeat TVS every 3-4 days later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure Endometrial thickness (ET) for every follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If absent of Dominant follicle (DF&lt;12mm up to Days 20), consider failed or anovulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 Clomiphene Citrate Group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will be given CC 100 mg from D5-D9 of menses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Base line TVS at D2 will be done, following spontaneous menses /induction with MPA 10 mg&#xD;
           Daily for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transvaginal scan was done to document the evidence of ovulation only if patient having&#xD;
           menses (D8 -10 onwards).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If dominant follicle (DF) present (DF&gt; 12mm), repeat TVS every 2 days,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ovulation is diagnosed when the mature DF is about 18 to 22 mm and then evidence of&#xD;
           ruptured about 3 to 4 days later&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If dominant follicle (DF) absent (DF&lt;12mm), repeat TVS every 3-4 days later.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  If absent of dominant follicle (DF&lt;12mm up to Days 20), consider failed or anovulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all groups a urine pregnancy test was done 3 weeks after documented ovulation and the&#xD;
      patient remained amenorrheic. All study medications will be discontinued when there was a&#xD;
      positive pregnancy test. Pregnant patients were then will be followed up until an ultrasound&#xD;
      could document the viability of pregnancy. Copies of patients' obstetric records, including&#xD;
      delivery records, were reviewed by the investigators to obtain obstetrics outcomes e.g:&#xD;
      miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, preterm delivery etc).&#xD;
