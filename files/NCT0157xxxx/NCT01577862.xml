  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acinetobacter baumannii causes severe infections (pneumonia, bacteremia, organ space) with&#xD;
      high lethality in hospitalised critically ill patients. It can acquire resistance to all&#xD;
      classes of antibiotics (multidrug resistance, MDR) except an 'old' drug, colistin, which may&#xD;
      be the only therapeutic option. However, colistin is not registered for this indication. The&#xD;
      addition of rifampicin to colistin has been shown to be synergistic in vitro, and may be&#xD;
      promising in vivo, but this combination has not been studied in comparison with colistin&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomised, open-label, multicentre clinical trial is to assess whether&#xD;
      the association of colistin and rifampicin reduces significantly the mortality of patients&#xD;
      with severe MDR A. baumannii infections compared with colistin alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will enroll 210 patients from intensive care units (ICU) of five tertiary care&#xD;
      hospitals where MDR A. baumannii infection is endemic with epidemic phases. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to either colistin alone (control arm) or colistin plus rifampicin&#xD;
      (experimental arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point is overall mortality, defined as death occurring within 30 days from&#xD;
      randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points will be disease-specific death, microbiological eradication,&#xD;
      hospitalization length, emergence of resistance to colistin during treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a multicentre open-label, parallel randomised, controlled trial.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly allocated to two treatment arms: 1) colistin alone (control arm);&#xD;
      2) colistin, plus rifampicin (experimental arm). The study will be carried out over 2 years&#xD;
      according to the principles of good clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population is represented by adult hospitalised patients with severe nosocomial&#xD;
      infections due to multi-drug resistant A. baumannii, susceptible to colistin. It will be&#xD;
      performed in intensive or sub-intensive care units of 5 Italian clinical centres where MDR A.&#xD;
      baumannii infection is endemic with epidemic phases. All adult subjects, irrespective of age,&#xD;
      will be included in the study, thus also elderly subjects will be eligible. Large eligibility&#xD;
      criteria are warranted by the pragmatic approach of the study, the severe prognosis of these&#xD;
      patients and the lack of effective alternative treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment procedure: At the time of A. baumannii isolation, inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be checked by the pertinent centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once obtained the informed consent, subjects will be randomized to treatment. No patient may&#xD;
      be enrolled in a centre before the formal approval of the Ethics Committee of that&#xD;
      Institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual time: according to the sample size estimate (see below) and based on the current&#xD;
      incidence of MDR A. baumannii severe infections of 12-14 cases per month in the five&#xD;
      participating centres, the accrual time will last approximately 18 months to achieve the&#xD;
      planned sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe infections include hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator associated pneumonia&#xD;
      (VAP), bloodstream infection, intra-abdominal infection or other organ-space infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-drug resistant A. baumannii is defined as clinical isolates resistant to carbapenems&#xD;
      and to all other antimicrobial drug classes, except colistin, irrespective of rifampicin&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity of illness is assessed by the SAPS II score. This will be considered low or high&#xD;
      according to a SAPS II score below/equal to or higher than 40, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly allocated into two treatment arms: 1) colistin alone, 2 million&#xD;
      units every 8 hours intravenously or according to renal function (control arm); 2) colistin,&#xD;
      2 million units every 8 hours intravenously or according to renal function, plus rifampicin,&#xD;
      600 mg every 12 hours intravenously (experimental arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be administered for at least 10 days and up to a maximum of 21 days. Duration&#xD;
      of treatment will be established by the physician in charge. The end of treatment (EoT)&#xD;
      evaluation will be performed the day of treatment discontinuation. The end of study (EoS)&#xD;
      (follow-up) evaluation will be performed 30 days after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be discontinued in the following instances: clinical cure with or without&#xD;
      microbiological eradication; occurrence of significant renal or liver toxicity; patient&#xD;
      death. Throughout the study, patients will receive routine intensive care support by the&#xD;
      physician in charge according to standard diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical cure is defined by disappearance of symptoms and signs of infection, irrespective of&#xD;
      A. baumannii eradication at the site of infection. Therapeutic failure is defined as&#xD;
      worsening or no improvement of clinical conditions on therapy with persistently positive A.&#xD;
      baumannii cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal and liver function will be monitored by daily measurements of creatinine,&#xD;
      aminotransferase and direct bilirubin serum levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug dosages will be adjusted according to renal and liver function. Renal toxicity is&#xD;
      defined as decrease of creatinine clearance below 50 ml/min or &gt;50% reduction in the&#xD;
      creatinine clearance relative to the baseline. Hepatic toxicity is defined as increase of&#xD;
      direct bilirubin above 3 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance cultures from the original source of isolation (blood, bronchial aspirate,&#xD;
      urines or drainage fluids) will be obtained on admission and repeated weekly, or whenever&#xD;
      clinically needed, during and after treatment to monitor persistence versus eradication of A.&#xD;
      baumannii at the infected site. In vitro activity of colistin and rifampicin will be checked&#xD;
      against all A. baumannii repeat isolates to detect development of resistance. Identification&#xD;
      and antibiotic susceptibility of A. baumannii isolates will be performed at each centre using&#xD;
      an automated system. Species identification will be confirmed by molecular biology.&#xD;
