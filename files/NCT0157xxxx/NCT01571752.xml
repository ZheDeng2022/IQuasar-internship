      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers have been studying patterns of mood and drug use in specific neighborhoods.&#xD;
      This study will look at environmental factors that may affect drug use, addiction, and&#xD;
      treatment seeking in Baltimore neighborhoods. The results could inform prevention efforts,&#xD;
      enhance treatment interventions, and improve substance use outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To better understand why some people start to use drugs, why some people who use drugs&#xD;
      become addicted, and why some people who become addicted enter treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are living in the neighborhoods participating in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will be&#xD;
           separated into one of four groups: (1) people who do not use drugs, (2) people who have&#xD;
           used drugs in the past, (3) people who are using drugs and want treatment, and (4)&#xD;
           people who are using drugs and do not want treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will include two outpatient visits about 12 months apart. Each visit will&#xD;
           last about 5 hours. Each study visit may be done in 1 day or in 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each study visit, participants will provide blood, breath, urine, and saliva samples.&#xD;
           They will also have a heart function test and body measurements. They will complete&#xD;
           questionnaires about personal and family history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be monthly follow-up phone calls between the two visits.&#xD;

      Background: The reasons for initiation and continuation of use of illicit substances are&#xD;
      multifactorial; however, some individuals appear resistant to both. One set of determinants&#xD;
      lies in the environment. In ongoing studies, we are examining environmental concomitants of&#xD;
      behavior in individuals in drug treatment. In this study, we will examine environmental&#xD;
      factors that may impact initiation, addiction, and treatment seeking among the greater&#xD;
      population at large (non-drug-users, current opioid/stimulant users, and current marijuana&#xD;
      users).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific goals: (1) To assess, cross-sectionally at baseline, differences in stress, social&#xD;
      stability, and mental and physical health among three main neighborhood-matched groups of&#xD;
      current opioid/stimulant users, current marijuana users, and nondrug users; (2) to assess,&#xD;
      longitudinally, mediators of 12-month changes in drug-misuse status in the same three groups;&#xD;
      (3) to provide neighborhood-matched control groups of non-drug-using individuals,&#xD;
      Unclassified/former drug users, and current opioid/stimulant drug users not seeking treatment&#xD;
      for our ongoing environmental studies of individuals in drug treatment; (4) to explore the&#xD;
      possible role of genetics and its interplay with environment in regards to drug use&#xD;
      initiation, addiction, and treatment seeking among the study groups, (5) to assess EMA&#xD;
      reports of drug use and psychosocial stress as well as real-time environmental risk exposure&#xD;
      in a non-treatment seeking and/or nondrug using population and compare to our ongoing&#xD;
      environmental studies of individuals in drug treatment, (6) to assess the accuracy of stress&#xD;
      detection in the lab and the field by the Health Tag.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant population: We will enroll 650 participants in Phase B of the study for a total&#xD;
      enrollment (Phase A + Phase B + Phase C) of 3000 participants. Target enrollment will include&#xD;
      25% women and 70% minorities (mostly African-American).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design and methods: This is a three-group observational study with a&#xD;
      crosssectional component and a longitudinal component: each participant will be assessed in&#xD;
      two visits spaced approximately 12 months apart. The three main groups will be: (1)&#xD;
      non-drug-users (NDUs), (2) current opioid/stimulant users [(COSUs) comprised of two&#xD;
      subgroups: treatment seeking (COSU-TS) and non-treatment seeking (COSU-NTS)], and current&#xD;
      marijuana users (CMUs). All groups will be roughly matched for socioeconomic status and&#xD;
      neighborhoods of residence. Each participant will attend a 3-5-hour initial study visit and a&#xD;
      3-5-hour 12 month visit #2. The study visits will include a questionnaire component and a&#xD;
      biological-sample component. Questionnaires will cover substance use, stress, social&#xD;
      stability (including healthcare access/utilization, and neighborhood environment), physical&#xD;
      and mental health (including quality of life, HIV, and trauma). The biological component will&#xD;
      consist of samples of urine (for drugs of abuse and cotinine), breath (for alcohol and carbon&#xD;
      monoxide). Blood for genetics will be obtained at Visit 1 or Visit 2. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measures will be lifetime substance-misuse history (cross-sectional component) and changes in&#xD;
      drug-use status across the 12 months between visits (longitudinal component). Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures will include: biological assessments of drug use; medical, psychiatric,&#xD;
      social determinants of health; and impulsivity and decision-making factors. Individuals who&#xD;
      choose not to return for a 12-month Visit #2 will be asked to complete a 45-minute telephone&#xD;
      visit #2. In the HON EMA/GMA secondary study participants will carry a smartphone for up to 4&#xD;
      weeks after completing Visit 1. Event-triggered entries will be initiated by participants (1)&#xD;
      each time that they use a drug (COSU) or marijuana and/or alcohol (NDU, CMU, and&#xD;
      Unclassified) and (2) each time they feel overwhelmed, anxious, or stressed more than usual.&#xD;
      Participants will also make 5 random-signal-triggered recordings per day and one brief end of&#xD;
      day recording. During this study participants will also come to the clinic once a week to&#xD;
      complete compliance visits. In the Health Tag secondary study, participants will undergo a&#xD;
      one-day laboratory session followed by a 30-day field study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to participants and/or society: There are no benefits to participants. The knowledge&#xD;
      gained may benefit society by providing data on the health outcomes of drug-using and&#xD;
      nondrug-using individuals and the natural history of drug use by neighborhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to participants: This is a minimal-risk study, consisting of standard physical and&#xD;
      questionnaire-based assessments.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age at least 18 years. Rationale: Children under 18 will not be included because many&#xD;
             of the measures to be administered in this study are not validated for use with&#xD;
             children. Furthermore, the research question under investigation is the drug&#xD;
             trajectories of adults, over the age of 18. However, there is no intervention in this&#xD;
             study that is contraindicated for older adults, and given that addiction in the&#xD;
             elderly is understudied, it is important to include elderly individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Residence in Baltimore city or one of the surrounding counties. Rationale: Our current&#xD;
             geographic mapping technology currently only includes these areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
