      This study serves as a comparison study between the EPIC ClearView and a predicate device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EPIC ClearView is a galvanic skin response (GSR) measurement system that is intended to&#xD;
      be used to determine autonomic response as psychological indicators by measuring the&#xD;
      electrical resistance of the skin. The EPIC ClearView is a non-invasive digital&#xD;
      bioelectrography instrument that is used to assess the electrophysiology of humans. The&#xD;
      measurements are digital photographs taken in a brief exposure to an electric field. These&#xD;
      measurements are quantified to produce a standardized Response Scale.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to perform a point-to-point comparison of the EPIC ClearViewâ„¢ galvanic skin response hand measurements (on a 0-25 scale) to those of a predicate device (on a 0-100 scale). We hypothesize that there will be a statistically significant correlation between the galvanic skin response measurements made by the two devices.</description>
