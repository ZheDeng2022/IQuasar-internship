  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective randomized study is to compare the quality of treatment&#xD;
      between cemented versus uncemented hydroxyapatite coated femoral stems in Total Hip&#xD;
      Arthroplasty (THA) in patients who suffers from dislocated femoral neck fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that an uncemented option spares the patient the operative load of the&#xD;
      cementing procedure, i e risk of fatty embolism and inflammatory response, which in turn also&#xD;
      perhaps reduces the postoperative cognition strain and improves mobilization parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the uncemented option has the same excellent fixation in poor bone stock, as in the case&#xD;
      of these osteopenic fractures, and also has the same good clinical outcome, it would be a&#xD;
      viable standard option for the treatment of dislocated femoral neck fractures.&#xD;

      Corail-SP study. A prospective randomized study to compare the quality of treatment between&#xD;
      cemented versus uncemented hydroxyapatite coated femoral stems in Total Hip Arthroplasty&#xD;
      (THA) in patients who suffers from dislocated femoral neck fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Femoral neck fractures often occurs among the fragile elderly patients who have a higher&#xD;
      degree of co-morbidity. The 3-month mortality is 13%. The incidence of risk of fracture&#xD;
      complications when using osteosyntheses are as high as 30-40%, mainly due to non union, which&#xD;
      leads to impairments in quality of life, locomotion and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For that reason more patients nowadays are submitted to a cemented hemiarthroplasty or a&#xD;
      total hip arthroplasty directly after their injury - at the same time the problem with fatty&#xD;
      embolism syndrome has been recognized. When cementing during surgery, the bone marrow is&#xD;
      pushed into the blood stream, which can affect the cardiopulmonary function and even the&#xD;
      mental functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a measure for reducing those risks an uncemented hip arthroplasty is sometimes used&#xD;
      instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pros and cons with uncemented fixation is poorly examined which this study will try to&#xD;
      scrutinize.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 patients with dislocated (Garden classification III-IV) femoral neck fractures who have&#xD;
      the clinical indication of undergoing a Total Hip Arthroplasty are asked and included at&#xD;
      MÃ¶lndals Hospital (part of Sahlgrenska University Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization to either; an inversed hybrid arthroplasty with an uncemented hydroxyapatite&#xD;
      coated Corail stem and a cemented Marathon cup (DePuy), alternatively to, a totally cemented&#xD;
      option with a Lubinus SPII stem and a IP cup (Link).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient questionnaires regarding cognitive and social status, hip function, quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL), activity level. Standard hip and pelvis X-ray. Blood sample for biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peroperatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary artery catheter measurements of pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac output, ejection&#xD;
      fraction of the right ventricle. Surgeon's questionnaire regarding prosthesis components,&#xD;
      duration of surgery, blood group, bleeding volume, oxygen saturation. Half of the patients&#xD;
      are marked with tantalum pellets for radiostereometric analysis (RSA). Biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard X-ray. On the patients marked with tantalum pellets RSA is performed. Bone density&#xD;
      scan (DXA). Measurements regarding cognition, ADL, mobilization. Eventual confusion is noted.&#xD;
      Biomarkers every second day until discharge from hospital. Eventual wound infections or&#xD;
      thromboembolic episodes are noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient return visits to physician 3, 6 months, 1, 2, 5, 7, 10 years postoperatively.&#xD;
      Standard X-ray, RSA, DXA, Patient questionnaires regarding patient's satisfaction, QoL,&#xD;
      activity level, hip function. Biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eventual gains with an uncemented prosthesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced fatty embolism risk, reduced inflammatory response, reduced generalized&#xD;
      symptoms/confusion, faster mobilization, shorter surgery.&#xD;
