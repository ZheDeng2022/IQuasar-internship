      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical that is used primarily to make plastics, resins, and&#xD;
      thermal paper. Most people are exposed daily to low levels of BPA that leaches into food and&#xD;
      water from plastic products, including water and baby bottles. However, not all of the risks&#xD;
      of BPA are known. Researchers want to learn more about how BPA acts in the body, and how the&#xD;
      body gets rid of BPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study controlled exposure to BPA and its effects on the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy, non-obese volunteers between 25 and 45 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have six visits over about 2 to 4 weeks for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit, participants will be screened with a physical exam and blood and&#xD;
           urine tests. They will complete a questionnaire about exposure to BPA-containing&#xD;
           products. They will also receive a list of medications that should not be taken during&#xD;
           the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second visit will last about 13 hours. Participants will fast for 8 hours before the&#xD;
           visit. They will then have a single dose of d-BPA (a modified form of BPA that is easier&#xD;
           to study in the body). Regular blood samples will be taken over the 13-hour visit. All&#xD;
           urine will also be collected. Participants will receive breakfast and lunch during the&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have four follow-up visits. They will collect and store all of their&#xD;
           urine between each follow-up visit. Blood samples will be collected at the follow-up&#xD;
           visits....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bisphenol A (BPA) is utilized primarily in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastic and epoxy&#xD;
      resins, which are widely used in the fabrication of baby bottles and food can linings.&#xD;
      Consequently, human exposures to BPA are widespread. However, there is still uncertainty&#xD;
      about the extent and nature of these exposures. This pharmacokinetic (PK) study is aimed at&#xD;
      refining our understanding of the metabolism and excretion of BPA following two different&#xD;
      routes of administration. This investigation is also intended to help resolve current&#xD;
      controversies in BPA risk assessment. We will administer 100 microgram/kg body weight (bw) of&#xD;
      deuterated BPA (d-BPA) orally and/or dermally (as an ethanol solution or a&#xD;
      carboxymethylcellulose suspension), in up to 50 participants, with comparable numbers of men&#xD;
      to women, and collect blood and urine for measurements of d-BPA and d-BPA conjugates at&#xD;
      selected time points over a six day period post-dosing. The use of d-BPA will allow the&#xD;
      detection of the administered BPA to be distinguished from background BPA. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint of the study is detection of measurable d-BPA and d-BPA conjugates in blood and&#xD;
      urine after administration of a single dose of 100 microgram/kg bw d-BPA applied orally&#xD;
      and/or dermally (as an ethanol solution or a carboxymethylcellulose suspension). Participants&#xD;
      will be given an option to complete either one or both phases of the study, the exposure&#xD;
      visits separated by a period of at least 4 weeks. Dose selection was based on balancing the&#xD;
      need for detectable levels of BPA in blood and urine to meet the objective and the need to&#xD;
      minimize human subject risk. Data from the first 3 participants in the study, who received&#xD;
      oral d-BPA, confirmed dosing during the oral pilot phase was sufficient in capturing&#xD;
      measurable d-BPA in blood and urine and will continue at 100 microgram/kg bw of d-BPA for&#xD;
      oral dosing. Dermal exposure will consist of a pilot phase for this route of administration&#xD;
      comprising 4 participants to assess whether 100 microgram/kg bw of d-BPA applied to the skin&#xD;
      is sufficient to obtain measurable d-BPA in blood and/or urine in order to establish PK&#xD;
      parameters and to evaluate whether the time points are appropriate and necessary. If needed,&#xD;
      the dermal pilot phase will be repeated using an ethanol solution rather than a&#xD;
      carboxymethylcellulose suspension. The design includes sufficient sampling of blood and urine&#xD;
      to define relevant PK parameters, including the rate of BPA absorption, plasma elimination&#xD;
      rate, area under the curve (AUC) and apparent clearance, half-life, the urinary excretion&#xD;
      rate, and the fractional metabolic clearance of the glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.&#xD;
