    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People with cancer can have a weak immune system as a result of the cancer itself, or from&#xD;
      prior treatments. . Still, treatments that stimulate the immune system have been shown to be&#xD;
      effective against a number of different cancers. Recombinant human interleukin-15 (rhIL-15)&#xD;
      is a drug that is designed to boost the immune system. Researchers are interested in seeing&#xD;
      if rhIL-15 can strengthen the immune system's response against cancer. The drug will be given&#xD;
      through a vein without a break for 10 days (240 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To see rhIL-15 given as a continuous infusion over 10 days can be used to treat advanced&#xD;
           cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the side effects associated with this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age with advanced cancer for which there are no effective&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants screening procedures will include a physical exam and medical history,&#xD;
           laboratory (blood) tests and x-rays (Imaging studies) to determine suitability for the&#xD;
           protocol. --Appropriate participants with easily accessible tumor deposits may also be&#xD;
           asked to have one pretreatment and one post (cycle 1) treatment tumor biopsy. .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will be admitted to the hospital for the rhIL-15 treatment and&#xD;
           will spend about 12 days in the hospital. .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive one 10 day infusion each cycle (about every 42 days) for as&#xD;
           long as there are no serious side effects and the disease does not progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will continue treatment as long as imaging studies show that the tumor&#xD;
           continues to shrink or for two additional cycles after it has disappeared from the&#xD;
           x-rays to make that the cancer is completely gone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who stop treatment for side effects or because their tumor did not shrink&#xD;
           or stopped responding to the treatment will continue to have follow-up visits to monitor&#xD;
           the outcome of the rhIL-15 treatment until there is evidence their cancer has progress&#xD;
           or they begin another treatment.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a stimulatory cytokine with a number of desirable&#xD;
           immunotherapeutic features, and clinical trials evaluating recombinant human (rh) IL-15&#xD;
           are underway.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In contrast to IL-2, IL-15 treatment does not stimulate activation-induced cell death of&#xD;
           Tcells; potentially inhibits immunosuppressive CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells, contributes&#xD;
           to the proliferation, differentiation and activation of CD8+ T-cells and NK-cells and&#xD;
           the maintenance of long-term CD8+ memory T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-15 is active in a number of syngeneic mouse preclinical tumor models, and&#xD;
           vacciniabased constructs expressing IL-15 induced long-lasting, high-avidity cytotoxic&#xD;
           CD8+ Tlymphocyte response that appears to be more effective than similar IL-2 expressing&#xD;
           vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacology/toxicology (pharm/tox) experiments in non-human primate (NHP) rhesus&#xD;
           macaques and preliminary results from the first-in-human phase I trial examining rhIL-15&#xD;
           given as an IV bolus (IVB) for 12 consecutive days indicate significant stimulation and&#xD;
           expansion of NK-cells and CD8+ T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rhIL-15 given as an IVB at 1 mcg/kg dose level appears to be well tolerated despite the&#xD;
           presence of some common cytokine-related side effects indicating that 0.1 mcg/kg/day is&#xD;
           an appropriate initial dose level for a phase I safety trial of continuous intravenous&#xD;
           infusion (CIV) of rhIL-15.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of the pharmacokinetic and immunologic assessments from the IVB phase I trial&#xD;
           with the data from both sets of NHP pharm/tox experiments suggest that CIV of rhIL-15&#xD;
           may have greater potential for stimulating an anticancer cellular immune response with a&#xD;
           more manageable safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Determine the safety, toxicity profile, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) of rhIL-15 administered as a CIV for 10 consecutive days (240 hours) in subjects&#xD;
      with metastatic unresectable cancers for which curative or palliative measures either do not&#xD;
      exist or are not associated with a survival advantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients greater than or equal to18 years-old, ECOG PS less than or equal to 1, with&#xD;
           pathologically confirmed metastatic unresectable cancers for which curative or&#xD;
           palliative measures either do not exist or are not associated with a survival advantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with measurable or evaluable disease, normal organ and bone marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a single-institution, open-label, non-randomized 3 + 3 design phase I dose&#xD;
           escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Groups of 3 to 6 subjects will receive CIV rhIL-15 at doses of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 1, 2, 4, 6&#xD;
           and 8 mcg/kg/day for 10 days provided that DLT has not been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After assessments of the 10-day dosing cohorts have been completed, new groups of 3 to 6&#xD;
           subjects will receive CIVrhIL-15 at doses of 3, 4 and 5 mcg/kg/day for 5 days provided&#xD;
           that a DLT has not been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with evidence of response and the absence of significant toxicities will be&#xD;
           eligible for repeat cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Samples for correlative studies will be obtained prior to treatment and at specific&#xD;
           times points during and after treatment to assess pharmacokinetics of rhIL-15, the&#xD;
           effect of rhIL-15 on immune cell subset populations and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels&#xD;
           in the peripheral blood and for the development of neutralizing anti-rhIL-15 antibodies.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed (by the NCI Pathology Department) solid&#xD;
             tumor malignancy or lymphoma that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard&#xD;
             curative or palliative measures do not exist or are associated with minimal patient&#xD;
             survival benefit (as defined the Metabolism Branch physicians or if the patient&#xD;
             refuses standard of care treatment ). Enrollment of patients with tumors that can be&#xD;
             safely biopsied is encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have evaluable or measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion&#xD;
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be&#xD;
             recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 20 mm with conventional techniques or as greater than or equal to 10 mm with&#xD;
             spiral CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered to &lt; grade 1 CTCAEv4 from toxicity of prior chemotherapy&#xD;
             or biologic therapy and must not have had prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy&#xD;
             within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C, 8 weeks for UCN-01).&#xD;

             prostate cancer will need to have metastatic prostate cancer that has progressed&#xD;
             despite hormonal therapy. Castrate testosterone levels occur within hours after&#xD;
             castration and within 2 to 3 weeks of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist.&#xD;
             The current standard is to continue androgen suppression despite progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DLCO/VA and FEV-1.0 &gt; 60% of predicted on pulmonary function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine of less than or equal to 1.5 X the upper limit of normal.&#xD;

             to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with inactive central nervous system (CNS) metastasis are eligible. Inactive&#xD;
             CNS metastasis is defined as: no signs of cerebral edema after successful definitive&#xD;
             treatment of brain metastases (surgical resection, whole brain irradiation,&#xD;
             stereotactic radiation therapy, or a combination of these) with stable or improved&#xD;
             radiographic appearance on MRI scan at least 1 month after completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received any systemic corticosteroid therapy within 3 weeks prior to&#xD;
             the start of therapy with the exception of physiological replacement doses of&#xD;
             cortisone acetate or equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Documented HIV, active bacterial infections, active or chronic hepatitis B, or&#xD;
             hepatitis C infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive hepatitis B serology indicative of previous immunization (i.e., HBsAb&#xD;
             positive and HBc Ab negative), or a fully resolved acute hepatitis B infection is not&#xD;
             an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive hepatitis C serology is an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent anticancer therapy (including other investigational agents), with the&#xD;

             months after completion of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive impairment, history of medical or psychiatric disease, other uncontrolled&#xD;
             intercurrent illness, active substance abuse, or social circumstances, which in the&#xD;
             view of the Principal Investigator (PI), would preclude safe treatment or the ability&#xD;
