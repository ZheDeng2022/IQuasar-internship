  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of lowered physical activity&#xD;
      (resulting in decreased muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity) alone and together with&#xD;
      increased plasma free fatty acid availability (by infusion of a clinically widely used lipid&#xD;
      emulsion (Intralipid)) on insulin sensitivity and glucose and lipid metabolism. To this end,&#xD;
      we will compare skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and glucose and lipid metabolism (within&#xD;
      one subject) after 9 days of immobilization of one leg (unilateral lower limb&#xD;
      suspension(ULLS))(decreased muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity) versus an active control&#xD;
      leg (unchanged muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity). Further, changes in IMCL and fatty&#xD;
      acid intermediates will be investigated in the immobilized vs the control leg, and this will&#xD;
      be related to insulin sensitivity. The effectiveness of the ULLS intervention will be tested&#xD;
      by measuring muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity in both the immobilized and the control&#xD;
      leg. All measurements will be performed both in the immobilized and control leg after 9 days&#xD;
      of ULLS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the Netherlands and worldwide, the number of individuals suffering from obesity and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus is rising steadily. It is well established that obesity predisposes&#xD;
      individuals to accumulation of excessive fat in non-adipose tissues such as the liver, the&#xD;
      heart and skeletal muscle (called steatosis or ectopic fat accumulation). Furthermore, in&#xD;
      sedentary humans ectopic fat accumulation in skeletal muscle is strongly associated with&#xD;
      insulin resistance. However, paradoxically, IntraMyoCellular Lipid (IMCL) content is also&#xD;
      increased in highly insulin sensitive endurance trained subjects (known as the athlete's&#xD;
      paradox). This is suggesting that IMCL per se is not causative in skeletal muscle insulin&#xD;
      resistance. The increased IMCL storage following endurance training serves to match&#xD;
      training-induced increase in oxidative capacity and reliance on fat as a substrate during&#xD;
      exercise, whereas in obesogenic/diabetogenic conditions the high fat availability is not&#xD;
      matched by improved oxidative capacity. It is therefore speculated that under the latter&#xD;
      conditions, the lipid intermediates of IMCL metabolism such as diacylglycerol (DAG),&#xD;
      ceramides and fatty acyl-CoAs will accumulate and impede cellular insulin signalling. The&#xD;
      rate of oxidative capacity is regulated by mitochondria, which are cellular organelles&#xD;
      responsible for cellular energy production and cellular metabolism. Therefore, the overall&#xD;
      hypothesis of this project is that a low muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity can lead to&#xD;
      muscle fat accumulation and/or accumulation of lipid intermediates when fatty acid&#xD;
      availability is high, and this may result in insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.&#xD;

    <description>This is an intervention study, where each subject will undergo 12 days of unilateral lower limb suspension. Randomly, the dominant or the non-dominant leg of the subject will be suspended by attachment of a sling to a non-rigid ankle brace and to a harness on the upper body and unloaded from all weight bearing. The knee will be slightly flexed at an angle of 130°. Hip, knee and ankle will be fully mobile. The sling will be used during all locomotory activity, and the subjects will use crutches for walking.</description>
