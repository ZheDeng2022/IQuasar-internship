      To employ a fear learning-extinction paradigm with functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) and skin conductance response (SCR) assessments among patients with posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma exposed healthy controls, aiming to a) clarify neural&#xD;
      circuits underlying PTSD and b) to probe brain based predictors of symptomatic improvement in&#xD;
      response to Prolonged Exposure (PE) treatment, and first line treatment for PTSD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. It is&#xD;
      defined by a fearful response to traumatic events, and its clinical picture includes&#xD;
      reexperiencing, arousal, and avoidance to reminders of the exposure. Despite efforts to&#xD;
      characterize the pathophysiology of PTSD, no biomarkers have been established that aid in&#xD;
      diagnosis, treatment development, or prediction of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several lines of evidence suggest that PTSD symptoms are mediated by dysfunctional processes&#xD;
      involving the brain's fear-circuitry network in general, and extinction learning and recall&#xD;
      deficits in particular. Based on our preliminary work in applying fear extinction task to&#xD;
      healthy humans and patients with PTSD the goal of this renewal RO1 application is to employ&#xD;
      an established extinction paradigm with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and Skin&#xD;
      Conductance Response (SCR) assessments in a large and well characterized sample with PTSD and&#xD;
      trauma exposed healthy control (TE-HC) subjects. We plan to clarify circuits underlying PTSD&#xD;
      psychopathology and to probe, for the first time, neural circuitry of symptomatic improvement&#xD;
      in response to Prolonged Exposure (PE) treatment. This goal is congruent with NIMH strategic&#xD;
      plan strategy 1.3 (&quot;identify and integrate biological markers and behavioral indicators&#xD;
      associated with mental disorders&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred subjects including 60 individuals with a principal diagnosis of PTSD and 40&#xD;
      trauma exposed healthy controls will be assessed by fMRI and SCR to determine the neural&#xD;
      circuitry activation to the fear extinction task. fMRI data will be acquired simultaneously&#xD;
      with fear extinction and recall measurement quantified by SCR. All 60 PTSD subjects and 20&#xD;
      randomly assigned TE-HCs subjects will repeat these procedures 10 weeks later, after PTSD&#xD;
      subjects have completed 10 weeks of intensive PE treatment. Three months after treatment&#xD;
      completion clinical ratings of PTSD severity will be conducted to permit analysis of neural&#xD;
      predictors of long term treatment durability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims above will be accomplished through four years of study, conducted by a&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary research team, comprised of research scientists from Columbia, Harvard and&#xD;
      New York Universities, who have conducted studies in PTSD and structural and functional brain&#xD;
      imaging. If successful, the study will produce highly needed information on the neural&#xD;
      circuitry which underlies deficient extinction and recall in PTSD, and will provide highly&#xD;
      important information about the neural effects of Prolonged Exposure treatment, a first line&#xD;
      treatment for PTSD. Together these lines of expected findings will not only advance&#xD;
      identification of biomarkers associated with PTSD, but also facilitate identification of&#xD;
      biomarkers for clinical reponse to an empirically supported treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy consists of ten 90-minute sessions. Elements of PE include imaginal and in vivo exposure to trauma reminders; breathing retraining; cognitive restructuring; and PTSD psychoeducation. The therapist helps the patient cognitively restructure his/her experience of the traumatic event. Each week the narrative is elaborated, becoming more detailed and exhaustive, until the patient habituates to it, extinguishing the anxiety it formerly aroused.</description>
