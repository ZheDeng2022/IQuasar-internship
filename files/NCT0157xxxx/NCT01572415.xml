  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to identify compare SCOUT DS to random capillary glucose for&#xD;
      identification of at-risk subjects with dysglycemia defined by hemoglobin A1C ≥ 6.0%.&#xD;

      The study will complete up to 400 subjects at the clinical site to evaluate the precision and&#xD;
      accuracy of SCOUT DS and random capillary glucose for detecting pre-diabetes and undiagnosed&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes in subjects at risk but not having a pre-existing diagnosis of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. A point of care A1c measurement will serve as the reference method for defining&#xD;
      pre-diabetes (6.0% ≤ A1c ≤ 6.4%) and diabetes (A1c ≥ 6.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will require one visit by each subject to the clinical site. The visit does not&#xD;
      require fasting and can be done any time of day. The study (not including the IRB process and&#xD;
      recruiting) is expected to last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target cohort for comprises persons at risk for pre-diabetes and/or type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
