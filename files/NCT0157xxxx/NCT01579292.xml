      The goals of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess effect sizes of our mDPP intervention on weight loss, physical activity, dietary&#xD;
           intake, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels from baseline to 5 months as compared to&#xD;
           a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the association between low heath-literacy levels at baseline and adherence&#xD;
           to mobile phone usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To conduct process evaluation to gain insights into patient compliance to the mobile&#xD;
           intervention, including usage barriers and acceptability of our mDPP, at 1 and 5 months&#xD;
           using a semi-structured interview method.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) continues to rise at an alarming rate in the United&#xD;
      States. A greater risk of diabetes is observed for ethnic/racial minority and lower&#xD;
      socioeconomic status (SES)groups as compared to Caucasians of similar ages. Several clinical&#xD;
      trials have tested intensive lifestyle interventions or pharmacologic agents in preventing or&#xD;
      delaying T2DM in adults at risk. These trials (e.g.the Diabetes Prevention Program)&#xD;
      consistently show impressive diabetes risk reductions using lifestyle interventions, such as&#xD;
      relatively modest amounts of weight loss and exercise. However these programs have been&#xD;
      expensive to implement and sustain over time in clinical settings or communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile technologies are ideal platforms to deliver and disseminate such lifestyle&#xD;
      modification programs to a much broader ethnic/racial minority population, making them more&#xD;
      cost effective. Today, 87% of adults in the U.S. own a mobile phone. In particular, usage of&#xD;
      non-voice services (such as text messaging or mobile internet) in African-Americans and&#xD;
      non-white Hispanics is significantly higher than their Caucasian counterparts. In contrast,&#xD;
      ethnic /racial minority populations are much less likely to own a computer at home compared&#xD;
      to their Caucasian counterparts. Given the rapid diffusion of mobile technologies in&#xD;
      ethnic/racial minority populations, we need to understand how to apply mobile persuasive&#xD;
      technologies to such lifestyle modification programs.&#xD;
