      A Single Center Non-Interventional Post-Market Release, Long Term Follow Up study of patients&#xD;
      who underwent Isolated Aortic Valve Replacement or Isolated Mitral Valve Replacement with a&#xD;
      Medtronic Mosaic Bioprosthesis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long term&#xD;
      safety, efficacy and clinical performance of the Mosaic Bioprostheses.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the long-term safety, efficacy and&#xD;
      clinical performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single center, non-interventional, non-randomized, post-market release&#xD;
      clinical study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 255 patients had aortic valve replacement and 47 patients had mitral valve&#xD;
      replacement in the Albertinen-Krankenhaus (Hamburg, Germany) during the previous Mosaic&#xD;
      Pre-Market approval (PMA) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surviving patients from the Mosaic Pre-Market Approval study at this center, will be&#xD;
      invited to participate. Approximately 225 patients will be invited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is intended to serve as an ongoing source of information on long-term durability&#xD;
      and safety of the CE-marked Medtronic Mosaic bioprosthesis. As such the study is to continue&#xD;
      indefinitely until the last follow-up visit (until patient study exit due to patient death,&#xD;
      withdrawal of patient consent,...) of the last study patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT SELECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients who were enrolled and implanted with the Mosaic bioprosthesis in the&#xD;
           Albertinen-Krankenhaus (Hamburg, Germany) during the previous Mosaic PMA study, will be&#xD;
           invited to participate in this long- term follow-up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are not from the Albertinen-Krankenhaus (Hamburg, Germany) and who did not&#xD;
           participate in the Mosaic PMA study are ineligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients refusing or not able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients not willing and unable to comply with the Clinical Investigation Plan&#xD;
           (CIP)-requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Requirements and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient enrolled in the study, information will be collected annually. Data will be&#xD;
      collected on the patient status and device hemodynamic performance by echocardiography.&#xD;
      Patient identity is anonymized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate statistical analysis will be performed for the collected clinical data.&#xD;
