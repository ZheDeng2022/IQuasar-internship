      The purpose of this study is to quantify hip biomechanics of subjects with and without FAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will advance our understanding of how the FAI alters the&#xD;
      biomechanics of the hip joint, improving diagnosis and directing treatment strategies.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who present with hip pain subsequently diagnosed as femoroacetabular&#xD;
             impingement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who meet the following radiographic criterion of cam or pincer FAI, will be&#xD;
             given the opportunity to volunteer in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects that demonstrate a cross-over-sign or a lateral center edge angle (LCEA)&#xD;
             without an alpha angle, will be classified as having pincer FAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with an alpha angle, without a cross-over sign or LCEA, will be categorized&#xD;
             as having cam type FAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Finally, with at least one cam (alpha angle) and pincer sign &quot;cross-over-sign or a&#xD;
             lateral center edge angle (LCEA)&quot; will be classified as mixed FAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control Population Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  12 controls will consist of volunteers in the same age range as the subject groups&#xD;
             (18-35 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Control hips will be screened with a standard AP radiograph. Normal volunteers who&#xD;
             have radiographic evidence of FAI, dysplasia or other joint deformities will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis (Tonnis Grade III or IV)&#xD;
             will be excluded as this study focuses on the mechanics of hips before prominent&#xD;
             cartilage damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have had prior procedures to correct FAI or other hip conditions will be&#xD;
             excluded (exploratory procedures will be included).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minors (under age 18), mentally disabled, persons incarcerated, on parole, probation&#xD;
             awaiting trial, or pregnant women are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A human Chorionic Gondaotropin (hCG) urine pregnancy test will be performed on all&#xD;
             women prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To limit the annual radiation exposure to any participating volunteers, we will&#xD;
             exclude anyone who has had a CT scan or participated in a research study involving&#xD;
             ionizing radiation in the past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Motion Capture Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are unwilling or unable to perform the proposed activities of daily&#xD;
             living or undergo the clinical exams will be dismissed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a BMI less than 30 (www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/) or those with dense hip&#xD;
             musculature/wide hips (maximum of 42 cm of circumferential hip length) will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CT Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are unwilling or unable to remain still.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are allergic to contrast agent and/or lidocaine will be dismissed.&#xD;
