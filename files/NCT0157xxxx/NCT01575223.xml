      Purpose: To determine if high volume saline nasal irrigation (HVSI), (NeilMed® Sinus Rinse™)&#xD;
      offers a benefit over low volume saline irrigation (LVSI), (Salinex®) in the early&#xD;
      post-operative management in patients with chronic rhino sinusitis.&#xD;

      Background: Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common inflammatory condition of the upper&#xD;
      respiratory tract lasting more than 8 to 12 weeks. Major symptoms include facial&#xD;
      congestion/fullness, facial pain/pressure, nasal obstruction/blockage, purulent nasal&#xD;
      drainage, and reduction or loss of smell. The diagnosis must include two major symptoms and&#xD;
      either endoscopic evidence of polyps, edema or mucopurulent discharge from the middle meatus&#xD;
      and/or CT changes in the mucosa of sinuses or osteomeatal complexes.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRS has an estimated prevalence of 5% in the Canadian population2, and up to 16% in some&#xD;
      adult populations in the United States.3 Sinusitis is associated with a major societal health&#xD;
      care burden, costing billions of dollars a year in North America.4,5 The medical treatment of&#xD;
      CRS includes topical saline and corticosteroid sprays, systemic steroids and antimicrobials.&#xD;
      Specifically, saline nasal irrigation (SNI) is a safe, nonpharmacologic treatment, and an&#xD;
      important and efficacious component in the management of CRS.6,7 SNI can vary by&#xD;
      concentration (e.g. hypertonic, isotonic, hypotonic) and device (e.g. bulb syringe, nasal&#xD;
      mist, squeeze bottle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mayo Clinic recently reviewed major expert consensus guidelines on the medical treatment&#xD;
      of CRS.8 Although they recognized an overall paucity of controlled trials for any medical&#xD;
      treatment, and a lack of a consensus or algorithm in the treatment of CRS, there is an&#xD;
      overall consensus agreement of the use for SNI in this population. In this review, there was&#xD;
      no mention of treatment of CRS in postoperative period, and no recommendation of what type of&#xD;
      SNI is best.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies examine various SNI formulations in the postoperative period. These were&#xD;
      highlighted by Canadian authors in a recent exhaustive review of SNI in sinusitis.9 Three&#xD;
      studies, all greater than 15 years old, include formulations that are not currently in&#xD;
      popular use, or even available in North America.10-12 These did show that pressurized jets or&#xD;
      sprays of seawater were more effective than nasal drops. More recently, Harvey et al.&#xD;
      examined how irrigation is delivered and retained in the sinus, using more common&#xD;
      devices.13,14 In a cadaveric model, they compared HVSI to LVSI devices and found a greater&#xD;
      delivery (p&lt;..02) in the former. To date there are no studies comparing HVSI to LVSI, using&#xD;
      subjective patient benefit and objective endoscopic measure outcomes, in the postoperative&#xD;
      CRS patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One study did examine two different SNI devices in the management of CRS.15 The authors&#xD;
      recruited 150 subjects with CRS in the primary care setting, and randomized them to two weeks&#xD;
      of SNI with a bulb syringe, SNI with a nasal irrigation pot, and a control group of&#xD;
      reflexology massage.15 Hypertonic saline was used in both treatment groups. Subjective&#xD;
      questionnaires were administered at baseline and at the end of the study period. Both groups&#xD;
      significantly improved, with no significant difference between the two SNI devices. Patients&#xD;
      equally preferred the two devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Popular HVSI and LVSI formulations with patients and physicians are NeilMed® Sinus Rinse™ and&#xD;
      Salinex®, respectively. These are two examples of positive pressure treatments,13 which have&#xD;
      enjoyed widespread usage in North America preceding sufficient evidence-based medicine&#xD;
      demonstrating safety and efficacy. This is likely because topical saline sprays are&#xD;
      considered safe; they do not require a prescription, and perhaps most importantly the massive&#xD;
      marketing campaign surrounding SNI devices. SNI devices have received significant news&#xD;
      coverage and appearances on major television shows, including the Oprah Winfrey Show, the New&#xD;
      York Times, and numerous YouTube videos.16 Purpose: The authors hypothesize that there is an&#xD;
      advantage of HVSI over LVSI. The mechanical effect of high volume irrigation helps ensure&#xD;
      that a larger surface area of sinonasal mucosa is debrided and cleansed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine if there is a clinical benefit of HVSI over LVSI in the&#xD;
      postoperative period in patients with CRS. This information would help otolaryngologists,&#xD;
      family physicians, and other health care professionals recommend the best SNI device for&#xD;
      their patients with CRS. It would also provide a much-needed prospective and controlled trial&#xD;
      in the evidence for SNI in CRS in the post-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population/Procedure: This is a multicenter, randomized, single blind, controlled prospective&#xD;
      study evaluating the subjective and objective outcomes of HSVI versus LSVI in patients who&#xD;
      have ESS for CRS. One month postoperative scores will be compared to preoperative scores. The&#xD;
      expected total number of patients to be enrolled in this study is approximately 100, with a&#xD;
      planned completion time of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At our institution, ten patients who are offered endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for CRS will&#xD;
      be approached for study participation.&#xD;
