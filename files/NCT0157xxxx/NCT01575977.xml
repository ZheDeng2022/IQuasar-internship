  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to predict cartilage contact pressures in the hip after&#xD;
      periacetabular osteotomy (PAO).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PAO was designed as a joint preserving surgical procedure to compensate for a shallow&#xD;
      acetabulum by re-orienting the acetabulum into a position that provides better coverage of&#xD;
      the femoral head. Although the overall theory that increasing load bearing area (improving&#xD;
      coverage of the femoral head) results in reduced joint stress is intuitive, the complex bony&#xD;
      surface may not behave in this manner. It is possible that joint stress may increase when the&#xD;
      acetabulum is reoriented into a position that increases load bearing area if post-operative&#xD;
      joint congruency is worse than pre-operative.&#xD;
