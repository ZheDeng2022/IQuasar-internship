  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In treating idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus with a shunt there is always a risk of&#xD;
      underdrainage or overdrainage. The hypothesis is tested whether treatment of patients with an&#xD;
      adjustable valve preset at the highest opening pressure (OPV), leads to comparable clinical&#xD;
      results with less subdural effusions than in a control group with an opening pressure preset&#xD;
      and kept fixed at a low pressure level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) is characterized by a clinical triad of&#xD;
      symptoms: gait disturbance, urinary incontinence and cognitive impairment. INPH typically&#xD;
      develops among the elderly and shares some symptoms with other neurological disorders. In&#xD;
      general, 60-70% of patients with the complete clinical triad and signs of hydrocephalus on&#xD;
      CT/MRI will improve after cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting. Implantation of a shunt,&#xD;
      however, carries complications such as infection, obstruction, underdrainage, and&#xD;
      overdrainage. The cumulative complication rate and revision rate is estimated to be 35-80%&#xD;
      among adults. The England shunt registry described an overall incidence of underdrainage of&#xD;
      52%, and studies have resulted in incidences of overdrainage between 2 and 21%. Børgesen&#xD;
      claims that 80% of complications of shunting for INPH are related to overdrainage.&#xD;
      Overdrainage may lead to low intracranial pressure syndrome and subdural effusions (SDE). Low&#xD;
      intracranial pressure syndrome is characterized by orthostatic headaches and sometimes&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, diplopia, upward gaze palsy and visual defects. As INPH&#xD;
      patients are often elderly patients with concomitant brain atrophy and normal CSF pressure&#xD;
      they are especially at risk for developing signs and symptoms of overdrainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overdrainage can be prevented or treated by implanting an anti-siphon device (ASD) or&#xD;
      changing the opening pressure of the valve (OPV). Different ASDs have been developed since&#xD;
      the first publication in 1973. They have in common that the lumen of the catheter is closed&#xD;
      under influence of a negative hydrostatic pressure at the level of the ASD. The optimal valve&#xD;
      setting for treating INPH is still the subject of controversy. The dilemma in INPH patients&#xD;
      is that a low OPV might lead to overdrainage-related symptoms. A high valve setting might&#xD;
      lead to underdrainage and the patient misses the chance of maximum improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies examining whether to use a low or high OPV have been contradictory so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, baseline primary and secondary outcome measure assessments are conducted&#xD;
      preoperatively. Within 24 hours of shunting, skull, thoracic, and abdominal X-rays are done&#xD;
      to verify device connections and position. Follow-up visits at 1, 3, and 9 months include all&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcome assessments. All measurements are done by a research assistant&#xD;
      who visits the participating hospitals to prevent inter-observer variation. Study end for&#xD;
      each patient is defined as completing the 9 month visit or death, detection of SDE on CT, or&#xD;
      shunt removal or revision due to infection or dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PL in Group 1 (control group) is allowed to be increased to a higher setting when an SDE&#xD;
      is detected. The patient thereby reaches study end, and the treating physician is free to&#xD;
      decide how to manage the PL. The 9-month follow-up is still obtained. The PL in Group 2 is&#xD;
      preset at the highest PL and eventually lowered 1 step at each follow-up visit when the&#xD;
      modified mini mental state (3MS) or Gait score is not increased ≥ 15% provided that no SDE is&#xD;
      visible on a new CT scan. The 15% is considered the minimum percentage to reliably determine&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;

    <description>in the intervention group, the performance level(PL) of the valve of the VP shunt, preset at the highest PL (meaning highest resistance) is lowered stepwise in the follow-up period at 1,3 and 9 months postoperatively after implantation until improvement occurs or signs of overdrainage are encountered on a new CT scan of the brain. In the control group the PL is preset and fixed at the second lowest PL and these patients serve as a control group.</description>
