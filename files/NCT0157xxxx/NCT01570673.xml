      What are we doing? A pilot research study is planned to take place within the Pediatric&#xD;
      Urology program at McMaster Children's hospital starting this spring/summer 2012. The pilot&#xD;
      study will compare standard individual teaching that occurs in pediatric urology clinic about&#xD;
      bladder re-training and achieving healthy bladder and bowel habits to a group teaching&#xD;
      session. The group teaching session will be one hour in length and include the same content&#xD;
      taught in pediatric urology clinic and provide more time for the children to ask questions,&#xD;
      demonstrate and practice different exercises and talk about some of the challenges associated&#xD;
      with having problems with their bladder. The group teaching session will be approximately one&#xD;
      hour in length and occur weekly in the evenings for 12 to 15 weeks. Study participants will&#xD;
      be asked to attend either one group teaching session or one individual teaching session which&#xD;
      will occur in regular pediatric urology clinic. Parents will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      demographics questionnaire at the start of the study and child participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete 2 short questionnaires about symptoms and quality of life before and after either&#xD;
      individual or group teaching sessions. At the 3 month follow up, parents and child&#xD;
      participants will also be asked to fill out an evaluation form of the session received.&#xD;
      Children between the ages of 6 and 10 years old and a diagnosis of nonneurogenic lower&#xD;
      urinary tract dysfunction will be asked if they would like to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why are we doing it? Some of the symptoms of bladder dysfunction include incontinence&#xD;
      (wetting), recurrent urinary tract infections, frequency (having to pee a lot) and urgency&#xD;
      (having sudden urges to pee). These symptoms can affect a child's physical and&#xD;
      emotional/mental well-being. Treatment includes improving bladder habits through bladder&#xD;
      re-training and improving bowel habits through treatment and management of constipation as&#xD;
      well as establishing a bowel routine. Children are taught about their urinary tract system&#xD;
      and what they need to do to improve and maintain its health. Children are asked to void (pee)&#xD;
      every 2 hours, double void and drink more water. Sometimes they also need to take&#xD;
      medications. Often in a busy clinic, parents are taught what the child needs to do and&#xD;
      expected to return home and implement the bladder re-training instructions. Participation of&#xD;
      the child during these visits varies. However, participation and engagement of the child in&#xD;
      bladder re-training is crucial for success. Also, little time is spent on the impact of&#xD;
      bladder dysfunction on the lives of these children. Many children do not want to follow the&#xD;
      instructions on bladder re-training because they are worried about what their peers may say.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What do we hope to accomplish? The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a&#xD;
      group teaching session and evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of the session.&#xD;
      Questionnaire results will be compared before and after the teaching sessions and between the&#xD;
      individual and group teaching groups. Evaluation forms will provide feedback about the&#xD;
      teaching sessions which will help determine the strengths of the sessions and improvements&#xD;
      that could be made to improve the quality and effectiveness of future treatment. Outcomes&#xD;
      that will be measured include symptoms and quality of life. This pilot study will also&#xD;
      provide important information related to symptoms and quality of life for these children.&#xD;

      Background Urotherapy has been the standard nonsurgical, nonpharmacologic treatment for&#xD;
      children with nonneurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) and dysfunctional&#xD;
      elimination syndrome (DES) for over two decades (Hoebeke, 2006). Children with NLUTD/DES&#xD;
      represent a heterogenous group whose physical and mental health are affected (Afshar et al.,&#xD;
      2009). There is no widely accepted diagnostic criteria (Afshar et al.) and urotherapy&#xD;
      modalities that have been studied vary by setting, curriculum, length of treatment, outcome&#xD;
      measurements and study participants. It is challenging to determine what modality of&#xD;
      urotherapy is the most effective by reviewing the current literature. Furthermore, quality of&#xD;
      life as an outcome measurement of urotherapy has not been reported in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a group urotherapy session&#xD;
      and evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of the group urotherapy session by measuring&#xD;
      NLUTD/DES symptoms and quality of life and compare the group urotherapy session to standard&#xD;
      urotherapy that takes place in pediatric urology clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Children aged 6-10 years old diagnosed with NLUTD/DES will be recruited from&#xD;
      pediatric urology clinic at McMaster Children's Hospital over 12 to 15 weeks. The aim is to&#xD;
      recruit at least 60 participants, 30 will be randomized to the control group and receive&#xD;
      standard individual urotherapy in clinic and 30 will be randomized to the experimental group&#xD;
      and receive a 1 hour group urotherapy session. Parents will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      demographics questionnaire at the time of consent and children will be asked to complete 2&#xD;
      questionnaires at time of consent and again 3 months after receiving either individual or&#xD;
      group urotherapy. At the 3 month follow up, parents and participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete an evaluation form to provide feedback about the teaching session received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measurements NLUTD/DES symptoms will be evaluated using the Vancouver NLUTD/DES&#xD;
      questionnaire. This questionnaire assesses the following symptoms: incontinence, urgency,&#xD;
      frequency, dysuria, hesitancy, straining and constipation. Quality of life (QOL) will be&#xD;
      measured using the PinQ QOL measure. This questionnaire measures 6 domains of QOL: social,&#xD;
      self-esteem, family, body image, independence and mental health. Both questionnaires have&#xD;
      been deemed valid and reliable in children with the same diagnosis and age as the study&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact This pilot study will provide new knowledge as a controlled trial comparing standard&#xD;
      individual and group urotherapy which has not been reported on in the literature. Urotherapy&#xD;
      is effective, but the search for the most effective program continues. This pilot study will&#xD;
      provide information on the feasibility of the group urotherapy session as well as preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness. Furthermore, quality of life as an outcome measure has not been used to&#xD;
      evaluate urotherapy. Again, this will provide new and valuable knowledge on the child's&#xD;
      perception of their condition and the effect of urotherapy on their QOL.&#xD;
