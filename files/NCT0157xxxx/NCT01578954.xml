  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of the study drug, lenalidomide, at&#xD;
      different dose levels in people diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have finished&#xD;
      standard induction therapy and have had a partial or complete response to induction therapy.&#xD;
      The investigators want to find out what effects (for example, side effects) the study drug,&#xD;
      lenalidomide, has on people and their leukemia. The investigators also want to see if&#xD;
      additional treatment (maintenance therapy) with lenalidomide will keep the leukemia from&#xD;
      relapsing (coming back).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, open-label phase Ib clinical trial testing the hypothesis that&#xD;
      the daily use of lenalidomide will be safe and tolerable as evidenced by the rate of&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) seen during one month of reinduction/consolidation in older (≥&#xD;
      60 years of age) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated after one cycle of&#xD;
      conventional, anthracycline-based induction. (Re-induction is the prescribed lenalidomide&#xD;
      therapy given to patients who are in partial remission/response post induction while&#xD;
      consolidation is the same prescribed lenalidomide therapy post induction given to patients&#xD;
      who are in complete remission).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will take place within cohorts during the 28-day re-induction/ consolidation&#xD;
      lenalidomide treatment at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After&#xD;
      re-induction/consolidation, patients who harbor ≥ 5% peripheral blood or bone marrow&#xD;
      myeloblasts will be removed from protocol therapy. Patients who have &lt;5% peripheral blood or&#xD;
      bone marrow myeloblasts after consolidation therapy will be allowed to continue to&#xD;
      maintenance therapy: lenalidomide 10 mg/day continuously for up to 12 months. Up to 26&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial includes a Geriatric Assessment (GA) of each enrolled patient at baseline and&#xD;
      serially across the trial. The investigators also plan to study natural killer (NK) cell&#xD;
      phenotype and cytolytic function in patients at various intervals across the study (baseline,&#xD;
      post re-induction/consolidation, and during maintenance.&#xD;
