  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed to investigate differences in terms of efficacy (mean change&#xD;
      in best corrected visual acuity obtained after 12 months of treatment) and safety, of 3&#xD;
      therapeutic estrategies for non-tractional macular edema in diabetic patients: a) laser&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        To be eligible, the following inclusion criteria must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age ≥18 years from both sexes. Women of childbearing age should use adequate&#xD;
             contraception methods and submit a negative pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2 (documented by ADA or WHO guidelines)&#xD;
             and serum HbA1c &lt;11% at the time of randomization (determinations done in the last two&#xD;
             months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eye with clear media, pupil dilation and patient able to cooperate to perform&#xD;
             retinography, OCT and fluorescein angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with clinically significant diabetic macular edema; the patient must have at&#xD;
             least one:&#xD;
&#xD;
             5.1) retinal thickening within 500 μ from the center or 5.2) hard exudates within 500&#xD;
             μ from the center if associated with adjacent retinal thickening or 5.3) the size of&#xD;
             retinal thickening at least 1 area disc, part of which is less than 1 DD of the&#xD;
             center.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with diffuse diabetic macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with not tractional diabetic macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A patient is not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria are present:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women of childbearing age not using adequate contraceptive methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnancy and lactation. Pregnancy test was performed before starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Chronic renal failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation.&#xD;

          5. Systemic use of steroids in the last 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient intends to change his place of residence within 3 years after recruitment,&#xD;
             whenever you go to an area not covered by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Blood pressure&gt;180/110. If blood pressure is brought below 180/110 by&#xD;
             anti-hypertensive treatment, patient can become eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. HbA1c&gt; 11% in the current analysis or done in the last 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual&#xD;
             acuity would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy,&#xD;
             pigmentary changes, dense subfoveal hare exudates, nonretinal condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. An ocular condition is present (other than diabetes) that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of&#xD;
             the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease,&#xD;
             neovascular glaucoma, Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be&#xD;
             decreasing visual acuity by 3 lines or more&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of prior treatment with intravitreal corticosteroids or intravitreal&#xD;
             antiangiogenic.&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. History of focal, grid or panretinal photocoagulation within 4 months prior to&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Need of panretinal photocoagulation in the first 4 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. History of prior pars plana vitrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle, vitrectomy, etc.)&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. History of YAG capsulotomy performed within 2 months prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Intraocular pressure &gt;25mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. History of open-angle glaucoma (either primary open-angle glaucoma or other cause of&#xD;
             open-angle glaucoma; note: angle-closure glaucoma is not an exclusion). A history of&#xD;
             ocular hypertension is not an exclusion as long as (1) intraocular pressure is &lt;25&#xD;
             mmHg, (2) the patient is using no more than one topical glaucoma medication, (3) the&#xD;
             most recent visual field, performed within the last 12 months, is normal (if&#xD;
             abnormalities are present on the visual field they must be attributable to the&#xD;
             patient's diabetic retinopathy), and (4) the optic disc does not appear glaucomatous.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. History of cortisone-induced glaucoma that required IOP-lowering treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. History of prior herpetic ocular infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Exam evidence of ocular toxoplasmosis.&#xD;
