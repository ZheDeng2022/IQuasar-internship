      The aim of this present study is to test the feasibility and toxicity of individualized&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiotherapy, and to report outcome data. In case this phase II trial has&#xD;
      favorable results, a phase II/III trial on maximally tolerable, individualized,&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiotherapy within a shorter overall-treatment time is aimed for.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the Netherlands, approximately 10.000 new patients are diagnosed with lung cancer every&#xD;
      year. Of these, 80% present with non-small-cell lung cancer. Between 1995 and 2008, the&#xD;
      national incidence has risen with 16% caused by an impressive increase of 53% in women&#xD;
      suffering from this disease. The aggressive nature of this disease leads to a one-year&#xD;
      survival rate of 45% and a 5-year survival rate of only 14%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is widely accepted that surgery provides the best chance of cure in patients with operable&#xD;
      NSCLC (www.oncoline.nl). In practice, only 20% of patients are amenable for tumor resection&#xD;
      with curative intent. Alternatively, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) results in&#xD;
      excellent local control in localized early stage disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In locally advanced, inoperable disease, combined chemotherapy and external-beam radiotherapy&#xD;
      (EBRT) are increasingly being used. Evidence suggests that concurrent schedules are more&#xD;
      effective than sequential treatments despite increased toxicity, although the true magnitude&#xD;
      of the additional benefit remains uncertain. However, a large number of patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC is not suitable for concurrent chemoradiotherapy due to their general&#xD;
      condition, age, comorbidity or tumor-related factors. Therefore, there is a need to increase&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment for all patients with advanced stage NSCLC undergoing either&#xD;
      radiotherapy alone, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy, or concurrent&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from the addition of chemotherapy, treatment modification by intensification of the&#xD;
      radiotherapy schedule or by dose escalation has been proven beneficial. Several phase I/II&#xD;
      trials explored altered EBRT fractionation schedules that increased the biological effective&#xD;
      dose to the primary tumor and reduced local relapse rate. Thereby, two main principles were&#xD;
      pursued: reduction of the dose per fraction (≤ 1.8 Gy), giving two or three fractions per day&#xD;
      (so-called hyperfractionation), aimed at sparing normal tissues while increasing the dose to&#xD;
      the primary tumor; increase of the fraction dose (≥ 2 Gy), combined with a reduction in the&#xD;
      total number of fractions (so-called hypofractionation) aimed at increasing the effective&#xD;
      tumor dose in less radiation-sensitive primary tumors. On the one hand, hyperfractionation&#xD;
      limits the treatment-related side-effects, on the other hypofractionation is attractive for&#xD;
      the patient and radiation department as the number of treatment fractions can be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensification of the irradiation schedule by continuous, hyperfractionated radiotherapy&#xD;
      (CHART) delivered in 12 consecutive days showed an absolute improvement in two-year survival.&#xD;
      With the advent of highly conformal dose planning and delivery techniques during the last&#xD;
      decade (i.e., 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, 3D-CRT; intensity-modulated&#xD;
      radiation therapy, IMRT; volumetric-modulated arc therapy, VMAT/RapidArc; Tomotherapy),&#xD;
      organ-sparing technology became widely available. Recently, van Baardwijk and collaborators&#xD;
      published an individualized dose prescription study in 166 stage-III NSCLC patients. Already&#xD;
      in 2006, Belderbos et al. reported favorable toxicity data and an encouraging failure-free&#xD;
      interval in 88 inoperable NSCLC patients treated with intensified, hypofractionated 3D-CRT&#xD;
      based on the MTD to the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from these reported studies, there are three hypofractionation trials being conducted&#xD;
      elsewhere. In the UK, two 3D-CRT based phase I/II trials have been approved investigating&#xD;
      individualized dose escalation based on normal tissue dose constraints in patients with stage&#xD;
      II or stage III NSCLC (ISRCTN12155469 and I-START; CRUK/10/005). In the US, the University of&#xD;
      Wisconsin is conducting a helical tomotherapy-based hypofractionation study (NCT00214123)&#xD;
      with pulmonary toxicity (pneumonitis grade 3 lasting for more than 2 weeks) as primary&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reported hypo- and hyperfractionation studies have a 'trial-and-error' approach for&#xD;
      dose-level estimation in common. In a recent in silico trial in 26 stage III NSCLC patients,&#xD;
      we have investigated the use of a dedicated software tool for individual dose escalation by&#xD;
      hypofractionation. Based on an existing, clinical IMRT/VMAT treatment plan (66 Gy in 33&#xD;
      fractions), radiation dose was escalated by scaling the radiation dose until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose constraints for the healthy lung, the esophagus, spinal cord, brachial plexus&#xD;
      or heart was met. The aim of this present study is to test the feasibility and toxicity of&#xD;
      individualized hypofractionated radiotherapy, and to report outcome data. In case this phase&#xD;
      II trial has favorable results, a phase II/III trial on maximally tolerable, individualized,&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiotherapy within a shorter overall-treatment time is aimed for.&#xD;
