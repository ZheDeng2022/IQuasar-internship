  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis has been thought to be a degenerative process basically induced by&#xD;
      long-lasting mechanical stress, and hemodynamic factors such as shear forces, acceleration of&#xD;
      blood flow, hypertension and rapid heart rate might contribute to progression of aortic&#xD;
      stenosis. Peak aortic jet velocity is known to be associated with clinical outcomes in mild&#xD;
      and moderate AS, and our previous study showed that rate of progression was significantly&#xD;
      associated with baseline aortic jet velocity in mild aortic stenosis. Because beta-blocker&#xD;
      therapy would decrease aortic jet velocity and heart rate, it might decrease hemodynamic&#xD;
      stress and eventually slow down the degenerative process in patients whose disease is not too&#xD;
      advanced for therapy to be effective. The investigators hypothesized that a beta-blocker&#xD;
      therapy would decrease the rate of progression of aortic stenosis by modifying hemodynamic&#xD;
      factors favorably in patients with mild to moderate aortic stenosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis (AS) is a gradually progressive disease, characterized by an increase in&#xD;
      calcium deposition leading to progressive narrowing of the aortic valve (AV). There are&#xD;
      currently no effective medical treatment to halt the disease process and surgical valve&#xD;
      replacement remains the only proven therapy when the valve becomes severely stenotic. AS is&#xD;
      mediated by a chronic inflammatory disease process, very similar to that seen in&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, but lipid-lowering therapy did not slow the progression of AS in the&#xD;
      SALTIRE, SEAS, or ASTRONOMER trials. It is possible that these trials may have targeted&#xD;
      patients in whom disease was too advanced for lipid-lowering therapy to be effective, or in&#xD;
      whom atherosclerotic mechanism was not the central pathogenic process in AS. Because&#xD;
      identifying and treating patients in earlier stages of AS would not be cost-effective, it&#xD;
      seems more logical to explore alternative pharmacological approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AS has been thought to be a degenerative process basically induced by long-lasting mechanical&#xD;
      stress, and hemodynamic factors such as shear forces, acceleration of blood flow,&#xD;
      hypertension and rapid heart rate might contribute to progression of AS. Peak aortic jet&#xD;
      velocity is known to be associated with clinical outcomes in mild and moderate AS, and our&#xD;
      previous study showed that rate of progression was significantly associated with baseline&#xD;
      aortic jet velocity in mild AS. Because beta-blocker therapy would decrease aortic jet&#xD;
      velocity and heart rate, it might decrease hemodynamic stress and eventually slow down the&#xD;
      degenerative process in patients whose disease is not too advanced for therapy to be&#xD;
      effective. In a retrospective, observational study, beta-blocker therapy was associated with&#xD;
      a favorable clinical outcome in AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that bisoprolol, a new generation beta-blocker, would decrease&#xD;
      the rate of progression of AS by modifying hemodynamic factors favorably in patients with&#xD;
      mild to moderate AS.&#xD;
