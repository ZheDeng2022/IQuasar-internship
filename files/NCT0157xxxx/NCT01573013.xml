    <textblock>
      In a cross-sectional study allotted by the ethical committee of the ETH Zurich, we are&#xD;
      investigating the extent of anemia, iron deficiency and lead intoxication in young children.&#xD;
      For this purpose an assessment of body lead burden and iron status was conducted in a cohort&#xD;
      of individuals residing in areas of presumed high lead exposure. Associations between lead&#xD;
      burden and iron status will be investigated in the near future (current status of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a follow-on intervention study, the effect of iron fortification with and without NaEDTA&#xD;
      on blood lead levels in lead-exposed children will be evaluated; and the relative impact of&#xD;
      these two strategies on child growth, motor and cognitive test performance will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the potential use of iron fortification to not only combat anemia&#xD;
      but also reduce body lead burden in lead-exposed populations; it specifically investigates&#xD;
      whether iron fortification with NaFeEDTA could have additional beneficial effects to iron&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

      Introduction Coexisting chronic lead poisoning and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are common in&#xD;
      urban areas in developing regions, particularly in young children. In urban Morocco, anemia&#xD;
      affects more than 1/3rd of schoolchildren and lead exposure is high. Lead poisoning and IDA&#xD;
      both impair cognitive development and educability and may therefore have substantial health,&#xD;
      social and economic costs on developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron status alters susceptibility to gastrointestinal lead exposure; absorption of lead is&#xD;
      sharply increased in children with IDA. IDA upregulates the divalent metal transporter&#xD;
      trans-port protein (DMT-1) and increases lead absorption. Thus, iron fortification to reduce&#xD;
      IDA may also reduce lead absorption and be an effective strategy to accompany environmental&#xD;
      lead abatement. The optimal iron compound for wheat flour is currently debated, and although&#xD;
      elemental iron compounds are commonly used, they may be only poorly absorbed in the face of&#xD;
      inhibitory compounds found in wheat flour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A form of chelated iron, NaFeEDTA, is a promising iron fortificant that is recommended for&#xD;
      wheat flour fortification. It is also a lead chelator. It may be superior to other iron&#xD;
      fortificants in its ability to reduce body lead burden, due to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. its iron is highly bioavailable in the face of dietary inhibitors (such as phytic acid&#xD;
           in wheat flour); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. potentially, its ability to chelate lead in the gut and bloodstream. Thus, it may be a&#xD;
           good choice for fortification of wheat flour in Morocco, particularly in urban areas, to&#xD;
           both reduce IDA and lower body lead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of body lead burden and iron status in a cohort of individuals residing in&#xD;
           areas of presumed high lead exposure. Investigation of associations between lead burden&#xD;
           and iron status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison of effect of iron fortification with and without NaEDTA on body lead and iron&#xD;
           status in lead-exposed children; and the relative impact on cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of iron deficiency and elevated blood lead will be high in children in this&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Body lead burden, as assessed by blood lead levels and urinary lead and&#xD;
      delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), will be higher in individuals with poorer iron status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Poor iron status will be associated with low intakes of bioavailable iron. 4) Greater&#xD;
      severity of iron deficiency and/or higher body lead in children will predict poorer&#xD;
      performance on cognitive and motor tests, and these conditions will interact to predict&#xD;
      poorer performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our studies will be carried out in one of the four sub-economic areas, that were previously&#xD;
      used in the baseline assessment in and near Marrakesh, Morocco (exact site still needs to be&#xD;
      determined according to extend of lead contamination on the level of human population). Body&#xD;
      lead burden and iron status will be determined, and associations between these examined using&#xD;
      a cross-sectional design. For this purpose, blood and urine samples will be collected from&#xD;
      two groups (preschool and school-aged children), residing in an area of high lead exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An 8-month intervention study in iron deficient, lead-exposed school children (n=500) will be&#xD;
      designed to investigate whether iron fortification to reduce IDA may also reduce lead&#xD;
      absorption and be an effective strategy to accompany environmental lead abatement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose these children will be divided into four groups to receive a daily fortified&#xD;
      baked snack containing either: 1) 66.4 mg NaFeEDTA ; 2) 52.2 mg Na2EDTA dehydrate; 3) 27.1 mg&#xD;
      FeSO4 ; or 4) no fortificants.&#xD;
