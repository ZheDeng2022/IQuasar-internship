  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social phobia is the third most common psychiatric disorder besides depression and&#xD;
      alcoholism. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy in&#xD;
      the treatment of social phobia. Nevertheless, there is no effect in a third of the people at&#xD;
      the existing treatment methods. Pharmacological therapies have similar effects, but there is&#xD;
      a high rate of relapse after discontinuation of medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social phobia is characterized by fear of performance or interaction situations. The strong&#xD;
      fear of negative evaluation by others is usually accompanied by a marked avoidance behavior&#xD;
      and increased physical symptoms such as blushing, sweating, palpitations, or tremors. The&#xD;
      confrontation with a phobic stimulus leads to a retrieval of stimulus-associated aversive&#xD;
      memories, resulting in an immediate anxiety response. Several studies had already shown that&#xD;
      elevated glucocorticoids impair retrieval of declarative memory contents in healthy subjects.&#xD;
      The investigators demonstrated an anxiety-reducing effect after the administration of&#xD;
      cortisone before the confrontation with a phobic stimulus in patients with social and spider&#xD;
      phobia.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety disorders have major public health significance and social phobia ranks as the third&#xD;
      most common mental health disorder after depression and alcoholism. Even though&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective non-pharmacological approach to the&#xD;
      treatment of social phobia, more than one third of the patients do not respond to treatment,&#xD;
      or achieve only partial remission of symptoms. Pharmacotherapy (e.g., SSRIs, benzodiazepines)&#xD;
      has been shown to be effective in the acute treatment of social phobia, however, with high&#xD;
      rates of relapse when medication is discontinued. In addition, the combination of CBT and&#xD;
      medication does not seem to be more beneficial than CBT alone. Consequently, the development&#xD;
      of innovative psychobiological approaches combining effective psychotherapy methods with&#xD;
      synergizing substance administration is a primary challenge in interdisciplinary research on&#xD;
      treatment of social phobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study the investigators found evidence that a pharmacological elevation of&#xD;
      glucocorticoid levels reduces fear in patients with social phobia and spider phobia exposed&#xD;
      to a phobic stimulus. Furthermore, the investigators have shown that repeated administration&#xD;
      of glucocorticoids before exposure to a phobic stimulus leads to an extinction of phobic&#xD;
      fear. Also the low-dose administration of cortisone over a month in patients with&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder reduces cardinal of symptoms the disorder. Based on these&#xD;
      findings, glucocorticoid treatment, in combination with exposure therapy, may help to reduce&#xD;
      fear and promote extinction of phobic fear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an interdisciplinary research project involving psychology, behavioral pharmacology&#xD;
      psychiatry, genetics and neuroimaging the investigators propose to investigate the&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy of combining an exposure-based cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT)&#xD;
      with hydrocortisone treatment. The investigators hypothesize that hydrocortisone exerts both&#xD;
      acute beneficial effects by reducing fear during exposure, and long-term beneficial effects&#xD;
      by facilitating the extinction of phobic fear. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      differential treatment responses depending on genetic variations in glucocorticoid-related&#xD;
      genes (substudy 1). These hypotheses will be tested in a clinical study with 100 patients&#xD;
      with mainly speech anxiety who fulfill DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of social phobia and&#xD;
      60 patients with spider phobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first study aimed at determining the therapeutic efficacy of combining&#xD;
      hydrocortisone administration and a short-term exposure-based cognitive-behavioral group&#xD;
      therapy for the treatment of social phobic patients with specific speech anxiety and patients&#xD;
      with spider phobia. Considering the large number of patients suffering from social phobia,&#xD;
      the suggested interdisciplinary project will have important clinical implications for the&#xD;
      development of a more effective therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether short-term treatment with 20 mg hydrocortisone enhances the efficacy of&#xD;
      exposure-based cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT) in patients with social phobia,&#xD;
      specifically speech anxiety and patients with spider phobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of studies indicate that elevated glucocorticoid levels inhibit the retrieval of&#xD;
      memory in healthy humans. Further the low-dose administration of glucocorticoids over a month&#xD;
      inhibited the retrieval of traumatic memories in patients with post traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder. These findings suggest that glucocorticoids might also inhibit retrieval of fear&#xD;
      memory in phobia and social phobia exposed to a phobic stimulus. Additionally, the&#xD;
      investigators found evidence indicating that repeated administration of glucocorticoids&#xD;
      before exposure to a phobic stimulus leads to an extinction of phobic fear. Based on these&#xD;
      findings, glucocorticoid treatment, in combination with exposure therapy, may help to reduce&#xD;
      fear and promote extinction of phobic fear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a placebo-controlled double-blind study design, patients will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive CBGT + hydrocortisone (Social Phobia: N=50 / Spider Phobia: N=30) or CBGT + placebo&#xD;
      (Social Phobia: N=50 / Spider Phobia: N=30). Psychopathological symptoms and stress&#xD;
      reactivity will be assessed by psychometric and endocrine parameters before, during and after&#xD;
      CBGT therapy. The patients have further the possibility to attend to a neuroimaging study, in&#xD;
      which the investigators examine and localize the anxiolytic effect of acute glucocorticoid&#xD;
      administration in the brain (substudy 2). In this substudy 2 the investigators compare the&#xD;
      patients with social phobia with patients with specific spider phobia and healthy controls as&#xD;
      they did in their previous studies (Soravia et al. 2006).&#xD;
