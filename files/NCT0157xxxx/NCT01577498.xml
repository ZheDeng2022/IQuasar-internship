  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Economic globalisation has been associated with a rise of cross-border migration in Europe.&#xD;
      In France, courts commonly demand appropriate medical tests aimed at age estimations of&#xD;
      supposed minors without documentation. Determining the age of foreign adolescents may be&#xD;
      important in order to define the rights and protection afforded them by law depending on this&#xD;
      status, and the conditions in which they may be detained or held in police custody if they&#xD;
      are under suspicion. Age estimation is considered to be ideally based on the combination of&#xD;
      clinical, skeletal, and dental examinations. A number of forensic physicians do not integrate&#xD;
      published recommendations or the results of published studies into their daily practice.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that medical practice is heterogeneous in this area. Factors&#xD;
      determining this heterogeneity are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the personal and professional development of the physician, as well as&#xD;
      the characteristics and the circumstances of medical examination can affect medical response&#xD;
      on age determination, beyond clinical and radiological data. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      identify factors determining medical response to courts.&#xD;

      Economic globalisation has been associated with a rise of cross-border migration in Europe.&#xD;
      Courts commonly demand appropriate medical tests aimed at age estimations of supposed minors&#xD;
      without documentation. Determining the age of foreign adolescents may be important in order&#xD;
      to define the rights and protection afforded them by law depending on this status, and the&#xD;
      conditions in which they may be detained or held in police custody if they are under&#xD;
      suspicion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines for age estimation in living individuals have been proposed and are based on the&#xD;
      combination of general clinical, skeletal, and dental examinations. However, guidelines for&#xD;
      paediatricians in the UK and a national consensus conference in France on doctors' attendance&#xD;
      on detainees in police custody have stated that the currently available methods generally do&#xD;
      not enable a doctor to state with confidence if a detainee is a minor or not. The validity of&#xD;
      currently used methods has also been questioned by the French National Consultative Ethics&#xD;
      Committee on Health and Life Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As any middle school teacher can testify, anthropometric measures such as height and weight,&#xD;
      and visible signs of sexual maturity vary widely from one adolescent to another, so that&#xD;
      general clinical examination has limited value for age estimation. The skeletal examination&#xD;
      is considered more reliable. In the reference radiological method, X-ray examination of the&#xD;
      left hand and wrist is compared with standard images from an atlas published by Greulich and&#xD;
      Pyle, who collected standards obtained in the 1930's and 1940's from an American white&#xD;
      middle-class population. The main criteria applied for dental age determination are the&#xD;
      eruption and development of the third molars, based on external and X-ray examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age estimation is considered to be ideally based on the combination of clinical, skeletal,&#xD;
      and dental examinations. However, it is not easy to determine from available published series&#xD;
      if the estimated age of a given individual is a precise age or a spectrum of possible ages,&#xD;
      and in this case how broad is the proposed spectrum. Indeed, the information in the&#xD;
      radiological atlas by Greulich and Pyle is statistical, not individual. The use of such data&#xD;
      for forensic purposes has never been intended by the authors, nor validated. Moreover, the&#xD;
      ethnic and socioeconomic characteristics of the adolescents examined today in Western Europe&#xD;
      may differ largely from those presented in the atlas, as previously suggested. The role of&#xD;
      ethnic factors in skeletal maturation has been repeatedly studied and gave conflicting&#xD;
      results. In most series evaluating skeletal age in different populations, hand and wrist&#xD;
      X-rays were obtained from healthy subjects or patients received for evaluation of trauma. The&#xD;
      conclusions of these studies may not be validated, or at least should be considered&#xD;
      cautiously, when extrapolating results to adolescents without documents involved in judicial&#xD;
      procedures, who have heterogeneous and largely unevaluated psychological and socioeconomic&#xD;
      characteristics. A number of forensic physicians do not integrate published recommendations&#xD;
      or the results of published studies into their daily practice. Previous studies have shown&#xD;
      that medical practice is heterogeneous in this area. Factors determining this heterogeneity&#xD;
      are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the personal and professional development of the physician, as well as&#xD;
      the characteristics and the circumstances of medical examination can affect medical response&#xD;
      on age determination, beyond clinical and radiological data. The main objective of this study&#xD;
      is to identify factors determining medical response to courts. A secondary objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate how evidence-based data obtained from medical journals are taken into account in&#xD;
      medical decision making by forensic physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main evaluated criterium is the medical response transmitted to courts regarding age&#xD;
      determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Prospective observational study of 500 age determinations requested by courts in&#xD;
      migrant adolescents without documentation, in 18 departments of forensic medicine in France.&#xD;
      Non-inclusion criterium is the refusal of the adolescent to undergo a medical examination.&#xD;
