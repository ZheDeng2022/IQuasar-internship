      To study the early safety and performance of the Shockwave Medical System in subjects to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the device can safely and effectively deliver localized energy for the&#xD;
      treatment of vascular disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Shockwave Medical, Inc. intends to conduct a prospective, single-arm, single-center, First in&#xD;
      Human study designed to evaluate the early safety and feasibility of the Shockwave&#xD;
      Lithoplasty System in subjects with heavily calcified infrainguinal arteries with 3.75mm to&#xD;
      6mm reference vessel diameter at target site. The Shockwave Lithoplasty System is indicated&#xD;
      to generate sonic shockwave energy within the target treatment site and disrupt calcium&#xD;
      within the lesion to allow for subsequent dilation of a peripheral artery stenosis using low&#xD;
      balloon pressure. Up to 10 subjects will be enrolled to undergo lihtoplasty.&#xD;
