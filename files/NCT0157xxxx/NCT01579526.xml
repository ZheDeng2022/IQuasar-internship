             by the Cockcroft-Gault equation (see section 7.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be using adequate birth control as&#xD;
             determined by the Investigator.&#xD;

          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test results at&#xD;
             screening and Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must be able to provide informed consent after risks and benefits have been&#xD;
             explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects must be non-smoking and non-tobacco user (defined as a subject who has not&#xD;
             smoked or used tobacco products for ≥ 12 months from study screening), and must agree&#xD;

             their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects must have a 12 lead ECG without any clinically significant abnormalities of&#xD;
             rate, rhythm, intervals or conduction, as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects are in generally good health, based on pre-study medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination and routine laboratory tests, as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who have no clinically significant disease and/or clinically significant&#xD;
             abnormal laboratory values as determined by the Investigator based on medical history,&#xD;
             physical examination, or laboratory evaluations conducted at the screening visit or on&#xD;
             admission to the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Be willing and able to comply with the study protocol requirements for the duration of&#xD;
             the study, including pharmacokinetic sampling&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Subjects who have participated in any investigational trial within 30 days or six&#xD;
             half-lives of the test drug's biologic activity, whichever is longer, before the start&#xD;
             of the study (time of first dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who have clinically significant medical or psychiatric illnesses currently or&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Subjects who have had symptoms of any significant acute illness including upper&#xD;
             respiratory infections within 30 days prior to the start of study (time of first&#xD;
             dose), as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;

             hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, or central nervous&#xD;
             system function; or any other conditions that might interfere with the absorption,&#xD;
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study drug, or that would place the&#xD;
             subject at increased risk, as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
