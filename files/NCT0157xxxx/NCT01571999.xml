      This study will assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of inhaled GSK573719 and&#xD;
      GSK573719/vilanterol combination in healthy subjects and in subjects with severe renal&#xD;
      impairment. The results of the study will provide guidance on the use of this product in&#xD;

      GSK573719 monotherapy and GSK573719/vilanterol combination are currently under development&#xD;
      for the treatment of COPD. This study will assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of inhaled&#xD;
      GSK573719 and GSK573719/vilanterol (VI) in healthy subjects and in subjects with severe renal&#xD;
      impairment. Nine subjects with severe renal impairment (as defined by a Clcr&lt;30mL/min) will&#xD;
      be recruited along with healthy control subjects (as defined by a Clcr&gt;80mL/min matched to&#xD;
      the severe renal impairment subjects based on gender, ethnicity, body mass index (±15%) and&#xD;
      age (±5 years)). The results from this study will provide guidance on the use of GSK573719&#xD;
      and GSK573719/VI in severe renally impaired patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who need to take any concomitant medication, either prescribed or overthe-&#xD;
             counter, which may in the opinion of the Investigator, interfere in any way with the&#xD;
