    <textblock>
      A single arm, single treatment study is proposed to assess the feasibility of the AP Platform&#xD;
      (cell phone + Control to Range system) outside of a hospital based clinical research center.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Automated closed-loop control (CLC) of blood glucose, known as &quot;artificial pancreas&quot; (AP) can&#xD;
      have tremendous impact on the health and lives of people with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). This&#xD;
      inter-institutional and international research team has been on the forefront of CLC&#xD;
      developments since the beginning of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF)&#xD;
      Artificial Pancreas initiative in 2006. Thus far, the investigators have conducted three&#xD;
      closed-loop control clinical trials (totaling 60 subjects with T1DM), which demonstrated&#xD;
      significantly more time in an acceptable &quot;target&quot; blood glucose range during CLC, and&#xD;
      significantly fewer hypoglycemic events during CLC compared to open loop. The overall&#xD;
      objective is to sequentially test, validate, obtain regulatory approval for, and deploy at&#xD;
      home, a closed-loop Control-to-Range (CTR) system comprised of two algorithmic components: a&#xD;
      Safety Supervision Module (SSM) and a Hypoglycemia Mitigation Module (HMM). The SSM will&#xD;
      monitor the safety of the subject's continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump (CSII) to&#xD;
      prevent hypoglycemia and will also monitor the integrity of continuous glucose monitor (CGM)&#xD;
      data for signal sensor deviations or loss of sensitivity. The HMM will be responsible for the&#xD;
      optimal regulation of postprandial hyperglycemic excursions through correction boluses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the ability of AP Platform to (1) run CTR in an outpatient setting, and&#xD;
      (2) be remotely monitored. Specifically, this study involves studying adults with T1DM who&#xD;
      are experienced insulin pump users. Subjects will spend two nights (~42 hours) in a local&#xD;
      hotel, during which the AP Platform will be remotely monitored in an adjacent hotel room for&#xD;
      validation that remote system monitoring can successfully occur. During the study, study&#xD;
      subjects will be responsible for operating the CTR system with nursing and technicians&#xD;
      available for additional support. A study physician and senior engineer will be on call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five subjects each will be enrolled at University of Virginia and the University of&#xD;
      California, Santa Barbara.&#xD;
