      The main purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) techniques in the detection and grading of liver fibrosis, so that the investigators&#xD;
      can reduce the need of invasive techniques such as liver biopsy and transjugular hepatic&#xD;
      venous portal pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements to assess the degree of liver scarring&#xD;
      and portal hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In chronic liver diseases of all aetiology, persistent hepatocyte injury leads to progressive&#xD;
      fibrosis and cirrhosis. In the UK, 76 adults per 100,000 population have cirrhosis and its&#xD;
      incidence is increasing (Fleming et al., J Hepatol 2008,49,p732-738). Currently, liver biopsy&#xD;
      is the only method of assessing the degree of fibrosis. However, liver biopsy is associated&#xD;
      with limitations such as sampling error, intra- and inter-observer variations in&#xD;
      interpretation and adverse events (Morbidity 1-5% and mortality between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in&#xD;
      10,000), hence considered a 'Silver (rather than Gold) standard'. Assessment of degree of&#xD;
      fibrosis is necessary to stage the disease process, determine the timing of intervention and&#xD;
      for prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of portal hypertension as a result of progressive fibrosis is a landmark in the&#xD;
      natural history of chronic liver diseases as it accounts for majority of complications and&#xD;
      clinical outcome. The degree of fibrosis and presence of portal hypertension will determine&#xD;
      whether patients are included in surveillance programmes for the early detection of varices&#xD;
      and hepatocellular carcinoma. As with assessment of the degree of fibrosis, the presence and&#xD;
      degree of portal hypertension can only be determined by transjugular hepatic venous portal&#xD;
      pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements, another investigation that is also hampered by access,&#xD;
      costs, risks and difficulty of serial measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of evolving techniques using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Talwalkar et al.,&#xD;
      Hepatology 2008; 47:332-42) if validated and established, have potential to replace liver&#xD;
      biopsy and HVPG measurements. The non-invasive nature of MRI, its ability to estimate amount&#xD;
      of accumulated fat (1H MR spectroscopy), cell membrane turnover (31P-MRS), iron&#xD;
      (relaxometry), fibrosis (MR elastography) as well as an ability to assess portal blood flow&#xD;
      and hepatic perfusion (Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL)) make it an ideal tool to evaluate liver&#xD;
      structure and function and to stage the liver disease. Most recently, MRI has seen&#xD;
      unprecedented developments in terms of accuracy of quantitation and speed of assessment,&#xD;
      which has been realised due to data-sharing ultra-fast MRI sequences, multispectral analysis,&#xD;
      and refinement of elastography methods. Validation of evolving MRI techniques against liver&#xD;
      biopsies, HVPG and metabolomics is a critical step prior to its translation into clinical&#xD;
      applications by the creation of MRI biomarkers.&#xD;
