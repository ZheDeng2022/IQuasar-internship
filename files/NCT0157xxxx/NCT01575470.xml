      The purpose of this study is to determine if bone marrow harvest, BMMNC separation, and&#xD;
      re-infusion in adults with acute severe TBI is safe and will improve functional outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12/09/2015 Update: The study is closed to new enrollment and all follow-up visits have been&#xD;
      completed. Data analysis is underway.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to 50% of all trauma deaths. The mortality rate for&#xD;
      adults following severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 9) is estimated to be 33%. There is&#xD;
      currently no therapy to reverse the primary injury associated with TBI. Over the past 10&#xD;
      years there has been a growing body of literature supporting the use of various progenitor&#xD;
      cell types to treat acute neurological injuries such as TBI and stroke. Neural stem cells&#xD;
      (adult and embryonic), mesenchymal stromal and multipotent adult progenitor cells, and bone&#xD;
      marrow mononuclear cells (from which MSC and MAPCs are derived) have all shown efficacy in&#xD;
      pre-clinical models of TBI/stroke through various mechanisms; however, few groups believe&#xD;
      that true neural replacement and integration are the putative mechanisms involved in the&#xD;
      observed efficacy. More likely is that the progenitor cell populations are modifying the&#xD;
      regional response to injury (inflammatory/reparative vs. regenerative), resulting in improved&#xD;
      functional outcomes. Our primary hypothesis is that bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMMNC)&#xD;
      autologous transplantation after TBI is safe (harvest and infusion related toxicity) after&#xD;
      TBI. Our secondary hypothesis is that functional outcomes measures will improve after BMMNC&#xD;
      infusion, (3) BMMNC infusion will reduce BBB permeability, (4) BMMNC is neuroprotective and&#xD;
      preserves grey matter and white matter volumes after TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, ages18 to 55 years old, admitted to Memorial Hermann Hospital Trauma Center with&#xD;
      Glasgow Coma Scores (GCS) of 5 to 8 will be screened. Those patients meeting&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria (or their Legal Authorized Representative [LAR]) will be offered&#xD;
      consent to participate. This is a dose-escalation study consisting of 4 cohorts including a&#xD;
      control group (5 subjects/cohort). The first five subjects will not undergo the bone marrow&#xD;
      harvest procedure; though they will be followed and treated the same as the other study&#xD;
      participants and complete all follow-up procedures. Subjects 6-10 will receive the lowest&#xD;
      dose target of 6X106 mononuclear cells/kilogram body weight. Subjects 11-15 will receive&#xD;
      9x106 mononuclear cells/kilogram body weight, and lastly Subjects 16-20 will receive 12X106&#xD;
      mononuclear cells/kilogram body weight. The study is NOT powered to detect functional&#xD;
      measures of efficacy. However, estimates can be made regarding potential treatment effect&#xD;
      sizes to allow rational power analyses for the follow-on Phase II study. This study should&#xD;
      determine if bone marrow harvest, BMMNC separation, and reinfusion is safe in adults with&#xD;
      acute, severe TBI.&#xD;
