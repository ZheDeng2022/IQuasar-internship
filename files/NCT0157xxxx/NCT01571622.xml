      The aim of the present study is to examine the therapeutic effect of whey protein concentrate&#xD;
      (WPC 80) in adult subjects with in type 2 diabetes. Whey protein will be administered before&#xD;
      breakfast and its effects on posprandial glucose, insulin, c-peptide, intact and total GIP&#xD;
      and GLP-1, and DPP-4 plasma levels will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Milk and dairy product consumption has been associated with lower risk of metabolic disorders&#xD;
      and cardiovascular diseases (1). A population-based prospective study (CARDIA) revealed that&#xD;
      dairy consumption was inversely associated with the prevalence of all components of the&#xD;
      insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) in overweight individuals (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whey accounts for about 20% of whole milk protein, while casein accounts for the rest. Whey&#xD;
      protein is a source of bioactive components and branch chained amino acids (BCAAs) which&#xD;
      could play a further role in the control of food intake and management of glucose metabolism,&#xD;
      obesity and diabetes (1,3,4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whey protein appears to have insulinotropic and glucose lowering properties in healthy adults&#xD;
      (6-9), and also in individuals with type 2 diabetes (10,11). The magnitude of postprandial&#xD;
      blood glucose reduction following ingestion of whey protein is comparable to that observed&#xD;
      with pharmaceutical interventions such as sulfonylureas (12) or nateglinide (13). These&#xD;
      findings imply an important role for whey protein in the management of type 2 diabetes (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whey protein seems to induce insulinotropic/β-cell-stimulating and glucose lowering effects&#xD;
      via bioactive peptides generated during gastrointestinal digestion of BCAAs contained in&#xD;
      β-lactoglobulin, the major whey protein (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These bioactive peptides stimulate the release of several gut hormones, especially the&#xD;
      incretins, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1&#xD;
      (GLP-1), which potentiate insulin secretion from β-cells and are also associated with the&#xD;
      control of food intake (9, 15-17). Increased plasma levels of GIP and GLP-1 have been&#xD;
      reported following whey ingestion in patients with type 2 diabetes (10). The stimulatory&#xD;
      effect of whey protein on GLP-1 is especially important since it has been shown that&#xD;
      postprandial GLP-1 secretion is reduced in type 2 diabetes (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bioactive peptides generated from whey protein may also serve as endogenous inhibitors of&#xD;
      dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) in the proximal gut, preventing incretin (GIP and GLP-1)&#xD;
      degradation (19, 20). Indeed, recently DPP-4 inhibitors have been found and identified in&#xD;
      Whey protein (21). All these may reduce postprandial blood glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incretin action is enhanced by whey protein ingestion, possibly through incretin degradation&#xD;
      via inhibition of DPP-4 (19,20). This is important in light of several incretin-based&#xD;
      therapies such as continuous administration of GLP-1 (19), treatment with&#xD;
      degradation-resistant GLP-1R agonists (Exendin-4) (15,23-25), and therapy with DPP-4&#xD;
      inhibitors (Sitagliptin, Liraglutide and others gliptines ) (15,23-27) all of which have lead&#xD;
      to substantial improvements in glucose control and β-cell function in subjects with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whey protein stimulates GLP-1 secretion and prevents its inactivation by DPP 4. Thus, by&#xD;
      potentiating GLP-1 secretion and enhancing its action, (15), whey protein may represent a&#xD;
      valuable tool for treating type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
