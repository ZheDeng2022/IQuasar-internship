    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Harriet Lane Clinic Healthy Futures Program is to increase academic or&#xD;
      workforce development success among adolescents and young adults. To this end, the Healthy&#xD;
      Futures educational intervention includes motivational interviewing and knowledge and skill&#xD;
      building activities that will focus on improving educational, vocational, health, and self&#xD;
      sufficiency outcomes for youth who attend the Harriet Lane Clinic. Goals of this youth&#xD;
      development project include determining what factors are associated with school engagement,&#xD;
      parental academic involvement, and future planning.&#xD;

      This is a feasibility study to examine if an intervention in a primary care setting can&#xD;
      recruit and retain adolescents and young adults and influence future planning behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will address the following research Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the feasibility of a career development program provided to low income&#xD;
           adolescents and young adults in a pediatric primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the receptiveness of adolescents and young adults in pediatric primary care&#xD;
           setting to future planning interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the impact of a career development program in improving educational,&#xD;
           workforce, and health attitudes and outcomes for adolescents and young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Healthy Futures Program is an interactive, multi-session training program. There will be&#xD;
      participants in 3 different intervention tracks (College/vocational school, Job, and Career&#xD;
      Planning). Tracks are assigned to participants based on interest and age. During the&#xD;
      screening process, participants who are 16 years old or older will be asked if they are&#xD;
      interested in participating in a program designed to help them apply to college or job&#xD;
      training services. Based on their preference, they will be assigned a college or job track.&#xD;
      Participants who are 14 and 15 years old will automatically be assigned to the career&#xD;
      planning track.&#xD;
