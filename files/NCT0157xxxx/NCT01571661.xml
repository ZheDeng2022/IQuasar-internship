  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, single dose escalation,&#xD;
      first-time-in-human, 5-way crossover study to assess the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of ascending doses of GSK189075A in healthy&#xD;
      subjects (Part A). Single doses will be given to 10 healthy subjects. The planned doses are&#xD;
      20mg, 50mg, 150mg, 500mg, and 1000mg. Each subject will receive 4 of the 5 active doses and a&#xD;
      placebo separated by a washout of 5-10 days. A second cohort of 6 subjects with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus will receive 2 active doses and a placebo along with oral glucose in a&#xD;
      three-way, randomised, placebo controlled, crossover design to assess glucose lowering&#xD;
      following GSK189075A administration (Part B). Blood samples will be taken throughout the&#xD;
      study day for pharmacokinetic analysis of prodrug and metabolites. Safety will be assessed by&#xD;
      measurement of blood glucose, blood pressure, heart rate, ECGs, laboratory safety screens,&#xD;
      and collection of adverse events.&#xD;
