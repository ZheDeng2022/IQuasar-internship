  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnesium accelerates the reaction of rocuronium, a neuromuscular blocker used for muscle&#xD;
      relaxation to ease the intubation during anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Succinylcholine is a very fast reacting neuromuscular blocker. It is often used in emergency&#xD;
      procedures, when rapid intubation is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to now if a perfusion of magnesium before anaesthesia accelerates to such an extent&#xD;
      the reaction of rocuronium that intubation conditions are comparable or even better than with&#xD;
      succinylcholine alone (prior perfusion of saline=placebo)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is the preferred method of endotracheal intubation in the&#xD;
      emergency setting. The aim of RSI is to achieve rapid unconsciousness and complete&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade which facilitates endotracheal intubation. RSI is of particular&#xD;
      importance in unfastened patients who are at risk of regurgitation and subsequent aspiration&#xD;
      of stomach contents into the lungs during induction of anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Still today, succinylcholine is the neuromuscular blocking agent of choice for RSI. However,&#xD;
      unfortunately in 60 at 80% the intubations conditions not are excellent and there are&#xD;
      contraindications for the usage of succinylcholine and numerous side effects. Thus there is a&#xD;
      need for alternative techniques that allow for rapid, high-quality and safe intubation&#xD;
      conditions. Magnesium has an impact on neuromuscular transmission; it reduces the amount of&#xD;
      acetylcholine that is released at the motor nerve terminal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that an IV infusion of magnesium sulphate prior to a standard intubation&#xD;
      dose of rocuronium enhanced the speed of onset of the neuromuscular block compared with&#xD;
      rocuronium alone by about 35% and there was much less variability in onset times. This makes&#xD;
      the combination magnesium-rocuronium a potentially interesting alternative to succinylcholine&#xD;
      for RSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators objective is to compare in surgical patients during a standardized RSI&#xD;
      procedure intubation conditions with rocuronium 0.6 mg kg-1 after pre-treatment with&#xD;
      intravenous MgSO4 60 mg kg-1 (experimental intervention) with succinylcholine 1 mg kg-1&#xD;
      (control intervention) and to quantify any minor or major adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators primary hypothesis is that with rocuronium 0.6 mg kg-1, after pre-treatment&#xD;
      with MgSO4 60 mg kg-1, the rate of excellent intubation conditions will be higher (80%)&#xD;
      compared with succinylcholine 1 mg kg-1 (60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two centre (Division of Anaesthesiology, Geneva University Hospitals and Division&#xD;
      of Anaesthesiology, University Hospital of Lausanne), stratified (male, female), randomized,&#xD;
      double blinded study including 280 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare in surgical patients during a standardized RSI procedure&#xD;
      intubation conditions with rocuronium 0.6 mg kg-1 after pre-treatment with intravenous MgSO4&#xD;
      60 mg kg-1 (experimental intervention) with succinylcholine 1 mg kg-1 (control intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intubation conditions will be evaluated by the intubating anaesthesiologist following&#xD;
      predefined criteria. The intubating anesthetist will not be present at study drug&#xD;
      administration to guarantee blinding. Only two intubating anaesthetists will be identified&#xD;
      per participating centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid sequence intubation is a cornerstone of daily anaesthetic practice and succinylcholine&#xD;
      is still the most frequently used neuromuscular agent in this context. In some patients,&#xD;
      succinylcholine is contraindicated and therefore alternatives to this very fast reacting&#xD;
      neuromuscular blocker are needed. If the investigators show that the investigators proposed&#xD;
      magnesium-rocuronium regimen provides better intubation conditions as succinylcholine, the&#xD;
      investigators study is likely to have an important impact on daily clinical practice.&#xD;
