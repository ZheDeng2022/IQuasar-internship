      The investigators aim to identify all clinical, biological, echo and imagistic parameters&#xD;
      that predispose to increased progression rates in a prospective observational trial which&#xD;
      will include ONLY patients with moderate AS, with the complete cardiological investigational&#xD;
      tools provided in 2012. Once those parameters are found, medical and interventional treatment&#xD;
      could be implemented to decrease the mortality rates.&#xD;

      1. Why this study? 1.1. Significance and difficulty of the problem being addressed. Aortic&#xD;
           stenosis is the most encountered valvular disease According to the 2007 ESC guidelines&#xD;
           (1), moderate aortic stenosis (AS) is defined as valve area 1.0-1.5 cm² (0.6 cm²/m² to&#xD;
           0.9 cm²/m² body surface area (BSA)) or mean aortic gradient of 30-50 mmHg in the&#xD;
           presence of normal flow conditions. We already know how to treat patients with severe&#xD;
           AS, symptomatic or not. On the contrary, in patients with moderate AS there is not a&#xD;
           clear agreement on what to do to reduce the excess mortality (detailed below). Why do&#xD;
           these patients die and what can we do to reduce mortality rates? 1.2. Originality of the&#xD;
           proposed solution and the appropriateness of the objectives. There are already some&#xD;
           progression factors in all spectrum of AS that have been highlighted (discussed below)&#xD;
           and which could influence mortality in this patient subgroup, but none of the studies&#xD;
           address exclusively to moderate AS. The majority of these studies have major&#xD;
           limitations, are not prospective, and even if some are, the parameters followed do not&#xD;
           cover the complete cardiological investigational tools (no 3D left ventricular (LV)&#xD;
           ejection fraction (EF), no strain, no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), etc.). As in any&#xD;
           major disease, lots of studies that include moderate AS are contradictory on the same&#xD;
           matter (see progression of AS). We aim to identify all clinical, biological, echo and&#xD;
           imagistic parameters that predispose to increased progression rates in a prospective&#xD;
           randomized trial which will include ONLY patients with moderate AS, with the&#xD;
           investigational tools provided in 2012. Once those parameters are found, medical and&#xD;
           interventional treatment could be implemented to decrease the mortality rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
           But first, some data about survival and death in moderate AS. I would like to start by&#xD;
           paraphrasing one of the most passionate researchers in the field of aortic stenosis, C.&#xD;
           Otto (2): &quot;even mild disease is important&quot; (referring of course at the outcomes of&#xD;
           patients with mild AS). Similarly, people with moderate AS/ aortic sclerosis, not even&#xD;
           mentioning moderate to severe AS (3) have an increased death rate in comparison to&#xD;
           age-matched healthy population. The same author reported in 1999 the results of a&#xD;
           prospective study (4) with a follow-up (FU) at 5 years and she observed a cardiac death&#xD;
           rate of 6.1% in general population (normal aortic valves), 10.1% in patients with aortic&#xD;
           sclerosis and 19.6% in patients with AS. In 2004 Rosenhek et al. (5) found a cardiac&#xD;
           death rate of 8.7% in a population with mean age of 67 years, with moderate AS at the&#xD;
           initial examination. Even though the largest study (6) evaluating medical treatment in&#xD;
           moderate AS reported a cardiac death rate of 6.0% (similar to general population), we&#xD;
           consider this study not eloquent because there was a super-selected population enrolled&#xD;
           (investigators ruled out the most important progression factors of AS: exclusion&#xD;
           criteria included history of coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke and diabetes mellitus&#xD;
           (DM)).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Trials involving patients with moderate AS. In this presentation we will not review or&#xD;
           discuss outcomes of severe AS, but ONLY outcomes of patients with MODERATE AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The first step in our research was the identification of all studies involving moderate&#xD;
           AS. We observed that there are few studies that included ONLY patients with moderate AS.&#xD;
           At the opposite, the large majority of studies included moderate AS among all spectrum&#xD;
           of AS patients (sclerosis, mild, moderate, severe- alone or combined). That is why we&#xD;
           categorized all previous studies regarding moderate AS by the baseline inclusion&#xD;
           criteria. We found 4 major groups of enrolled patients that we reviewed and discussed&#xD;
           below: patients with mild to moderate AS (Table 1) (5-10), patients with moderate AS&#xD;
           (Table 2)(11-12), patients with mild, moderate and severe AS (Table 3)(13-20) and&#xD;
           patients with moderate to severe AS (Table 4)(21-27).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Even though all essential data regarding moderate AS can be easily read in the tables&#xD;
           (patient characteristics, progression of moderate AS, outcomes, survival, limitations&#xD;
           and conclusions) and even though progression factors are summed-up below, of great&#xD;
           importance are the results of some echo studies recently published on which I would like&#xD;
           to briefly discuss. Monin et al. enrolled 107 patients with baseline peak velocity (PV)&#xD;
           of 3.5 to 4.4 m/s (26), he concluded that female sex, PV and brain natriuretic peptide&#xD;
           (BNP) at baseline were correlated with AS progression and developed a score to best&#xD;
           stratify outcomes in these patients (see Table 4 for limitations). Marechaux et al. (27)&#xD;
           included 135 patients with at least moderate AS (53% had severe AS), with normal stress&#xD;
           test at baseline. Increased progression was present in those with resting mean gradient&#xD;
           (MG) &gt;35 mmHg and exercise-induced increase in MG &gt;20 mmHg (see Table 4 for&#xD;
           limitations). Two studies tried to clarify the role of strain in AS. One of the studies&#xD;
           showed that strain gradually decreased as severity of AS increases and that global&#xD;
           longitudinal strain (GLS) might be useful to assess subtle changes in LV function in&#xD;
           patients with mild, moderate and severe AS (17). In the second study, Ng et al. (19)&#xD;
           found that longitudinal, radial and circumferential strain and strain rate (SR)&#xD;
           deteriorate with aortic valve disease progression. Important limitations of both studies&#xD;
           are found in Table 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Progression of AS. There is a wide variability in AS progression. Progression rates (for&#xD;
           the PV) begin from 0.15±0.01 m/s/y in population without cardiovascular risk factors (6)&#xD;
           and increase to 0.34±0.42 m/s/y in patients with CAD, reaching 0.45±0.38 m/s/y in&#xD;
           patients with cardiovascular events (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
           High progressors are those that have at least one abnormal parameter of the followings:&#xD;
           echocardiography parameters: baseline PV (3, 12, 5, 10, 16, 20, 26), baseline peak&#xD;
           gradient (24), mean gradient (3), rate of increase in PV (3, 20), moderate to severe&#xD;
           aortic valve calcification on echo (5, 12), LV hypertrophy (27), resting MG &gt;35 mmHg&#xD;
           (27), exercise-induced increase in MG &gt;20 mmHg (27), E velocity (16), bicuspid aortic&#xD;
           valve (16); clinical predictors: CAD (5, 21), age (&gt;80 years-8, 12, 18, 20, &gt;64&#xD;
           years-21, &gt;65years-27), diabetes (14, 27), metabolic syndrome (MS) (24), dialysis (28,&#xD;
           29), increased BMI (7), functional status (3), history of smoking (7, 30), systolic&#xD;
           blood pressure (SBP) (18, 30), male gender (24, 30), female gender (26); and biological&#xD;
           parameters: parathyroid hormone (PTH) level (18), BNP at baseline (26), high lipoprotein&#xD;
           (a) (Lp(a)) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (30).&#xD;
&#xD;
           No influence on AS progression were treatment with simvastatin and ezetimibe (6),&#xD;
           elprenone (25) or rosuvastatin (9) and statins (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Slower progression was observed after osteoporosis (11) and bisphosphonate treatment&#xD;
           (15), but studies were either too small, retrospective (11, 15) or biased (11).&#xD;
           Geographical differences are evident in two papers which show that Korean patients&#xD;
           progress slower than western population (12, 16).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data regarding the role of C-reactive protein in AS progression are controversial (10,&#xD;
           13).&#xD;
&#xD;
           We did not discuss the old studies or small series of patients with AS, some in the era&#xD;
           of cardiac catheterizations (31-36), some in the early echo decades (37-41). Their&#xD;
           capability to address this subject was limited by a retrospective design in most cases,&#xD;
           potential selection bias, limited clinical, functional, or exercise data, the&#xD;
           availability of only two data points per patient, lack of factors that predict the rate&#xD;
           of hemodynamic progression and clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Incidence of AS. Degenerative aortic valve disease evolves slowly from aortic sclerosis&#xD;
           to aortic stenosis. Aortic sclerosis and stenosis are found in about 29% and 2-9%&#xD;
           respectively in adults older than 65 years (4). In 5,201 subjects &gt; 65 years, aortic&#xD;
           valve sclerosis was present in 26% and AS in 2% of the entire study cohort; in subjects&#xD;
           &gt;75 years of age, sclerosis was present in 37% and stenosis in 2.6% (30). The prevalence&#xD;
           of critical AS was 2.9% in the group 75 to 86 years of age in another study (42). In an&#xD;
           observational study (43) which enrolled 953 subjects (aged 25-74 years), the overall&#xD;
           prevalence of degenerative aortic valve disease (defined as the presence of valvular&#xD;
           sclerosis, calcification, or thickening on echocardiographical examination) was 28%. The&#xD;
           prevalence of degenerative aortic valve disease by age groups was the following: 7%&#xD;
           (35-44 years), 19% (45-54), 30% (55-64), 38% (65-74) and 64% (75-84). There were no&#xD;
           significant differences between men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical factors associated with AS are similar to those associated with CAD (3, 44). Even&#xD;
      though several small non-randomized studies (45, 46-49) suggested a beneficial effect of&#xD;
      statins, three prospective randomized studies did not find any effect of lipid-lowering&#xD;
      therapy on the progression of aortic-valve stenosis.(6, 10, 50).&#xD;
