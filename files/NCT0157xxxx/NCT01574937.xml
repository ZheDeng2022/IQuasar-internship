  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of&#xD;
      an investigational drug. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the&#xD;
      investigational drug to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is&#xD;
      still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also&#xD;
      means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) may not have approved this drug for&#xD;
      use in participants, including people with your type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, we are testing the safety of XL184 at different dose levels. XL184 is&#xD;
      a new study drug, which is taken by mouth. Laboratory studies have shown that XL184 may&#xD;
      prevent tumor growth by stopping the formation of blood vessels inside the tumor and also&#xD;
      shrink tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This drug has been used in early-stage studies and is also currently being studied in other&#xD;
      trials. Information from those other research studies suggests that XL184 may help to slow or&#xD;
      stop tumor growth including prostate cancer. We will also be taking blood and urine tests to&#xD;
      look at how your body processes the drug.&#xD;

      The following procedures will be performed during this study. On Day 1 for every cycle (28&#xD;
      days/4 weeks)-The following will be undertaken prior to initiating study therapy and on day 1&#xD;
      of every subsequent cycle: A medical history, physical exam, performance status, blood tests,&#xD;
      urine test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since we are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered safely&#xD;
      without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants, not everyone who participates in&#xD;
      this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose you get will&#xD;
      depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study before you and how&#xD;
      well they have tolerated their doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will actively monitor your condition for up to 30 days after you come off the study. If&#xD;
      you come off study for a side effect we will monitor your condition until the resolution or&#xD;
      stabilization of the side effect&#xD;
