  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular Targeted Photodynamic therapy (VTP) with the Vascular Occluding Agent (VOA) WST11,&#xD;
      may offer an alternative, providing tumour destruction via a minimally invasive approach. In&#xD;
      this investigation, the investigators plan to use the WST11 VTP procedure to treat a&#xD;
      predetermined small renal tumour targets. Patients will be given a general anaesthetic, to&#xD;
      ensure immobility, and prevent discomfort during treatment sessions. Treated patients will&#xD;
      then undergo surgical resection of their tumours, and the accuracy and reliability of tissue&#xD;
      death with VTP will be assessed histologically. The aim of this proof of concept study is to&#xD;
      demonstrate whether this modality has potential for a clinical role in the treatment of&#xD;
      oncological kidney disease, either as an alternative to surgery, or where surgery is not&#xD;
      feasible.&#xD;

    <description>WST11-mediated VTP will consist of the combination of a single IV administration of WST11 at doses of 2 mg/kg, or 4mg/kg using 753 nm laser light at a fixed power (150 mW/cm) and energy (200 J/cm) delivered through percutaneous optical fibres. The fibres are introduced into transparent needles that are positioned in the areas of interest under CT image guidance. After a minimum of 3 patients at each drug dosage (2 &amp; 4 mg/kg) has been treated with a light energy of 200 J/cm, the general and local safety will be assessed. The safety results of the first 3 patients treated in each drug dose/number of fibres combination will be reviewed by the investigators prior to escalation to a higher drug dose/number of fibres combination.</description>
