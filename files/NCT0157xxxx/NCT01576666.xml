  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum dose of LDE225 and BKM120 that can be&#xD;
      safely given together to patients and/or the dose that will be used in future studies. This&#xD;
      study will also learn more about how the combination of these two investigational drugs may&#xD;
      work for patients with certain cancers (specifically metastatic breast cancer, advanced&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma, metastatic colorectal cancer and recurrent glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine a combination maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of LDE225 and BKM120 when co-administered orally&#xD;
      in patients with advanced solid tumors. Adult patients, aged &gt; 18 years with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors that have progressed despite standard therapy or for which no standard therapies exist&#xD;
      will be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose escalation part of the study, four groups of patients with the following tumor&#xD;
      types will be enrolled: recurrent GBM, metastatic breast cancer, metastatic CRC and advanced&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma. It is anticipated that approximately 45 patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the dose escalation part. Approximately 15 GBM patients (maximum of 2 patients per dose&#xD;
      level) will be enrolled to previously well-tolerated doses during dose escalation if no slot&#xD;
      is available in a cohort under active testing. In the dose expansion part of the study, five&#xD;
      groups of patients (approximately 15 patients per group) with the following tumor types will&#xD;
      be enrolled: recurrent GBM, triple negative metastatic breast cancer, hormone receptor&#xD;
      positive (ER+/PR+, and Her2-) metastatic breast cancer, gastric/gastroesophageal junction&#xD;
      cancer, and a combined maximum of 15 patients with metastatic CRC or advanced pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma. The dose expansion will enroll approximately 75 patients. Accounting for&#xD;
      patients who may withdraw or who may not meet the eligibility criteria, it is expected that&#xD;
      this study will enroll approximately 120 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose finding, phase Ib study to determine the MTD and/or&#xD;
      RDE for the combination of LDE225 plus BKM120, followed by an expansion part to further&#xD;
      assess safety and preliminary efficacy of the combination in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors that are frequently associated with dysregulated Hh and/or PI3K pathways, specifically&#xD;
      triple negative metastatic breast cancer, hormone receptor positive (ER+/PR+, and Her2-)&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer, advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, metastatic CRC, recurrent GBM&#xD;
      and gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer patients. Patients will be treated daily on&#xD;
      28-day cycles. Dose escalation will be dependent on the available toxicity information&#xD;
      (including adverse events that are not DLTs), PK, PD, and efficacy information, as well as&#xD;
      the recommendations from the Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM).&#xD;
