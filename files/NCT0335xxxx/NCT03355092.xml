  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overall aim: To demonstrate that weight loss through vBloc Therapy in combination with usual&#xD;
      care will achieve better glycemic control for patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes than&#xD;
      usual care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: Participants will be asked to participate in a 12 month study that involves a&#xD;
      baseline visit and research follow-up visits at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 60 participants will be enrolled in the study. Of these, 30 will be randomized&#xD;
      to vBloc therapy and 30 will be randomized to usual care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vBlocT2D study is a two arm, randomized, controlled, unblinded clinical trial in which 60&#xD;
      adult patients with T2D with moderate to extreme obesity (BMI 35-45 kg/m2) and suboptimal&#xD;
      glycemic control (glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 7-10%) without significant diabetic&#xD;
      complications, will be randomized to usual care alone (n=30) or vBloc therapy plus usual care&#xD;
      (n=30) to assess the superiority of vBloc therapy plus usual care than standard usual care&#xD;
      alone in improving diabetic control. The vBloc therapy will be delivered through an&#xD;
      electrical and reversible vagal blocking device (the Maestro Rechargeable System) implanted&#xD;
      using laparoscopic surgery. The device was approved by the FDA in 2015 for weight loss in&#xD;
      adults with BMI 40-45 kg/m2, or BMI 35-39.9 kg/m2 with one or more obesity-related co-morbid&#xD;
      conditions. The study will recruit patients over a 12-month period and follow each individual&#xD;
      for 12-months post intervention. The primary outcome is change in HbA1c at 12-months post&#xD;
      randomization. The secondary outcomes are changes in weight, waist and hip circumferences,&#xD;
      blood pressure, lipids, insulin sensitivity and β-cell health measured through oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance testing, dietary intake, eating behaviors, physical activity, quality of life and&#xD;
      potential circulating biomarkers. Medication use, clinical labs and adverse events will be&#xD;
      compared as well.&#xD;

    <description>The vBloc device will be placed using a laparoscopic procedure. The participants will be followed according to standard clinical practice and vBloc therapy protocol under the supervision of study surgeons. . Pre-operative testing will be conducted per surgeon's evaluation. Participants will receive weight management education according to the vBloc Therapy protocol.</description>
