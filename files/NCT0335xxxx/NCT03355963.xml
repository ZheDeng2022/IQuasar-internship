  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      purpose: The aim of this study is to compare the safety, efficacy and durability of different&#xD;
      doses of BTX-A (50 and 100 unit) in the treatment of Vasculogenic Erectile Dysfunction after&#xD;
      failure of other ICI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: This study will be conducted on 200 patients diagnosed as vascular&#xD;
      erectile dysfunction by penile color Doppler not responding to medical and injection therapy&#xD;
      presenting to Urology department and outpatient clinic at Benha University Hospital,&#xD;
      Andrology, Sexology &amp; STD's outpatient clinic, Kasr El Aini Hospitals, Cairo&#xD;
      University.(multicentric study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A- Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age between 40 to 70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vascular ED proved by penile duplex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unable to develop erections sufficient for intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A &quot;No&quot; response on Sexual encounter profile questions (SEP 2 &amp; 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failing to respond to first line and second line treatments for Erectile Dysfunction&#xD;
           with surgery as the only remaining treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant cardiovascular disease interfering with sexual activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any history of an unstable medical or psychiatric condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any presence of penile anatomical abnormalities (e.g. penile fibrosis) that would&#xD;
           significantly impair erectile function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      patients will be simply randomized into 3 equal groups, one control group and two treatment&#xD;
      groups. Ethics committee approval and informed consent were obtained.&#xD;

      introduction: Evidence has been arising suggesting that Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A)&#xD;
      injections can relax smooth muscles fibers in the treatment of obesity and Detrusor muscle&#xD;
      over-activity, similar effect on cavernosal smooth muscles would help in the treatment of&#xD;
      erectile dysfunction (ED) resistant to oral and intracavernous (IC) therapy, thus avoiding&#xD;
      surgical treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      patient and methods: All patients will perform penile color Doppler evaluation to confirm a&#xD;
      vascular etiology, a trimix solution (PGE1 10 ug + Phentolamine 1 mg + Papaverine 30 mg) was&#xD;
      injected IC during the penile Doppler study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group: received an IC 1 ml saline injection one day after the penile&#xD;
      Doppler/trimix test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment group B: received a single IC injection of BTX-A 50 units one day after the&#xD;
      penile Doppler/trimix test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment group C: received a single IC injection of BTX-A 100 units one day after the&#xD;
      penile Doppler/trimix test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment for all groups was done by penile color Doppler exam, Sexual Health Inventory for&#xD;
      men (SHIM), Sexual Encounter Profile questions 2 and 3 (SEP 2 &amp; SEP 3), and the global&#xD;
      assessment question (GAQ) were completed pre-treatment and 2 weeks after treatment also, 3&#xD;
      and 6 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 1 day after the penile color Doppler test, the patient is placed in the supine&#xD;
      position flaccid and stretched penile length and girth would be measured from tip of the&#xD;
      penis to the pubic bone will be done. A rubber band will be applied to the base of the penis.&#xD;
      The skin will be prepped with alcohol swabs followed by the IC injection of 50 units of BTX-A&#xD;
      for patients in treatment group B and 100 units of BTX-A for patients in treatment group C&#xD;
      with direct pressure will be applied for 2 minutes. The rubber band will be removed after 15&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and controls will fill the Sexual Health Inventory for men (SHIM) questionnaire and&#xD;
      answer the ,Sexual Encounter Profile questions 2 and 3 (SEP 2 &amp; SEP 3), and the global&#xD;
      assessment question (GAQ) before and 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after treatment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rational for selecting the minimum 2-weeks waiting period is to give a chance for the&#xD;
      BTX-A to reach its maximum effect. Possible Risks include pain and prolonged erections, also&#xD;
      3 months and 6 months after treatment do detect safety, efficacy and durability.&#xD;
