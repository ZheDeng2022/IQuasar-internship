  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical efficacy of directional DBS&#xD;
      electrode technology and whether electrophysiology biomarkers can predict effective contact&#xD;
      segments for chronic therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) can be remarkable for treating symptoms of Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease, improvement varies across clinical trials, individual patients, and over time. A&#xD;
      major limitation to the advancement of DBS therapy is that there are no established&#xD;
      biomarkers to tailor stimulator settings in individuals. Emerging segmented (&quot;directional&quot;)&#xD;
      lead technology allows current steering, a new opportunity to improve tolerability and&#xD;
      efficacy by shaping the DBS electrical field. This novel lead design has 8 contacts rather&#xD;
      than the 4 available with currently available leads. How do the investigators optimally&#xD;
      adjust stimulation parameters when there are far more potentially useful settings than can be&#xD;
      practically evaluated in clinic? How do the investigators know that DBS settings in a given&#xD;
      patient are optimal or appropriate? The investigators have pioneered minimally invasive,&#xD;
      rapidly acquired biomarkers to solve these important problems. Using electrocorticography,&#xD;
      electroencephalography, and subcortical local field potentials, the investigators will&#xD;
      measure whether resting or stimulus-evoked electrophysiology can serve as a predictive&#xD;
      biomarker to guide activation and adjustment of a directional DBS system. The purpose of this&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind crossover study is to measure the clinical efficacy of directional&#xD;
      versus omnidirectional stimulation and to explore whether electrophysiology biomarkers can&#xD;
      rapidly predict effective, well-tolerated contacts for directional DBS therapy.&#xD;
