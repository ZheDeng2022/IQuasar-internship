  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over Study designed&#xD;
      to determine the efficacy of multiple intrathecal administrations of autologous mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (MSC-NP) compared to placebo in patients with&#xD;
      progressive multiple sclerosis. Efficacy will be measured through assessment of disability&#xD;
      outcomes. Study participants will receive six intrathecal injections of culture-expanded&#xD;
      autologous MSC-NPs at two month intervals in one year and six lumbar punctures as placebo&#xD;
      treatments in a second year.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The IT-MSC-NP treatments and all clinical assessments will take place at a single center&#xD;
      (Tisch MSRCNY). Study subjects will be assigned to blocks stratified by baseline EDSS score&#xD;
      (3.0-4.0, 4.5-5.5, 6.0, and 6.5) and disease subtype (SPMS or PPMS). Study subjects are&#xD;
      randomized in an equal fashion (1:1) to study treatment and placebo at initial randomization.&#xD;
      Subjects in each block will be randomized into placebo or treatment group. In the second&#xD;
      year, treated subjects will cross over to the placebo group and placebo subjects will cross&#xD;
      over to the treated group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total study duration will be 3 years upon enrollment. Each study subject will be required&#xD;
      to attend up to 18 study visits, to include 1 screening visit, 1 bone marrow visit, 1&#xD;
      baseline visit, followed by study visits every 2 months during the treatment period of two&#xD;
      years (12 treatment/LP procedure visits and 2 outcome visits), and an additional follow-up&#xD;
      visit at the end of year 3.&#xD;

    <description>MSC-NPs represent a neural subpopulation of MSCs from bone marrow with reduced pluripotency and minimized risk of ectopic differentiation, thus are likely to be more suitable for CNS delivery. Importantly, characterization of MSC-NPs demonstrated their immunoregulatory and trophic properties, and MSC-NPs derived from MS and non-MS patients alike were therapeutically viable.</description>
