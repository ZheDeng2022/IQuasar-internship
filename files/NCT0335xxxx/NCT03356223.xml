  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is an open-label, single arm, Phase II study using an A'Hern single stage design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The molecular prescreening step will allow to defined HPV tumor status as well as molecular&#xD;
      status CDKN2A, CCND1 and CDK6. Following this centralized molecular screening, only patients&#xD;
      with HPV negative status and with tumor harboring CDKN2A homozygous deletion and/or CCND1&#xD;
      amplification and/or CDK6 amplification could initiate abemaciclib at time of documented&#xD;
      radiological progression. Patients will be treated with ABEMACICLIB, 400 mg/day with 2 doses&#xD;
      of 200 mg 12 hour apart (QH12). A cycle is defined as an interval of 28 days. For each 28-day&#xD;
      cycle, a total of 56 doses of study drug will be dispensed.&#xD;

      SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION The primary endpoint is the non-progression rate (CR, PR, SD as per&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1) after 8 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation was based on an A'Hern single stage phase II design, with a&#xD;
      minimum success (non- progression) rate considered of interest of p1=40% and an uninteresting&#xD;
      rate of p0=15%. Assuming a type I error alpha of 0.05 and 85% power, 23 patients are needed&#xD;
      to reject the null hypothesis H0: p&lt;=p0 vs the alternative hypothesis H1: p ≥ p1 in a&#xD;
      unilateral situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the assumption that 10% of the patients may be non-evaluable, 25 patients will be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ENTRY AND DATA MANAGEMENT All the data concerning the patients will be recorded in the&#xD;
      eCRF throughout the study. SAE reporting will be paper-based by Fax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will perform the study monitoring and will help the investigators to conduct the&#xD;
      study in compliance with the clinical trial protocol, Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and local&#xD;
      low requirements.&#xD;
