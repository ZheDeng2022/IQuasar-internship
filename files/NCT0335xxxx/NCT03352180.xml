      Do concomitant subscapularis tears in large to massive rotator cuff tears affect&#xD;
      postoperative functional and structural outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subscarpularis tendon is essential force maintaining normal glenohumeral biomechanics.&#xD;
      However, there are few studies which have addressed the outcomes of tears extending to the&#xD;
      subscapularis tendon in massive rotator cuff tears. The purpose of this study was to assess&#xD;
      the clinical and structural outcomes of arthroscopic reapair of massive rotator cuff tears&#xD;
      involving the subscapulrais.&#xD;

      MATRALS AND METHODS This retrospective comparative study was approved by our institutional&#xD;
      review board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection This study targeted patients who had undergone arthroscopic rotator cuff&#xD;
      repair, which was performed by a single surgeon in our institution between January 2010 and&#xD;
      January 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) a full-thickness superoposterior rotator cuff&#xD;
      tear larger than 5 cm(19) or complete superoposterior rotator cuff tear(24) identified on&#xD;
      preoperative MRI and intra operative arthroscopic findings, (2) a follow-up MRI evaluation at&#xD;
      6 months after surgery, and (3) a clinical assessment performed a minimum 2 years&#xD;
      postoperatively. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) small, medium, or large&#xD;
      tears(21); (2) a partial-thickness tear; (3) an isolated subscapularis tear; (4) failure of&#xD;
      subscapularis repair at the time of the index procedure; (5) previous rotator cuff surgery of&#xD;
      the affected shoulder; (6) concomitant surgery for glenohumeral joint instability or other&#xD;
      bony procedure; and (7) substantial glenohumeral arthritis (Hamada classification29 grade 4)&#xD;
      or inflammatory arthropathy of the affected shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tear Classification Rotator cuff tear patterns were classified into the following 3&#xD;
      categories according to the tear size of the subscapularis tendon on preoperative MRI:&#xD;
      I-massive tear, intact subscapularis tendon; S-massive tear, tear involving half or less than&#xD;
      half of the subscapularis tendon; and L-massive tear, tear extending to more than half of the&#xD;
      subscapularis tendon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Assessments Clinical data were recorded on the day before surgery and at final&#xD;
      follow-up (at least 24 months postoperatively) by fellowship trainees. Four outcome measures&#xD;
      were used in this study: VAS pain score, ASES score, Constant score, and active shoulder ROM.&#xD;
      The ASES score involves a score summation using a 100-point system (50 points for daily&#xD;
      function and 50 points for pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic Evaluation A standard set of plain radiographs was obtained as follows:&#xD;
      anteroposterior (AP) views in internal rotation and external rotation, supraspinatus outlet&#xD;
      view, axillary view, and Rockwood view (30 caudally angled AP view). We evaluated fatty&#xD;
      degeneration of the rotator cuff muscle preoperatively with MRI, using the 5-stage grading&#xD;
      system27: grade 0, no fatty deposit; grade 1, some fatty streaks; grade 2, more muscle than&#xD;
      fat; grade 3, as much muscle as fat; and grade 4, less muscle than fat. The integrity of&#xD;
      rotator cuff repair was determined by ultrasonographic evaluation. All patients underwent a&#xD;
      postoperative ultrasonographic examination at 4.5 months and 12 months or later after&#xD;
      surgery. One specialized radiologist with more than 10 years of experience in musculoskeletal&#xD;
      ultrasonography performed all follow-up examinations using an HDI 5000 system or an IU-22&#xD;
      system (both from Philips Healthcare). He did not receive any information on intraoperative&#xD;
      findings and subsequent operative procedures. An ultrasonographic evaluation of the rotator&#xD;
      cuff was performed according to the standard protocol.42 The ultrasound criteria for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of full-thickness rotator cuff tears were as follows5,54: (1) absence of&#xD;
      observation of the supraspinatus tendon attributable to retraction under the&#xD;
      acromioclavicular joint; (2) localized absence or focal discontinuity of the rotator cuff&#xD;
      with concomitant loss of the normal anterior arc of the subdeltoid bursa; (3) loss of the&#xD;
      normal supraspinatus substance with widening of the gap between the supraspinatus and biceps&#xD;
      tendons, including exposure of a bare area of bone and cartilage; (4) a hypoechoic or&#xD;
      anechoic cleft extending through the entire substance of the rotator cuff; and (5)&#xD;
      coexistence of fluid in the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa and/or presence of fluid in the&#xD;
      sheath of the long head of the biceps tendon. Partialthickness tears were diagnosed based on&#xD;
      the presence of a focal hypoechoic or anechoic defect in the tendon, involving either the&#xD;
      bursal or articular surface and manifesting in 2 perpendicular planes.54&#xD;

    <description>The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.</description>
