  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate the feasibility of implementing a low-intensity,&#xD;
      patient-centered activity regimen (PCAR) that prioritizes education and communication over a&#xD;
      12-week period in advanced stage lung cancer patients. The primary outcomes will include&#xD;
      number of patients increasing their overall step count over the study period and adherence to&#xD;
      step count recommendations. Secondary outcomes will include quality of life (QoL), dyspnea,&#xD;
      and depression scores before and after the intervention as well as a patient feedback&#xD;
      questionnaire (to guide further interventions). The goals are to increase overall step count&#xD;
      and obtain adherence of &gt;50% of participants. The investigators will also assess whether the&#xD;
      physical activity regimen influences markers of inflammation and glucose control and novel&#xD;
      markers of cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Exercise Adherence will be defined as (the number of weeks a subject follows the activity prescription)/(the number of &quot;usable&quot; weeks). A week is considered &quot;usable&quot; if 5/7 days of step counts are available, and days with &lt;200 steps/day are considered not usable.</description>

    <time_frame>change from pre- to post-intervention (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via self-report using the Patient Health Questionnaire, Depression Module (PHQ-9). a 9-item questionnaire that assesses depressive symptoms over the preceding two weeks. Each item is scored 0-3 (0 = &quot;Not at all&quot;; 1 = &quot;Several days&quot;; 2 = &quot;More than half of days&quot;; 3 = &quot;Nearly every day&quot;). A total score is calculated by taking the sum of questions 1-9, and a higher score indicates worse depression.</description>
