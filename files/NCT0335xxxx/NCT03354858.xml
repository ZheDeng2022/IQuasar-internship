    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective observational paired study on the effect of follicular flushing&#xD;
      oocyte recovery rate, oocyte maturity, fertilization rate, and embryo development and&#xD;
      utilization as compared to direct aspiration (no flushing) in women undergoing IVF treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each woman enrolled, one ovary (right or left) will be randomly assigned to be aspirated&#xD;
      with either follicular flushing or direct aspiration without flushing. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      will be oocyte recovery rate (oocytes retrieved per follicle aspirated). Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will be oocyte maturity, fertilization rate, and embryo development and utilization.&#xD;
      Pregnancy rates will be reported as a surrogate outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSVAGINAL OOCYTE COLLECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following controlled ovarian stimulation (COS), final oocyte maturation is triggered using&#xD;
      hCG or triptorelin. Oocyte collection is performed 35-36 hours post triggering. The procedure&#xD;
      involves transvaginal ultradound-guided aspiration of follicles via a double lumen aspiration&#xD;
      needle (16G, Casmed),. An interdisciplinary team is required for the procedure, including&#xD;
      Gynaecologists, Embryologists Midwives/Nurses and Anaesthetists. It is performed in a&#xD;
      gynaecological operating theatre, adjacent to an embryology laboratory, with the patient&#xD;
      being sedated and under aseptic conditions and strict regulation of environmental conditions&#xD;
      to ensure oocyte viability and patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the procedure The day before the procedure, the embryologist prepares culture dishes&#xD;
      (Falcon Central Well dishes) containing bicarbonate buffered media specifically designed for&#xD;
      oocyte culture (Fert, Origio) overlaid with mineral oil (Fertipro). The dishes are placed in&#xD;
      a 5-7% CO2 incubator at 37oC to equilibrate overnight. Aliquots of HEPES buffered media&#xD;
      (Flushing medium, Origio) which achieves pH regulation outside of the incubator is pre-heated&#xD;
      to 37oC. Finally, 160 ml flasks of DPBS (phosphate buffered saline) for use in follicular&#xD;
      flushing are placed in the theatre's incubator for pre-warming. All the embryological&#xD;
      preparation is performed aseptically under a laminar flow hood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure utilises surgical equipment which is autoclaved and packagedd in sterile&#xD;
      surgical cloths. All materials that come into contact with follicular fluid, such as oocyte&#xD;
      needles, 20ml syringes (non toxic, BD) and collection tubes (14ml IVF tubes, NUNC), are IVF&#xD;
      tested via MEA testing (mouse blastocyst survival), pre-sterilised and single use. These are&#xD;
      stored prior to use in a 37oC warming chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We use a 16G double lumen needle (Casmed, UK) which allows continuous aspiration and flushing&#xD;
      of follicles. The needle has a length of 30 cm and echogenic markings near the tip for easy&#xD;
      recognition under transvaginal ultrasound guidance. The length of the tubing is 60cm and&#xD;
      includes a bung for connection to a standard test tube and separate tubing with a Luer-lock&#xD;
      for connection to a syringe for flushing. The needle and its connections are all manufactured&#xD;
      from high grade surgical stainless steel. The tubing is manufactured from translucent PTFE&#xD;
      (Polytetrafluoroethylene).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All products are manufactured in accordance with quality standards ISO 9001:2008, ISO 13485&#xD;
      and CE marking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparing for the procedure Patient Preparation Before entering the operating theatre, the&#xD;
      anaesthesiologist confirms the patient's medical history pertinent to her imminent&#xD;
      anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is escorted to the operating theatre and her identity is confirmed by two&#xD;
      persons, who sign the witnessing document. In patients with very few expected oocytes (poor&#xD;
      responders, mild IVF or natural cycles) a transvaginal ultrasound is performed just prior to&#xD;
      the procedure by the treating physician in order to confirm the presence and location of&#xD;
      mature follicles. In cases of high risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, a blood sample&#xD;
      is also taken, according to our standard clinical practice as previously described (Lainas et&#xD;
      al., 2012, 2013, 2014). The procedure followed for the preparation of the patient is the same&#xD;
      as that of most gynaecological surgeries. The patient is laid on the operating table in the&#xD;
      lithotomy position and her external genitalia are washed with hibitane solution (which is&#xD;
      considered milder than using betadine scrub) and then rinsed with saline. After performing a&#xD;
      standard hand and arm scrub, the surgeon's assistant wears surgical gloves and opens the&#xD;
      sterilised tool packages, including pre-warmed and sterilised tube blocks, which is placed on&#xD;
      sterilised surgical paper towels within a heating stage. Sterilised collection tubes are&#xD;
      placed in the heating block, for use during the procedure. If during the procedure more tubes&#xD;
      are required the assisting nurse should aseptically place more tubes in the heating block.&#xD;
      The patient is then covered with sterilised surgical towels on the body and legs.The probe of&#xD;
      the ultrasound is disinfected with CIDEX for 5 minutes and then washed with copious amounts&#xD;
      of water for injection. Following insertion of a vaginal dilator, the vagina is washed with&#xD;
      DPBS up to the cervical os. The assistant then wears new surgical gloves and gown and covers&#xD;
      the patient with additional sterilised surgical paper drapes The pre-sterilised oocyte needle&#xD;
      guide is opened and it and the flushing syringes are washed with DPBS. One syringe is&#xD;
      carefully filled with DPBS, which will be used to flush the needle and then discarded. The&#xD;
      ultrasound probe is then aseptically placed on the patient's drapes, the needle guide is&#xD;
      attached to it and the probe is finally connected to the ultrasound central unit. A&#xD;
      pre-warmed 16 G double lumen oocyte collection needle is opened and the aspiration pump is&#xD;
      set to 250 mmHG. The needle's various tubing connectors are connected to: a) the aspiration&#xD;
      pump, b) the flushing syringe, c) the first oocyte collection tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon performs a standard hand and arm scrub, wears a surgical gown and surgical gloves&#xD;
      before assuming the surgical position at the surgical table. The needle and its tubing are&#xD;
      washed by flushing with warm DPBS before use and the first collection tube is discarded. This&#xD;
      ensures that the entirety of the needle/tubing is filled with DPBS before puncturing the&#xD;
      follicle. The anaesthesiologist sedates the patient and monitors her breathing and heart&#xD;
      function throughout the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embryological Laboratory Preparation The entire embryological procedure is performed under a&#xD;
      laminar flow hood, with a heated stage set at 40oC in order to endure a dish temperature of&#xD;
      37+/-0.2 oC. The embryologist prepares central well culture dishes with HEPES media. Empty&#xD;
      pre-heated round dishes, heat-polished glass Pasteur pipettes and an empty container for&#xD;
      discarded follicular fluid are all placed on the heated workbench. All of the above should be&#xD;
      clearly labelled with the patients details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physician places the oocyte collection needle into the guide and then attaches it to the&#xD;
      transvaginal probe of the ultrasound. He then performs an ultrasound estimation of the&#xD;
      ovaries and Douglas pouch. After he has located the follicles, he punctures the vaginal wall&#xD;
      with the needle at a point adjacent to the first ovary and proceeds to aspirate all antral&#xD;
      follicles. larger than (...mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As each follicle is aspirated, the fluid is collected in the tube and the surgeon's assistant&#xD;
      replaces it with a new tube from the heated stage. A nurse takes the filled tube and&#xD;
      estimates its volume based on a volumetrically marked &quot;reference&quot; tube. The volumetric&#xD;
      estimation is based on a series of tubes of known volume. The tube is then quickly placed in&#xD;
      the heating block within the embryological laboratory (via the connecting window). Tubes are&#xD;
      placed from left to right on the heating block, with the leftmost spot being reserved for&#xD;
      fluids from newly aspirated follicles and the rightmost positions for tubes containing&#xD;
      flushed follicular fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The embryologist takes the tube and carefully pours the contents of each tube into the dish.&#xD;
      He then searches for the Cumulus-Oocyte Complex (COC) through his microscope. The results of&#xD;
      this search are communicated to the physician and fall into three categories: a) COC found,&#xD;
      b) COC not found but follicle cells present, c) COC not found and no follicle cells present.&#xD;
      When the COC is found, the physician moves on to the next follicle, while the embryologist&#xD;
      transfers it to the moat of the collection dish and thoroughly washes it, before moving it to&#xD;
      the central well. If the COC is not found, the physician then proceeds to flush DPBS into the&#xD;
      follicle via the syringe. The volume flushed should not exceed 50% of the initial volume of&#xD;
      the follicle to avoid rupturing it, which may cause haemorrhaging of the follicle. The&#xD;
      flushed fluid is then aspirated and the procedure is repeated as described above. This&#xD;
      process is repeated until the COC is found or 4-5 flushes are performed. When the flushing&#xD;
      syringe runs out of DPBS it is replaced with a new one which has been carefully and&#xD;
      aseptically filled just prior to use (no more than 2 minutes prior to use, in order for the&#xD;
      temperature to not drop significantly).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the procedure continues, COCs are placed by the embryologist in the collection dish until&#xD;
      a maximum of 10 are collected. A new dish should be used for additional COCs. Following the&#xD;
      end of the oocyte collection, the oocytes are transferred to dishes containing Fert medium&#xD;
      and placed in the incubator. After the embryologist has ensured that all tubes have been&#xD;
      searched he informs the physician of the final number of oocytes retrieved. Before ending the&#xD;
      procedure the physician scans the ovaries and Douglas pouch one last time and if excess fluid&#xD;
      is detected, he aspirates as much as possible. Finally the physician removes the needle and&#xD;
      probe and ensures that there is no vaginal bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors contributing to successful oocyte retrieval&#xD;
&#xD;
      A transvaginal oocyte retrieval is a complicated procedure with many variables that need to&#xD;
      be accounted for in order to make it successful. Side effects from the operation can be&#xD;
      affected by the length of the procedure, the skill of the physician and the type of needle&#xD;
      used. The length of the procedure is primarily affected by the number of oocytes collected&#xD;
      and the ease that these were collected. Procedures that include flushing of follicles are on&#xD;
      average longer than those without flushing. The width of the needle (gauge) directly affects&#xD;
      the level of vaginal bleeding and the level of pain the patient experiences due to the&#xD;
      operation. The above variables (flushing and width of needle) have been proposed as major&#xD;
      factors for the effectiveness of the oocyte collection, i.e. the number of oocytes retrieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follicular flushing Flushing has been proposed as a method that may increase the oocyte yield&#xD;
      due to the fact that oocytes that are not immediately retrieved from the follicle can be&#xD;
      collected after flushing. Double lumen needles allow for flushing via the use of two channels&#xD;
      within the needle, one for aspirating the follicles and one for flushing. However, there is&#xD;
      controversy regarding its routine use mainly due to the fact that the procedures tend to last&#xD;
      longer, but also due to the risk of haemorrhage and infection from flushing. Many studies&#xD;
      have been performed over the years comparing flushing (with double lumen needles) and no&#xD;
      flushing (with single lumen needles), with conflicting results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cochrane review published in 2010, assessed the use of flushing, found no significant&#xD;
      benefit in the use of double-lumen needles. In a recent randomised study performed in EUGONIA&#xD;
      clinic, flushing was found to be associated with significantly higher retrieval rates&#xD;
      compared to no flushing using a 16G Casmed double lumen needle. In addition, around 97% of&#xD;
      oocytes collected were retrieved in the first 3 flushes and oocytes were found to have&#xD;
      similar maturation and fertilisation rates regardless of the number of flushes required,&#xD;
      suggesting that a small number of flushes may increase the final number of developmentally&#xD;
      competent oocytes retrieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the safety of flushing, adherence to the protocol presented above, especially with&#xD;
      regard to aseptic techniques, will minimise the risk of infection from the flushes. It should&#xD;
      be stressed that care should be taken to avoid rupturing follicles via too vigorous flushing.&#xD;
      The amount of DPBS flushed into the follicle should not exceed 50% of the volume of the&#xD;
      follicle and follicles with excess vascularisation should not be flushed at all. The&#xD;
      procedure should be performed by an experienced team to ensure safety of the patient while&#xD;
      also minimising the length of time of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspiration Needles A significant parameter when comparing both needles and retrieval&#xD;
      techniques is the working diameter of the needle used to aspirate. This is especially true&#xD;
      when performing oocyte retrievals with the use of follicular flushing. Double lumen needles&#xD;
      have as a rule smaller working diameters compared to similar gauge single lumen needles. This&#xD;
      fact should be considered when setting the negative pressure on the aspiration pump, as&#xD;
      double-lumen needles will require significantly higher pressure in order to achieve a similar&#xD;
      flow rate as single-lumen needles. Even similar double-lumen needles from different&#xD;
      manufacturers can have dissimilar inner lumen diameters, significantly altering their&#xD;
      performance, since even small changes in the diameter have a large effect on the flow-rate.&#xD;
      Below is a comparison of the diameters of some commonly used aspiration needles. The inner&#xD;
      diameter in the double lumen category refers to the working diameter of the inner lumen. Note&#xD;
      the significant differences in diameters between similar gauge needles.&#xD;
