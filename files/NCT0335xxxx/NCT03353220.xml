    <textblock>
      This two-phase study aims to explore ways to predict who will respond well to the weight loss&#xD;
      drug lorcaserin and to understand the mechanisms that develop which limit drug efficacy.&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited for a 5-week crossover study (phase 1) with lorcaserin and placebo&#xD;
      followed by treatment with lorcaserin for 24 weeks (phase 2).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In phase 1, at Weeks 1 and 5, participants will take the weight loss drug lorcaserin or&#xD;
      placebo for 7 days. At Week 5 participants will receive whichever treatment they did not&#xD;
      receive at Week 1. At the end of Weeks 1 and 5, participants will have a lumbar puncture&#xD;
      (spinal tap) to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for neuropeptide and hormone analyses,&#xD;
      including proopiomelanocortin (POMC), Agouti-related protein (AgRP) and cortisol. Blood will&#xD;
      also be obtained for neuropeptide and hormone analyses. Breakfast will be served to&#xD;
      participants who will then complete an eating behavior profile. A laboratory test meal will&#xD;
      be performed 4h after breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing both the 7 day lorcaserin and placebo studies, participants will then&#xD;
      continue on Phase 2 of the study, which includes treatment with lorcaserin for 24 weeks.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive nutritional counseling to reduce their daily caloric intake to 600 kcal&#xD;
      below their calculated caloric requirement and will be encourage to exercise moderately for&#xD;
      30 minutes daily. Participants will visit the clinic monthly during the 24 week study period&#xD;
      for nutritional counseling, review of food diaries, vital signs and safely labs. Blood will&#xD;
      also be obtained for neuropeptide peptide and hormone analyses. At the end of the 24 week&#xD;
      period subjects will come for a final study visit, including a lumbar puncture, blood sample,&#xD;
      breakfast, an eating behavior profile and a test meal.&#xD;

      <pre_assignment_details>Out of the 32 enrolled subjects: 30 subjects completed Phase 1 (Arms A and B) and 30 subjects continued into Phase 2. However, the study was stopped prematurely during Phase 2 as lorcaserin was withdrawn from the market. Data was collected and analyzed for the 30 subjects that completed phase 1 out of 32 subjects; the 2 subjects who did not complete phase 1 were excluded from analysis. 19 subjects completed phase 2.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Mean Differences in AgRP Concentrations (Fmol/ml) in Blood After Lorcaserin for One Week Compared to Placebo</title>
        <description>This is designed to measure mean Agouti-related protein (AgRP) concentrations (fmol/ml) in blood in order to determine if long-term lorcaserin induced weight loss can be predicted by short-term differences in AgRP concentrations.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>The data information were collected and analyzed separately for the time period of placebo or drug exposure - i.e., comparing participants receiving placebo only OR Lorcaserin only (instead of comparing Arm A and Arm B). At one point, the same participant was exposed to either placebo OR Lorcaserin. Therefore, there are 30 analyzed for placebo only and 30 analyzed for drug only.</population>
