  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses two challenges seen among African American (AA) participants during&#xD;
      previous weight loss and dietary interventions aimed at reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD)&#xD;
      risk: poor weight loss results and high attrition rates. Investigators will target both of&#xD;
      these challenges by using a randomized design to compare a plant-based dietary intervention&#xD;
      (vegan diet) vs. an omnivorous (omni) diet and by focusing on culturally-tailored food&#xD;
      choices for AA adults living in the South. Therefore, the objective of the study is to&#xD;
      conduct a culturally-tailored, randomized trial examining how a vegan diet affects CVD risk&#xD;
      factors and weight as compared with an omni diet. The study will randomize overweight AA&#xD;
      adults (n=130) to follow one of two different diets (vegan or omni) for 24 months.&#xD;
      Investigators will accomplish objectives and test hypotheses by following two specific&#xD;
      primary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims: Using a randomized design, determine the impact at 12 months of two different,&#xD;
      culturally tailored diets (n=65 omni and n=65 vegan) on changes in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Risk factors for CVD, including LDL cholesterol and blood pressure; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine long-term changes in CVD risk factors and body weight at 24 months.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in this group will follow a plant-based vegan diet. The vegan group diet will be based on investigators' pilot work, which instructs participants to favor a diet built around whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. This group will be supplemented by the Oldways African Heritage and Health program, which includes a food pyramid guide. A Taste of African Heritage (ATAH) six-lesson nutrition and cooking program and an online course for health professionals and cooking instructors (all research and restaurant team members will complete this course.&#xD;
Interventions include intervention meetings, physical activity, and podcasts/mailings.</description>
