      Background: In the last 30 years mindfulness-based approaches have been extensively used for&#xD;
      a variety of mental disorders, including affective disorders characterized by emotional&#xD;
      instability. Mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an 8-week intervention that&#xD;
      combines mindfulness practices with cognitive behavioural therapy. Although changes in&#xD;
      emotional processing have been postulated as one of mindfulness mechanisms of action, the&#xD;
      effects of mindfulness-based programs on objective tasks of emotional processing have been&#xD;
      poorly studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To explore the effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on emotional&#xD;
      processing in a sample of individuals with emotional instability attended in a mental-health&#xD;
      public service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The sample (n = 30) will be recruited from public mental-health outpatient centers&#xD;
      in Barcelona, Spain. Inclusion criteria: 1) high emotional instability defined as scores&#xD;
      above 96 on the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), 2) age between 18 and 65&#xD;
      years, 4) no prior experience with mindfulness/meditation. Exclusion criteria: 1) risk of&#xD;
      suicide (attempted suicide in the last year or current suicidal ideation). Psychotropic&#xD;
      medication will be permitted, as long as there are no changes in dose/type during the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures Diagnostic measures (MINI, DERS, CGI) and a complete medical register will be&#xD;
      collected prior inclusion in the study. Additional measures on personality (ZKPQ) and&#xD;
      temperament (Temps-A) will be collected as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotional processing task: Participants will complete the FERT task at two time points:&#xD;
      baseline (pre-treatment) and 8 weeks (post-treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants will complete the following assessments (pre-and-post- treatment):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-16)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anxiety Symptoms (STAI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mindfulness (FFMQ and EQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a manualized, 8 weeks-group-based&#xD;
      training derived from mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      therapy (CBT). In MBCT participants are trained in how to be more aware of their bodily&#xD;
      sensations, thoughts and feelings associated with negative emotional states. Mindfulness&#xD;
      exercises and cognitive-behavioral skills are practiced both during the sessions and through&#xD;
      homework assignments. The program is structured in 2.30 h group sessions over 8 consecutive&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness is typically defined as a present-centered non-judgmental awareness (Kabat-Zinn,&#xD;
      1990). In the last 30 years mindfulness-based approaches have been extensively used for a&#xD;
      variety of mental disorders, including affective disorders characterized by emotion&#xD;
      dysregulation (Khoury et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) includes meditation techniques to help&#xD;
      participants become more aware of their experience in the present moment. Participants learn&#xD;
      the practice of mindfulness meditation through 8 classes held on a weekly basis. Unlike other&#xD;
      mindfulness-based approaches, MBCT also includes basic exercises derived from cognitive&#xD;
      therapy that demonstrate the links between thinking and feeling and how participants can care&#xD;
      for themselves (Williams &amp; Kuyken, 2012). Although the efficacy of MBCT has been established&#xD;
      in a number of studies (Barnhofer et al., 2009; Kuyken et al., 2008; Ma &amp; Teasdale, 2004),&#xD;
      little is known in regard to the mechanisms underlying mindfulness beneficial effects. Holzel&#xD;
      (Holzel et al., 2011) suggests that one of these mechanisms is related to the effects of&#xD;
      mindfulness in emotion regulation, however this mechanism has been poorly studied, especially&#xD;
      in clinical samples. Therefore the aim of the present study is to explore the performance of&#xD;
      a naturalistically recruited sample of patients with high emotional instability in a task of&#xD;
      facial expression recognition. We hypothesized that mindfulness practice will lead to changes&#xD;
      in emotional processing as measured with the facial emotion recognition task (FERT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES Primary aim: The objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of&#xD;
      MBCT on emotional processing in a sample of individuals with emotion instability attended in&#xD;
      a mental-health public service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondarily, the effect of MBCT on depressive and anxiety symptoms and mindfulness capacities&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pre-post interventional study. Given the exploratory nature of this study a sample&#xD;
      of 30 participants will be recruited from public mental-health outpatient centers in&#xD;
      Barcelona, Spain located at the catchment area of the PSMAR (CSMA Sant Martí Sud, CSMA Sant&#xD;
      Martí Nord, CSMA Santa Coloma y CSMA La Mina). Inclusion criteria: 1) high emotional&#xD;
      instability defined as scores above 76 on the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale&#xD;
      (DERS), 2) age between 18 and 65 years, 3) no prior experience with mindfulness/meditation.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: 1) risk of suicide (attempted suicide in the last year). Psychotropic&#xD;
      medication will be permitted, as long as there are no changes in dose/type during the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychiatric symptoms will be collected with the Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PDSQ; Pérez Gálvez, García Fernández, de Vicente Manzaro, &amp; Olivera&#xD;
      Valenzuela, 2010; Zimmerman &amp; Mattia, 2001) in order to obtain Axis I comorbidities. The PDSQ&#xD;
      contains 13 sub-scales screening for: major depressive disorder, bulimia, post-traumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder,&#xD;
      obsessive-compulsive disorder, alcohol abuse/dependence, drug abuse/dependence, somatization,&#xD;
      hypochondriasis and psychosis. A complete medical register will be also collected prior&#xD;
      inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004; Hervás &amp; Jódar,&#xD;
      2008) will be used for assessing emotional instability. Participants will be included in the&#xD;
      study if they scored higher than 76 (1 SD above the mean of the general population). The DERS&#xD;
      is a 28 item-questionnaire that provides a total score and 4 sub-scores measuring:&#xD;
      non-acceptance of emotional responses, lack of emotional awareness, lack of emotional clarity&#xD;
      and limited access to emotion regulation strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Global Impression Severity and Improvement (CGI-S and CGI-I; Kadouri, Corruble, &amp;&#xD;
      Falissard, 2007). The CGI-S scale would be used to evaluate the clinical severity of the&#xD;
      participant in a scale from 1 to 7 (&quot;not ill at all&quot;, to &quot;very ill&quot;). The CGI will be&#xD;
      clinician-administered and self-reported. In addition, the CGI-I will be also used, in order&#xD;
      to evaluate the improvement between the baseline visit and the post-intervention assessment&#xD;
      (from 1: &quot;very slight deterioration&quot; to 7: &quot;maximum deterioration&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TEMPS-A scale (Vázquez and Akiskal 2005) is a self-evaluation questionnaire used to&#xD;
      assess the four basic affective temperaments (hyperthymic, depressive, cyclothymic, and&#xD;
      irritable), and the anxious temperament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotional processing task: Participants will complete the Facial Expression Recognition Task&#xD;
      (FERT) task at two time points: baseline (pre-treatment) and 8 weeks (post-treatment). The&#xD;
      FERT uses stimuli pictures of faces expressing basic emotions (i.e., anger, disgust, fear,&#xD;
      happiness, sadness and surprise) from 10 actors. Each emotion was morphed, in 10% steps,&#xD;
      between two standard images of 0% (neutral) and 100 % (full emotion). Four examples of each&#xD;
      emotion at each intensity (10-100%) are presented (6 emotions x 10 intensities x 4 actor&#xD;
      examples = 240 stimuli). Each face is also presented in a neutral expression, so there are a&#xD;
      total of 250 stimulus presentations. Facial expressions appear on the screen for 500ms,&#xD;
      followed by a blank screen. Participants are asked to classify the expression of presented&#xD;
      faces as quickly and accurately as possible by clicking in one of the seven labeled emotion&#xD;
      keys. The next face is not presented until an expression has been assigned to the previous&#xD;
      face. Accuracy and reaction time are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants will complete the following questionnaires (pre-and-post-&#xD;
      treatment):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-16; Rush et al., 2003). Self-reported 16 item questionnaire that&#xD;
      assess depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety Symptoms (STAI; Spielberg, 1983). To assess anxiety symptoms the state version of the&#xD;
      STAI will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness (FFMQ and EQ). The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer, Smith, Hopkins,&#xD;
      Krietemeyer, &amp; Toney, 2006; Cebolla et al., 2012). The FFMQ measures five different factors:&#xD;
      (1) Observe, (2) Describe, (3) Acting with awareness, (4) Non-judging the inner experience&#xD;
      and (5) Non-reacting to the inner experience. Participants were asked to rate the degree of&#xD;
      concordance with each statement on a 5-point Likert scale that ranges from 1 (never or very&#xD;
      rarely, true) to 5 (very often or always, true). The Experiences Questionnaire (Fresco et&#xD;
      al., 2007; Soler et al., 2014). This instrument comprises 11 items and measures decentering,&#xD;
      defined as the capacity to observe one's thoughts and emotions as temporary events of the&#xD;
      mind. The EQ items are scored in a 5-point-Likert-type scale, ranging from never to all the&#xD;
      time, with higher scores indicating more decentering.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; Segal, Williams, &amp; Teasdale, 2002))&#xD;
           is a manualized, 8 weeks-group-based training derived from mindfulness-based stress&#xD;
           reduction (MBSR) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). In MBCT participants are&#xD;
           trained in how to be more aware of their bodily sensations, thoughts and feelings&#xD;
           associated with negative emotional states. Mindfulness exercises and&#xD;
           cognitive-behavioral skills are practiced both during the sessions and through homework&#xD;
           assignments. The program is structured in 2.30 h group sessions over 8 consecutive&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure. Participants who fulfil inclusion/exclusion criteria will be invited to&#xD;
           participate in the study. After explaining study's procedures, participants will receive&#xD;
           the &quot;Participant Information Sheet&quot; and the informed consent will be signed. Thereafter,&#xD;
           participants will complete the FERT task using a tablet and paper-and-pencil&#xD;
           questionnaires. Baseline assessments will be conducted within one week prior to the&#xD;
           start of the group-therapy. Assessments (FERT task and questionnaires) will be completed&#xD;
           at post-treatment, also within a week of concluding the group. A detailed description of&#xD;
           the measures used by study phase can be found in Table 1.&#xD;
