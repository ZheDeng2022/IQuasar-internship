  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of dapaconazole tosylate 2% cream in the treatment&#xD;
      of Tinea cruris compared to the active control miconazole nitrate 2% cream in patients with a&#xD;
      single lesion.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, non-inferiority, monocentric, double-blind, randomized (allocation of&#xD;
      treatment), balanced, controlled (active comparator) trial, with two parallel groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization depended on inclusion/exclusion criteria, taking into account the confirmation&#xD;
      of diagnosis by the direct mycological test and culture performed during the screening phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants showed up to the clinic, for treatment, during 14 consecutive days, when one of&#xD;
      the investigational products (according to the randomization) was applied by a blind member&#xD;
      of the study staff. A non-blind member of the study staff weighed the corresponding&#xD;
      investigational product and passed on to the blind member only a spatula with the weighed&#xD;
      product, in order to maintain the blinded aspect of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For exploratory purposes, clinical and mycological evaluations was also performed after 7 and&#xD;
      after 14 days of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analysis was performed considering all the randomized patients to which at least one&#xD;
      dose of the investigational products has been applied, regardless of the result of the fungal&#xD;
      culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion of non-inferiority was based on the per protocol set. It was deemed as per&#xD;
      protocol those participants who did not miss more than 20% of the applications and, also, no&#xD;
      more than four consecutive application days.&#xD;

    <description>Proportion of participants, in each treatment group, who achieved therapeutic cure, defined as both clinical and mycological cure, on the assessment performed after 14 days of treatment.&#xD;
Clinical cure was considered when there was no more scaling of the lesions, total absence of erythema, itching and desquamation.&#xD;
Mycological cure was defined as negative result for the direct mycological examination (potassium hydroxide [KOH] test) and a negative fungal culture.</description>
