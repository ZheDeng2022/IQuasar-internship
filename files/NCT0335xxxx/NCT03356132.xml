  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the safety and performance of Silimed® silicone gel breast implants&#xD;
      with a textured surface and Silimed® silicone gel breast implants with polyurethane coated&#xD;
      surface. Female patients who underwent primary or secondary breast augmentation using&#xD;
      Silimed® breast implants will be followed-up through 10 years. The safety of each type of&#xD;
      Silimed® breast implant is going to be assessed by estimating the known and unexpected short-&#xD;
      and long-term risk / adverse event rates. The performance of each type of Silimed® breast&#xD;
      implant is going to be assesses by estimating the satisfaction and quality of life after&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;
