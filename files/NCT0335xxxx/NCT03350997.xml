  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team will assess &quot;free-living&quot; 24h glucose control using continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitors (CGM) over an 88h period on two separate occasions. Importantly, standardized meals&#xD;
      will be provided and will be consumed at specific times each day of the CGM measurement&#xD;
      period. These meals will be identical on day 1 and day 3 of measurement. Each subject will&#xD;
      complete two CGM periods, which will be identical except for the calorie and macronutrient&#xD;
      content of the post-exercise dinner. In addition, during trial 1, two CGM's will be worn,&#xD;
      while only 1 CGM will be worn on trial 2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be instructed to exercise exactly 2 days before each experimental trial period,&#xD;
      and then abstain from exercise other than the exercise session on Day 2 of the trial period&#xD;
      until after the trial period is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will arrive to the Substrate Metabolism Laboratory at approximately 4pm on Day 0 of&#xD;
      each trial. For trial 1, two CGM devices will be placed on either side of the abdomen, near&#xD;
      the belly button. For trial 2, only one CGM device will be placed on one side of the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of both trials, participants will go about their normal daily activities (other than&#xD;
      planned exercise) while eating provided meals at designated time points. This day will serve&#xD;
      as the non-exercise control day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 2, subjects will return to the laboratory to exercise on the bike for ~1h at a&#xD;
      moderate exercise intensity (approximately 65% of their measured VO2peak) to expend 350&#xD;
      kilocalories. During trial 1 only, subjects will use the mouthpiece and nose clip (which will&#xD;
      allow all of their expired air to pass through the metabolic cart for analysis of oxygen&#xD;
      consumption and carbon dioxide production) for ~5 min at the beginning, middle and toward the&#xD;
      end of exercise to verify they are exercising at 65% of VO2peak. This will also allow the&#xD;
      study team to accurately measure energy expenditure (kcal) during exercise. On trial 2,&#xD;
      subjects will perform the exact same exercise protocol, but the mouthpiece and nose clip will&#xD;
      not be required. One hour after the exercise session, participants will eat their&#xD;
      standardized dinner. Importantly, the caloric content of this meal will differ between the&#xD;
      two trials (+/- 350kcal), and this will be the only difference between the two study trial&#xD;
      periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 3, participants will go about their normal daily activities (other than planned&#xD;
      exercise) while eating the provided meals at designated time points. This day will serve as&#xD;
      the post-exercise day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 4, participants will return to the laboratory at approximately 8am for removal of the&#xD;
      CGM device(s).&#xD;
