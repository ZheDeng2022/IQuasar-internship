    <textblock>
      Trial assessing atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) as treatment option for patients with mycosis&#xD;
      fungoides/sezary syndrome having progressed under or after previous therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, we invite patients suffering from mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome who&#xD;
      have progressed after initial therapy or have failed to respond to previous therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome are cancers in which lymphocytes* become malignant&#xD;
      (cancerous) and affect the skin. In mycosis fungoides, the disease is generally limited to&#xD;
      the skin, and people develop flat or raised areas on their skin where the lymphocytes have&#xD;
      accumulated. Sometimes even larger aggregations of lymphocytes occur in the skin or lymph&#xD;
      nodes, resulting in tumors. In Sézary syndrome, the skin is often reddened or itchy, and some&#xD;
      abnormal lymphocytes circulate in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Lymphocytes are a type of immune cells that is made in the bone marrow and is found in the&#xD;
      blood. Lymphocytes have a number of roles in the immune system, including the production of&#xD;
      antibodies and other substances that fight infections and other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In standard practice, the disease will be treated with conventional chemotherapy that&#xD;
      unfortunately has a limited lasting benefit. In this study, we want to see if a new treatment&#xD;
      option can optimize and improve response and make benefit last as long as possible. This new&#xD;
      treatment option is immunotherapy, using atezolizumab (Tecentriq).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single&#xD;
      type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or&#xD;
      normal cells that may help cancer cell grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill&#xD;
      the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Atezolizumab blocks a&#xD;
      protein called PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) from binding to its receptor found on the&#xD;
      surface of lymphocytes. It helps to restore the immune activity of the body against the&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atezolizumab is already used to treat adults with a cancer that affects the bladder and the&#xD;
      urinary system, called urothelial carcinoma, and a cancer that affects the lungs, called&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, patients will receive atezolizumab for one year unless the tumor starts&#xD;
      growing again or this is not considered suitable for them anymore or they wish to stop the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

          -  WHO performance status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow and organ function prior to receiving the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt;10.0 g/dL (&gt;100 g/L) or hematocrit &gt;30% (&gt;0.30 v/v);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  White blood cell count &gt;3.0 x 109/L (&gt;3000/mm3);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count of &gt;1.5 x 109/L (&gt;1500/mm3);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &gt;100 x 109/L (&gt;100,000/mm3);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated creatinine clearance &gt;40 mL/min based on the Cockcroft Gault calculation or&#xD;
             serum creatinine less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values less&#xD;
             than 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum total bilirubin 1.5 ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with suspicion of Gilbert disease who have serum bilirubin level 3 x ULN may&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Clinically normal cardiac function based on 12 lead ECG without clinically relevant&#xD;
             abnormalities and the institutional lower limit of normal for left ventricular&#xD;
             ejection fraction as assessed either by multi-gated acquisition scan or cardiac&#xD;
             ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 72 hours prior to the first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: women of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal females capable of&#xD;
        becoming pregnant (i.e. females who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months,&#xD;
        with the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy). However, women who have been&#xD;
        amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if&#xD;
        the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, low body weight,&#xD;
        ovarian suppression or other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;

             measures, as defined by the investigator, during the study treatment period and for at&#xD;
             least 5 months after the last dose of treatment. A highly effective method of birth&#xD;
             control is defined as a method which results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1%&#xD;
             per year) when used consistently and correctly. Such methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with&#xD;

          -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral,&#xD;
             injectable, implantable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;

             relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
             of the patient)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects who are breast feeding should discontinue nursing prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study treatment and until 6 months after the last study treatment.&#xD;
