    <textblock>
      A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, 48-week clinical trial with a core population&#xD;
      (group A) of 79 ambulant 6.5 to 12 years old Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients&#xD;
      that are under stable standard treatment of care with glucocorticoids. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to include 6-20 non-ambulant patients who do not receive glucocorticoids&#xD;
      (as parallel group B), 10 to 16 years old, to obtain efficacy and safety data in a broader&#xD;
      DMD population. All patients will receive 20 mg of tamoxifen (TAM) or placebo once daily&#xD;
      during 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open label extension (OLE) trial for participants of the TAMDMD main study will be&#xD;
      performed. All TAMDMD patients on TAM or placebo are offered to enter this OLE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 48-week multicentre, parallel, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled phase 3&#xD;
      safety and efficacy trial. There are two treatment arms: Tamoxifen (verum) and placebo&#xD;
      (control), with treatment allocation of 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to screen at least 79 and to enroll at least 71 ambulant DMD patients&#xD;
      aged between 6.5 and 12 years (group A) and 6 - 20 non-ambulant DMD patients aged between 10&#xD;
      and 16 years (group B). In order to reach statistical power, 60 ambulant patients (group A)&#xD;
      need to complete the trial. Treatment with 20 mg Tamoxifen once daily will be given for the&#xD;
      total trial duration of 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients with glucocorticoids (standard treatment of care) will be included in group A&#xD;
      (ambulant patients) and only non-glucocorticoid users in group B. At baseline as well as at&#xD;
      the end of the study clinical, laboratory, and MRI measurements will be performed. These&#xD;
      include the Motor Function Measure (MFM) scale, timed function tests, the 6 minute walking&#xD;
      distance, quantitative muscle testing (QMT) and quantitative thigh muscle MRI,&#xD;
      questionnaires. A physical examination, an ECG, vital signs as well as safety laboratory&#xD;
      blood analyses will be performed at every visit. Furthermore, an x-ray of the hand and a dual&#xD;
      energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)-scan will be performed at baseline and at the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open label extension (OLE) trial for participants of the TAMDMD main study will be&#xD;
      performed. All TAMDMD patients on TAM or placebo are offered to enter this OLE. All OLE&#xD;
      patients will receive 20 mg of TAM daily during 48 weeks. The same study specific assessments&#xD;
      as in the double-blind randomized phase will be performed during the OLE phase&#xD;
