  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to fatigue, pain is the most frequent and persistent symptom following breast&#xD;
      cancer and breast cancer treatment. Despite the effectiveness of different physical therapy&#xD;
      modalities, such as manual techniques, passive mobilizations and exercises, many patients&#xD;
      still experience pain and subsequent difficulties in daily functioning at short and long&#xD;
      term. Past decades, the awareness on the important role of educational interventions in the&#xD;
      management of pain in general has increased. Educational interventions aim at explaining and&#xD;
      improving the knowledge, control and attitude of the patient regarding his/her pain&#xD;
      complaint. However, these educational interventions are often restricted to more biomedical&#xD;
      pain management instructions and general advice on physical activity and analgesics (=&#xD;
      traditional biomedical education). Only recently, increased knowledge on pain mechanisms led&#xD;
      to a more modern educational approach. This modern approach is suited to explain more complex&#xD;
      issues associated with pain and takes into account many more factors related to pain. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, only one controlled trial investigated the effectiveness of a modern educational&#xD;
      intervention in the early stage of breast cancer treatment. The results were very promising&#xD;
      for shoulder function. However, only short-term effects were examined, no randomization was&#xD;
      performed and no pain-related and socio-economic outcomes were evaluated. Therefore, the aim&#xD;
      of the proposed project is to investigate the effectiveness of a similar modern educational&#xD;
      program, in addition to standard physical therapy care, in the early treatment phase of&#xD;
      breast cancer in comparison with traditional biomedical education. A randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial will be performed with a long-term follow up period. The primary outcome parameter is&#xD;
      pain-related disability. Secondary outcomes are different dimensions of pain, physical and&#xD;
      mental functioning, return to work and health-care related costs.&#xD;
