  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, and&#xD;
      post-operative pain management is a challenge for otolaryngologists. A 2013 black-box warning&#xD;
      on codeine following tonsillectomy has drawn attention to potential concerns with all&#xD;
      narcotics in these patients, and many surgeons try to avoid narcotics. The use of&#xD;
      intra-operative corticosteroids has been proven to be beneficial in reducing post-operative&#xD;
      morbidity, and some small studies have shown possible benefit to the use of post-operative&#xD;
      oral corticosteroids as well, although the results of these studies are mixed. To date, no&#xD;
      one has looked at whether the use of post-operative oral steroids may reduce or eliminate the&#xD;
      need for narcotics. We aim to determine whether the addition of oral steroids to our&#xD;
      post-operative pain regimen can reduce the need for narcotic pain medications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      I. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States with the&#xD;
      predominant indications being obstructive sleep apnea and recurrent tonsillitis1. While it is&#xD;
      usually performed on young and otherwise healthy children, postoperative morbidity is&#xD;
      ubiquitous occurring in nearly 20% of children with the most frequent complaints being throat&#xD;
      pain, otalgia, fever, poor oral intake, nausea and emesis, and secondary hemorrhage2.&#xD;
      Historically, Tylenol with codeine was commonly used for pain control post-operatively in&#xD;
      children. However, in 2013 the FDA issued a black box warning on codeine following&#xD;
      tonsillectomy due to reports of multiple deaths and morbidities in children3. Since that&#xD;
      time, there has been increased awareness of the dangers of opioids in general and many&#xD;
      surgeons are trying to minimize or eliminate the prescription of opioids to children&#xD;
      following tonsillectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been found by multiple studies that intra-operative use of steroids during&#xD;
      tonsillectomy has beneficial effects in children. A Cochrane Review updated in 2011 presented&#xD;
      a meta-analysis of 19 randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded studies and concluded&#xD;
      that routine use of a single intra-operative dose of dexamethasone reduces post-operative&#xD;
      morbidity. The studies found a decrease in post-operative emesis and a higher likelihood of&#xD;
      advancement to a soft or solid diet on the first postoperative day. Eight of the studies used&#xD;
      the Visual Analog Scale (ranging from 0-10), which found a reduction of post-operative pain&#xD;
      of more than one point. No adverse effects related to intra-operative corticosteroid use were&#xD;
      reported and a single dose of steroids is believed to be virtually harmless4. Despite the&#xD;
      utility of corticosteroids intra-operatively, there is currently a paucity of studies&#xD;
      investigating the potential effects of a short post-operative course of oral (PO) steroids on&#xD;
      pain control and other morbidities of tonsillectomy. Of the available literature, a short&#xD;
      course of prednisolone of up to 1 week in patients without specific contraindications was&#xD;
      found to provide a significant benefit in pain relief, return to normal diet, return to&#xD;
      normal activity, and re-epithelialization of the tonsillar fossae, in an assessment of 69&#xD;
      pediatric patients5. Another study by Macassey et al. compared 5 days of oral prednisolone to&#xD;
      placebo by assessing pain, nausea, vomiting, return to normal function, and sleep duration&#xD;
      and quality. This study did not find a difference in any of the study parameters between the&#xD;
      two groups6. To our knowledge, there have been no studies specifically looking at how the&#xD;
      addition of a post-operative course of oral steroids impacts patient's necessity for narcotic&#xD;
      pain medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to conflicting reports and a general paucity of literature to support or refute routine&#xD;
      postoperative steroid use in children following tonsillectomy, it will be useful to determine&#xD;
      the efficacy of this otherwise ubiquitous and benign medication on pain control, time to&#xD;
      return to normal diet, dehydration, post-operative infections, and post-operative bleeding in&#xD;
      our patient cohort; these are the most common complaints and complications following&#xD;
      tonsillectomy surgery. Therefore, similar to the above-referenced studies5,6 we will be&#xD;
      evaluating all of these endpoints in our patients. However, in addition to these endpoints we&#xD;
      will also look at the need for post-operative narcotics. Given the recent black box warning&#xD;
      on Tylenol with codeine use in children following tonsillectomy3, many surgeons are&#xD;
      understandably hesitant to prescribe any narcotics to children following tonsillectomy. Our&#xD;
      study will evaluate the potential role of steroids to reduce or possibly even eliminate the&#xD;
      need to prescribe these children narcotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study comparing the&#xD;
      post-tonsillectomy morbidity and analgesic/narcotic use in children 4 to 18 years old&#xD;
      receiving a 5 day-course of oral prednisolone versus those receiving placebo. We plan to&#xD;
      approach patients and parents preoperatively to assess their willingness to participate in&#xD;
      the study. Following tonsillectomy, parents will be asked to complete a patient log,&#xD;
      detailing the child's post-operative course. This log will document the quantity of narcotics&#xD;
      and other pain medications used, daily pain assessments using the validated Wong-Baker facies&#xD;
      tool, return to regular oral diet, and return to regular activities. Complications such as&#xD;
      dehydration, post-operative infection, and post-operative bleeding requiring an emergency&#xD;
      room visit will also be assessed in a post-operative survey, which will be completed at the&#xD;
      post-operative office visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the use of a single dose of intraoperative steroids is a widely accepted practice, we&#xD;
      believe there is a value in investigating whether a short postoperative course of steroids&#xD;
      adds further benefit to a child's post-tonsillectomy course, especially because it is a safe&#xD;
      and inexpensive intervention, and may reduce the need for post-operative narcotics. Given the&#xD;
      significant concerns with narcotics in this cohort of patients and the recent black-box&#xD;
      warning, there is great interest among pediatric otolaryngologists in minimizing narcotic&#xD;
      use. This study has significant potential to change the paradigm of post-operative pain&#xD;
      management after tonsillectomy to minimize or even avoid the use of narcotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints for this study include frequency and total amount of narcotic and&#xD;
      non-narcotic pain medication required, time to return to normal diet, and time to return to&#xD;
      normal activity. Secondary endpoints will include the rates of post-operative emergency&#xD;
      department visits, dehydration, and post-operative tonsillar hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a prospective double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled control trial to assess&#xD;
      the effects of oral prednisolone on the post-operative course following tonsillectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment At the pre-operative visit, a member of the patient care team (resident, nurse&#xD;
      practitioner, or attending physician within the Pediatric Otolaryngology department) will&#xD;
      assess the willingness of the patient and parents to hear more about the study. Study details&#xD;
      will be made available to the parents and child, with the understanding that their child will&#xD;
      be randomized into a group receiving post-operative steroids or a group who receives placebo.&#xD;
      It will be emphasized that study participation is voluntary and without participation&#xD;
      children will receive our current standard of care, which is a single intra-operative dose of&#xD;
      dexamethasone but no post-operative oral steroids. It will be made clear that the parents are&#xD;
      able to withdraw from the study at any time. If they agree to take part in the study, parents&#xD;
      will be asked to record all pain medications taken by their child in the five days following&#xD;
      surgery as well as keep a record of diet and activity. Informed consent will be obtained for&#xD;
      participation in the study at the first visit. Parents will also be asked to bring the study&#xD;
      medication bottle and the pain medication bottle to the follow-up visit to ensure compliance.&#xD;
      A survey assessing secondary endpoints will be completed at the post-operative follow-up&#xD;
      visit. Study details and patient logs will be available in English only.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Pre-operative Visit (Visit 1) If the patient and family agree to participate after an&#xD;
      explanation of the project (see Recruitment above), and meets all criteria for participation,&#xD;
      they will be enrolled in the study. An informed consent document, oral assent document (if&#xD;
      applicable), and written assent document (if applicable) will then be obtained and a copy&#xD;
      will be given to the patient and/or parent. Only one parent will be required to provide&#xD;
      consent for the surgery and for participation in the study as typically only one parent&#xD;
      accompanies children to our clinic. A physical examination will be performed to note the&#xD;
      patient's tonsil size. Pre-operative sleep study findings in patients with suspected&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea will be recorded as well. Any concurrent medications will be&#xD;
      recorded. The patient's information will be sent to the participating pharmacist for&#xD;
      randomization into an experimental arm (5 day course of post-operative oral steroids -&#xD;
      prednisolone) and a control arm (5 day course of post-operative ORA-Sweet © placebo)&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 ratio at Visit 1 by the participating pharmacist,&#xD;
      using www.randomization.com. The patients as well as the surgeons and the remainder of the&#xD;
      research team will be blinded to the randomization. Prescription documents for the study&#xD;
      medication and placebo will be created by the participating pharmacist prior to the start of&#xD;
      the study. Once a patient is enrolled, a prescription will be sent to the participating&#xD;
      pharmacist who will then randomize the patient to receive either prednisolone or the&#xD;
      equivalent volume of OraSweet © solution to serve as a placebo. Details of randomization as&#xD;
      well as which patients received the study medication will be kept by the participating&#xD;
      pharmacist and can be available for review by the institutional review board or any governing&#xD;
      agencies at their request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day of Surgery (Visit 2) On the day of surgery all patients will receive a single&#xD;
      intravenous, weight-based dose of dexamethasone intra-operatively, as this is the current&#xD;
      standard of care. Tonsil size will, once again be noted at this visit and updates to&#xD;
      concurrent medications will be recorded. Any adverse events intraoperatively or immediately&#xD;
      post-operatively will be recorded. In female patients over age 9, it is hospital policy that&#xD;
      the patient undergoes a urine pregnancy test prior to undergoing surgery. This will be&#xD;
      recorded and, if positive, the patient will not undergo surgery and will be disqualified from&#xD;
      the study. After surgery, the participating pharmacist will then deliver the appropriate&#xD;
      volume of study medication (1mg/kg/day prednisolone divided BID (twice per day)) or for 5&#xD;
      days post-operatively to start on post-operative day 1. The control group will receive the&#xD;
      same volume of OraSweet© placebo also to start on post-operative day 1. Each group will&#xD;
      receive an additional quantity of 3 doses in the event of emesis and a need to redose.&#xD;
      Parents will then be asked to monitor their child's post-operative pain, oral intake,&#xD;
      activity, and quantity of pain medication given for 5 days using patient logs created for&#xD;
      this research endeavor (attached). The patient will then be discharged home or admitted for&#xD;
      overnight observation if pre-operative sleep study scores indicate a severe obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea (AHI &gt;10) based on recommendations by the American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and&#xD;
      Neck Surgery Foundation or at the surgeon's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative visit (Visit 3) The first follow up visit will occur 2 weeks after surgery. At&#xD;
      this visit, we will collect the patient logs used by the parents as well as the study&#xD;
      medication bottles to ensure compliance or to determine continued eligibility in the study.&#xD;
      At this visit, we will perform a physical examination to ensure healing of the wounds as well&#xD;
      as record any adverse events and other, concurrent medications. Parents will also be asked to&#xD;
      complete a brief survey, asking about the post-operative course and any complications&#xD;
      (attached). We will then transfer the paper patient log recordings into an electronic format&#xD;
      kept securely on the secure DMC server. Once statistical power has been reached, we will use&#xD;
      these data to evaluate whether a 5-day course of post-operative steroids improves&#xD;
      post-operative pain and decreases time to normal activity and oral intake. If patients&#xD;
      develop any postoperative complications, the standard of care for that complication will be&#xD;
      undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication Details On the day of surgery, medication will be prepared for the patients by the&#xD;
      participating pharmacist, which the parents will receive in the recovery room. The medication&#xD;
      bottle will either contain 15 mg/5 mL prednisolone elixir (Prednisolone group) or ORA-Sweet ©&#xD;
      Syrup (Placebo group). The medication will be provided in a marked bottle by the pharmacy.&#xD;
      The medication will be supplied specifically for this study and will be stored at room&#xD;
      temperature in the investigational drug room in the inpatient pharmacy until needed.&#xD;
      Medications will be ordered specifically for this study and will have its own medication lot&#xD;
      independent from the regular hospital supply. A weight-based dose of 1 mg/kg/day of&#xD;
      prednisolone elixir rounded to the nearest whole number and divided BID (twice per day ) for&#xD;
      5 days will be given with a maximal dose of 60 mg per day for the intervention group. This&#xD;
      dosing schedule is similar to other common pediatric uses of prednisolone including acute&#xD;
      asthma attacks. The placebo group will take the equivalent volume of OraSweet © Syrup&#xD;
      placebo. An additional volume of 3 doses will be provided to ensure proper redosing in the&#xD;
      event of emesis. Marked oral syringes will be provided by the pharmacy for ease of dosing.&#xD;
      The study medication or placebo is to begin on post-operative day 1 and will continue twice&#xD;
      daily through post-operative day 5. It will be suggested that all medications be taken with&#xD;
      food to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. Other post-operative medications will be&#xD;
      standardized and all will receive oxycodone elixir (0.05 mg/kg every 4 hours (Q4hr) as&#xD;
      needed), acetaminophen (15 mg/kg every 4 hours (q4hr) with a maximum dose of 500mg per dose)&#xD;
      and ibuprofen (10 mg/kg every 6 hours (Q6hr with a maximum of 400mg per dose) to be used&#xD;
      regularly. No post-operative antibiotics will be given as this is currently recommended&#xD;
      against by the American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. Parents&#xD;
      will be advised to use acetaminophen and ibuprofen as primary medications for pain control,&#xD;
      and to use oxycodone only if inadequate pain relief with alternating acetaminophen and&#xD;
      ibuprofen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Determination Statistical analysis will be performed to evaluate for any&#xD;
      differences between the control and experimental groups using an analysis of covariance&#xD;
      design. For a 2 group design with 2 covariates and a medium-to-large effect size (alpha&#xD;
      0.05), a sample of about 80-180 participants would be needed to achieve a power of 0.80 or&#xD;
      above. Therefore in order to allow for some drop-out, our goal is to achieve a sample size of&#xD;
      200 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient logs Attached are the patient logs that are to be used for this research study. Aside&#xD;
      from the Wong-Baker Faces scale, the remainder of the items in the patient logs to be used&#xD;
      are non-validated as no such tool currently exists for use of this purpose. Parents will be&#xD;
      asked to fill out a daily log for 5 days post-operatively focusing on aspects of pain&#xD;
      control, medication administration, activity level, and oral intake. Parents will be asked to&#xD;
      evaluate the child's pain on each post-operative day. Pain will be assessed in all patients&#xD;
      using the validated Wong-Baker FACES scale, which has been incorporated into our study&#xD;
      patient logs. Parents will be given a packet with written instructions and space to record&#xD;
      the child's pain level on each post-operative day, as well as space to record their pain&#xD;
      medication administration. They will also be given an activity and diet diary to monitor the&#xD;
      child's activity and diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative Survey Parents will be given a survey to complete at the post-operative visit&#xD;
      (Visit 3). The survey will be completed while they are at the office, so that we can clarify&#xD;
      or ask any further questions as needed. The survey will assess general compliance with the&#xD;
      study, as well as ask about any complications, including bleeding, ED visits, or hospital&#xD;
      admissions. This will allow us to capture any potential visits to outside emergency rooms&#xD;
      which we would not otherwise be aware of. If the parents indicates &quot;yes&quot; to the question&#xD;
      about whether they visited an emergency room, further details will be elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Outcome measures will include: the amount of post-operative narcotics required&#xD;
      in the 5 day post-operative period, amount of other non-narcotic analgesic medications&#xD;
      (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) required in the 5 day post-operative period, time to return to&#xD;
      normal activity, and time to return to normal diet. Complications such as post-operative&#xD;
      bleeding, dehydration that requires an emergency department visit, and post-operative&#xD;
      infection requiring antibiotics will be monitored as well. As study subjects with&#xD;
      complications return to the Children's Hospital of Michigan Emergency Department, the study&#xD;
      team will be notified by the on call otolaryngology resident and appropriate measures can be&#xD;
      undertaken. Complication rates will be compared between the two study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Safety Monitoring Plan Adverse effects associated with post-operative oral steroids or&#xD;
      complications from tonsillectomy will be monitored via the research team using the data&#xD;
      collection sheets. During the period that the study is ongoing, Dr. Bianca Siegel will&#xD;
      compile all information on adverse events every three months beginning after the first 20&#xD;
      patients. The pharmacy will reveal the randomization groups and statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed to determine any significant difference in adverse events between the two groups.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed by a Wayne State University biostatistician. We will&#xD;
      monitor specifically for serious adverse events such as dehydration or post-operative&#xD;
      tonsillar hemorrhage. If a statistically significant increase in serious adverse events is&#xD;
      found between the study group and the placebo group, the study will be aborted. We will also&#xD;
      abort the study if there is a non-statistically significant difference, but a noticeable&#xD;
      trend of increased adverse events in the study group. Early in the study, our small sample&#xD;
      size may result in a lack of statistical significance despite a large increase in relative&#xD;
      risk of serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential physical benefits to a subject participating in this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decreased narcotic use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A faster return to normal activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A faster return to normal diet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decreased post-tonsillectomy complication rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in severity or resolution of obstructive sleep apnea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in rates or resolution of recurrent tonsillitis/pharyngitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential benefits to society include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data-based information on the improvement of a normally very painful post-operative&#xD;
           tonsillectomy course following administration of prednisolone, with decreased necessity&#xD;
           for narcotic prescriptions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The potential for a new standard of care for improving tonsillectomy surgical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decreased costs to society from readmissions following tonsillectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Risks Short-term corticosteroid use is general considered safe. The most common adverse&#xD;
      reactions to steroids in the pediatric population include gastrointestinal upset,&#xD;
      hyperactivity, agitation, mood swings, and insomnia (up to 10%). Other, more infrequent risks&#xD;
      include adrenal suppression, delayed wound healing, glucose intolerance, myopathy, neuritis,&#xD;
      and weight gain (1-5%). These adverse events typically resolve with the discontinuation of&#xD;
      the corticosteroid. There are some reports of avascular necrosis of the hip, although these&#xD;
      are exceedingly rare. Corticosteroids, including prednisolone, are used for a variety of&#xD;
      pulmonary, rheumatological, and musculoskeletal pathologies in children and have stood the&#xD;
      test of time for safety and efficacy. These risks are mitigated by the short duration of use&#xD;
      of the medication, the encouragement to take the medication with food, the recommended dosing&#xD;
      schedule, and proper preoperative counseling and education regarding administration of&#xD;
      prednisolone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a part of this study and the current standard of care following tonsillectomy at DMC&#xD;
      Children's Hospital of Michigan, subjects will be prescribed acetaminophen (Tylenol ®) and&#xD;
      ibuprofen (Motrin ® or Advil ®) if acetaminophen is not tolerated. Oxycodone will also be&#xD;
      prescribed for additional pain coverage as needed as a normal part of the post-operative&#xD;
      course. A list of the more common and serious risks of each of the medications is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acetaminophen: swelling, itching, liver failure (very uncommon)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ibuprofen: nausea, vomiting, swelling, ringing in the ears (3-9%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxycodone: dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, sedation&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are risks associated with undergoing tonsillectomy including, but not limited to,&#xD;
      dehydration, bleeding, infection, trouble swallowing, painful swallowing, sore throat,&#xD;
      temporary voice changes, difficulty breathing, and, very rarely, death. These risks can be&#xD;
      lessened by good oral hydration and adequate pain management after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social risks are unlikely to occur during the course of this study, but there is a small risk&#xD;
      of breach of confidentiality. In order to maintain your child's confidentiality, all of their&#xD;
      identifiable information will be kept separate from study documents.&#xD;
