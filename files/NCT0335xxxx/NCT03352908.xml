      The purpose of this study is to determine if the Yale Swallow Protocol is an effective screen&#xD;
      for aspiration in recently extubated patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysphagia is prevalent in recently extubated patients with estimates ranging from 29-84% of&#xD;
      recently extubated patients having some form of dysphagia with elevated risk for silent&#xD;
      aspiration.One challenge providers face when managing post extubation dysphagia (PED) is that&#xD;
      there are no best practice guidelines on how to evaluate for PED, specifically how to&#xD;
      evaluate for silent aspiration (aspiration without cough response).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One method that has been suggested is the Yale Swallow Protocol (YSP), a pass/fail screen for&#xD;
      aspiration consisting of a three ounce water challenge as well as a brief cognitive screen&#xD;
      and oral motor exam. The assumption of the YSP is that silent aspiration (aspiration without&#xD;
      a cough response) is volume dependent. This is based on a study of over 4000 patients that&#xD;
      underwent both a FEES (5mL puree and 5mL liquid boluses) and a 3oz water challenge. Results&#xD;
      from previous literature indicated that the 3oz water swallow had a high sensitivity for&#xD;
      detecting aspiration (98%). This was again studied with a double blind research design with&#xD;
      25 patients, comparing results of the 3oz water challenge with results of videofluoroscopic&#xD;
      swallow study. This showed 100% sensitivity for detecting aspiration, 64% specificity, 78%&#xD;
      positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value. However, no published study&#xD;
      has evaluated the YSP in recently extubated patients and so it is unclear if the high&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity would be retained. Investigators aim to determine the sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity of the Yale Swallow Protocol in identifying aspiration in recently extubated&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <description>The Yale Swallow Protocol (YSP) consists of a brief cognitive screen, a brief oral motor exam, and a 3oz water challenge (subjects instructed to drink 3oz of water without stopping). Pass/fail is determined based on the subjects ability to drink the 3oz of water uninterrupted without immediate cough.</description>

    <description>Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) uses a flexible endoscope that will be passed transnasally into the pharynx by a speech pathologist specializing in dysphagia management. FEES will be treated as a placebo comparator.</description>
