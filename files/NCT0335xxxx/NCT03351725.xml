    <textblock>
      Peripheral intravenous cannulas (PIVCs) are utilized in large scale in modern health care.&#xD;
      Known complications due to a PIVC are phlebitis, thrombosis, bleeding, nerve damage and&#xD;
      infection. PIVC-related infection causes morbidity, mortality and increased healthcare costs.&#xD;
      PIVC-related infections can and should be prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indwell time is a known risk factor for PIVC-related infection. Another factor potentially&#xD;
      influencing the risk of developing PIVC-related infection is what type of PIVC that is being&#xD;
      used. Roughly there are two types of PIVCs. One with an open injection valve and another with&#xD;
      a closed injection valve. The former being far more used in our hospital and the latter being&#xD;
      suggested as lowering the risk of PIVC-related infection compared to the open one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim with this study is to evaluate the incidence of PIVC-colonization in&#xD;
      300 patients at our 500-bed secondary level hospital in Sweden, as a first step in trying to&#xD;
      understand what healthcare-providers can improve regarding prevention of PIVC-related&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral intravenous cannulas (PIVCs) are utilized in large scale in modern health care.&#xD;
      Known complications due to a PIVC are phlebitis, thrombosis, bleeding, nerve damage and&#xD;
      infection. PIVC-related infection causes morbidity, mortality and increased healthcare costs.&#xD;
      In an Australian study the investigators found the presence of a PIVC the most frequent cause&#xD;
      (36%) of healthcare-associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia during 2012. PIVC-related&#xD;
      infections can and should be prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indwell time is a known risk factor for PIVC-related infection. Another factor potentially&#xD;
      influencing the risk of developing PIVC-related infection is what type of PIVC that is being&#xD;
      used. Roughly there are two types of PIVCs. One with an open injection valve and another with&#xD;
      a closed injection valve. The former being far more used in Ryhov County Hospital, Sweden,&#xD;
      and the latter being suggested as lowering the risk of PIVC-related infection compared to the&#xD;
      open one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a systematic review from 2006 Maki et al report a point incidence of blood stream&#xD;
      infections of 0,5 per 1000 catheter-days in PIVCs. In 2014 Hammarskjöld reported an incidence&#xD;
      of 0,6 per 1000 catheter-days regarding central venous catheters (CVC). Maki et al concludes&#xD;
      &quot;…, infection control programs must strive to consistently apply essential control measures&#xD;
      and preventive technologies with all types of intravascular devices.&quot; The investigators find&#xD;
      there is a gap between the large scale utilization of PIVCs and the knowledge about&#xD;
      PIVC-related infections and recommendations on how to prevent them. Hammarskjöld et al has&#xD;
      done research on infections related to CVCs, subcutaneous venous ports and on arterial&#xD;
      cannulas but not PIVCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim with this study is to evaluate the incidence of PIVC-colonization at Ryhov County&#xD;
      Hospital, a 500-bed secondary level hospital in Sweden, as a first step in trying to&#xD;
      understand what can be done to improve work regarding prevention of PIVC-related infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting The hospital is a 500-bed general county hospital including most medical, oncological&#xD;
      and surgical specialties except neurosurgery and cardiac surgery. No solid organ or stem cell&#xD;
      transplantations are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Patients admitted to surgical, medical or infectious wards were regularly included&#xD;
      by a specifically trained nurse from June 2016 until December 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Patients ≥ 18 years of age with a PIVC in situ for 48 hours or more&#xD;
      informed verbally and in written and invited to take part in the study. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
      Patients &lt; 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological methods Intraluminal hub culturing from the two injection sites of the PIVC&#xD;
      performed with sterile cotton-tipped applicators moistened with sterile sodium chloride 0,9&#xD;
      %. Swabs transported in Amies medium with charcoal. Identification performed by standard&#xD;
      methods at our local microbiology laboratory (www.srga.org.accessed _ http://&#xD;
      www.srga.org.accessed/ _ January 1, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Descriptive. How many positive cultures and which type of microbes were found.&#xD;
