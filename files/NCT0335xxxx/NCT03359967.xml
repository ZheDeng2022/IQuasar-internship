      The CHILISALT Study aimed to explore the effect of angiotensin-neprilysin inhibition on&#xD;
      intrathoracic impedance and -derived fluid index in HFrEF patients who had a device for&#xD;
      cardiac resynchronization therapy and/or an implantable cardioverter-deﬁbrillator (ICD;&#xD;
      Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN) allowing continuous measurement of intrathoracic impedance.&#xD;

      Background Cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) that are improving clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in selected heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients also&#xD;
      collect valuable diagnostic information from continuous monitoring of several physiological&#xD;
      variables such as intrathoracic electrical impedance. Intrathoracic electrical impedance&#xD;
      monitoring has been used as a tool to evaluate pulmonary congestion. Intrathoracic impedance&#xD;
      is inversely correlated to pulmonary volume expansion and has been linked to cardiac ﬁlling&#xD;
      pressures. Decreasing in intrathoracic impedance and -derived fluid indices such as OptiVol&#xD;
      Fluid Index, has been shown to predict heart failure hospitalizations and all-cause mortality&#xD;
      in patients with HFrEF. Furthermore, studies also have shown the usefulness of monitoring&#xD;
      impedance to initiate timely interventions preventing decompensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with symptomatic HFrEF, the PARADIGM-HF trial demonstrated that&#xD;
      sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the primary endpoint of cardiovascular mortality&#xD;
      and heart failure hospitalization, compared with enalapril. The rate of all-cause mortality&#xD;
      was also significantly reduced. Subsequently, Sacubitril/Valsartan is recommended by current&#xD;
      guidelines as foundational therapy for many patients with symptomatic HFrEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However as a natriuretic agent, effects of Sacubitril/Valsartan treatment on intrathoracic&#xD;
      impedance and fluid index remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The CHILISALT Study aimed to explore the effect of angiotensin-neprilysin&#xD;
      inhibition on intrathoracic impedance and fluid index values in HFrEF patients who were&#xD;
      implanted with a device for cardiac resynchronization therapy and/or an implantable&#xD;
      cardioverter-deﬁbrillator (ICD; Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN) allowing continuous&#xD;
      measurement of intrathoracic impedance and OptiVol Fluid Index. Main outcome parameters are&#xD;
      the change in intrathoracic impedanceand OptiVol Index values between baseline (before&#xD;
      Sacubutril/Valsartan treatment) and, 14th and 28th days of Sacubutril/Valsartan treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods CHILISALT Study will designed as national, multicentre,&#xD;
      non-interventional, observational, single arm cohort study. Study population will identified&#xD;
      from dedicated CIED Clinics from participating centres. Patients will eligible if they had&#xD;
      already taking Sacubitril/Valsartan for ≥2 weeks and had been implanted with CIED for ≥3&#xD;
      months. Additionally, eligible patients must have a CIED before Sacubitril/Valsartan&#xD;
      prescription date. Due to descriptive (proof of mechanism) design of the CHILISALT Study a&#xD;
      formal population volume calculation will not be made. However, after minimum 24 patients&#xD;
      included an interim analysis will be done in terms of changes in impedance values and other&#xD;
      related parameters between baseline and after Sacubitril/Valsartan treatment. An independent&#xD;
      data monitoring committee will decide to enrol or to finalize the study according to main&#xD;
      outcome variable distribution. Main outcome parameters are the change in intrathoracic&#xD;
      impedance and OptiVol Fluid index values between baseline (before Sacubutril/Valsartan&#xD;
      treatment) and, 14th and 28th days of Sacubutril/Valsartan treatment. As a tool to evaluate&#xD;
      pulmonary fluid status, intrathoracic impedance measuring quantiﬁes impedance changes. CIEDs&#xD;
      measured intrathoracic impedance (ohms) using the RV-coil to can vector. Impedance-derived&#xD;
      fluid index will obtained using a cumulative sum mathematical model that calculates the&#xD;
      differences between impedance measured in ohms (measured impedance) and a reference&#xD;
      impedance. OptiVol Fluid index will be expressed in ohm-days. It was demonstrated that the&#xD;
      index value exceeded 60 ohm-days, the crossing of this threshold value predicted both&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality. Other possible confounders such as change in body weight&#xD;
      (kilogram), current diuretic dose (miligram per day), requirement of intravenous diuretic&#xD;
      therapy (yes/no), and the change from baseline to 28th day of the treatment in the clinical&#xD;
      summary score on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ; on a scale from 0 to&#xD;
      100, with higher scores indicating fewer symptoms and physical limitations associated with&#xD;
      heart failure) is selected as secondary outcomes.&#xD;
