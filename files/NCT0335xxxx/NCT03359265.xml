  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction (ED) is common, and is defined as &quot;persistent or regular inability to&#xD;
      achieve or maintain penis erection for satisfactory intercourse&quot;. Approximately 3% to 71% of&#xD;
      males have this problem as they age, and it is predicted that 320 million males worldwide&#xD;
      will have ED by 2025. However, sex remains a topic that is too sensitive for most people to&#xD;
      discuss openly. ED therapies include oral medication, vacuum erection devices,&#xD;
      intracavernosal injection, testosterone supplementation, surgery, and psychological&#xD;
      counseling. In addition, germanium (Ge), titanium (Ti), and π elements are noble metals that&#xD;
      can be used to produce far-infrared radiation. There has been little application of these&#xD;
      metals to the treatment of ED, but their use is worth investigating. Administered as health&#xD;
      textiles, the application of these metals are expected to promote blood circulation,&#xD;
      especially in the reproductive system, resulting in an improved sexual performance. Hence,&#xD;
      the researcher aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Ge-Ti-π elements fiber&#xD;
      textiles as an ED treatment, assessed by using the questionnaires related to the quality of&#xD;
      sexual function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial recruited 30 subjects with ED (a test group of 21 subjects and a control&#xD;
      group of 9 subjects). Cellulosic textiles, incorporating noble metals (Ge, Ti, and π&#xD;
      elements), developed by Green Energy Nano Technology Co., Ltd, were used in the test group,&#xD;
      while commercially available regular textiles were used in the control group. The safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the treatment to the subject's sexual function quality were assessed through the&#xD;
      International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) and the validated Portuguese version of the&#xD;
      Quality of Erection Questionnaire (QEQ) questionnaires. In the same session, the symptoms&#xD;
      related to ED were assessed through the Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) and the&#xD;
      International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaires. The questionnaires were completed&#xD;
      once a month and followed up for 3 months. The incidence of severe adverse effects was&#xD;
      analyzed to assess product safety.&#xD;

    <measure>The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>IIEF-5 is a multidimensional validated questionnaire with 15 questions in the five domains of sexual function, such as erectile and orgasmic functions, sexual desire, satisfaction with intercourse, and overall sexual satisfaction. IIEF-5 scoring:&#xD;
The IIEF-5 score is the sum of the ordinal responses to the 5 items. 22-25: No erectile dysfunction 17-21: Mild erectile dysfunction 12-16: Mild to moderate erectile dysfunction 8-11: Moderate erectile dysfunction 5-7: Severe erectile dysfunction</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Erection Questionnaire (QEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>QEQ is a questionnaire that provides a further level of information by assessing satisfaction with the quality of the erections that were attained and maintained. QEQ is to be evaluated as a total score, which is the sum of responses to all items transformed onto a 5-30 scale.&#xD;
The maximum score on the QEQ is 30, and a higher score indicates better function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>PEDT has been shown to be valid in detecting the presence of premature ejaculation among patients with five questions. Each item has a score of zero to four, and PEDT is scored by considering all five items together, which a higher score indicates highly suggestive of premature ejaculation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>IPSS is a well-known questionnaire to evaluate the symptom of prostate disease in patients. The answers are assigned points from 0 to 5. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic).</description>
