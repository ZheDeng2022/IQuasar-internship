      To determine the effect of re-activation of brain glucose metabolism induced by&#xD;
      dichloroacetate (DCA) on cognitive function and counterregulatory hormone responses in&#xD;
      patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) with recurrent hypoglycemia.&#xD;

      This will be a single center, placebo-controlled, cross-over, randomized clinical pilot&#xD;
      study. The screening will take place at the Yale New Haven Hospital Research Unit (HRU) 10th&#xD;
      floor, East Pavilion at 20 York St., New Haven, CT. At the screening visit informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained. Medical history and documents will be reviewed to screen potential subjects&#xD;
      by inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects will receive a physical examination and&#xD;
      laboratory blood work (BUN/creatinine, electrolytes, lipid profile, liver function, and&#xD;
      HbA1c) as well as urine toxicology screens (to confirm self-report of alcohol, and drug&#xD;
      information) to ensure good physical health.&#xD;
