  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
      immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of AK105 as a single agent in&#xD;
      adult subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies. The study consists of a dose&#xD;
      escalation phase (Phase 1a) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for AK105 as a single agent, and a dose expansion phase (Phase 1b) in&#xD;
      subjects with specific tumor types which will characterize treatment of AK105 as a single&#xD;
      agent at the MTD or RP2D.&#xD;
