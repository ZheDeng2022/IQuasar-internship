      The linked HFE genetic hemochromatosis (C282Y mutation in the homozygous state) is the most&#xD;
      common form of genetic iron overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its treatment is based on bloodletting, and takes place in 2 phases, according to the&#xD;
      recommendations of the High Authority of Health (HAS). The first phase, called induction,&#xD;
      aims to achieve ferritinemia &lt;50 by performing weekly bleeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase, called maintenance, aims to maintain this ferritinemia &lt;50 by performing&#xD;
      bleeding every 1 to 6 months depending on the case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is therefore according to the current recommendations only adapted according to&#xD;
      ferritinemia, and not according to the effectiveness on the functional symptoms. However,&#xD;
      some patients report persistent asthenia during maintenance treatment, despite ferritin&#xD;
      levels &lt;50. This could reflect an incomplete control of their disease, and leads us to raise&#xD;
      two points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is known that in some subjects, the Transferrin Saturation Coefficient remains high,&#xD;
           despite ferritinemia &lt;50; it is also known that this elevation of the Transferrin&#xD;
           Saturation Coefficient may be accompanied by a rise in circulating free iron, which is&#xD;
           toxic for the organism1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The asthenia observed in some patients in the maintenance phase could be linked to a&#xD;
           high rate of Transferrin Saturation Coefficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to evaluate, in patients homozygous C282Y in maintenance phase, the&#xD;
      association between quality of life and Transferrin Saturation Coefficient .&#xD;
