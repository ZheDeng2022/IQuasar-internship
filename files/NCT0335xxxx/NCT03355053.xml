  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep deprivation is common and severe in critically ill patients cared for in intensive care&#xD;
      units (ICUs), and is hypothesized to be a key modifiable risk factor for delirium and&#xD;
      long-term cognitive disability. Dexmedetomidine reduces the incidence of delirium in ICU&#xD;
      patients by unknown mechanisms. This project will determine whether dexmedetomidine reduces&#xD;
      delirium by improving sleep, whether bolus dosing vs continuous infusion is better, and the&#xD;
      relationship of sleep quality to long-term cognitive outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep deprivation is among the most common complaints about the ICU experience. ICU sleep&#xD;
      tends to be light and non-restorative (as opposed to deep / restorative sleep), severely&#xD;
      fragmented, and distributed throughout the day and night rather than consolidated into&#xD;
      nighttime hours. Sleep deprived patients suffer from sleep debt, a condition of impaired&#xD;
      attention and memory, and cognitive slowing. Sleep disturbances in the ICU arise not only&#xD;
      from light and noise pollution, but also from drugs that interfere with brain activity&#xD;
      involved in restorative sleep. Sleep deprivation has also been suggested as a major&#xD;
      modifiable risk factors for acute encephalopathy, also known as delirium. Delirium is an&#xD;
      acute state of confusion that affects up to 80% of ICU patients, and is one of six leading&#xD;
      causes of preventable morbidity and mortality in hospitalized elderly patients. Many patients&#xD;
      who survive delirium experience long-term cognitive impairment and loss of independence.&#xD;
      Current medications used in the ICU to treat sleep problems (e.g. benzodiazepines,&#xD;
      antipsychotics) do not induce natural sleep and do not prevent delirium. In contrast, the&#xD;
      investigators have found that the Î±2-adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine can induce&#xD;
      biomimetic sleep, a brain state whose pattern of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity,&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow, and functional connectivity approximates restorative sleep. Moreover, a&#xD;
      recent large clinical trial in post-surgical patients suggests that low-dose dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      given overnight substantially reduces the risk of delirium. It is unknown whether this&#xD;
      benefit is linked to improved sleep, or whether patients with better sleep while in the ICU&#xD;
      have better long-term cognitive outcomes. The investigator's central hypothesis is that sleep&#xD;
      deprivation substantially mediates both the short- and long-term cognitive impairments&#xD;
      associated with delirium in critical illness. To test this hypothesis, this study is designed&#xD;
      to systematically determine 1) the impact of prophylactic dexmedetomidine on sleep quality,&#xD;
      2) the optimal way to give dexmedetomidine (all night vs at the beginning of the night only),&#xD;
      2) the impact of sleep deprivation on short-term cognitive function and delirium, and 3) the&#xD;
      contribution of sleep deprivation to long-term neuropsychiatric outcome following critical&#xD;
      illness. At the conclusion of these studies, the investigators will have expanded knowledge&#xD;
      of sleep physiology in critical illness and relationship of sleep with delirium; evaluated a&#xD;
      new preemptive therapeutic strategy to promote sleep and prevent delirium, and developed an&#xD;
      understanding of how sleep impacts neuropsychological outcomes after critical illness. These&#xD;
      studies will thus will provide crucial guidance for individualized approaches to preserving&#xD;
      long-term brain health in this vulnerable patient population.&#xD;
