      The primary aim of this study is to assess whether physical activity programs in preterm&#xD;
      infants improve bone mineralization as well as growth and reduce the risk of fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to include other potential benefits in terms of length of hospital stay,&#xD;
      weaning from mechanical ventilation, feeding tolerance and adverse events&#xD;

      This is a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial that will be conducted on 36 VLBW&#xD;
      preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) - Ain Shams University&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the newborns included in the study will be subjected to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comprehensive history taking including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Antenatal history: Maternal age, maternal diseases, maternal diabetic control,&#xD;
                maternal infection (STORCH infection), maternal medication during this pregnancy,&#xD;
                and last menstrual period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Natal history: Gestational age, neonatal sex and mode of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Postnatal history: Respiratory distress and cyanosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Family history: Consanguinity, congenital anomalies, previous abortion, sibling&#xD;
                death, and still birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Thorough clinical examination with particular emphasis on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of gestational age based on last menstrual period and confirmed by&#xD;
                ultrasonography in early pregnancy if possible and Ballard scores&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete examination including cardiac, chest, abdominal, and neurological&#xD;
                examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample size calculation and Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sample size was calculated using power and sample size calculation program and was&#xD;
           based on the previously reported intervention changes in Bone mineral density (BMD)&#xD;
           following assisted exercise. A mean difference of 5.3 mg cm2 between the groups, with a&#xD;
           standard deviation of 5.6 mg cm2 was used, based on the study by Considering a 0.05&#xD;
           significance level and power equal to 80%, an n of 19 patients per group was determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who will meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized into the physical&#xD;
           exercise (n=18) and control (n=18) groups. Randomization will be made by birth order;&#xD;
           the first born preterm infant will be recruited to the exercise group, the second to the&#xD;
           control group, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Standard neonatal care:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Babies admitted to NICU bathed, placed in incubator, attached to monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cannula inserted, IV fluids is started (Dexstrose10%) and IV antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If there is respiratory distress: O2 or ventilation is started, usually feeds are&#xD;
                delayed to day 2 or day 3 (or even later) according the severity of condition&#xD;
                (clinical decision according to the attending neonatologist).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If no distress and the baby is well: trophic feeds is started (10ml/kg/day milk),&#xD;
                feeds is increased in 10-20ml/kg/day according to baby tolerance, and the condition&#xD;
                of the baby (clinical decision according to the attending neonatologist), IV fluids&#xD;
                are reduced gradually.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Exercise protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The exercise protocol was designed for Infants in treatment and control groups received&#xD;
           well defined interventions applied by the same trained occupational therapist, described&#xD;
           as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the exercise group, systematic physical activity programs consisting of&#xD;
           range-of-motion exercises with gentle compression, extension and flexion of all joints&#xD;
           of both bilateral upper extremities; including the shoulder, elbow, and wrist and lower&#xD;
           extremities; including the hip, knee and ankle, with a total of 12 joints. Each activity&#xD;
           was about 10 min a day and was carried out 5 times per week for 4 weeks. This program&#xD;
           was started after 1 week of birth. Physical activity continued until discharge from&#xD;
           hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Because tactile stimulation might have influenced growth and development, control&#xD;
           subjects had a daily interactive period of holding and stroking but no range-of-motion&#xD;
           activity. The time schedule of each activity was the same as the exercise group. Other&#xD;
           routine care activities such as bathing (every day) and kangaroo care (30 minutes/day),&#xD;
           will be done for both the control and exercise group subjects according to the neonatal&#xD;
           intensive care unit (NICU) recommendations, however, without movement and standardized&#xD;
           articular compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Laboratory investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete blood count with differential leucocytic count.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum calcium concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum phosphorous concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum magnesium concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum alkaline phosphates concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum carboxy-terminal cross linked telopeptides of type 1 collagen (CTX).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urinary calcium/phosphorous ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All the previous investigations will be done before at after the end of the exercise&#xD;
           protocol for patients and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Bone mineralization will be assessed by measured by dual- energy x- ray absorptiometry&#xD;
           (DEXA) :&#xD;
&#xD;
           DEXA evaluates body composition (total body will be done after the end of the exercise&#xD;
           protocol for patients and control groups by measuring:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bone mineral Content (BMC, mg),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bone Mineral Density (BMD, mg/ cm2),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bone area (BA/ cm2),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lean mass (LM, g) and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fat mass (g).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected data will be used for study purpose only. The mothers of the newborns under study&#xD;
      will be informed about the purpose of the study and the plan of work before agreeing to&#xD;
      participate. They will be provided informed consent before the testing began. Study protocol&#xD;
      will be presented to and approved by the Ethical Committee of the Scientific Research-Ain&#xD;
      Shams University.&#xD;
