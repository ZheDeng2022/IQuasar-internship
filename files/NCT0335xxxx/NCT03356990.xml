  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to learn more about how to help people who have chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      (CKD). This study will increase the investigators understanding of how diet affects factors&#xD;
      that can slow the progression of kidney disease. The investigators are asking 30 adults and&#xD;
      30 children with stage 3 CKD to be part of this study. Participants will supplement their&#xD;
      diet with resistant starch for two weeks. The investigators anticipate that the resistant&#xD;
      starch will change the bacteria in the intestines to a more beneficial type of bacteria. The&#xD;
      investigators will measure a product of these beneficial bacteria called butyrate. The&#xD;
      investigators will also determine changes in the gut bacteria and products of the bacteria in&#xD;
      the blood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD), a progressive decline in kidney function, is a growing health&#xD;
      problem: 13% of adults in the US have CKD. Among patients with CKD, the risk of progression&#xD;
      to irreversible loss of kidney function (end-stage renal disease, ESRD) is about 1% per year.&#xD;
      In addition, adjusted mortality is approximately four times greater among those with CKD&#xD;
      compared to those without. For ESRD, apart from dialysis and kidney transplant, no treatment&#xD;
      exists. CKD increases urea levels in bodily fluids leading to a dominance of&#xD;
      urease-containing bacteria in the gut. Such dysbiosis results in decreased production of the&#xD;
      short chain fatty acid, butyrate and decreased health of the colonic epithelial barrier.&#xD;
      Consequently, bacterial toxins translocate into the bloodstream, promoting inflammation.&#xD;
      Moreover, production of uremic toxins such as indoxyl and p-cresyl sulfates are also&#xD;
      increased, resulting in further kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CKD patients are prescribed a diet low in protein, fiber and symbiotic organisms, which&#xD;
      reduces complications like hyperkalemia, but also contributes to the dysbiosis.&#xD;
      Re-formulating the CKD diet may improve the clinical management of CKD. The investigators's&#xD;
      overall hypothesis is that changes in the microbial diversity, xeno-proteins and&#xD;
      xeno-metabolites correlate with CKD progression, and microbiome-directed therapies can be&#xD;
      used to slow the disease. In this study, the investigators will determine the tolerability of&#xD;
      supplemental resistant starch (RS). Secondary aims are to determine if a diet high in&#xD;
      resistant starch changes fecal butyrate concentrations, the make-up of the gut microbiome and&#xD;
      the concentrations in the blood of uremic toxins produced by the gut microbiome. This study&#xD;
      will help in the design of a future study with the aim of understanding if a high resistant&#xD;
      starch diet can slow the progression of chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
