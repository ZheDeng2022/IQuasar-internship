      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of multi-antigen cytomegalovirus&#xD;
      (CMV)-modified vaccinia ankara vaccine and to see how well it works in treating pediatric&#xD;
      patients with positive cytomegalovirus who are undergoing donor stem cell transplant.&#xD;
      Multi-antigen CMV-modified vaccinia ankara vaccine may help people resist CMV&#xD;
      life-threatening complications.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the optimal dose of multi-antigen CMV-modified vaccinia ankara vaccine&#xD;
      (Triplex) in CMV-positive pediatric patients receiving human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched,&#xD;
      mismatched, or haploid-identical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). (Phase I) II. To&#xD;
      evaluate the safety profile of Triplex in this patient population. (Phase I) III. To&#xD;
      determine if Triplex reduces the frequency of CMV events when compared to historical data.&#xD;
      (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize CMV reactivation and disease by assessing: time to CMV reactivation,&#xD;
      duration of viremia, recurrence of viremia, incidence of late CMV viremia/disease (defined as&#xD;
      &gt; 100 days and =&lt; 365 days post HCT), use of anti-viral drugs triggered by rising CMV viremia&#xD;
      or viremia &gt;= 3750 IU/mL, cumulative number of CMV specific antiviral treatment days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the impact of Triplex on transplant related outcomes by assessing the&#xD;
      incidence of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), relapse, non-relapse&#xD;
      mortality (NRM), all-cause mortality, infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate the impact of Triplex on cellular immunity by investigating: the level,&#xD;
      function and kinetics of CMV-specific T-cell immunity, the changes in adaptive natural killer&#xD;
      (NK) cell population and highly cytotoxic memory NKG2C+ NK cells, and changes in GVHD&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive multi-antigen CMV-modified vaccinia ankara vaccine intramuscularly (IM) on&#xD;
      days 28 and 56 post-HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 270 or 365 days.&#xD;
