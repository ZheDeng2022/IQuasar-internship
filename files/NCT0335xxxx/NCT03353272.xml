  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Despite similar treatment outcomes for surgery or conservative care, the number&#xD;
      of surgeries for the care of rotator cuff (RTC) related shoulder pain has increased. With the&#xD;
      increase in surgery, there is an increased risk of harms, increased costs, and high re-tear&#xD;
      rates. Patient expectations are beliefs or attitudes that include pre-treatment thoughts and&#xD;
      beliefs regarding the need for specific treatment methods and the timing and intensity of&#xD;
      these methods. Brief interventions designed to alter and enhance treatment expectations for&#xD;
      conservative care and have been shown to improve patient expectations, but to date, no&#xD;
      studies have explored whether such interventions can influence patient decisions to pursue&#xD;
      surgical care. The investigators propose a comprehensive intervention that involves Patient&#xD;
      Engagement Education, and Restructuring of Cognitions (PEERC) that is designed to change&#xD;
      expectations, will reduce the likelihood that patients will choose to have shoulder surgery&#xD;
      and improve functional outcomes. The cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches that form&#xD;
      the core of our PEERC protocol are patient-centered and are designed to empower the patient&#xD;
      in their own recovery process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose/Aims: To examine the effect of the PEERC protocol on the decision to have surgery&#xD;
      (primary), and improve global well-being, pain catastrophizing, pain, functional outcomes,&#xD;
      and follow up expectations (secondary).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, Discharge (estimated 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Numeric Pain Scale- The NRS for pain is scaled from 0 to 10 (11 point scale) and is based on pain intensity. Overall pain intensity will be queried where 0/10 represents no pain and 10/10 represents the worst pain possible.</description>

    <measure>Change in GRoC - Global rate of change</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, Discharge (estimated 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Rating of Change (GRoC) asks patients to report their global rating of change (GROC) relative to physical function, using a 7-point ordinal scale (where -7 much worse and +7 much better).</description>

    <measure>Change in SPADI - Shoulder Pain and Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, Discharge (estimated 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The SPADI contains 13 items that assess two domains; a 5-item subscale that measures pain and an 8-item subscale that measures disability</description>

    <measure>Change in MODEMS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, Discharge (estimated 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The MODEMS patient expectation scale has been used by a number of studies and has shown validity in predicting outcomes in conservative and surgical interventions. As we previously stated, the instrument is a Likert-based scoring tool with a mean score of 5 out of 5 (indicating high expectations of positive outcomes) and a mean score of 1 out of 5 (indicating very poor expectations of positive outcomes)30</description>

    <measure>Change in TEGNER</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Discharge (estimated 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Tegner Activity Scale measures the patient's perspective of function and activity as a numerical value between 0 (complete disability) to 10 (elite athletics)</description>

    <measure>OSPRO 10 - Optimal Screening for Prediction of Referral and Outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Optimal Screening for Prediction of Referral and Outcome-10. The OSPRO is a review-of-systems screening tool that includes constructs associated with comorbidities, negative mood, quality of life, pain, and function</description>

    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
