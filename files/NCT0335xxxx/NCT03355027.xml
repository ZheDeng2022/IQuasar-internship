    <textblock>
      The INTENSITY-HIGH study aims to answer if there are any limits to LDL reduction in relation&#xD;
      to benefiting vascular health, exploring the mechanisms by which secondary prevention in&#xD;
      patients with established heart disease may benefit from even lower LDL levels. By using&#xD;
      PCSK9 inhibitors such as Alirocumab, very low LDL cholesterol levels not previously&#xD;
      encountered in statin trials, can be achieved in patients with established heart disease on&#xD;
      top of intensive statin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is being carried out because it is unclear what the lowest threshold of LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol should be to attain significant reductions in CV risk in stable cardiovascular&#xD;
      patients. It is unknown whether there is a true limit of LDL cholesterol below which there is&#xD;
      no further improvement in endothelial function in stable cardiovascular patients, and,&#xD;
      whether this is associated with a reduction in markers of both systemic and vascular&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defining this may help identify individuals from the general population who may benefit from&#xD;
      more aggressive lipid lowering treatment than standard statin treatment in terms of CV&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in patients with stable cardiovascular disease, where they will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive either a combination of Alirocumab and statin, or Ezetimibe plus&#xD;
      statin. 60 patients will be recruited to this single center, randomized, open label, parallel&#xD;
      group, mechanistic physiological study which will be conducted at Cambridge University&#xD;
      Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. In order to be eligible for enrollment to the study, some&#xD;
      patients may have to complete a 4 week washout period on a suitable statin therapy. The total&#xD;
      study duration for each participant will be approximately 14 weeks, where a series of&#xD;
      non-invasive vascular studies and medical imaging assessments which will be conducted to&#xD;
      observe vascular/systemic inflammation and to assess endothelial vascular function.This study&#xD;
      is funded by JP Moulton Charitable Foundation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The INTENSITY-HIGH study primarily seeks to explore the physiological mechanisms (mainly&#xD;
      using endothelial function and vascular imaging of inflammation) by which secondary&#xD;
      prevention in patients with established cardiovascular disease may benefit from even lower&#xD;
      LDL levels using PCSK9 therapies. This will then set the basis for potential changes to&#xD;
      guidelines about what a &quot;healthy cholesterol&quot; level should be and the targets these should be&#xD;
      achieving, or indeed if there is a plateau beyond which there is no further benefit on&#xD;
      surrogates of CV disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial function can be measured in the peripheral vasculature in a number of different&#xD;
      ways, which include venous occlusion plethysmography with intra-arterial infusions of&#xD;
      acetylcholine, ischemia flow-mediated endothelium-dependent dilatation (FMD) of the brachial&#xD;
      artery, reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) and others. A venous&#xD;
      plethysmography measure of forearm blood flow to intra-arterial acetylcholine infusion is the&#xD;
      most sensitive and direct measurement of endothelium release of nitric oxides, but is more&#xD;
      invasive than other techniques. FMD is non-invasive and measures changes in the brachial&#xD;
      artery to ischemia. It is acknowledged that whilst FMD has a larger coefficient variation and&#xD;
      is more technician dependent, it is more patient-friendly in that it is of shorter duration&#xD;
      procedure wise, is non-invasive and is repeatable over a short period; therefore we have&#xD;
      employed this technique in this study to improve chances of patient acceptability. RH-PAT is&#xD;
      an alternative non-invasive assessment which measures volume changes at the fingertip (a&#xD;
      surrogate of reactive hyperemia), is easy to implement and is not operator dependent.&#xD;
      However, as yet it remains not well validated. Therefore, flow mediated dilatation has been&#xD;
      selected for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolically active inflammatory cells utilize more glucose than non-activated cells, and&#xD;
      the degree of metabolic activity can be measured using 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron&#xD;
      emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT). Cellular FDG uptake is largely&#xD;
      irreversible and correlates with glucose usage and macrophage numbers in both tumor cells and&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaques [38, 39]. FDG PET imaging has been successfully used to determine&#xD;
      culprit plaques responsible for TIA and stroke [4042]. The signal has also been shown to be&#xD;
      responsive to therapy, with clear reductions in FDG uptake noted in both humans and animal&#xD;
      models of atherosclerosis [43, 44]. In addition, very recently, it has been shown that&#xD;
      FDG-PET/CT is a reliable technique to assess changes in plaque structure with good&#xD;
      reproducibility [40]. Taken together, these findings suggest a role for FDG PET/CT imaging in&#xD;
      the assessment of the antiinflammatory potential of novel compounds such as PCSK9 therapies.&#xD;
