  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the full study is to determine whether multimodal analgesia for hip&#xD;
      arthroscopy will reduce post-operative pain scores, narcotic consumption and hospital&#xD;
      length-of-stay. To do this, the investigators will compare the standard of care (SOC), with&#xD;
      routine pain management with a post-operative opioid prescription, to three different groups&#xD;
      with multi-modal analgesia (SOC+peri-operative celecoxib, SOC+peri-operative gabapentin, and&#xD;
      SOC+post-operative zopiclone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that administration of multi-modal analgesia in all three&#xD;
      treatment groups will result in improved post-operative pain control, reduced post-operative&#xD;
      narcotic consumption and an overall reduction in post-operative length-of-stay compared to&#xD;
      the group receiving treatment as per the standard of care. However, prior to undertaking a&#xD;
      large multi-centre study, the investigators need to determine whether the study is feasible&#xD;
      from data obtained with this pilot study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will be a randomized controlled trial, where the surgical team, data&#xD;
      collector, and patient will be blinded to the treatment received. The investigators will&#xD;
      include any patient between the ages of 18 and 60 years undergoing hip arthroscopy by one of&#xD;
      three fellowship-trained hip arthroscopists. The investigators will exclude patients with any&#xD;
      radiographic signs of osteoarthritis (Tönnis grade 2 or higher), an American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification of 3 or higher, allergies to sulfa-based drugs,&#xD;
      adverse reactions to any of the potential study medications, or a history of chronic pain or&#xD;
      substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio into one of four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1 - Standard of Care (SOC): Opioid medication (Oxycodone-acetaminophen 5 mg/325&#xD;
           mg, 1-2 tabs every 6 hours as needed), Heterotopic ossification prophylaxis - Naprosyn&#xD;
           500 mg twice daily x 3 weeks);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2 - SOC + Post-operative sleeping aid (Zopiclone 7.5 mg nightly x 7 days);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group 3 - SOC + Pre-operative and Post-operative Gabapentin (600 mg orally, 1 hour&#xD;
           pre-operatively; 600 mg 8 hours post-operatively);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Group 4 - SOC + Pre-medicate with Celebrex (400 mg orally, 1 hour pre-operatively)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the research team will ensure that the surgeons, data collectors, and patients&#xD;
      remain blinded to the treatment group and by performing all randomization and medication&#xD;
      administration. For those patients randomized to the celebrex or gabapentin groups, a dose of&#xD;
      each respective medication will be administered 1 hour before arthroscopic surgery. To&#xD;
      maintain blinding, patients in the SOC group and zopiclone groups will receive a&#xD;
      lactose-based placebo at the same time. Post-operatively, patients randomized to the&#xD;
      zopiclone group will receive a prescription to be taken at night. Patients in the other three&#xD;
      groups will receive lactose-based placebo pills for the same duration, again to maintain&#xD;
      blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive similar treatment for their hip arthroscopy. All surgeries will be&#xD;
      performed in the supine position utilizing a hip distraction system (Smith and Nephew,&#xD;
      Andover MA). The procedure will be performed with use of a general anesthetic without&#xD;
      regional anesthesia. Pathology will be identified and treated at the discretion of the&#xD;
      primary surgeon. Patients will receive a standardized anesthetic regimen intra-operatively.&#xD;
      Portal sites will be injected with a total of 20cc of bupivacaine. Following the procedure,&#xD;
      all patients will be managed with a standardized post-operative analgesic regimen and&#xD;
      subsequently discharged with a prescription for oral analgesics and prophylaxis against&#xD;
      heterotopic ossification. Patients will be instructed to retain and return any unused&#xD;
      narcotics at subsequent follow-up at the 2-week post-operative visit. Patients will be&#xD;
      encouraged to request additional prescriptions through their surgeons' office for tracking,&#xD;
      although a chart review will be performed to evaluate for any additional emergency department&#xD;
      visits post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect demographic information, including age and sex, and&#xD;
      intra-operative data as to the surgical procedures performed including potential confounders&#xD;
      like the duration of traction time, and dose of intraoperative narcotics. The investigators&#xD;
      will measure pain preoperatively using a pain visual analog scale (VAS). Postoperatively,&#xD;
      patients will again be evaluated for pain with using the same VAS at 1 hour, 2 hours, 6&#xD;
      hours, 24 hours, daily for 7 days and every other day for 6 weeks. Post-operatively, in&#xD;
      hospital complications including nausea/vomiting/urinary retention will be recorded. Patient&#xD;
      satisfaction will also be evaluated at 24 hours, 48 hours, daily for 7 days and every other&#xD;
      day for 6 weeks. The total quantity of narcotics consumed will be calculated after accounting&#xD;
      for unused medications returned post-operatively and additional prescription requests.&#xD;
      Lastly, the hospital length-of-stay and associated costs will be calculated form the patients&#xD;
      hospital records. Patients will also be administered a questionnaire on cost-reporting to&#xD;
      evaluate for any costs due to visits to any emergency room, other physician, additional&#xD;
      visits to rehabilitation or pain specialists, additional medications including&#xD;
      over-the-counter medications obtained by the patient or those prescribed by another physician&#xD;
      on a weekly basis for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will consecutively approach all patients undergoing a hip arthroscopy until&#xD;
      100 patients are eligible and give their consent to participate (approximately one year from&#xD;
      study commencement). This number of patients will provide a sufficient sample size to&#xD;
      accurately estimate the proportion of eligible patients who will give their consent (the&#xD;
      study will be sufficiently powered to provide the estimate with a 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      around the estimate where half the width of the confidence interval [CI] is no greater than&#xD;
      0.05).&#xD;
