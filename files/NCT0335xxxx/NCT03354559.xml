  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In severe trauma patients, uncontrolled bleeding is a major cause of death, partly caused by&#xD;
      trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC).TIC represents a severe post-traumatic complication&#xD;
      associated with increased transfusion requirements and worsened mortality. Fibrinolysis is a&#xD;
      central part of the TIC process. Massive Transfusion Protocols (MTPs) were introduced as part&#xD;
      of damage control resuscitation, with the aim to facilitate rapid blood product release and&#xD;
      to increase adherence to hemostatic resuscitation, In 2013, the Italian Trauma Centers&#xD;
      Network (TUN) developed a new treatment algorithm providing early coagulation support (ECS)&#xD;
      to control coagulopathy and hemorrhage in major trauma patients with a clinically relevant&#xD;
      bleeding risk. The protocol includes the use of fibrinogen concentrate and RBC during initial&#xD;
      resuscitation, and the early use of viscoelastic techniques when available&#xD;
      (thromboelastometry ROTEM® or thromboelastography TEG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this multicenter, before and after study was to assess the effects of a new ECS&#xD;
      protocol compared to the standard MTP in terms of blood products' consumption and clinical&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

      In severe trauma patients, uncontrolled bleeding is a major cause of death, partly caused by&#xD;
      trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC).TIC represents a severe post-traumatic complication&#xD;
      associated with increased transfusion requirements and worsened mortality. Fibrinolysis is a&#xD;
      central part of the TIC process. Damage control resuscitation is defined as rapid hemorrhage&#xD;
      control through early administration of blood products prevention and immediate correction of&#xD;
      coagulopathy, and minimization of crystalloid fluids. Massive Transfusion Protocols (MTPs)&#xD;
      were introduced as part of damage control resuscitation, with the aim to facilitate rapid&#xD;
      blood product release and to increase adherence to hemostatic resuscitation, following a&#xD;
      transfusion ratio of 1:1:1 of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets (PLT) and packed red blood&#xD;
      cells (pRBC). Their activation is triggered by clinical parameters, including patients'&#xD;
      trauma severity, clinical signs and laboratory data, which are included in scoring systems.&#xD;
      In 2013, the Italian Trauma Centers Network (TUN) developed a new treatment algorithm&#xD;
      providing early coagulation support (ECS) to control coagulopathy and hemorrhage in major&#xD;
      trauma patients with a clinically relevant bleeding risk. The protocol includes the use of&#xD;
      fibrinogen concentrate and RBC during initial resuscitation, and the early use of&#xD;
      viscoelastic techniques when available (thromboelastometry ROTEM® or thromboelastography&#xD;
      TEG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this multicenter, before and after study was to assess the effects of a new ECS&#xD;
      protocol compared to the standard MTP in terms of blood products' consumption and clinical&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We undertook a before and after study using historical controls. We included all consecutive&#xD;
      adult patients with major trauma at risk of bleeding admitted to the emergency department of&#xD;
      two referral Trauma Centres in Rome, Italy (i.e. Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.&#xD;
      Gemelli and S. Camillo Hospital). Patients treated in 2011-2012 were compared to patients&#xD;
      treated in 2013-2014. In the second period, the ECS protocol was concomitantly implemented as&#xD;
      standard of care in both trauma centers. Informed consent was waived as all the procedures&#xD;
      were considered the standard of care in both periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the control period (pre-ECS), patients were treated according to a MTP with the&#xD;
      following targets: FFP/PRBC ratio ≥ 1:1.5, target platelet count &gt; 100.000 x 109/L. According&#xD;
      to the ECS protocol applied in the study period, all included patients received an &quot;initial&#xD;
      resuscitation&quot; ,defined as the period between hospital admission and the first available&#xD;
      coagulation results (coagulation screen, fibrinogen level and/or viscoelastic monitoring and&#xD;
      platelet count), with a fixed initial coagulation support of tranexamic acid (TA) 1 g&#xD;
      intravenous bolus over 20 min followed by 1 g in continuous infusion over 8 hours and&#xD;
      fibrinogen concentrate (FC) 2 g bolus along with 2 to 4 units of PRBCs. Point of care (POC)&#xD;
      tests were systematically used to monitor coagulation and to guide subsequent interventions.&#xD;
      FFP was not administered in the early treatment stage. Permissive hypotension (systolic&#xD;
      arterial pressure 80-90 mmHg or mean arterial 50-60 mmHg) and a fluid restrictive strategy&#xD;
      were applied until surgical bleeding control was achieved. However, when prolonged bleeding&#xD;
      occurred and an increasing number of PRBCs (&gt;4 units) and fluid volume was required (&gt;2000&#xD;
      ml), plasma was transfused for hemodynamic and hemostatic resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the electronic records were matched with the blood bank registries to confirm the&#xD;
      number of blood units transfused within the study's time span. For patients transferred from&#xD;
      other hospitals, information regarding transfusions administered before admission were&#xD;
      collected and matched with the blood banks' data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' characteristics at admission are summarized through mean and standard deviation for&#xD;
      continuous variables. Median and interquartile range for scales and scores and relative&#xD;
      frequencies are used for discrete variables. We tested the null hypothesis of no association&#xD;
      between study period and patients' characteristics with the t-test, Wilcoxon test and&#xD;
      chi-square test for the three types of variables, respectively. We estimated the mean&#xD;
      difference in transfused units and length of stay between ECS and pre-ECS from unadjusted&#xD;
      Poisson models, using the delta methods to estimate the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the&#xD;
      mean difference. Findings were robust by replacing the Poisson model with a negative binomial&#xD;
      distribution. In addition, we defined &quot;multiple transfused patients&quot; as those experiencing&#xD;
      four or more RBC units during the first 24 hours. The cut-off of four PRBC units represented&#xD;
      the sample 75th percentile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We investigated the association between clinical features and the probability of multiple&#xD;
      transfusion by means of univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. For the&#xD;
      mortality outcome, we estimated the Relative Risk (RR) and its' 95% CI of death within the&#xD;
      first 24 hours and within 28 days since admission for the post-ECS as compared to pre-ECS&#xD;
      patients from Poisson models without adjustment for other variables. Among those surviving&#xD;
      the first 24 hours, we replicated the analysis by considering death between the 2nd and the&#xD;
      28th day of hospital stay. Furthermore, we investigated whether differences in resources' use&#xD;
      and mortality between ECS and pre-ECS were related to major patients' demographic and&#xD;
      clinical features at presentation, including age (18-40, 40-65, 65+ years), severity of&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury (head AIS &lt;4 vs. ≥ 4), and trauma severity (number of critical illness&#xD;
      criteria; presence/absence of each criterion). These stratified analyses were performed&#xD;
      including a study period patients' feature interaction in separated Poisson models and by&#xD;
      formally testing the null hypothesis of equal efficacy of the ECS protocol among categories&#xD;
      of patients through an F test. To further control for any residual difference in clinical&#xD;
      features between pre and ECS groups, we compared the resource consumption, the probability of&#xD;
      multiple transfusion and the mortality outcomes among propensity-score matched patients. The&#xD;
      propensity score included the following variables: age, sex, ISS, AIS head, worse SBP, base&#xD;
      excess, lactates, hemoglobin and platelets. For the statistical analyses, we used the SAS&#xD;
      software, 9.4 release (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, US). The propensity score matching was&#xD;
      performed using a standard macro.&#xD;
