  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot multimodality treatment approach trial with androgen deprivation therapy in&#xD;
      combination with docetaxel chemotherapy followed by radical prostatectomy in patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed high-risk and oligometastatic prostate cancer. This study aims to evaluate&#xD;
      the rates of complete pathologic response (pCR) at the time of prostatectomy as well as PSA&#xD;
      response, time to PSA recurrence and safety and toxicity of the combination. This study will&#xD;
      be heavily embedded with biomarker analyses of the tumor and tumor cells in circulation as&#xD;
      well in the bone marrow before and after treatment and will also include imaging analyses&#xD;
      using a novel positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technology.&#xD;

    <description>Docetaxel is a commercially marketed product that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. It is also approved for the treatment of other malignant disease, such as locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that returns after any prior chemotherapy; locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that recurs after prior platinum-based chemotherapy. However, the FDA does not currently approve its use in patients with localized prostate cancer but no evidence of radiographic metastases.</description>
