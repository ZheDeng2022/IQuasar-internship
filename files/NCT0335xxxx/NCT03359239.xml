  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the good and bad effects of atezolizumab given in&#xD;
      combination with a personalized cancer vaccine in patients with urothelial cancer either&#xD;
      after surgery to remove organ where the tumor arose (for example, removal of the bladder) or&#xD;
      for urothelial cancer that has spread to other organs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, proof-of-concept study. Fifteen subjects with urothelial cancer&#xD;
      interested in participation will sign a &quot;tissue acquisition and vaccine preparation consent&quot;&#xD;
      after which tumor tissue will be obtained from either a surgical resection specimen or&#xD;
      biopsy. Subjects are scheduled to undergo cystectomy or nephroureterectomy for invasive&#xD;
      urothelial cancer may consent prior to, or within 6 weeks after, surgery. The tumor specimen&#xD;
      will be submitted for genomic sequencing followed by neoantigen identification utilizing a&#xD;
      computational pipeline. Peptides corresponding to these neoantigens will be prepared for the&#xD;
      personalized vaccine product. Subjects eligible for the treatment phase of the protocol&#xD;
      (i.e., after surgery in adjuvant patients and chemotherapy in metastatic patients) will&#xD;
      receive atezolizumab every 3 weeks plus up to ten doses of PGV001 vaccination plus Poly-ICLC.&#xD;
      The primary objectives will be to determine the feasibility and safety of administration of a&#xD;
      personalized neoantigen-based vaccine (PGV001) plus atezolizumab in subjects with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.&#xD;
