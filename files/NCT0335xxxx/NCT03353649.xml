    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine targets of self-regulatory function among two exemplar populations&#xD;
      for which behavior plays a critical role in health outcomes: smokers and individual who binge&#xD;
      eat (BED). This is the second phase of a study that aims to identify putative mechanisms of&#xD;
      behavior change to develop an overarching &quot;ontology&quot; of self-regulatory processes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health risk behavior, including poor diet, physical inactivity, tobacco and other substance&#xD;
      use, causes as much as 40% of the illness, suffering, and early death related to chronic&#xD;
      diseases. Non-adherence to medical regimens is an important exemplar of the challenges in&#xD;
      changing health risk behavior -- and is common, costly (due to increased utilization of&#xD;
      healthcare services), and associated with poor patient outcomes. This may be particularly&#xD;
      evident among older adults who experience a disproportionate amount of the chronic disease&#xD;
      burden in the U.S. Although an array of interventions have been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      promoting health behavior change, much of this work has been siloed (focused on one disorder&#xD;
      at a time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, interventions are typically intended to engage multiple mechanisms of behavior&#xD;
      change, but the mechanisms by which they actually work are infrequently systematically&#xD;
      examined. Because the need to alter health-related behavior is ubiquitous across medicine,&#xD;
      understanding the extent to which the principles of effective health behavior change, and the&#xD;
      mechanisms by which they work, are similar or differ across health conditions and settings is&#xD;
      a critically important area of scientific inquiry. Improving medical regimen adherence and&#xD;
      promoting health behavior change are also crucial issues in the changing healthcare&#xD;
      landscape, where quality, value, cost and patient-centered care are central. This line of&#xD;
      research may allow for great strides in crafting &quot;precision medicine&quot; approaches for a wide&#xD;
      array of populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One promising domain of putative behavior change targets is that of self-regulation -- a&#xD;
      person's ability to manage cognitive, motivational and emotional resources to act in&#xD;
      accordance with his/her long-term goals. In this proposal, the investigators have assembled&#xD;
      an outstanding interdisciplinary team to 'scale up' this work to an unprecedented level by&#xD;
      examining putative targets of behavior change within the self-regulation mechanism domain&#xD;
      across contexts, populations, and assays - in 3 primary levels of analysis: (1) psychological&#xD;
      (e.g., constructs such as self-efficacy; emotion regulation; response inhibition), (2)&#xD;
      behavioral (e.g., tasks of reward responsiveness; temporal horizon), and (3) biological&#xD;
      (structural and functional MRI of key neural circuitry). The investigators will conduct this&#xD;
      work with two exemplar populations for which behavior plays a critical role in the course of&#xD;
      medical regimen adherence, health, and health outcomes: (1) smokers and (2) binge eaters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these groups, the investigators will evaluate the extent to which participants can engage&#xD;
      and manipulate putative targets within the self-regulation domain both within and outside of&#xD;
      laboratory settings. 50 smokers and 50 obese/overweight persons will participate in a lab&#xD;
      study to complete the identified tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will experimentally modulate engagement of targets (e.g., stimulus set of&#xD;
      palatable foods images or tobacco-related images as well as self-regulation interventions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in a 30 minute introductory session and a single testing session at&#xD;
      Stanford, which will include testing using a subset of self-regulatory tasks from the&#xD;
      following list (stop-signal task, conditional motor selective stop signal task, Stroop task,&#xD;
      dot pattern expectancy task, attention network task, Columbia card task, task switching,&#xD;
      delay discounting task, tower of Hanoi, and emotion regulation task). The order of&#xD;
      assessments will be counterbalanced across subjects. Imaging will allow an assessment of the&#xD;
      degree to which the neural systems associated with each element in the ontology can be&#xD;
      engaged and manipulated in the clinical samples. Imaging will be performed at the Stanford&#xD;
      Center for Neurobiological Imaging, which has a research-dedicated 3T GE MRI scanner with all&#xD;
      necessary accessories for stimulation and recording. In addition to task-based fMRI, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect resting-state fMRI while passively viewing either a blank screen&#xD;
      or a movie that may include smoking or food-related stimuli. The proposed sample size of 50&#xD;
      per clinical group will provide sufficient power to detect delta=0.56 between groups, and a&#xD;
      correlation of r=0.2 across the aggregated sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the investigators collect data from all participants, they will include manipulations (or&#xD;
      &quot;motivating operations&quot;) meant to modulate putative targets within the self-regulation domain&#xD;
      in each clinical group - to assess the extent to which participants can shift self-regulatory&#xD;
      function both in desired and undesired directions. This will be achieved by (1) exposing&#xD;
      subjects to specific stimulus sets relevant to the sample that may promote engagement of&#xD;
      appetitive drives (images of highly palatable foods for obese individuals, and&#xD;
      tobacco-related images or smokers), and (2) exposing them to an instructional manipulation&#xD;
      (&quot;now&quot; vs &quot;later&quot; cues that instruct subjects to engage with the immediate hedonistic&#xD;
      properties of the stimulus or the long-term consequences of using the stimulus, respectively)&#xD;
      designed to engage self-regulatory processes in the presence of these stimulus sets.&#xD;

Specifically, participants in this sample will be exposed to images of food and control non-food images. In different trials, subjects will be given a &quot;now&quot; cue instructing them to engage with the immediate hedonic properties of the stimulus or a &quot;later&quot; cue instructing them to imagine the long-term consequences of using the stimulus.&#xD;

A similar approach to the Binge Eating sample will be used for the smoking sample using two stimulus sets. Instead of foods and non-food control images, smokers will see smoking-related images and the same control non-food non-smoking images as the Binge Eating sample.&#xD;

More specifically, subjects will see a &quot;now&quot; cue instructing them to think of immediately using/consuming that stimulus or a &quot;later&quot; cue instruction them to think about the long-term consequences of using/consuming that stimulus. The latter cue is intended to down-regulate desire to use/consume the stimulus, and this down-regulation is measured by a subsequent probe asking subjects the degree to which they want to use/consume that stimulus.</description>
