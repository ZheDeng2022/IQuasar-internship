    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males with confirmed diagnosis of MPS II, based on deficient activity of IDS in&#xD;
             leucocytes or fibroblasts and/or pathogenic mutations identified in the IDS gene (if&#xD;
             enzyme diagnosis was in dried blood spots or plasma, molecular genetics confirmation&#xD;
             is mandatory).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One of the following age groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. 0 to 3 years and 11 months old (6 patients, 2 in each dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. 4 years to 7 years and 11 months old (6 patients, 2 in each dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. 8 years or older (6 patients, 2 in each dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of providing written consent by himself, unless the patient is under the age&#xD;
             of 18 years at the time of informed consent process, or it is not possible to obtain&#xD;
             consent from the patient himself due to his intellectual disabilities associated with&#xD;
             MPS II.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the case of a patient who is under the age of 18 years or from whom it is not&#xD;
             possible to obtain consent due to his intellectual disabilities associated with MSP&#xD;
             II, he may be included if written consent can be provided by legal representative;&#xD;
             however written consent should be obtained from the patient himself too, wherever&#xD;
             possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Naïve patients or patients who are receiving enzyme replacement therapy with&#xD;
             idursulfase could be included if provided treatment has been stable in the last 6&#xD;
             months and agree to interrupt the treatment at least one week before the first study&#xD;
             drug infusion, and agree in suspending this treatment for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refusal to sign the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to perform the study procedures, except for neurocognitive testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous engrafted BMT/HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgical or other major medical intervention planned to occur before week 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a clinical trial with an investigational drug in the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Judged by the investigator or subinvestigator as being unable to undergo lumbar&#xD;
             puncture, including those who have difficulties in taking a position for lumber&#xD;
             puncture due to joint contracture or those who are likely to experience difficulty&#xD;
             breathing during the lumbar puncture process.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Judged by the investigator or subinvestigator to be ineligible to participate in the&#xD;
             study due to a history of a serious drug allergy or sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Otherwise judged by the investigator or subinvestigator to be ineligible to&#xD;
             participate in the study out of consideration for the subject safety.&#xD;
