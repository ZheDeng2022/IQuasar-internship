  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The opioid epidemic in the United States has become a clear health and safety concern for our&#xD;
      children and families. Opioids given to our patients for the treatment of pain that go unused&#xD;
      after the immediate post operative period pose a major hazard when left in the home&#xD;
      unattended. Opioids can be accidentally ingested by small children or deliberately ingested&#xD;
      by pre-teens and adolescents leading to major morbidity and or death. Additionally, studies&#xD;
      have shown that many people addicted to opioids/narcotics have become so due to ingestion of&#xD;
      medically prescribed drugs. Finally, there has been an increase number of home robberies&#xD;
      specifically with the intent to steal prescription drugs. Removal of unused medication from&#xD;
      the home is an important public safety concern to protect our patients, families and friends.&#xD;
      The Sharps Co (R), offers a product called Takeaway Medication Recovery System. This product&#xD;
      allows individuals to put unused opioids in a pre-paid envelope which is returned to the&#xD;
      company through the postal system and properly incinerated. This provides safe disposal in&#xD;
      accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to protect the water table from&#xD;
      contamination by drugs disposed of my other means. This system through the Sharps Co would&#xD;
      allow for de-identified tracking of returned drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants identified by the PI and participating research staff/coordinators that will&#xD;
      receive opioids following discharge will be approached. The participant information sheet&#xD;
      will be provided to the parents/legal guardian and explained. The consenting study&#xD;
      coordinator will review the potential risks of opioids as described in the information sheet.&#xD;
      A brief demonstration of the TakeAway envelope will be provided. The participants will be&#xD;
      instructed that there is absolutely no cost to them or their family and that the envelope is&#xD;
      pre-paid and that all returned or unreturned contents are strictly confidential. A few brief&#xD;
      demographic questions will be asked and are completely optional. The participant will be&#xD;
      asked for an email and contacted 15 days and 30 days following the procedure. The email will&#xD;
      strictly be a reminder to return all un-used medication using the provided envelope Or an&#xD;
      optional response reporting nothing to return. If participants do not have an email or do not&#xD;
      wish to be contacted, they may still enroll in the study. The entire peri-operative period&#xD;
      will progress in the usual manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each envelope has a serial number that will be recorded during enrollment - the company&#xD;
      provides access to ascertain exactly how many pills are returned. This access is strictly&#xD;
      provided to the PI. The company will have no patient information and therefore only the PI&#xD;
      will be able to track the serial number to the patient. The PI and research staff will record&#xD;
      the number of pills prescribed to the patient to allow the research team to calculate the&#xD;
      percentage of pills returned.&#xD;
