      The aim of this study is to determine the repetition numbers of the peak force value&#xD;
      generated during isokinetic knee flexion and extensor movement evaluation at 60 and 180 °/&#xD;
      sec angular velocities and to identify the factors associated with this repetition.&#xD;

      Individual evaluation in the field of health; is very important because it sets out the steps&#xD;
      necessary for defining and improving the current situation. Evaluation of muscular strength&#xD;
      is a key factor in sports to improve performance and determine the risk of injury. Thus, the&#xD;
      training and training process that will optimize the performance of the athlete can be&#xD;
      planned and necessary steps can be taken to prevent injuries. There are many methods to&#xD;
      determine muscle strength, manual muscle testing and isokinetic evaluation are the most&#xD;
      frequently used methods. Isokinetic evaluation provides the ability to objectively measure&#xD;
      dynamic force. Potential injuries are avoided by providing effective and optimal loading of&#xD;
      joints and muscles throughout the range of motion. With isokinetic dynamometry, it can&#xD;
      measure and amplify at high speed with maximal contraction using muscle function at full&#xD;
      speed over the entire range of motion. With this method, it is possible to assess the&#xD;
      strength of the muscles of the joint movements in the agonist (the group performing the&#xD;
      movement as a primer) and the antagonist (the muscle group controlling the movement in the&#xD;
      movement) during all reciprocal movements. One of the most important values of this&#xD;
      evaluation is the peak torque, the maximum force. The peak torque value is influenced by many&#xD;
      internal factors such as the environmental factors, the adaptation of the isokinetic&#xD;
      instrument to the person, as well as the internal factors of the person being assessed. One&#xD;
      of the most important of the effective factors is to determine the appropriate number of&#xD;
      repetitions. Isokinetic dynamometers offer the possibility to make various adjustments such&#xD;
      as angular velocity, number of repetitions, the range of motion, the current state of the&#xD;
      person. Therefore, the evaluator can determine the number of repetitions itself. Sufficient&#xD;
      repeatability is required to allow the individual to create maximum force. However, too much&#xD;
      repetition can cause fatigue in the individual as well as an additional workload in terms of&#xD;
      time. There are many studies in the literature carried out with different repeat numbers at&#xD;
      different angular velocities. The studies include protocols ranging from five repetitions to&#xD;
      twenty repetitions with very different repeat numbers. Five repetitions may not be sufficient&#xD;
      for the peak torque to appear, but twenty repetitions cause fatigue in the athlete and lead&#xD;
      to loss of time. There is no standardized repeat number for isokinetic knee evaluation in the&#xD;
      literature. The lack of consensus on the number of repetitions hampers the interpretation of&#xD;
      the works. In our work, it will be determined how many times the athletes reached peak torque&#xD;
      values. This will prevent future studies from carrying out an incorrect measurement without&#xD;
      reaching the maximum peak force with a low number of repetitions, or having too many&#xD;
      repetitions to include tougher, longer evaluations. Standardization of repeat numbers will&#xD;
      make evaluation easier and more meaningful if it increases the objectivity of evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>Isokinetics, or accommodating resistance, is a form of exercise where a person provides a maximum muscle contraction against a resistance or lever arm, (isokinetic dynamometer) at a fixed speed through a given range of motion. This type of muscle action can be done either concentrically or eccentrically at the given joint.</description>
