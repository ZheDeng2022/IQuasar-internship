  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study aims to determine if intermittent dosing is deliverable, based on&#xD;
      patient and professional willingness to take part in a randomised trial evaluating less&#xD;
      rather than the standard durations of treatment. The trial will evaluate treatment&#xD;
      compliance, Progression Free Survival and Quality of Life, to inform whether a subsequent&#xD;
      definitive trial is justified and how it should be designed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic melanoma has a very poor prognosis: median overall survival is 8 months untreated&#xD;
      and around 2 years even with optimal systemic therapies. A gene called BRAF is abnormal in&#xD;
      about half of melanomas and biological agents targeting the BRAF pathway have been shown to&#xD;
      extend life. They are now routinely available in NHS clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Giving BRAF and MEK inhibitor drugs together offers the best anti-cancer treatment for these&#xD;
      patients. However, treatment is limited by side-effects (often affecting the skin) and&#xD;
      secondary resistance (which means the cancer regrows usually after about a year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory experiments and case reports suggest intermittent dosing of these chronic orally&#xD;
      administered drugs makes BRAF pathway inhibitors work for longer, extending life and reducing&#xD;
      side effects. The INTERIM trial aims to test whether less treatment than usual is acceptable&#xD;
      to patients and doctors and, potentially, more beneficial. The INTERIM trial also aims to&#xD;
      develop better tools to monitor skin side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population will be male and female participants aged 18 and over with BRAFV600&#xD;
      mutant stage 3 unresectable or metastatic melanoma.Patients will be provided with information&#xD;
      regarding the trial both through conversation with investigators and research nurses and in&#xD;
      writing via a patient information sheet. Patients will be given time to ask questions and&#xD;
      discuss with family/support structures before deciding to participate. If the patient agrees&#xD;
      to take part, they will be asked to provide written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit schedule for consenting patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients will enter the screening/baseline phase, which will be completed within&#xD;
      28 days prior to randomisation. This will include assessing the patient against inclusion &amp;&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If eligible, patients will be randomly assigned to either treatment arms using a web-based&#xD;
      central randomisation system. Patients will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to one of 2 arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm: dabrafenib 150mg twice daily and trametinib 2mg once daily, taken by mouth&#xD;
      continuously on a 4 week cycle Experimental arm: dabrafenib 150mg twice daily x 3 weeks and&#xD;
      trametinib 2mg once daily x 2 weeks, on a 4 week cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      On treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first two cycles of treatment patients will attend the hospital every two weeks&#xD;
      (on days 1 and 15 of the cycle) where they will have a clinical review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From cycle 3 onwards patients will attend the hospital only on day 1 of the cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients are on treatment for more than 52 weeks, clinic visits can be every other cycle&#xD;
      with telephone follow-up between to ensure patient review is at least every 4 weeks until&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of treatment an additional clinical visit will be performed to review the patient.&#xD;
      If at the time of treatment cessation patients have not met the criteria for disease&#xD;
      progression they will be followed up every 4 weeks. After 52 weeks since randomisation there&#xD;
      will be the option of clinic visits every 8 weeks with telephone follow-up in between.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease progression:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a clinical visit at the time of protocol-defined disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up after disease progression:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend hospital every three months after disease progression for a minimum of 9&#xD;
      months from randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical review &amp; physical examinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be reviewed by the trial team during the screening period, at every treatment&#xD;
      and follow-up visit. This will involve recording any medications they may be taking, and any&#xD;
      symptoms and/or side-effects they may have. Patients will also have a physical examination,&#xD;
      and assessment of blood pressure as part of this review, and the clinical team will assess&#xD;
      the patient's clinical status using ECOG and Karnofsky performance status scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline skin assessment &amp; skin toxicity questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening the patient and clinician will be asked to complete a questionnaire about the&#xD;
      baseline condition of the patient's skin. If during treatment there are any skin-related&#xD;
      adverse events both the patient and clinician will be asked to complete a skin toxicity&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment at each clinical visit the patient will be asked to bring their medication&#xD;
      along with their diary card.The clinical team will record how many tablets remain and how&#xD;
      many tablets have been taken. The patient will be asked to record in the diary card the date&#xD;
      and time when they take their medication. Both of these activities will be used to assess the&#xD;
      patient's compliance to the treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women of child bearing potential will have a pregnancy test at screening to ensure they are&#xD;
      not pregnant and are therefore able to receive the trial drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram (ECG):&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ECG test is required before starting the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiogram (ECHO):&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ECHO is required prior to starting the trial in patients with a history of cardiac&#xD;
      problems, in patients with no cardiac history and a normal ECG it must be performed within&#xD;
      two weeks of starting trial drug. ECHOs will subsequently be performed as standard of care,&#xD;
      the recommended frequency is during cycle 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter to ensure that&#xD;
      patients are tolerating the trial drugs well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (routine and research):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to have routine blood tests (FBC, renal, liver, bone profiles, LDH) to&#xD;
      ensure that they are fit enough for the trial, and that they are tolerating the drug well.&#xD;
      These blood samples will be taken at every clinical visit during treatment and at disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be asked to give extra blood for research related to this trial. The&#xD;
      samples will be used to measure circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). An extra blood sample will be&#xD;
      taken every 2 weeks for the first two cycles of treatment, every 4 weeks for the next two&#xD;
      cycles, then every 8 weeks, and at disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked if they wish to participate in optional pharmacokinetic sampling. This&#xD;
      will involve collection of 9 blood samples on both cycle 1 day 1, and cycle 2 day 15 at&#xD;
      timepoints after they have taken their tablets. Additionally, 3 blood samples would be taken&#xD;
      if their disease progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have an initial CT scan of body and head during the screening period. Scans&#xD;
      will be repeated between days 8-15 of cycle 2 and then every 8 weeks until the end of&#xD;
      treatment. If treatment continues beyond 52 weeks imaging can be reduced to every 12 weeks.&#xD;
      If the initial screening head scan is clear, the head scan only requires repeating at every&#xD;
      other assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to fill in questionnaires about their quality of life at screening on&#xD;
      day 1 of cycle 2, and then every12 weeks until the end of participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour Tissue collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon starting treatment patients will be asked to donate previously archived tissue collected&#xD;
      for research purposes. If patients undergo surgical resection or biopsy during the course of&#xD;
      the trial for progressive disease, a tumour sample will be requested for this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Experience survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient who do not consent to participate in the trial will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire to explore their reasons for declining. Additionally, patients who do&#xD;
      participate in the trial will be asked to complete patient experience questionnaires after&#xD;
      consent and after 9 months participation in the trial. These questionnaires will ask the&#xD;
      patients about their experience of participating in the trial and any toxicity they&#xD;
      experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may continue on allocated treatment as long as they benefit from the treatment and&#xD;
      it is tolerable. Patients will be followed for a minimum of 9 months from randomisation to a&#xD;
      maximum of 5 years.&#xD;
