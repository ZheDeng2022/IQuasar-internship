      Cholangiocarcinoma refers to bile duct cancer (bile duct cancer) and gallbladder cancer that&#xD;
      develop in the gallbladder. According to the data from National Cancer Information Center in&#xD;
      2013, the incidence of cancer in Korea is 5,283, which corresponds to about 2.3% of all&#xD;
      cancers and the 5-year survival rate is 30% And most of the long-term survival is due to&#xD;
      early detection by screening, and advanced carcinoma is a refractory carcinoma with a 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate of less than 5%. In addition to the standard anticancer drugs, alternative&#xD;
      anticancer drugs and targeted therapies have been developed to provide a variety of treatment&#xD;
      modalities. However, the development of cell therapy drugs for cancer, such as cancers, has&#xD;
      not been developed in Korea. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural killer cells (NK cells) are innate lymphocyte cells with cytotoxic activity. Unlike T&#xD;
      cells and B cells, which have antigen-specific receptors, NK cells express various innate&#xD;
      immunoreceptors on the cell surface, thereby enabling selective recognition of cancer cells&#xD;
      And recognizes cancer cells, it is a cytotoxic cell that can immediately remove cancer cells&#xD;
      without any other activation process. In addition, natural killer cells also interact with&#xD;
      dendritic cells or T cells directly or indirectly to regulate the immune response, thereby&#xD;
      inhibiting the development and metastasis of cancer cells and effectively removing cancer&#xD;
      stem cells important for cancer recurrence It has many advantages in the development of&#xD;
      anti-cancer immunotherapy.&#xD;

      Cholangiocarcinoma refers to bile duct cancer (bile duct cancer) and gallbladder cancer that&#xD;
      develop in the gallbladder. According to the data from National Cancer Information Center in&#xD;
      2013, the incidence of cancer in Korea is 5,283, which corresponds to about 2.3% of all&#xD;
      cancers and the 5-year survival rate is 30% And most of the long-term survival is due to&#xD;

      survival rate of less than 5%. In addition to the standard anticancer drugs, alternative&#xD;
      anticancer drugs and targeted therapies have been developed to provide a variety of treatment&#xD;
      modalities. However, the development of cell therapy drugs for cancer, such as cancers, has&#xD;
      not been developed in Korea. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although surgical resection is mandatory for curettage of the biliary tract, 40 ~ 50% of all&#xD;
      patients are able to undergo radical resection. In general, the incidence of mid / lower bile&#xD;
      duct cancer is high and the upper bile duct cancer is relatively low. The surgical resection&#xD;
      of the tumor depends on the location of the tumor. The curative surgery of the biliary cancer&#xD;
      is very complicated and time-consuming. The anatomical structures of the biliary and vascular&#xD;
      system are variable and it is difficult to accurately determine the extent of the tumor&#xD;
      invasion before surgery or even during surgery there is also a great deal of risk. Especially&#xD;
      in the case of hepatic portal biliary duct (upper bile duct cancer), it is difficult to judge&#xD;
      whether surgical resection is feasible, and there are many cases where resection is difficult&#xD;
      at the time of operation or discovery. Gallbladder cancer also has a poor prognosis. Early&#xD;
      cancer can be cured by surgery, but progressive cancer has a poor prognosis and overall&#xD;
      survival rate is similar to that of biliary cancer. Because it occurs in the biliary tract&#xD;
      with bile duct cancer, the clinical method and characteristics of the cancer cells are&#xD;
      similar, and the same method is used for the treatment and the chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, since there is no standard for the selection of second-line chemotherapy after&#xD;
      gemcitabine treatment, the development of an alternative therapeutic agent is urgently&#xD;
      required have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural killer cells (NK cells) are innate lymphocyte cells with cytotoxic activity. Unlike T&#xD;
      cells and B cells, which have antigen-specific receptors, NK cells express various innate&#xD;
      immunoreceptors on the cell surface, thereby enabling selective recognition of cancer cells&#xD;
      And recognizes cancer cells, it is a cytotoxic cell that can immediately remove cancer cells&#xD;
      without any other activation process. In addition, natural killer cells also interact with&#xD;
      dendritic cells or T cells directly or indirectly to regulate the immune response, thereby&#xD;
      inhibiting the development and metastasis of cancer cells and effectively removing cancer&#xD;
      stem cells important for cancer recurrence It has many advantages in the development of&#xD;
      anti-cancer immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, various clinical studies have been conducted to treat cancer using natural killer&#xD;
      cells worldwide, including in Korea, and therapeutic clinical results are shown for various&#xD;
      cancers. The clinical application of natural killer cells is carried out by culturing natural&#xD;
      killer cells isolated from blood of patient, patient's family or even from other people's&#xD;
      blood and injecting them into patients. It is also possible to expect the effect as a&#xD;
      combination therapy with chemotherapy alone or by eliminating the cancer cells in the&#xD;
      patient's body while improving the immunity of the patient by improving the immunity of the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite this, the clinical application of natural killer cells in Korea is limited&#xD;
      to only a few cancers, including hematologic and hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carcinoid cancer (biliary cancer, gallbladder cancer) is a rare carcinoma with around 3,500&#xD;
      cases per year in Korea. In the majority of cases, the rate of relying entirely on&#xD;
      chemotherapy is more than 50%, and the response rate of Gemcitabine based on the first&#xD;
      chemotherapy is about 30%. Other alternative therapies that do not lead to cancer are natural&#xD;
      killer cells that need to be tested for safety and efficacy in existing drugs.&#xD;
