    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of leukocyte- and platelet-rich&#xD;
      fibrin (L-PRF) on impacted mandibular third molar (IMTM) extraction wound healing, patient&#xD;
      postoperative discomfort, and incidence of alveolar osteitis (AO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty patients (18 female, 12 male) who met the inclusion criteria for this split-mouth&#xD;
      study underwent bilateral IMTM surgical extractions. Following extraction, randomization was&#xD;
      done. One socket received L-PRF, and the other socket served as a regular blood clot control.&#xD;
      Postoperatively, the soft tissue healing index (HI), pain according to visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS), facial swelling using a horizontal and vertical guide, and incidence of AO were&#xD;
      evaluated 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study was designed as a prospective split-mouth clinical trial on patients who needed&#xD;
      bilateral paired IMTM extractions. The study was conducted at the Maxillofacial Surgery&#xD;
      Department of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences. Approval by the local bioethics&#xD;
      committee was granted (No. BEC-MF-01). All patients signed an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection Based on previously treated pilot cases, a power analysis was conducted for&#xD;
      sample size estimation (Statistica 6.0, Dell Software, Round Rock, TX, USA). The calculations&#xD;
      revealed a minimum sample size of n = 30, based on a power of 90% and an α of 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Male and female patients with an age of 18 to 60 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Healthy patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA PS) index ≤&#xD;
           2);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sole bilateral extractions of IMTMs during the same surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Complete root formation of tooth No. 38 and 48 at radiological examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Absence of acute inflammation and/or infection in the IMTMs area;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. No history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use in the past 4 weeks prior&#xD;
           to surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Same-difficulty bilateral IMTM extractions, according to both Pederson and Juodzbalys &amp;&#xD;
           Daugela classifications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following exclusion criteria were used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Smoking patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. IMTM surgery duration difference greater than 10 minutes for each side, seeking to avoid&#xD;
           bias;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Different surgical manipulations taken at each IMTM surgery site;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Presence of any neoplastic lesion (benign or malignant), clinically or radiologically&#xD;
           evaluable, at the site or close to the impacted tooth;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Presence of any radiolucent lesion &gt;1 cm at impacted tooth level;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Absence of the adjacent tooth;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Systemic conditions or pharmacological treatments altering oral microbiota or&#xD;
           immunologic response;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Alcohol or drug abuse;&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Pregnant or breastfeeding women;&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Lack of compliance by the patient or any other evidence suggesting that the patient was&#xD;
           not likely to follow the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively, two blind expert surgeons assessed patient Orthopantomograph (OPG) and/or&#xD;
      cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), evaluating IMTM extraction difficulty and complexity&#xD;
      according to Pederson and Juodzbalys &amp; Daugela indexes for each IMTM bilaterally. The overall&#xD;
      kappa index for inter-observers agreement was calculated by using weighted kappa. Only teeth&#xD;
      having the same extraction difficulty scores according to both classifications were enrolled&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pederson difficulty index assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pederson difficulty index was evaluated based on anatomical and radiographic features of the&#xD;
      tooth to be extracted. Following scores were given according to OPG and/or CBCT findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spatial relationship&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mesio angular 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Horizontal 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vertical 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distoangular 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level A 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level B 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level C 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ramus relationship / space available&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Class I 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Class II 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Class III 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the difficulty score total score, the IMTMs were classified as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimally difficult (score 3 to 4) Moderately difficult (score 5 to 7) Very difficult (score&#xD;
      7 to 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Juodzbalys &amp; Daugela classification Modification of the Juodzbalys &amp; Daugela classification&#xD;
      is related with the different interpretation of the final score, i.e. rating of surgical&#xD;
      difficulty and the surgical time. Indexes and their evaluation remain unaltered. The impacted&#xD;
      mandibular third molar is evaluated by considering its relationships with adjacent anatomical&#xD;
      boundaries (second molar, mandibular ramus, alveolar crest, mandibular canal, corticals of&#xD;
      the mandible) and its spatial position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classification attributes a score from ranging from 0 to 3 (0=conventional; 1=simple;&#xD;
      2=moderate; 3=complicated) to six items (M, R, A, C, B, S), according to the tooth&#xD;
      positioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in relation to the second molar (M): the wisdom tooth crown could be directed at, or&#xD;
           above the equator of the second molar (conventional, score 0), directed below the&#xD;
           equator, to the coronal third of the second molar root (simple, score 1), directed to&#xD;
           the middle third of the second molar root (moderate, score 2), directed to the apical&#xD;
           third of the second molar root (complicated, score 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in relation to the mandibular ramus (R): the tooth could have sufficient space in the&#xD;
           dental arch (conventional, score 0), could be partially impacted in the ramus (simple,&#xD;
           score 1), completely impacted in the ramus (moderate, score 2), or completely impacted&#xD;
           in the ramus in disto-angular or horizontal position (complicated, score 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  considering the apico-coronal position of the tooth in relationship with the alveolar&#xD;
           crest (A): the tooth could be completely erupted (conventional, score 0), partially&#xD;
           impacted but with the widest part of the crown (equator) above the bone (simple, score&#xD;
           1), partially impacted but the widest part of the crown below the bone (moderate, score&#xD;
           2), or completely encased into the bone (complicated, score 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tooth relation with the mandibular canal is expressed as follows (C): ≥ 3 mm from the&#xD;
           mandibular canal (conventional, score 0), contacting or penetrating the mandibular&#xD;
           canal, with the wall of the mandibular canal which can be radiographically identified&#xD;
           (simple, score 1), contacting or penetrating the mandibular canal, with the wall of the&#xD;
           mandibular canal not radiographically identifiable (moderate, score 2), roots&#xD;
           surrounding the mandibular canal (complicated, score 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bucco-lingual position of the tooth in relation to mandibular lingual and buccal walls&#xD;
           (B): closer to buccal wall (conventional, score 0), in the middle between lingual and&#xD;
           buccal walls (simple, score 1), closer to lingual wall (moderate, score 2), closer to&#xD;
           lingual wall, when the tooth is partially impacted or completely encased in the bone&#xD;
           (complicated, score 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the spatial tooth positioning (S) is defined as follows: vertical (conventional, score&#xD;
           0), mesio-angular at ≤ 60◦ (simple, score 1), disto-angular at ≥ 120◦ (moderate, score&#xD;
           2), horizontal or inverted (complicated, score 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-PRF preparation Prior to surgery, two 9 ml glass-coated tubes (Intra-Spin, Intra-Lock&#xD;
      International, Boca Raton, USA) of patient venous blood were collected. Tubes were&#xD;
      transferred to a centrifuge (Andreas Hettich GmbH &amp; Co.KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) and processed&#xD;
      for 12 minutes at 2800 rpm to prepare L-PRF, as described previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure Surgical procedures were performed following a standardized surgical&#xD;
      approach by one expert surgeon (PD). Surgical manipulations required for each tooth&#xD;
      extraction were as follows: simple mobilization of the tooth, coronectomy, root separation,&#xD;
      incision, osteotomy. After removal of IMTM and socket curettage, on the side randomly chosen&#xD;
      by the opaque sealed envelope technique to be the study side, the extraction sockets were&#xD;
      filled with two L-PRF clots, whereas on the other side (control), they were allowed to form a&#xD;
      natural blood clot and undergo natural healing. Both sides were sutured with absorbable&#xD;
      Polyglactin (Atramat, Internacional Farmacéutica S.A. de C.V., Mexico City, Mexico)&#xD;
      interrupted 5-0 sutures. Patients were blinded to the study or control side selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the surgical procedure was counted from the beginning of surgical manipulations&#xD;
      to complete removal of mandibular wisdom tooth and wound closure for each side separately. If&#xD;
      there was a time difference greater than 10 minutes or if a different surgical manipulation&#xD;
      was used between each bilateral extraction, the patient was excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient was given systemic antibiotic prophylaxis (Clindamycin 600 mg per os) 1 hour&#xD;
      before and 6 hours after surgery. Postoperatively oral Lornoxicam 8 mg was prescribed to use&#xD;
      for pain control when needed. Patients were instructed to rinse with chlorhexidine 0.12%&#xD;
      solution three times a day for 2 weeks and provided with both verbal and written&#xD;
      postoperative instructions. The sutures were removed one week after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative outcome evaluation Quality of soft tissue healing, incidence of AO, pain, and&#xD;
      facial swelling were selected as postoperative outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postextractional wound soft tissue healing evaluation Postextractional wound soft tissue&#xD;
      healing was evaluated using a modified postextraction wound healing index (HI), which&#xD;
      considered four parameters: bleeding, suppuration, tissue color, and consistency of the&#xD;
      healing tissue. Each parameter involved 3 scoring levels; consequently, the cumulative&#xD;
      scoring scale ranged from 4, corresponding to excellent healing, to 12, indicating severely&#xD;
      impaired healing. HI was evaluated clinically by the same blinded examiner at the 1st, 3rd,&#xD;
      7th, and 14th days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alveolar osteitis evaluation Alveolar osteitis was characterized as postoperative continuous&#xD;
      throbbing pain surrounding the alveolus that was not adequately relieved by analgesics and&#xD;
      that increased in severity during a period of 1-3 days after tooth extraction. The pain was&#xD;
      followed by partial or complete loss of the initial blood clot in the interior of the socket&#xD;
      with or without halitosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain evaluation Pain was assessed using a written questionnaire with a visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS) every day by the patient during the first postoperative week. VAS consisted of 10 units&#xD;
      in combination with a graphic rating scale, where the leftmost score 0 represented absence of&#xD;
      pain and the rightmost score 10 indicated the worst possible, unbearable, excruciating pain.&#xD;
      Patients were blind to the knowledge of L-PRF and control sides and were asked to evaluate a&#xD;
      VAS pain score for each operated side every day separately for the first week after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facial swelling clinical assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facial swelling clinical assessments were performed by a single blinded examiner at baseline&#xD;
      (before surgery) and at the 1st-, 3rd-, and 7th-day visits postoperatively at approximately&#xD;
      the same time of day. Patients were seated in a relaxed position with the inferior border of&#xD;
      the mandible parallel to the floor. Facial swelling in the operation side was evaluated using&#xD;
      two facial measurements with nonexpandable tape:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the vertical dimension, measurement from the lateral canthus of the eye to the&#xD;
           pogonion of the mandible was taken;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the horizontal dimension, the distance from the lower border of the tragus to the&#xD;
           mouth commissure on both operated sides was measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facial swelling value was taken as the average value of these two measurements. The&#xD;
      preoperative measurement was considered as the baseline value.&#xD;
