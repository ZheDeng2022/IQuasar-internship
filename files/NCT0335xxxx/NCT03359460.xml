    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ibrutinib when giving together&#xD;
      with lenalidomide in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Ibrutinib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving ibrutinib and lenalidomide may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for ibrutinib in combination with&#xD;
      lenalidomide in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do an early assessment of the activity of the combination of ibrutinib and lenalidomide in&#xD;
      patients with MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
