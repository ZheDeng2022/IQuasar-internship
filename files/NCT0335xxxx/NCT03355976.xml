  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical and early-phase clinical data suggest that immune modulation represents a&#xD;
      treatment strategy that is worthy of further investigation in relapsed epithelial ovarian&#xD;
      cancer. One method by which tumor cells may evade immune surveillance is by activation of the&#xD;
      programmed cell death (PD-1) pathway, mediated by expression of PD-1 on the surface of T&#xD;
      lymphocytes, which conveys an inhibitory signal after binding to its ligand PD-L1 on the&#xD;
      surface of tumor cells. Nivolumab and Ipilimumab have shown activity as monotherapies in&#xD;
      solid tumors and very early data suggest that nivolumab may be particularly active for&#xD;
      ovarian clear cell carcinoma.(Hamanishi et al., 2015). Given the uniformly poor prognosis for&#xD;
      patients with clear cell carcinoma in general, we are interested in formally evaluating this&#xD;
      agent in all extra-renal clear cell carcinomas.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for&#xD;
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional&#xD;

             origin must have progressed after at least one prior platinum and taxane based&#xD;
             chemotherapy regimen. Patients with extra-renal clear cell cancer (including other&#xD;
             GYN) cancers must have progressed after at least one prior regimen for&#xD;
             advanced/metastatic disease. Radiation therapy (including the use of chemotherapy as a&#xD;
             radiosensitizer) will not count as a prior systemic regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior anti-PD-1, PD-L1 or CTLA-4 antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;

        X ULN (upper limit of normal) OR creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate thyroid function within 28 days prior to registration defined as serum TSH in&#xD;

             there is insufficient information to assess teratogenicity (preclinical studies have&#xD;
             not been done), a highly effective method(s) of contraception (failure rate of less&#xD;
             than 1% per year) is required as determined by the treating investigator. WOCBP must&#xD;
             follow instructions for birth control. For all women who discontinue protocol&#xD;
             treatment, contraception should be continued for five months following the last dose&#xD;
             of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L&#xD;
             or equivalent units of HCG) within 7 days prior to the start of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are not of childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal (lack of&#xD;
             menses &gt; 24 months) or surgically sterile) and azospermic men do not require&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must not be breastfeeding (document for all).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a&#xD;
             failure rate of less than 1 % per year. The investigator shall review contraception&#xD;
             methods and the time period that contraception must be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men that are sexually active with WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control&#xD;
             when the half life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception&#xD;
             should be continued for a period of 7 months after discontinuation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had prior therapy with nivolumab or with an anti-PD-1,&#xD;

             days) prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have not recovered from clinically significant adverse events to&#xD;
             &lt;grade 2 and which are related to prior treatment agents administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial because&#xD;
             of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;

             pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies, with the exception of&#xD;

             other cancer other than for clear cell cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In order for patients with known history of testing positive for human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) to be&#xD;
             eligible, they must be on a stable highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)&#xD;
             regimen, have CD4 counts &gt; 350, with no detectable viral load on quantitative PCR&#xD;
             within 4 weeks of registration.&#xD;

             eligible if they have been definitively treated for 6 months, have no detectable viral&#xD;
             load on quantitative PCR, and LFTs meet eligibility requirements within 4 weeks of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might&#xD;
             recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment&#xD;
             including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with&#xD;
             either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of day 1 study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other medical condition that will prevent the safe administration of study drugs&#xD;
             in the opinion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned concomitant, non-protocol directed anti-cancer therapy during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
