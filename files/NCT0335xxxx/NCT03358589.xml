      Background: Despite that up 90% of patients with early-stage breast cancer receives adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment, there are still about 300 patients diagnosed with primary metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      (MBC) and about 1,200 patients who develop metastases after the primary treatment each year&#xD;
      in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The investigators hypothesize that molecular evaluation with FDG-PET/CT and diffusion&#xD;
      weighted MRI allows an earlier detection of failure to respond to potentially toxic drugs in&#xD;
      patients receiving breast cancer directed treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of our project are to address the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does FDG-PET/CT allow an earlier detection of failure to respond to treatment for MBC&#xD;
           than conventional CT?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does FDG-PET/CT or MRI allow an earlier detection of failure to respond to treatment for&#xD;
           bone metastatic disease than conventional CT?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the PET based criteria (PERCIST) have the potential to lead to changes in the&#xD;
           treatment plans made from CT based criteria (RECIST)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does FDG-PET/CT give a more accurate diagnosis of MBC than conventional CT in terms of&#xD;
           number and distribution of metastatic sites?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Part A - the accuracy study: The study population will comprise all women referred to&#xD;
      Odense University Hospital with suspected metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The investigators&#xD;
      expect to include 270 patients who will be examined with FDG-PET/CT. If bone metastases are&#xD;
      detected, the patients will proceed to MRI. All patients with suspected metastases on&#xD;
      FDG-PET/CT or MRI will have a biopsy from a suitable lesion Part B - the response evaluation&#xD;
      study: The investigators expect to include 90 patients with biopsy-verified MBC. Patients&#xD;
      will receive oncologic treatment according to national guidelines. Response to treatment will&#xD;
      be evaluated by conventional CT criteria and compared to novel criteria according to FDG-&#xD;
      PET/CT, and MRI. Test results will be blinded to each other, so that knowledge of other test&#xD;
      results will be unknown for the reader of the CT, FDG-PET/CT or MRI, respectively Expected&#xD;
      clinical impact: This project represents a truly multidisciplinary effort to improve the&#xD;
      diagnosis, staging, and response evaluation of MBC. The investigators hope that patients will&#xD;
      benefit in terms of being spared for ineffective toxic treatment due to earlier detection of&#xD;
      failure to respond, and hence leading to earlier treatment transition. Patients are involved&#xD;
      in the planning and conduct of the project.&#xD;

      Background Breast cancer is the most frequent malignant disease in Danish women with about&#xD;
      4,500 new cases per year and about 60,000 women living after a diagnosis of breast cancer&#xD;
      (1). After lung cancer, it is the most common cause of death from cancer among Danish women.&#xD;
      Despite that up 90% of patients with early-stage breast cancer receive adjuvant treatment,&#xD;
      there are still about 300 patients diagnosed with primary metastatic breast cancer and about&#xD;
      1,200 patients who develop metastases after the primary treatment each year in Denmark (2).&#xD;
      Clinical guidelines unanimously recommend that diagnostic work-up for metastatic disease&#xD;
      should be performed only when clinically indicated, or prior to primary treatment in patients&#xD;
      at high risk of MBC, but they do not make clear recommendations on which diagnostic tool to&#xD;
      apply for staging patients with suspected MBC (3-5). The investigators have shown recently&#xD;
      that the molecular whole body imaging with FDG-PET/CT has a higher accuracy than conventional&#xD;
      imaging with CT and bone scintigraphy when diagnosing MBC (6); the investigators results are&#xD;
      in accordance with existing meta-analyses (7,8), and a recent review (9).The gold standard&#xD;
      for verifying MBC is a biopsy from a metastatic lesion, but treatment decisions are often&#xD;
      based on the biomarker profile of the primary tumor, since it has been assumed to remain the&#xD;
      same in the corresponding metastatic lesions. The investigators own data (10) supported by a&#xD;
      meta-analysis (11) point towards discordances between the primary tumor and the corresponding&#xD;
      metastasis ranging from 9% to 23% for expression of estrogen receptors (ER), Human Epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and Topoisomerase 2A (TOP2A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is essential to know the exact baseline stage of MBC in order to allow adequate evaluation&#xD;
      of treatment response subsequently. Response evaluation criteria have traditionally been&#xD;
      based on the morphological size of solid tumors as in the Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST)(12). The investigators consider it important to include changes in&#xD;
      metabolic activity for evaluation of treatment response, since metabolic changes occur before&#xD;
      morphological changes can be detected. The PET response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) is&#xD;
      a new standardized method to assess quantitatively the metabolic tumor response as seen on&#xD;
      FDG-PET/CT (13). A recent pooled analysis and review comparing the PERCIST to the RECIST&#xD;
      criteria concluded that the PERCIST criteria seem to be more suitable for assessing tumor&#xD;
      response than the RECIST criteria, but that the role of the PERCIST criteria needs to be&#xD;
      validated in relevant clinical settings (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring response to therapy in skeletal metastases has been challenging because the RECIST&#xD;
      criteria do not include changes in bony structures though the RECIST 1.1 accepts bone&#xD;
      metastases with soft tissue masses measuring &gt;= 10 mm as a target lesion (15). Up to 70% of&#xD;
      patients with MBC present with bone involvement, characterized as osteolytic, osteoblastic,&#xD;
      or mixed lesions on CT. Soft tissue metastases in the bone marrow may be overlooked by&#xD;
      conventional imaging, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown high accuracy for&#xD;
      diagnosing bone and bone marrow metastases (16, 17). Molecular imaging with FDG-PET/CT and&#xD;
      diffusion weighted MRI both have the potential to detect metabolic activity in all types of&#xD;
      bone and bone marrow lesions, and therefore a combination of FDG-PET/CT and whole body MRI&#xD;
      (WBMRI) may give valuable information in assessing metastatic processes in bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢Molecular evaluation can provide a more accurate assessment of the metastatic spread than&#xD;
      conventional methods and that molecular evaluation of response to breast cancer directed&#xD;
      treatments allows an earlier detection of failure to respond to potentially toxic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the project are to address the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does FDG-PET/CT allow an earlier detection of failure to respond to treatment for MBC&#xD;
           than conventional CT?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does FDG-PET/CT or MRI allow an earlier detection of failure to respond to treatment for&#xD;
           bone metastatic disease than conventional CT?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the PET based criteria (PERCIST) have the potential to lead to changes in the&#xD;
           treatment plans made from CT based criteria (RECIST)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does FDG-PET/CT give a more accurate diagnosis of MBC than conventional CT in terms of&#xD;
           number and distribution of metastatic sites?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method The project is divided into 2 parts. Part A - the accuracy study: The study population&#xD;
      will comprise all women referred to Odense University Hospital (OUH) with a suspected first&#xD;
      recurrence of breast cancer and newly diagnosed breast cancer at high risk of metastatic&#xD;
      spread. Data will be collected from about 270 patients over a 2-year period (Figure 1) All&#xD;
      patients will be examined by FDG- PET/CT with contrast enhanced CT in diagnostic quality at&#xD;
      baseline. If bone metastases are detected, the patients will proceed to WBMRI. All patients&#xD;
      with suspected metastases on FDG-PET/CT or WBMRI will have a biopsy from a suitable lesion.&#xD;
      The tissue from the biopsy will be for standard diagnostic procedures, including&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry for biomarkers (ER, HER-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All non- metastatic patients will be followed for one year by medical records to detect&#xD;
      potentially false negatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B - the response evaluation study: The response evaluation part is planned as a&#xD;
      longitudinal cohort design analyzing change of management and prediction og progression free&#xD;
      survival. It will include about 90 patients expected to present with biopsy-verified MBC&#xD;
      during the inclusion period. (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive oncologic treatment directed by the biomarker profile of the biopsy and&#xD;
      according to national guidelines. Response to treatment will be evaluated by FDG-PET/CT with&#xD;
      contrast enhanced CT in diagnostic quality after three series of chemotherapy (every 9 weeks)&#xD;
      or after 3 months of endocrine therapy (every 12 weeks). Patients with bone metastases will&#xD;
      be evaluated by WBMRI as well. Lesion based sensitivity analyses will be made for FDG-PET/CT&#xD;
      and for diagnostic CT, and in patients with bone involvement also for WBMRI. A radiologist&#xD;
      will apply the RECIST criteria from the CT and dedicated diffusion measurements from the MRI,&#xD;
      while a Nuclear Medicine Physician will apply the PERCIST criteria along with other relevant&#xD;
      quantitative measures. Test results will be blinded to each other, so that knowledge of other&#xD;
      test results will be unknown for the reader of the CT, FDG-PET/CT or MRI, respectively.&#xD;
      Treatment decisions will be made in a multidisciplinary conference form. Decisions will be&#xD;
      based on the conventional imaging criteria (RECIST) in the first 30 patients, and for each&#xD;
      patient the decision will be reconsidered by the PERCIST criteria and the metabolic&#xD;
      measurements. Discrepancies in decisions guided by the different evaluation criteria will be&#xD;
      registered and analyzed with regard to change of management in an interim analysis. The same&#xD;
      will be done for the succeeding evaluations, but the choice of response evaluation criteria&#xD;
      to guide clinical decision will depend on the result of the interim analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan the data collection in a way that allows us to perform&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analyses for the response evaluation study.&#xD;
