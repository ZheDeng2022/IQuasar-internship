  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary transplantation is the reference treatment for chronic terminal respiratory failure&#xD;
      in patients with cystic fibrosis. These are mainly bi-pulmonary transplants (cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      transplants are exceptional). The annual number of pulmonary transplants in France for cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis is about 90. In 2013, the transplant involves a total of more than 600 patients with&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis. The average age at the time of the transplant is 28.5 years (2013 data,&#xD;
      French cystic fibrosis register), compared to 58 years for patients transplanted to all&#xD;
      pathologies. Cystic fibrosis accounts for 25% of adult bi-pulmonary grafts. Pediatric&#xD;
      transplants are currently very rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The median survival after pulmonary transplantation in cystic fibrosis is currently 8.5 years&#xD;
      (and 10 years when considering patients surviving 3 months, ie excluding early mortality).&#xD;
      Cystic fibrosis is the pathology associated with better survival after pulmonary&#xD;
      transplantation given the young age of patients (28.5 years on average).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-respiratory comorbidities associated with transplantation, all underlying pathologies&#xD;
      combined, and referenced in the Registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung&#xD;
      Transplantation (ISHLT) are: hypertension, diabetes, renal insufficiency, Dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      cancers. Their frequency increases with the survival time of transplanted patients. Cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis is associated with non-respiratory comorbidities, the frequency of which increases&#xD;
      with age - diabetes, osteoporosis, renal insufficiency, hepatopathy, neoplastic pathologies -&#xD;
      and may become worse after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to estimate the incidence of non-respiratory co-morbidities after lung&#xD;
      transplantation in the cohort of patients with cystic fibrosis grafted in the Rhône-Alpes&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
