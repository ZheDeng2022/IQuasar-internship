  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate if Internet delivered emotion regulation individual therapy for adolescents is an&#xD;
      efficacious treatment when delivered as adjunctive to treatment as usual compared to a&#xD;
      control group consisting of treatment as usual.&#xD;

      Statistical Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment effects will be evaluated according to the intention-to-treat principle. Primary&#xD;
      end-point for all outcomes is post-treatment. Secondary end-point include a controlled 3&#xD;
      month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome analysis will include treatment group (ERITA , TAU) and weekly reports of&#xD;
      NSSI frequency measured once every week 4 weeks prior to treatment start, once every week&#xD;
      during treatment, and once every week four weeks after treatment termination. Regression&#xD;
      analysis modelled for count data will be used to estimate trend over time. Four weeks after&#xD;
      treatment termination will be considered primary endpoint. Pairwise contrasts (group x time&#xD;
      interaction) from the regression model will be used to evaluate between-group differences at&#xD;
      primary endpoint (4 weeks after treatment termination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes measured once before, during, and after treatment will be analyzed in a&#xD;
      similar fashion as for the primary outcome, modelled after data's distribution (count or&#xD;
      continuous). Measures collected only once at baseline and post-treatment will be analyzed&#xD;
      with regression analyses including treatment group (online ERITA , TAU) as the&#xD;
      between-subjects factor, time (baseline to post) as the within-subjects factor, and group ×&#xD;
      time interactions, modelled after data's distribution (count or continuous).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Month Follow-Up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected at 3-month follow-up will be used to determine the extent to which potential&#xD;
      treatment gains were maintained both within and between treatment conditions&#xD;
