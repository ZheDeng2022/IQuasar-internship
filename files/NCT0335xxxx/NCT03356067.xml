      Gastroparesis is a disorder triggered by numerous causes and it is defined by symptoms and&#xD;
      with an objective evidence of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective treatment for gastroparesis is challenging especially in patients with severe&#xD;
      symptoms. In refractory gastroparesis, endoscopic or surgical treatments may therefore be&#xD;
      considered. Endoscopic treatments include intrapyloric injection of botulinum toxin and&#xD;
      transpyloric insertion of a metallic stent. Surgical options involve implantation of a&#xD;
      gastric &quot;pacemaker&quot; (gastric stimulation), pyloroplasty and subtotal gastrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a new endoscopic technique, gastric endoscopic per oral pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) has&#xD;
      been introduced with promising preliminary results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective, sham-controlled, cross-over study (cross-over for patients&#xD;
      randomized to the sham arm) is to compare short and long-term efficacy and safety of G-POEM&#xD;
      in patients with refractory gastroparesis. Symptoms and objective parameters of gastric&#xD;
      emptying will be the main outcome criteria. The reason of using a sham protocol is to control&#xD;
      for the potential confounders (therapeutic effects of touch and belief, which are components&#xD;
      of the placebo effect).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gastroparesis is a disorder triggered by numerous causes and it is defined by symptoms and&#xD;
      with an objective evidence of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of obstruction (albeit&#xD;
      pyloric spasms may play a role in a subset of patients). Gastroparesis may be a consequence&#xD;
      of medication, surgery or diabetes but in approximately one third of patients, the cause&#xD;
      remains unknown and the patients are diagnosed with idiopathic gastroparesis. Effective&#xD;
      treatment for gastroparesis is challenging especially in patients with severe symptoms. The&#xD;
      efficacy of prokinetics is dubious since they have not proven real clinical efficacy in&#xD;
      placebo controlled trials. In refractory gastroparesis, endoscopic or surgical treatments may&#xD;
      therefore be considered. Endoscopic treatments include intrapyloric injection of botulinum&#xD;
      toxin and transpyloric insertion of a metallic stent. Surgical options involve implantation&#xD;
      of a gastric &quot;pacemaker&quot; (gastric stimulation), pyloroplasty and subtotal gastrectomy. The&#xD;
      partial effectiveness of botulinum toxin injection, stents and pyloroplasty suggests that&#xD;
      disruption of the pyloric muscle may lead to a decreased intrapyloric tone and consequently&#xD;
      to a symptomatic improvement in some patients with refractory gastroparesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a new endoscopic technique, gastric endoscopic per oral pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) has&#xD;
      been introduced with promising preliminary results. Uncontrolled studies with so far limited&#xD;
      number of patients have demonstrated a significant symptomatic improvement in approximately&#xD;
      70% of patients and improved or normalized of gastric emptying in more than a half of&#xD;
      patients after G-POEM. A prospective uncontrolled study suggested that patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic or post-surgical gastroparesis experiences higher success rate after G-POEM&#xD;
      (70-80%) compared to patients with diabetic gastroparesis (50%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      G-POEM is, in principle, adaptation of POEM (per-oral endoscopic myotomy) in the stomach.&#xD;
      POEM is now considered a standard treatment for esophageal achalasia and it has been shown to&#xD;
      be safe and effective. In contrast to achalasia, pathophysiology of pyloric function in&#xD;
      patients with gastroparesis is less understood and the explanation of how and why G-POEM&#xD;
      should work is some-how hypothetical. For example, presumed pylorospasm has not been&#xD;
      demonstrated as the predictive factor for treatment success of G-POEM yet. Refractory&#xD;
      gastroparesis is often accompanied by psychological or even psychiatric disturbances and&#xD;
      hence a placebo&quot; effect of G-POEM cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the real clinical efficacy&#xD;
      of G-POEM can only be demonstrated in a clinical randomized sham-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the severity of gastroparesis-related symptoms, the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom&#xD;
      Index (GCSI) has been developed for this item. The GCSI is part of a larger questionnaire&#xD;
      PAGI-SYM (Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Symptom severity index) established&#xD;
      for assessment of patient-reported symptoms in gastroparesis (dyspepsia and gastroesophageal&#xD;
      reflux). PAGI-SYM as well as GCSI subscale scores varied significantly by global disease&#xD;
      severity, with higher (worse) scores observed in those subjects who rated their gastroparesis&#xD;
      as moderate to severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective, sham-controlled, cross-over study (cross-over for patients&#xD;
      randomized to the sham arm) is to compare short and long-term efficacy and safety of G-POEM&#xD;
      in patients with refractory gastroparesis. Symptoms and objective parameters of gastric&#xD;
      emptying will be the main outcome criteria. The reason of using a sham protocol is to control&#xD;
      for the potential confounders (therapeutic effects of touch and belief, which are components&#xD;
      of the placebo effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to randomize 86 patients (43 in the active arm, ratio 1:1 active vs.&#xD;
      sham). Sample size is calculated based on expected therapeutic success of G-POEM in 50% of&#xD;
      patients vs. 20% in the sham group; significance level 0,05; study power 0,8; beta error 0,2;&#xD;
      adjustment for 15% expected drop out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised in blocks of 6, stratified according to the etiologies:&#xD;
      (idiopathic, diabetic, and post-surgical; patients after esophagectomy with gastric&#xD;
      pull-through will not be included). Control visits will be scheduled at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36&#xD;
      months. The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients with treatment success in the&#xD;
      active group vs. sham group at 6 months after the procedure. Several secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      also be assessed, including procedure-related parameters and safety parameters and change in&#xD;
      Gastric Emptying Study (GET) after G-POEM vs. sham. After 6 months, patients randomized to&#xD;
      the sham group will be offered G-POEM procedure and further followed up (cross-over part of&#xD;
      the study) providing that they did not have a therapeutic effect of the sham procedure.&#xD;
