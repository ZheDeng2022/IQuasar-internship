    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to further develop a prototype, evidence-based, electronic clinical&#xD;
      decision support system (CDSS) for pneumonia care (ePneumonia) with interoperability across&#xD;
      Electronic Health Records in order to improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare&#xD;
      resource utilization. The specific aims of this study are to evaluate the usability of&#xD;
      ePneumonia adapted for Cerner and its impact on clinical, patient-centered and healthcare&#xD;
      resource utilization outcomes in a stepped-wedge implementation study in 16 hospital&#xD;
      emergency departments (EDs) across the Intermountain Healthcare integrated health system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the launch of a paper-based pneumonia care process model in 1994, decision support for&#xD;
      pneumonia care has been under continuous development at Intermountain. Studies published in&#xD;
      2001 and 2006 demonstrated decreased mortality using paper-based methods. An electronic&#xD;
      pneumonia Clinical Decision Support System was later developed in the original Intermountain&#xD;
      computing environment and implemented in 4 regional emergency departments (ED) in 2011. This&#xD;
      tool featured a novel mortality predictor and real-time synthesis of clinical data to guide&#xD;
      diagnosis, risk stratification, admission triage and guideline-concordant treatment. An&#xD;
      outcome study published in 2015 demonstrated reduction in mortality with tool use compared to&#xD;
      usual care. Most recently, Intermountain researchers led by study co-Investigator, Dr.&#xD;
      Brandon Webb, developed an innovative tool to predict risk of drug-resistant bacteria and&#xD;
      demonstrated its potential to improve antibiotic use and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have entered a robust phase of additional development and adaptation of&#xD;
      ePneumonia into the Cerner Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. The objective of this study&#xD;
      is to advance development of an evidence-based, electronic CDSS for pneumonia care with&#xD;
      interoperability across EHRs in order to improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare&#xD;
      resource utilization. The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the usability of&#xD;
      ePneumonia and its associated impact on clinical, patient-centered and healthcare resource&#xD;
      utilization outcomes in a stepped-wedge implementation study in 16 hospital EDs in the&#xD;
      Intermountain Healthcare integrated health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis #1: Healthcare providers will affirm ePneumonia usability, lack of&#xD;
           interference with clinical workflow and only minor unintended consequences of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis #2: In patients with community-onset pneumonia, ePneumonia use will improve&#xD;
           clinical and patient-centered outcomes and decrease healthcare resource utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One year of baseline clinical outcome data will be gathered for all 16 emergency departments.&#xD;
      The first of 6 clusters of ED's will begin prospective data collection in January 2018, with&#xD;
      the remaining coming on at 2 month intervals until ePneumonia has been deployed at all sites.&#xD;
      An additional 1 year of data collection will be continued through 2019.&#xD;
