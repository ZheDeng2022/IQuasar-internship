      Objective: To evaluate the effect of intrauterine navigation using intrauterine insemination&#xD;
      catheter (IUI) one day prior to day 3 embryo transfer (ET) on pregnancy rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Pilot randomized controlled study. Setting: Tertiary referral center, King Fahad&#xD;
      Medical City. Patients: Patients who underwent ET during the period of the study after two or&#xD;
      less in-vitro fertilization failures and fulfilled the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Mock ETs were performed on day 2 post oocytes retrieval using intrauterine&#xD;
      insemination catheter, followed by day 3 ET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measure: Pregnancy rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Words: embryo transfer, mock embryo transfer, endometrial receptivity, endometrial&#xD;
      scratching, IVF.&#xD;

      Materials and Methods Population Forty-five patients were selected for this prospective&#xD;
      randomized control trial. It was conducted between October 2016 and October 2017 in the&#xD;
      Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility Medicine Department of King Fahad Medical City&#xD;
      (KFMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We included nulliparous patients who were &lt; 42 years of age with body mass index (BMI) &lt; 30&#xD;
      kg/m2 and normal endometrial cavity, used fresh sperm or oocytes, had two or more embryos&#xD;
      available for transfer on day 3 post ovum pick-up (OPU), and no more than 3 previous&#xD;
      unsuccessful ART cycles. Patients with uterine fibroids, uterine anomalies, intra-uterine&#xD;
      adhesions, and uterine polyps, patients with chronic diseases in the as uncontrolled diabetes&#xD;
      or hypertension, or if the patient had difficult mock ET . patients with severe male factors&#xD;
      for infertility requiring surgical retrieval of sperms were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical clearance of this study was obtained from the ethical committee of KFMC (IRB&#xD;
      00008644). Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation Protocols Participants were assigned either to the antagonist or agonist&#xD;
      protocol. In the agonist stimulation protocol, pituitary desensitization was achieved by&#xD;
      using 3.75 mg leuprolide acetate (Lupron Depot, Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, USA)&#xD;
      intramuscularly in the luteal phase of the previous cycle. The participants received 75-450&#xD;
      IU/d of either recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (Gonal-F; Serono, Munich,&#xD;
      Germany) or highly purified human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) (Merional; IBSA, Lugno,&#xD;
      Switzerland). The dosage was adjusted according to the serum E2 levels and vaginal ultrasound&#xD;
      folliculometry. In the antagonist protocol group, 0.25 mg/d cetrorelix acetate (Cetrotide;&#xD;
      Serono, Munich, Germany) was added on the day 5 of stimulation. When the sizes of three or&#xD;
      more follicles became ≥16 mm, the patient was given 10,000 IU of chorionic gonadotrophin&#xD;
      (Pregnyl; MERK, Hally, Germany) intramuscularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oocyte Retrieval and Fertilization Transvaginal oocyte retrieval was scheduled 36 h after the&#xD;
      administration of hCG and was performed under local anesthesia. Fertilization was achieved by&#xD;
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Pronuclear observation to determine fertilization&#xD;
      was performed 16-18 h after insemination. A commercial sequential IVF medium (Cook, Eight&#xD;
      Miles Plains, Queensland, Australia) was used for procedures involving the handling of&#xD;
      gametes and embryos. All embryos were transferred on their respective day 3 post OPU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mock Embryo Transfer On day 2 post OPU, one day before the actual ET, the participants, in&#xD;
      the study group, were taken into the operating room with a moderately full bladder at 10 am.&#xD;
      The patient was placed in the lithotomy position and a sterile speculum was inserted into the&#xD;
      vagina. The cervix was cleaned with sterile swabs and sterile water, and a mock transfer was&#xD;
      performed using a soft catheter (Wallace Intrauterine Insemination Catheter; Sims Portex&#xD;
      Ltd., Hythe, Kent, UK). The catheter has an outer sheet with memory , to aid insertion, and a&#xD;
      soft inner catheter with atraumatic tip. Under ultrasound guidance, only the soft inner&#xD;
      catheter was introduced beyond the internal cervical os till it was 0.5 cm from the fundus.&#xD;
      It was, then, gently withdrawn out of the uterus, and the speculum was removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embryo Transfer On the morning of ET, the patient was taken to the operating room with a&#xD;
      moderately full bladder. To facilitate safe handling of the embryos, the operating room was&#xD;
      connected to the embryology laboratory through a sliding door. The patient was placed in the&#xD;
      lithotomy position and the embryos were loaded by the embryologist into the soft catheter. A&#xD;
      maximum of two embryos were transferred per cycle. The physician then inserted the catheter&#xD;
      into the uterus till it was approximately 1.5 cm from the fundus, and expelled the embryos.&#xD;
      The catheter was then slowly removed from the uterus and returned to the embryologist for&#xD;
      inspection for any remnant embryos (retained embryos for reloading), blood, or mucus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravaginal progesterone (Cyclogest; 400 mg, Actavis, Devon, UK) was administered every 12 h&#xD;
      for luteal support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative assessment of serum ß-HCG level was performed two weeks after ET. Patients who&#xD;
      showed high levels of serum ß-HCG were considered as pregnant and were asked to return at 6&#xD;
      weeks of gestation for ultrasonographic confirmation. When they returned, clinical pregnancy&#xD;
      was determined by the observation of a gestational sac with fetal heart beat on transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound. The clinical embryo implantation rate was defined as the number of gestational&#xD;
      sacs observed at 6 weeks of gestation divided by the total number of embryos transferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 12.0; SPSS, Inc.,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL, USA). Results were tabulated and presented in percentages. Statistical analyses&#xD;
      were carried out using the chi-squared test or the Fisher Exact test for categorical&#xD;
      variables, and the unpaired two-way Student's t-test for continuous variables. A value of P ≤&#xD;
      0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.&#xD;
