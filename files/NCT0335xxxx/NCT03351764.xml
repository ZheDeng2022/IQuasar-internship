      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) may help diagnose and treat psychiatric and neurological&#xD;
      illness. But there is not enough research on how to apply NIBS. This includes how strong to&#xD;
      make it, where on the brain to apply it, and for how long. Researchers also want to see what&#xD;
      the brain is doing when it receives NIBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To increase the effectiveness of NIBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy native English speakers ages 18-65&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under another protocol with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and psychiatric history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychiatric evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will start with a 2-hour visit for screening. (see below). They may learn&#xD;
      how to do tasks that will be used later. After the screening session, they will be scheduled&#xD;
      for an MRI session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next part of the study is 4 substudies. Each substudy includes up to 4 sessions. A&#xD;
      session is usually 2-3 hours but can last up to 8 hours. Participants can join multiple&#xD;
      substudies, but only 1 at a time. They can do only 1 session on a given day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each substudy includes the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral tests: Interviews; questionnaires; simple tasks; and tests of memory, attention,&#xD;
      and thinking&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electromyography: Small sticky electrodes on the skin measure muscle activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation: A wire coil is held to the scalp. A brief electrical&#xD;
      current passes through the coil and affects brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Participants lie on a table that slides into a machine that&#xD;
      takes pictures of the brain. A coil is placed over the head. They will perform simple tasks&#xD;
      while in the scanner. They may also get TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalography: Small electrodes on the scalp record brain waves.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) using magnetic and electrical means, through the use of&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct and alternating current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS and tACS respectively), has proven to be a versatile tool in the&#xD;
      investigation of cortical organization and function, and has shown great potential as a means&#xD;
      to diagnose and treat psychiatric and neurological illness. Unfortunately, this research has&#xD;
      been slowed due to two fundamental problems that directly impact the usefulness of NIBS.&#xD;
      First, the space of parameters used to produce NIBS is immensely large and has barely been&#xD;
      explored. Such parameters include intensity of stimulation, pulse wave form and duration,&#xD;
      number and timing of pulses (which in turn can involve trains of pulses: their frequency,&#xD;
      duration, number, and intertrain intervals), the shape of the magnetic or electric field&#xD;
      produced (for TMS, meaning type of coil used, its position, and its orientation (with three&#xD;
      degrees of freedom for a figure eight coil), and for tDCS and tACS, the numbers, sizes and&#xD;
      placements of electrodes), and, for creating long-lasting effects, the number and timing of&#xD;
      NIBS sessions. Differences- often even very small differences- in the particular values of&#xD;
      any of these parameters have been shown to have significant impact on the size and duration&#xD;
      of NIBS effects, and yet little is known. Parametric exploration has only been addressed in a&#xD;
      limited way in the field, and primarily only in motor cortex. Second, the interaction of any&#xD;
      set of NIBS parameters with any individual brain is poorly understood, and this has led to&#xD;
      unpredictable efficacy and a large amount of inter-individual variability in NIBS studies.&#xD;
      The human brain is always in a complex, dynamic state of change, and it has become&#xD;
      increasingly clear that the state of a cortical region and its associated network connections&#xD;
      when NIBS is applied strongly influences its effects There are now a great many&#xD;
      demonstrations of how the state of the cortical region being stimulated plays a large role in&#xD;
      determining what specific NIBS effect occurs. Not knowing the particular state of a brain&#xD;
      when stimulating it has led to wide variability and unpredictability in NIBS effects. Thus&#xD;
      while the variable state of the target region in each subject is likely an important source&#xD;
      of the large amount of inter-individual variability found in TMS and tDCS studies, little&#xD;
      research has been performed as yet. This poses a huge challenge to the effectiveness of NIBS&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions on an individual and precision medicine basis, to the design and&#xD;
      implementation of brain stimulation studies and to the test-retest reliability of the&#xD;
      neurophysiological and behavioral measures used (and their optimization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this technical development protocol is to address these two fundamental&#xD;
      deficiencies in NIBS research. To do so, we would like to 1) explore, within safe ranges as&#xD;
      established by international consensus, the effects of different sets of NIBS stimulation&#xD;
      parameters on behavioral and cortical function, as measured by behavioral performance,&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), eye movements, and MRI. and, 2) to&#xD;
      develop the methodologies and analytic techniques behind those behavioral and physiological&#xD;
      measures in order to increase their usefulness in interpreting NIBS effects. In addition,&#xD;
      this protocol will be used to train new fellows coming to the Non-invasive Neuromodulation&#xD;
      Unit (NNU) in the use of TMS techniques. The NNU is exceptionally well-situated, both in&#xD;
      terms of expertise and resources, to perform this protocol. We expect that information&#xD;
      emerging from these studies will allow us to 1) optimize NIBS effects across ranges of&#xD;
      stimulation parameters and brain states, within individual subjects, and in terms test-retest&#xD;
      reliability, 2) to collect pilot data in healthy volunteers to establish feasibility and for&#xD;
      power analysis for future patient-oriented hypothesis-driven protocols, and 3) to train new&#xD;
      fellows in the use of these different methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We specifically propose to begin this development protocol with five substudies that span the&#xD;
      NIBS areas in need of further research, examining stimulus intensity, stimulus timing and&#xD;
      frequency, stimulus targeting, and methods for controlling brain state. These explorations&#xD;
      will provide a useful initial foray into NIBS parameter space, and will in addition help&#xD;
      develop means to more effectively dose TMS outside of motor cortex and reduce variability in&#xD;
      TMS effects, to test new methods of targeting TMS, to develop the usefulness of EEG in TMS,&#xD;
      and to understand the relationship of TMS timing and endogenous oscillations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol consists of the below substudies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 1 (Using TMS-evoked potential (TEP) to dose TMS outside of the motor cortex)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to begin an exploration of the feasibility of using EEG to evaluate the&#xD;
      response to single pulses of TMS over differing cortical brain areas, as a novel method of&#xD;
      individualizing the dose of TMS in a site-specific fashion. The local cortical response&#xD;
      represents an evoked wave of neuronal activity in the immediate vicinity of the stimulating&#xD;
      coil and could provide a useful dosing measure outside the motor cortex. In this first step,&#xD;
      at two cortical locations (motor cortex and occipital visual cortex) we explore the&#xD;
      relationship of TMS evoked potentials with functional evoked responses (MEPs from motor&#xD;
      cortex, visual discrimination in visual cortex) and with fMRI BOLD response to TMS at&#xD;
      different intensities applied to both cortical locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 2 (The value of electric field modeling in TMS localization)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study question for this substudy is as follows: Does inclusion of electric field modeling&#xD;
      to TMS targeting increase the efficacy of TMS?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal is to compare an electric field guided coil placement method with&#xD;
      (f)MRI-guided and scalp-guided NIBS targeting approaches. Including the latter condition&#xD;
      additionally allows for the substudy to address the only study that compared scalp-based and&#xD;
      fMRI-based targeting (Sack et al., 2009). The Sack et al. study was designed as between&#xD;
      groups, using very small Ns (of 5): the NIBS field would greatly benefit from a replication&#xD;
      with a larger group and a within-subjects design. In this first substudy, we will test the&#xD;
      efficacy of three E-field modeling approaches to TMS targeting, with the intention of using&#xD;
      the best method in a subsequent substudy to compare TMS targeting methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 3 (Controlling ongoing cortical state during NIBS with neurofeedback)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study question for this substudy is as follows: Does controlling brain states using&#xD;
      neurofeedback result in greater intra- and inter-individual variability in responses to TMS?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore the use of neurofeedback to control brain state, using EEG to&#xD;
      evaluate the cortical response to single pulses of TMS while subjects are controlling the&#xD;
      electrophysiological state of their brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 4 (Using cTMS EEG to understand mechanism and to optimize theta-burst stimulation&#xD;
      (TBS))&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study question for this substudy is as follows: What are the effects of TBS on EMG across&#xD;
      different waveforms of TMS pulses?&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this substudy, we aim to parametrically examine the effects of intertrial interval on TBS&#xD;
      response, and to harness the flexible control of pulse parameters using the cTMS device&#xD;
      (Rogue Research Inc., Canada) to investigate the effects of TBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 5 (using TMS as a probe of the fronto-striatal network, a key circuit implicated in&#xD;
      reward processing)&#xD;
&#xD;
      We seek to establish whether TMS can reach, in a dose-dependent way, a targeted subcortical&#xD;
      region transynaptically which is too distant for effective stimulation directly.&#xD;
      Specifically, we will test whether TMS, delivered to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (DLPFC) or the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), results in changes in activation of&#xD;
      the striatum, in a dose-dependent fashion. This hypothesis will be tested with the&#xD;
      perturbation-imaging procedure of TMS/fMRI interleaving, i.e. while participants receive TMS&#xD;
      during both resting state and task based fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 180 healthy volunteers, age 18 and older. The number is the sum of requested&#xD;
      participants (N=25) in the 4 substudies, with an additional 25 given an anticipated 20%&#xD;
      drop-out rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult volunteers will participate typically using repeated measures design, given the&#xD;
      goals of exploring parametric NIBS effects and to establish reliability in those effects,&#xD;
      although between groups designs might be required in some cases (e.g., when learning is&#xD;
      involved). Experiments will be carried out in two phases: with Phase I involving screening&#xD;
      and baseline procedures and Phase II being the experimental NIBS sessions. Phase I will&#xD;
      include consenting and screening. It will generally include an MRI session due to the need&#xD;
      for at least a structural MRI to be used for neuronavigation in NIBS targetingPhase I may&#xD;
      also include introduction and training in some behavioral task or tasks, as well as baseline&#xD;
      measures of, EEG, and EMG, as needed. In Phase II the experimental NIBS sessions will be&#xD;
      performed with each participant. The number of sessions will be variable, in general between&#xD;
      1 and 4, lasting about 1-3 hours each, depending on the exploratory question. NIBS may be&#xD;
      given in conjunction with EEG, EMG, and/or fMRI, either simultaneously or in a pre-post&#xD;
      manner. The NIBS stimulation parameters will never exceed safe ranges, as established in&#xD;
      international consensus safety reports. Experimental control comparisons may be between sham&#xD;
      and active NIBS, and/or in the latter case being NIBS to different scalp locations or at&#xD;
      different times, or in the case of parametric studies, differing values of the parameter in&#xD;
      question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experience in the NIBS field over the past three decades provides no evidence that there&#xD;
      is an upper limit on the number of NIBS sessions an individual can safely participate in.&#xD;
      This conclusion is primarily based on the many thousands of individuals who have received TMS&#xD;
      treatment for depression according to the FDA-cleared labeling, in which six weeks of daily&#xD;
      weekday treatment (30 sessions involving 3000 pulses of rTMS per session) are provided, with&#xD;
      no new, unexpected adverse events reported. Thus, the amount of participation will only be&#xD;
      limited in two ways: first, subjects participate in one experimental session per day. A&#xD;
      single session, which generally lasts between 1-3 hours, may last no longer than 8 hours to&#xD;
      allow for the initial testing paradigm followed by retests or performing other components of&#xD;
      the same substudy later in the day, with appropriate rest breaks and meal breaks during long&#xD;
      sessions. Second, subjects can participate in only one substudy at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 1: MEP and TEP amplitudes and latencies; fMRI BOLD changes; visual discrimination&#xD;
      threshold&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 2: Pre-post change in behavioral performance (RT and accuracy) and in parietal fMRI&#xD;
      BOLD response across conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 3: Individual and group averaged amplitudes and latencies of TEPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 4: Amplitude and latency of MEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 5: change in fMRI BOLD response in the striatum as the result of surface cortical&#xD;
      TMS.&#xD;
