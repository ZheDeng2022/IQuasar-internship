      On July 14, 2016, in Nice, children and their families were attacked by the organization&#xD;
      &quot;EI&quot;. In Nice, 86 deaths, including 10 children, the youngest at 4, were recorded. A number&#xD;
      of children, still difficult to assess exactly but over 100, was bereaved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a traumatic event, multiple clinical consequences may appear in children. Among these&#xD;
      consequences, the most common is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The aim of the study&#xD;
      is to characterize the psycho-social factors of risk and / or protection interfering in the&#xD;
      children's future, following the mass trauma of 14 July 2016 in Nice on a sample of pediatric&#xD;
      population exposed in comparison of children controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ancillary study, entilted &quot;The Physalis Child&quot;, prospectively observe the presence or not of&#xD;
      non-psychotic acousto-verbal hallucinations (AVH) in the population with PTSD from the&#xD;
      &quot;Program 14-7&quot;. The main objective of this ancillary study will be to identify factors of&#xD;
      social and emotional cognition linked to the presence of non-psychotic HAV within the cohort&#xD;

    <textblock>
      On July 14, 2016, in Nice, children and their families were attacked by the organization&#xD;
      &quot;EI&quot;. This is the second time in our country that children are victims of this organization&#xD;
      after the attack on the school Ozar Hotarah in March 2012 in Toulouse where four children&#xD;
      were killed &quot;touching end&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Nice, 86 deaths, including 10 children, the youngest at 4, were recorded. A number of&#xD;
      children, still difficult to assess exactly but over 100, was bereaved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a traumatic event, multiple clinical consequences may appear in children. Among these&#xD;
      consequences, the most common is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This pathology&#xD;
      includes 4 main symptoms: the reviviscences of the event, avoidance behaviors, alterations of&#xD;
      cognition and mood and neurovegetative overactivation. In addition, PTSD contributes to the&#xD;
      development of many other mental disorders. It is estimated that 75% of adolescents or&#xD;
      children having a comorbid disorder with PTSD. In the literature, the main comorbidities&#xD;
      identified in pediatric populations are: anxiety disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity&#xD;
      Disorder (ADHD) and depression. There is no recommendation as to the therapeutics to be used&#xD;
      in psychotraumatism in pediatric population. Epidemiological studies conducted on the&#xD;
      consequences of trauma reveal a high variability in the development of psychopathologies. 6&#xD;
      to 20% of exposed children would develop PTSD after a potentially traumatic situation.&#xD;
      Several factors can explain the heterogeneity of the results, including the age, the type of&#xD;
      trauma experienced, the violence suffered during this trauma. In Nice, to date, more than&#xD;
      2200 children have consulted: 700 children between July 14 and July 28, 2016, 1100 children&#xD;
      were seen between August and December, and about 400 since the creation of the Post Traumatic&#xD;
      Pediatric Intersectoral Assessment Center (CE2P), in January 2017. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      characterize the psycho-social factors of risk and / or protection interfering in the&#xD;
      children's future, following the mass trauma of 14 July 2016 in Nice on a sample of pediatric&#xD;
      population exposed in comparison of children controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-psychotic hallucinations represent a significant symptomatology in child psychiatry (1)&#xD;
      and remain clinical question. The results of our previous study &quot;the physalis child&quot; showed a&#xD;
      significant correlation between the persistence of non-psychotic acousto-verbal&#xD;
      hallucinations (AVH) and the presence of negative emotions, linked to post traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD). It seems important to understand the link between trauma and the presence of&#xD;
      non-psychotic AVH in children as the literature shows the risk of progression to psychosis&#xD;
      when these AVH persist.The interest of the ancllary study of &quot;the physalis child&quot; would be to&#xD;
      prospectively observe the presence or not of non-psychotic AVH in the population with PTSD&#xD;
      from the &quot;Program 14-7&quot;. The question would then be: &quot;Why in two subjects diagnosed with&#xD;
      PTSD, one has non-psychotic HAV and the other does not?&quot; The main objective of this ancillary&#xD;
      study will be to identify factors of social and emotional cognition linked to the presence of&#xD;
      non-psychotic HAV within the cohort of children exposed to the mass trauma of July 14, 2016&#xD;
      in Nice but also to any type of individual trauma.&#xD;
