  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, sham-controlled, patient masked, outcome assessor-blinded study to&#xD;
      assess a Pharyngeal Electrical Stimulation (PES) Catheter for treatment of oropharyngeal&#xD;
      dysphagia following a stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomization will be stratified at each site in a 1:1 fashion. All patients will have the&#xD;
      Phagenyx® Catheter placed prior to randomization, and will receive either an active treatment&#xD;
      of Pharyngeal Electrical Stimulation (PES) or a sham treatment performed by a health care&#xD;
      professional (HCP) that is un-blinded to treatment assignment. All other speech pathology&#xD;
      standard dysphagia care will be provided by a speech language pathologist (SLP) that is&#xD;
      blinded to treatment assignment. Administration of all protocol-specific assessments will be&#xD;
      conducted by personnel blinded to treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow an adaptive group sequential design with unblinded sample size&#xD;
      re-assessment. To ensure 180 evaluable patients with 7-day data and assuming a 20% dropout&#xD;
      rate, 225 patients will be enrolled initially. An interim analysis for futility will occur&#xD;
      after the first 60 patients complete their 7-day visits and another interim analysis will be&#xD;
      performed for efficacy and futility after 120 patients complete their 7-day visits. The total&#xD;
      sample size may be increased up to 338 patients after the second interim analysis to ensure&#xD;
      up to 270 evaluable patients. Up to 15 investigational centers across the US and possibly&#xD;
      Europe will participate in this study. The enrollment period is expected to be approximately&#xD;
      24 months and patient participation will last for approximately 11 weeks. Patients will be&#xD;
      assessed at the following intervals: baseline, 48 hours, 7 days, 14 days or at discharge,&#xD;
      whichever is first, and 11 weeks after completion of the study treatments.&#xD;

    <description>VFSS (Vidoeflouroscopic Swallow Study) Swallowing safety of a bolus of thin and nectar consistency determined by a videofluoroscopic swallowing study.The PAS provides a scoring mechanism for airway closure and clearance during the VFSS. The PAS is a validated 8-point scale that measures penetration and aspiration. Scores are determined primarily by the depth to which material passes into the airway.&#xD;
Material does not enter airway&#xD;
Material enters the airway, remains above the vocal folds, and is ejected&#xD;
Material remains above the vocal folds, and is not ejected from airway&#xD;
