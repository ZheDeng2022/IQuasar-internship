      This is an observational pilot study investigating the effectiveness, safety and specific&#xD;
      immunological mechanisms of Specific Oral Tolerance Induction (SOTI) in children with&#xD;
      IgE-mediated wheat allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 10 patients with persistent IgE-mediated allergy to wheat, who will&#xD;
      undergo 1-year home SOTI. Moreover, 5 patients with IgE-mediated allergy to wheat will be&#xD;
      followed for 1-year period after their diagnosis, without any intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Well-cooked wheat spaghetti will be given daily to patients with a programmed weekly dose&#xD;
      increment for 27 weeks (up-dosing phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, wheat protein maintenance dose will be received daily for additional 6 months&#xD;
      (maintenance phase), while afterwards patients will be clinically assessed and a 2nd OFC at a&#xD;
      higher cumulative dose of wheat protein will be performed, in order to assess patients'&#xD;
      desensitization to wheat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin Prick Tests (SPTs) to wheat, blood sampling for the determination of total IgE, wheat&#xD;
      specific IgEs and wheat Basophil Activation Test (BAT) will be performed at baseline, when&#xD;
      patients reach the maintenance dose and before the 2nd OFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding historical control group the same testing will be performed at baseline and at&#xD;
      re-evaluation (post 12 months).&#xD;

      This is an observational pilot study investigating the effectiveness, safety and specific&#xD;
      immunological mechanisms of Specific Oral Tolerance Induction (SOTI) in children aged 2-16&#xD;
      years with IgE-mediated wheat allergy. The study will be conducted in the Department of&#xD;
      Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 2nd University Pediatric Clinic of &quot;Panagiotis &amp; Aglaia&#xD;
      Kyriakou&quot; Children's Hospital, Athens, Greece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 10 patients with persistent IgE-mediated allergy to wheat, who will&#xD;
      undergo 1-year home SOTI, defined as SOTI group. Moreover, 5 patients with IgE-mediated&#xD;
      allergy to wheat will be followed for 1-year period after their diagnosis, without any&#xD;
      intervention, either because of denial or due to positive history of severe anaphylaxis to&#xD;
      very low doses of wheat during baseline Oral Food Challenge / OFC or home ingestion in the&#xD;
      preceding 3 months. These will be defined as historical control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Well-cooked wheat spaghetti will be given daily to patients with a programmed weekly dose&#xD;
      increment for 27 weeks (up-dosing phase). Three different home starting doses will be&#xD;
      pre-determined in accordance to each individual's reactivity threshold during baseline OFC to&#xD;
      wheat. Each proposed starting dose will be associated with a different weekly stable increase&#xD;
      ratio of wheat intake, so that all patients reach an equal predefined maintenance dose at&#xD;
      week 27 of up-dosing phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, wheat protein maintenance dose (spaghetti or equivalent quantity of wheat&#xD;
      protein of other wheat product) will be received daily for additional 6 months (maintenance&#xD;
      phase), while afterwards patients will be clinically assessed and a 2nd OFC at a higher&#xD;
      cumulative dose of wheat protein will be performed, in order to assess patients'&#xD;
      desensitization to wheat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin Prick Tests (SPTs) to wheat, blood sampling for the determination of total IgE, wheat&#xD;
      specific IgEs (f4, f79, f98, f416, f433) and wheat Basophil Activation Test (BAT) will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline, when patients reach the maintenance dose and before the 2nd OFC.&#xD;
      Additionally, blood sampling for determination of the levels of anti-tissue transglutaminase&#xD;
      (tTG)-IgA/IgG and anti-endomysial (EMA)-IgA antibodies at baseline and post study completion&#xD;
      will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding historical control group the same testing (except anti-tTG and anti-EMA) will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline visit and at re-evaluation (post 12 months). All children and / or&#xD;
      their parents / legal guardians will be trained in the use of self-injectable epinephrine in&#xD;
      case of severe allergic reactions and a detailed treatment plan will be given by the study&#xD;
      doctors. Written information sheet will be provided and written consent will be obtained from&#xD;
      all parents/legal guardians.&#xD;
