  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Presently, the standard of care at the investigators' practice is that the discharging&#xD;
      physician decides the type and amount of opioid medication to prescribe a patient following a&#xD;
      cesarean section. After informed consent has been obtained, patients will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      randomized-controlled equivalence study. The experimental group will be prescribed 20&#xD;
      oxycodone-acetaminophen and the control group will be prescribed 28 oxycodone-acetaminophen&#xD;
      at the time of discharge. Both groups will also be provided with a handout on non-opioid&#xD;
      analgesia. The groups will be assigned randomly in blocks. The investigators will recruit&#xD;
      patients either in the clinic, if participants are to have a scheduled cesarean section, or&#xD;
      at some time during the hospital admission for delivery. The satisfaction survey and pain&#xD;
      scale will be administered at the postoperative check by the clinic staff and providers.&#xD;
      These surveys will be stored in a secure location at the clinic. If the patient does not show&#xD;
      up for their postoperative visit, 3 attempts total will be made by an investigator to reach&#xD;
      the patient and administer both surveys by phone within 2 weeks of discharge. A preliminary&#xD;
      analysis of the data will be done once half the study patients have been recruited. The&#xD;
      investigators do not foresee any threats to the external or internal validity of the study.&#xD;
      The investigators are taking many measures to limit study bias. First, block randomization&#xD;
      will help limit discrepancies between groups. Also, strict adherence to the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will also help limit confounders that may make data difficult to&#xD;
      interpret, such as non-opioid na√Øve patients and complications that may potentially increase&#xD;
      pain and opioid requirements. Lastly, blinding of patients to the number of pills&#xD;
      participants receive will help mitigate patient bias.&#xD;

      Presently, the standard of care at our practice is that the discharging physician decides the&#xD;
      type and amount of opioid medication to prescribe a patient following a cesarean section.&#xD;
      After informed consent has been obtained, patients will be enrolled in our&#xD;
      randomized-control, equivalence study. The experimental group will be prescribed 20&#xD;
      oxycodone-acetaminophen and the control group will be prescribed 28 oxycodone-acetaminophen&#xD;
      at the time of discharge. Both groups will also be provided with a handout on non-opioid&#xD;
      analgesia. The groups will be assigned randomly in blocks. The investigators will recruit&#xD;
      patients either in the clinic, if participants are to have a scheduled cesarean section, or&#xD;

      the patient does not show up for their postoperative visit, 3 attempts total will be made by&#xD;
      an investigator to reach the patient and administer both surveys by phone within 2 weeks of&#xD;
      discharge. A preliminary analysis of the data will be done once half the study patients have&#xD;
      been recruited. First, block randomization will help limit discrepancies between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject evaluation will generally be limited to no more than 3 weeks following surgery.&#xD;
      Evaluations will occur at the postoperative visit via two surveys (see below). If the patient&#xD;
      does not show up for the clinic visit, 3 attempts will be made by an investigator to reach&#xD;
      the patient and administer both surveys by phone within 2 weeks of discharge.&#xD;

    <description>Our main aim is to determine the effect of decreased opioid prescribing on pain control following cesarean section. Our hypothesis is that despite decreased opioid prescribing [20 oxycodone-acetaminophen (5/325mg)] following cesarean section, pain scores will be equivalent to the control group [28 oxycodone-acetaminophen (5/325mg)]. Pain control will be measured by an 11-point numeric scale.</description>
