    <textblock>
      Pressure injuries are a serious health care problem and affect millions of people. Most&#xD;
      pressure injuries are avoidable with the application of best practices and with the use of&#xD;
      appropriate technology. Support surfaces are a crucial component of any comprehensive&#xD;
      prevention strategy. Decades of research have produced moderate and low levels of evidence&#xD;
      upon which to base clinical decisions concerning how and when to apply support surfaces for&#xD;
      prevention. This knowledge has been periodically assessed and assembled into clinical&#xD;
      practice guidelines. There is good evidence that the combined group of active and reactive&#xD;
      support surfaces is effective in preventing pressure injuries and that high-specification&#xD;
      reactive foam surfaces are effective in preventing pressure injuries. But there is&#xD;
      insufficient evidence that low air loss surfaces are more or less effective than other types&#xD;
      of surfaces. Yet, low air loss surfaces are used for more than 17% of patients in acute care&#xD;
      at high risk of developing pressure injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to determine if and when low air loss is effective in preventing&#xD;
      pressure injuries, and what level of heat and moisture control performance is necessary for&#xD;
      prevention effectiveness. The primary aim of the project is to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      reactive support surfaces with low air loss to reactive support surfaces without low air loss&#xD;
      in preventing pressure injuries for people with moisture risk factors in acute care. Support&#xD;
      surfaces are currently marketed and identified by practitioners based on device features&#xD;
      (e.g., low air loss, air fluidization, alternating pressure), categories (powered,&#xD;
      non-powered, reactive, and active) and components (e.g., foam, gel, fluid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The critical performance characteristics of low air loss systems are moisture, humidity and&#xD;
      temperature management. Preliminary work has revealed that these characteristics vary widely&#xD;
      among different low air loss products. A secondary aim of the proposed study is to explore&#xD;
      associations between support surface performance characteristics and pressure injury outcomes&#xD;
      to identify which low air loss performance characteristics and what level of those&#xD;
      performance characteristics are necessary for the technology to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful completion of this project will fill a critical gap in evidence regarding the&#xD;
      effectiveness of support surfaces with low air loss, and could influence a shift in the way&#xD;
      support surfaces are characterized away from the current feature-based paradigm toward a more&#xD;
      clinically relevant and generalizable performance-based paradigm.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pressure injuries are a serious health care problem and threaten the health and well-being of&#xD;
      millions of people. Most pressure injuries are avoidable with the application of standard&#xD;
      practices and proper utilization of existing technology. Support surface technology has been&#xD;
      shown to prevent pressure injuries, but the effectiveness of specific features designed for&#xD;
      management of tissue loads, microclimate (i.e., heat and moisture), and/or other therapeutic&#xD;
      functions are unknown. Preclinical research has demonstrated that heat and moisture are&#xD;
      important pressure injury risk factors. Low air loss is a support surface feature designed to&#xD;
      manage the heat and moisture at the interface between the person and the surface. It is a&#xD;
      feature that is invariably combined with the provision of pressure redistribution through&#xD;
      immersion and envelopment. Clinical research has produced evidence to support the use of&#xD;
      reactive support surfaces with good immersion and envelopment characteristics, but there is a&#xD;
      gap in evidence regarding the effectiveness of microclimate management features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to first determine if low air loss is effective for preventing pressure&#xD;
      injuries. Second, to facilitate translation of the results to clinical practice, the study is&#xD;
      designed to identify which low air loss performance characteristics and what levels of those&#xD;
      performance characteristics are necessary for the technology to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 will compare the effectiveness of reactive support surfaces with low air loss to&#xD;
      reactive support surfaces without low air loss in preventing pressure injuries for people&#xD;
      with moisture risk factors in acute care. This aim will also investigate the comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness in subgroups defined by age, body mass index (BMI), Braden score, and Braden&#xD;
      mobility subscale score. We will also investigate the association between pressure injury&#xD;
      severity and treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 will explore associations between support surface performance characteristics and&#xD;
      pressure injury outcomes. Performance will be quantified by the microclimate control measures&#xD;
      of evaporative capacity and heat flux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An individual randomized design with 816 subjects will be used to achieve the aims.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into either a low air loss or no-low air loss surface type&#xD;
      across seven possible groups differentiated only by the support surface assignment. The seven&#xD;
      surfaces will have a range of heat and moisture control performance characteristics.&#xD;
      Biological variables, pressure injury incidence, pressure injury risk factors and related&#xD;
      clinical conditions and procedures will be recorded and analyzed. For Aim 2, to explore&#xD;
      associations between support surface performance characteristics and pressure injuries, we&#xD;
      will determine threshold and cutoff values for optimum effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is designed to fill a critical gap in evidence regarding the effectiveness&#xD;
      of support surfaces with low air loss. The study will also explore cutoff scores or ranges of&#xD;
      effective performance for microclimate control. If successful, the study could influence a&#xD;
      shift in the way support surfaces are characterized away from the current feature-based&#xD;
      paradigm toward a more accurate and generalizable performance-based paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol: An individual randomized design will be used to achieve the aims. The study&#xD;
      procedures and flow is depicted in Figure 1. Eligible acute care patients will be identified&#xD;
      and enrolled within 24 hours of admission. New admissions will be screened for the following&#xD;
      criteria for inclusion: 1. total Braden score≤18 and 2. Braden Moisture sub-scale score&#xD;
      1-constantly moist or 2-very moist, 3. projected length of stay ≥4 days, and 4. absence of&#xD;
      pressure injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent, absence of pressure injuries will be confirmed, baseline data&#xD;
      (demographic and clinical data) will be recorded and participants will be randomized to one&#xD;
      of seven groups differentiated only by the support surface assignment. The seven surfaces can&#xD;
      be divided into reactive support surface with low air loss (5 total) or reactive surface&#xD;
      without low air loss (2 total) for analyses of Aim 1, and demonstrate a range of heat and&#xD;
      water vapor control performance characteristics for analyses of Aim 2. Once enrolled, the&#xD;
      participant will be provided the intervention within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in all groups will be provided usual care including tissue integrity management&#xD;
      according to UPMC system-wide Skin Integrity Procedures, which address risk assessment&#xD;
      (daily), skin inspection (twice daily), regular patient repositioning (every two hours as&#xD;
      condition allows), pressure alleviation, moisture control, nutritional support and&#xD;
      friction/shear relief applications. Outcomes will be recorded from electronic medical records&#xD;
      and through assessment by research staff until pressure injury incidence or hospital&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures were chosen to ensure direct relevance to patients at risk for&#xD;
      developing pressure injuries. We chose the direct clinical outcome measure of pressure injury&#xD;
      incidence to assess the clinical effectiveness of the study support surface interventions&#xD;
      being compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure injury status will be assessed daily. Pressure injury risk factors, ambulatory&#xD;
      status and related preventive interventions (support surface related conditions such as&#xD;
      layers of linens, and interventions such as turning schedules) will be monitored and recorded&#xD;
      every day (7 days per week) from electronic medical records, observation by research staff&#xD;
      and interviews with clinical staff until any of the following endpoints are reached: pressure&#xD;
      injury incidence, Braden score &gt;18, or discharge from hospital. After an endpoint is reached,&#xD;
      length of stay, and, for participants that develop pressure injuries, the severity will be&#xD;
      recorded as the highest injury stage reached prior to discharge (Stage 1, 2, 3, 4, DTPI or&#xD;
      unstageable) as defined by the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel. If the injury status&#xD;
      was observed to be a DTPI or unstageable at any point in time and later becomes identified as&#xD;
      1, 2, 3, or 4, the latter stage will be recorded. Otherwise DTPIs and unstageable injuries&#xD;
      will be recorded as such.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables believed to be associated with the study outcome of pressure injuries include: 1.&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical characteristics: age, race, ethnicity, weight, height, and medical&#xD;
      comorbidities such as diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, nutritional status, and&#xD;
      incontinence. These will be recorded at baseline. 2. Pressure injury risk factors: Braden&#xD;
      score, Braden sub-scale scores, and ambulatory status will be monitored and recorded daily&#xD;
      until endpoint. 3. Clinical conditions and procedures: layers of linens, interventions such&#xD;
      as turning schedules, and type and length of the surgery will be monitored and recorded daily&#xD;
      until endpoint. 4. Length of stay and number of days on the support surface will be recorded&#xD;
      at study endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      816 participants will be identified and recruited from the adult inpatient population of&#xD;
      facilities in the University of Pittsburgh hospital system (UPMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a 2:1 allocation randomization scheme stratifying by support surface type&#xD;
      (2 LAL to 1 no-LAL). The rationale for having a 2:1 allocation is to allow us to achieve both&#xD;
      aims. The 2:1 allocation is necessary because we plan to randomize to 5 LAL groups and 2&#xD;
      no-LAL groups. We will use randomized blocks of varying length (containing random&#xD;
      permutations of the two surface types, LAL vs. no LAL, across the seven groups) for&#xD;
      randomization. T.&#xD;
