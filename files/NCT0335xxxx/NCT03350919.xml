      The purpose of this research is to assess the efficacy of a visual training task on reducing&#xD;
      the size of a visual field deficit caused by brain damage in adults, and its ability to&#xD;
      improve visual functions in this patient population.&#xD;

    <description>A computer software and chin-rest necessary to perform visual training will be loaned to each patient to use at home. They will perform one to two daily training sessions in their home, consisting of 200-300 trials each. The visual task performed repetitively will involve discriminating the direction of motion of a small cloud of dots located at a pre-determined location in the blind field. The computer program will automatically create a record of patient performance during each home training session. They will train daily (about 40-60 minutes total), 5 to 7 days per week, for at least 24 weeks.</description>

          <title>Preliminary deficit size</title>
          <description>The total area of the subject's deficit, as measured by Humphrey perimetry using a 24-2 testing pattern. This value was calculated by combining testing results from both eyes and interpolating between the tested points to a resolution of 0.1 deg of visual angle. Regions of the visual field with a pattern deviation value (as measured by the Humphrey perimeter) of less than -5 dB were then recorded as part of the deficit. The total area of these combined regions is reported here in square degrees of visual angle.</description>
