      A retrospective morbidity and mortality study, using routinely collected data, investigating&#xD;
      the epidemiology of patients with conflict-related injuries presenting to a dedicated trauma&#xD;
      hospital in Erbil, Iraq, during the campaign to liberate Mosul from ISIS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trauma is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. An analysis of the Global&#xD;
      Burden of Disease study indicated that in 2013, globally 973 million traumatic injuries&#xD;
      warranted medical intervention, while 4.8 million injuries were fatal. The Small Arms Survey&#xD;
      - Global Burden of Armed Violence report compiles worldwide conflict-related data and&#xD;
      indicates that between 2007-2012, there were a total of 508,000 fatalities attributable to&#xD;
      interpersonal violence worldwide, of which 70,000 were conflict-related. Since the U.S.&#xD;
      invasion of Iraq in 2003, the country has perpetually constituted a scene of conflict.&#xD;
      Hagopian et al reports that in the period 2003-2011, there were between 48,000 and 751,000&#xD;
      excess deaths attributable to the conflict.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2014, a new group, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), made significant territorial&#xD;
      gains in several governorates in Iraq and captured key cities, including Fallujah and Mosul.&#xD;
      ISIS is unique among terrorist groups in that it employs a combination of conventional&#xD;
      maneuver warfare tactics with terrorist tactics such as Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)&#xD;
      and Vehicle-Born Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIEDs) in order to capture and hold&#xD;
      territory. These indiscriminate tactics lead to excessive civilian casualties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In mid-October 2016 the offensive to liberate Mosul started. Emergency Hospital (EH) is one&#xD;
      hospital assigned by the Kurdistan Ministry of Health to receive trauma patients from the&#xD;
      conflict, and is located in Erbil, around 94 Km east of Mosul. EH is a dedicated trauma&#xD;
      hospital that was set up in 1997. Since mid-October 2016 EH is exclusively providing care to&#xD;
      injured from the armed conflict. Initially EH and WEH were the only hospitals providing&#xD;
      surgical trauma care to patients from Mosul but since late December 2016 secondary facilities&#xD;
      have opened closer to Mosul. The two hospitals are since then mainly referral hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research on trauma from conflict zones generally focus solely on military&#xD;
      combatants. Due to the use of ballistic protection and forward surgical teams these results&#xD;
      may not be applicable to a civilian setting. A few organizations, such as the Médecins Sans&#xD;
      Frontières (MSF), have reported on civilian casualties in conflict zones; however, these have&#xD;
      been reports from single centers and articles are sometimes published several years after the&#xD;
      trauma occurred. More timely information is needed on the type and pattern of injury for both&#xD;
      combatants and civilians. ISIS tactics are likely to have a significant impact on the type of&#xD;
      injuries seen at EH. An increased understanding of this impact is essential for addressing&#xD;
      emerging resource requirements. The investigators anticipate a high incidence of blast- and&#xD;
      firearm-related injuries in both civilians and combatants. This study utilizes existing data&#xD;
      from the hospital to gain knowledge of the characteristics of conflict-related injuries, as&#xD;
      well as the demographic profile of the patients. Furthermore, the data will be used to&#xD;
      investigate how morbidity and mortality varies depending on injury type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the demographics of patients with conflict-related injuries presenting to the&#xD;
           EMC during the Mosul campaign.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe the morbidity profile of the study population, specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Determine how markers for injury severity vary with injury mechanism and patient&#xD;
                status as combatant or non-combatant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Compare how injury mechanism varies with patient identity as non-combatant, ISF or&#xD;
                Peshmerga.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the in-hospital mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is essential both for generating actionable results necessary to direct operational&#xD;
      priorities, and gaining an understanding of the wider public health impact of the ongoing&#xD;
      conflict. The evidence generated by this study will facilitate effective programmatic&#xD;
      monitoring and help optimize resource allocation to meet the rapidly changing health needs in&#xD;
      the area.&#xD;
