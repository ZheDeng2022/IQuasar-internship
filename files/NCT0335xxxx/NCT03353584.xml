  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is the most common complication in patients with sickle&#xD;
      cell disease (SCD) and pain related to VOC is often inadequately treated. This is a phase II&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of virtual reality technology&#xD;
      when added to standard pain management for patients with sickle cell disease who are&#xD;
      experiencing acute pain crisis in the ambulatory care setting. Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either standard management only or standard management in addition to virtual reality&#xD;
      therapy. The remainder of care for the painful event will continue per institutional&#xD;
      standards according to clinical indication, including reassessment and documentation of pain&#xD;
      and additional doses of pain medicines by intravenous (IV) or oral route. Pain scores and&#xD;
      opioid requirement will be measured and compared across treatment arms, along with the&#xD;
      outcomes of discharge from clinic versus admission to the inpatient unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) technology in reducing pain&#xD;
      at 30 minutes after intervention during an acute vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with&#xD;
      sickle cell disease. Primary endpoint will be change in pain scores in Standard versus VR&#xD;
      arms, between the first pain assessment at the time of presentation and the subsequent pain&#xD;
      assessments up to 30 minutes after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare total opioid consumption from the time of presentation to the time of&#xD;
           discharge from acute care setting in Standard versus VR arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) technology in reducing pain at 60 minutes&#xD;
           after the first IV medication administered or 60 minutes after completion VR during an&#xD;
           acute vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with sickle cell disease.&#xD;

      After consenting to participate in this study, patients will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      standard care therapy for VOC or to receive standard care therapy plus a 15-minute virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR) session. They will be additionally randomized into strata by age: 6 to 11 years,&#xD;
      12 to 18 years, and 19 to 25 years. At the end of therapy or therapy plus the VR session,&#xD;
      they will be asked to complete a 5-minute satisfaction survey. Information will also be&#xD;
      collected from the medical record about the pain episode, including pain scores, medicines&#xD;
      used, and time needed for pain to lessen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard care for management of an acute VOC includes parenteral hydration and pain&#xD;
      management with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as Toradol or Ibuprofen, and&#xD;
      opioids. Pain scores will be measured at three different time points: baseline at&#xD;
      presentation, at 30±10 minutes after first intravenous (IV) analgesic medication, and at&#xD;
      60±10 minutes after first IV analgesic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of VR will be included in addition to the standard care for management of patients&#xD;
      randomized to VR arm. VR is an interactive technology that allows the user to interface with&#xD;
      a three dimensional computer-generated environment by means of a lightweight head mounted&#xD;
      display. The user is transported into a relaxing VR environment that diverts their attention&#xD;
      away from pain. The duration of VR session is 15 minutes. Pain scores will be measured at&#xD;
      three different time points: baseline at presentation, at 15±10 minutes after completion of&#xD;
      VR therapy, and at 60±10 minutes after completion of VR therapy.&#xD;
