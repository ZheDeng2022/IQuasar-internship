  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infant mortality is still relevant despite the improvement and the accessibility of hospital&#xD;
      care. Premature birth are two fold higher than in metropolitan France. Some factors has been&#xD;
      suspected such as precariousness, alcoholism, congenital malformation, care accessibility,&#xD;
      epidemic environment ... Nevertheless, the impact of these factors on foetal death or&#xD;
      new-born death are not yet sufficiently quantified to provide appropriate care and prevention&#xD;
      action in Reunion Island.&#xD;

      Through the analysis of interview of the mothers that have lost their infant during pregnancy&#xD;
      or just after birth, the study aims to draw a picture of the pregnancy cares offer and&#xD;
      pregnancy conditions in Reunion Island.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an non interventional case-control study. Socio-economic conditions, pregnancy&#xD;
      care and prevention are screened to identified the major cause of foetal or new-born death in&#xD;
      Reunion Island. These data are still lacking and will be useful to identify which public&#xD;
      health actions that should be organized.&#xD;
