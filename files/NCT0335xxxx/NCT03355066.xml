  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation, dose-finding and expansion study&#xD;
      in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors for whom no standard therapy is available. The&#xD;
      study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of&#xD;
      SM08502 administered orally, once daily, following a 28-day treatment cycle (Part 1A).&#xD;
      Alternative dosing schedules will be explored in Part 1B and the recommended Part 2 dose and&#xD;
      schedule will be further evaluated in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in a screening period of up to 14 days. Dosing in 28-day cycles&#xD;
      will continue within each subject, unless treatment is discontinued due to toxicity, disease&#xD;
      progression, initiation of a new anti-neoplastic therapy, withdrawal of consent, the Sponsor&#xD;
      terminates the study, or the subject no longer meets retreatment criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 10 subjects enrolled in Part 2, irrespective of the tumor type, will be&#xD;
      included in a food effect substudy to assess the preliminary effect of a high-fat,&#xD;
      high-calorie meal on the PK of SM08502. Subjects participating in the food effect substudy&#xD;
      will continue on study and complete assessments as per the Part 2 schedule and receive&#xD;
      SM08502 at the recommended Part 2 dose (or another previously assessed dose level and&#xD;
      schedule).&#xD;

    <arm_group_label>Part 1A: Dose Escalation</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Cohorts of subjects with advanced solid tumors will receive increasing doses (10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 120, 160, or 200 mg) of SM08502, administered orally, once daily, following 28-day treatment cycles. If the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is not determined at the 200 mg dose, dosing will continue at 50 mg/dose increments until an MTD is determined. Cohorts will include approximately 1 to 6 subjects according to an accelerated escalation design and safety requirements for expansion of subject numbers. For the purpose of dose escalation and de-escalation, the dose of SM08502 and regimen may be modified based on the type of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed and following data review and discussions between the Sponsor and Investigators.</description>

Initially, two cohorts of 6-24 subjects will be evaluated comparing 2 different doses and schedules of SM08502 (30 mg daily and 40 mg 5 days on and 2 days off), administered orally following 28-day treatment cycles. If appropriate, alternative doses and schedules may be evaluated depending on the results.</description>

The indications to be evaluated include subjects with advanced and/or metastatic CRPC, NSCLC, TNBC, CRC, endometrial cancer, and ovarian cancer for which histologic or cytologic confirmation of malignancy was obtained at diagnosis. Each cohort will enroll approximately 20 subjects.&#xD;
Approximately 10 subjects enrolled in Part 2 will be included in a food effect sub-study to assess the preliminary effect of a high-fat, high-calorie meal on the PK of SM08502.</description>

                  (i.e., subjects must not be candidates for regimens known to provide clinical&#xD;
                  benefit) and for which histologic or cytologic confirmation of malignancy was&#xD;
                  obtained at diagnosis, with the exception of hepatocellular carcinoma if it meets&#xD;
                  appropriate imaging-only diagnostic criteria [per the National Comprehensive&#xD;
                  Cancer Network (NCCN), Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS),&#xD;
                  American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), Asian Pacific&#xD;

               2. Part 1B - Subjects with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors who are&#xD;
                  refractory to or intolerant of established therapy known to provide clinical&#xD;
                  benefit for their condition (i.e., subjects must not be candidates for regimens&#xD;

                  cytologic confirmation of malignancy must have been obtained at diagnosis. The&#xD;
                  indications eligible for Part 1B include: i. NSCLC, ii.TNBC, iii. CRPC, iv. CRC,&#xD;
                  v. Endometrial cancer, vi. Ovarian cancer&#xD;

             ng/ml or greater is required for study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must have recovered (i.e., Grade 1 [or better] based on CTCAE v5.0) from all&#xD;
             toxicity associated with previous chemotherapy, targeted therapy, experimental&#xD;
