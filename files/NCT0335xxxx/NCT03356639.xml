      The primary purpose is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ASP6981 in participants&#xD;
      with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also primary purpose is to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of ASP6981 in participants with&#xD;
      schizophrenia as measured by cognitive function and neurophysiological biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ASP6981 in&#xD;
      participants with schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate ASP6981 in stable participants with schizophrenia on stable doses of&#xD;
      up to 2 second generation antipsychotic drugs for at least 2 months prior to screening.&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled and randomized into 1 of 4 treatment sequences: AB, BA, CD, DC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening period: After a screening period of up to 29 days prior to study drug&#xD;
      administration, eligible participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on day -3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational period: Enrolled participants will be randomized to receive either ASP6981 or&#xD;
      Placebo first and then will be crossed over to receive the opposite intervention. The study&#xD;
      will consist of two treatment periods of 14 days separated by a washout period of 14 days.&#xD;
      Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit on day 15 for the washout period.&#xD;
      Washout may be extended up to a maximum of 21 days depending on the participant's&#xD;
      availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: Participants will return to the clinical unit for an End of Study Visit (ESV) on&#xD;
      day 28 of period 2 or, if the participant terminated early from the study, 14 days after the&#xD;
      last dose of study drug.&#xD;
