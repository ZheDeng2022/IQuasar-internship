      All patients who satisfy the inclusion criteria for this study in each participating&#xD;
      institution will be included. Considering the number of participating centers in Korea, Latin&#xD;
      America (Mexico, Colombia), and Europe (Switzerland, Israel), the expected number of patients&#xD;
      is 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research involves only the collection and analysis of existing data, documents, and&#xD;
      records. The information will be recorded by the investigators on a CRF in a way that the&#xD;
      subjects cannot be identified directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects. Thus,&#xD;
      this study should be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of each&#xD;
      participating institute, and exemption from additional written informed consent should be&#xD;
      applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age, sex, nationality, ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ann Arbor stage, disease involved sites, number of extranodal involvement, serum LDH&#xD;
           concentration, ECOG performance status, presence of B symptoms, regional lymph node&#xD;
           involvement, International Prognostic Index, bone marrow invasion at the time of&#xD;
           pralatrexate treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dose and schedule of pralatrexate, start date, last treatment date, other treatment&#xD;
           modalities&#xD;
