  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Listeriosis is a rare, severe foodborne infection, responsible for severe invasive&#xD;
      infections. It occurs in the great majority of cases in elderly patients and / or patients&#xD;
      with comorbidities, with a deficit of innate or cellular immunity. Pregnancy is also a risk&#xD;
      factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Multicentric Observational NAtional Analysis of Listeriosis and Listeria (MONALISA) is an&#xD;
      ongoing national case-control prospective study on listeriosis implemented since 2009 to&#xD;
      study risk and prognosis factors for listeriosis. In this cohort, which enrolled 902 patients&#xD;
      on 1 August 2014, 7% of patients with neurolisteriosis are under 40 years of age and have no&#xD;
      identified risk factor. Genetic susceptibility is suspected in these patients. Genetic&#xD;
      susceptibility could also explain the inconstant development of a neurolisteriosis or fetal&#xD;
      infection, as well as the particular severity of some infections (death, foetal loss,&#xD;
      neurological sequelae).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to identify genetic susceptibility to Listeriosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Listeriosis is a rare, severe foodborne infection caused by the bacterium Listeria&#xD;
      monocytogenes (Lm), responsible for severe invasive infections. It occurs in the great&#xD;
      majority of cases in elderly patients and / or patients with comorbidities, with a deficit of&#xD;
      innate or cellular immunity. Pregnancy is also a risk factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Multicentric Observational NAtional Analysis of Listeriosis and Listeria (MONALISA) is an&#xD;
      ongoing national case-control prospective study on listeriosis implemented since 2009 to&#xD;
      study risk and prognosis factors for listeriosis. In this cohort, which enrolled 902 patients&#xD;
      on 1 August 2014, 7% of patients with neurolisteriosis are under 40 years of age and have no&#xD;
      identified risk factor. Genetic susceptibility is suspected in these patients. Genetic&#xD;
      susceptibility could also explain the inconstant development of a neurolisteriosis or fetal&#xD;
      infection, as well as the particular severity of some infections (death, foetal loss,&#xD;
      neurological sequelae).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the genetically transmitted vulnerability of Lm has not yet been studied,&#xD;
      because of the lack of accessibility to prospective cohorts (and their DNA) for this rare and&#xD;
      severe infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to identify genetic susceptibility to Listeriosis that will optimize&#xD;
      the patient care in terms of treatment and prevention.&#xD;

    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>In patients with Listeriosis, the hypothesis that the identified genetic variation is the mutation responsible for the infection will be verified :&#xD;
by verifying that it is not a listed polymorphism by sequencing genomic DNA controls&#xD;
by verifiyng that family genetic segregation is compatible with clinical segregation&#xD;
by verifying the function of the mutated protein in the patient's cell lines and / or fresh cells&#xD;
by performing complementation experiments by transfecting the wild-type allele into the patient's cells</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identification of a susceptibility factor associated with the most severe or atypical forms</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>In patients with Listeriosis, the susceptibility factor associated with the most severe or atypical forms will be characterized :&#xD;
By testing the response and production of cytokines involved in infection control.&#xD;
By identifying chromosomal regions associated with the disease by a homozygosity mapping genetic study on multiplex and / or inbred families.&#xD;
By sequencing the identified candidate genes.</description>
