  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) progressed during or&#xD;
      after a previous docetaxel-based chemotherapy, for whom cabazitaxel has been scheduled as per&#xD;
      clinical practice and label indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the &quot;TROPIC&quot; Trial, cabazitaxel, administered concomitantly with prednisone 10 mg daily,&#xD;
      showed a significant advantage vs. mitoxantrone in both Overall Survival (OS) and Progression&#xD;
      Free Survival (PFS) / radiographic PFS in patients failing docetaxel-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Similar to docetaxel, cabazitaxel has been approved in combination with daily prednisone, but&#xD;
      the benefits of adding daily corticosteroids to taxane chemotherapy remain to be proven. In&#xD;
      fact, corticosteroids have a variety of biological effects, and a number of studies in large&#xD;
      cohorts of patients show that they may have both favourable effects, mediated by adrenal&#xD;
      androgen and cytokine suppression, and detrimental effects related to their adverse events&#xD;
      associated with their long-term use as well to the potential promiscuous activation of the&#xD;
      AR. In fact, prednisone and dexamethasone can activate some AR variants that make tumors&#xD;
      sensitive to glucocorticoids even at low concentrations. It has been showed that point&#xD;
      mutations of the AR, which appear to cluster in the ligand-binding domain, are rare in&#xD;
      therapy naive patients but occur in 15- 45% of patients with castration-resistant disease and&#xD;
      can increase AR affinity for a wide range of steroids. On the other hand, insofar as safety&#xD;
      is concerned, omitting daily corticosteroids does not seem to increase toxicity (e.g.&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reactions). In fact, in the CHARTEED trial, docetaxel was safely&#xD;
      administered without daily corticosteroids. Safety data about the use of cabazitaxel without&#xD;
      daily prednisone/prednisone alone are missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CABACARE study is designed to assess the effects in terms of efficacy, safety as well as&#xD;
      quality of life of omitting daily corticosteroids in patients treated with cabazitaxel.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the CABACARE study evaluates the mutational status of the RB gene as well as&#xD;
      presence of AR-V7 variant. The AR-V7 status assessed in circulating tumor cells has a strong&#xD;
      predictive value for abiraterone/enzalutamide effectiveness, but its role in patients&#xD;
      receiving cabazitaxel requires to be defined.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m² intravenously (Day 1) every 3 weeks, plus prednisone 10 mg orally&#xD;
      given daily. Premedication must be administered according to Cabazitaxel Package Insert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m² intravenously (Day 1) every 3 weeks, without daily prednisone.&#xD;
      Premedication must be administered according to Cabazitaxel Package Insert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be treated until radiological disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      or patient refusal. Patients will be followed through subsequent therapy lines of treatments&#xD;
      until death or the study cut-off, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every effort will be made to administer the full dose regimen to maximize dose-intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose reduction and/or treatment delay and/or treatment discontinuation are planned in case of&#xD;
      severe toxicity. If toxicity occurs, dose of Cabazitaxel can be reduced to 20 mg/mq in both&#xD;
      arms. If a second dose reduction is required the patient should be withdrawn from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prednisone doses should not be delayed or modified or stopped (unless there is a&#xD;
      contraindication to continue, the decision will be let to the investigator's discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case a dose reduction is required, cabazitaxel dose cannot be re-escalated. Prophylactic&#xD;
      use of G-CSF is allowed, as per EORTC / ASCO guidelines and according to physician judgment.&#xD;
      Patients experiencing neutropenia G 3-4 have to receive G-CSF in prophylaxis in subsequent&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate whether cabazitaxel alone is non inferior in terms of radiographic PFS with&#xD;
      respect to cabazitaxel plus daily prednisone in patients with castration resistant prostate&#xD;
      cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety in the two treatment arms; Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) and pain; Objective&#xD;
      Response Rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1);&#xD;
      Biochemical response (assessed considering PSA decrease ≥50% and waterfall plot results);&#xD;
      Time to PSA Progression (TTPP); Radiographic Time to Progression (rTTP); Overall Survival&#xD;
      (OS); Association of Overall&#xD;
&#xD;
      l Survival (OS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Objective Response Rate (ORR) with AR-V7&#xD;
      and RB status in circulating tumor cells assessed at flow-cytometry; Time to Skeletal-Related&#xD;
