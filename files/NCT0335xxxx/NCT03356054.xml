    <textblock>
      Patients with CD30 positive DLBCL, primary refractory or in first relapse after R-CHOP or&#xD;
      R-CHOP-like therapy will receive brentuximab vedotin in combination with R-DHAP, followed in&#xD;
      responsive patients by high dose chemotherapy and ASCT.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary refractory or relapse diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after&#xD;
      R-CHOP have a dismal prognosis. Only 25% long term survivors are observed after salvage with&#xD;
      high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). CD30&#xD;
      expression is observed in 30% of refractory/relapse DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monotherapy with brentuximab vedotin is effective in relapse CD30 positive DLBCL. The&#xD;
      addition of brentuximab vedotin to R-DHAP might improve the prognosis of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will consist of 3 cycles of brentuximab-vedotin in combination with R-DHAP. During&#xD;
      the phase I part the recommended dose level for this combination will be established. Cycles&#xD;
      will be given every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responsive patients will be treated with BEAM followed by ASCT. Total treatment duration is&#xD;
      approximately 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently patients will be followed until 5 years after registration.&#xD;
