    <textblock>
      The motivation for this study was produced from our preliminary data, which showed that&#xD;
      during the first 96 hours of life a full-term neonate will actively reduce the overall serum&#xD;
      iron concentration of their blood and the transferrin saturation decreases rapidly from 45%&#xD;
      in cord blood to ~20% by six hours post-delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators hypothesise that this active sequestration of iron, which results in&#xD;
      hypoferremia, is done in an effort to limit susceptibility to infection, a process referred&#xD;
      to as nutritional immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, little is known about iron regulation and iron homeostasis during the first week&#xD;
      of life and even less is known about the comparisons of nutritional immunity between full&#xD;
      term, preterm and low birth weight neonates. Additionally, limited research has been&#xD;
      conducted on the impact of these processes on bacterial pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to study the neonatal nutritional immunity and its role in neonatal&#xD;
      susceptibility to infection, The investigator will conduct an observational study in&#xD;
      full-term, preterm and low birth weight vaginally-delivered neonates born at Serrekunda&#xD;
      General Hospital, The Gambia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will fully characterise and quantify nutritional immunity during the early&#xD;
      neonatal period and the investogators will assess how this impacts bacterial growth. Study&#xD;
      sensitisation will occur at the antenatal clinic, during the mother's second trimester of&#xD;
      pregnancy. Mothers will be consented and enrolled at delivery. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected once from the umbilical cord and at serial time points from the neonates over the&#xD;
      first week of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The epicentres of neonatal death worldwide are West and Central Africa, with an estimated 35&#xD;
      deaths per 1000 births. Neonatal infection is the third largest cause of death in children&#xD;
      under five worldwide and is an ongoing major global public health challenge (WHO Millennium&#xD;
      Development Goal 4). Intrauterine and neonatal infections have a high risk of causing&#xD;
      substantial long-term neurological morbidity, affecting not just the individual but the local&#xD;
      community and national productivity. Current research on neonatal sepsis in low-resource&#xD;
      settings is focused on the use of mass perinatal antibiotic therapy for both mothers and&#xD;
      babies. However, antibiotic resistance in the developing world is dramatically increasing and&#xD;
      ablation of the neonatal microbiome has been linked with long-term health consequences. Novel&#xD;
      therapeutic solutions are urgently required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional immunity is the process by which the host innate immune system limits nutrient&#xD;
      availability to invading organisms. Iron is an essential micronutrient for both microbial&#xD;
      pathogens and their mammalian hosts. Changes in iron availability and distribution have&#xD;
      significant effects on pathogen virulence and on the immune response to infection. Commonly&#xD;
      found in blood, iron and its moieties (heme) are sequestered mainly in chaperone molecules&#xD;
      (transferrin, lactoferrin, haptoglobin, hemopexin). The long-term goal of our research is to&#xD;
      develop an anti-virulence therapeutic strategy that will augment nutritional immunity in the&#xD;
      at-risk newborn, in order to improve neonatal survival, while avoiding the use of traditional&#xD;
      empirical antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the dynamic neonatal period there are significant changes in circulation, oxygenation&#xD;
      and iron homeostasis, the foetus maintains a high haematocrit to facilitate perfusion in&#xD;
      utero. Within the first week of life, the neonate's haematocrit decreases as the RBCs&#xD;
      containing foetal haemoglobin are broken down. Our preliminary data shows that during the&#xD;
      first 24 hours of life full-term neonates will actively reduce the overall serum iron&#xD;
      concentration and transferrin saturation decreases rapidly from 45% in cord blood to ~20% by&#xD;
      six hours post-delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, little is known about nutritional immunity in the neonates or about its impact on&#xD;
      bacterial pathogens. In the aims below, the investigators will investigate the hypothesis&#xD;
      that nutritional immunity may be an evolutionary mechanism designed to protect neonates from&#xD;
      infection during the first critical days of life, by limiting the pathogenicity and virulence&#xD;
      of these organisms by reducing the availability of iron. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      this protective mechanism may not be activated in preterm and low birth weight neonates,&#xD;
      putting these babies at an enhanced risk of neonatal infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Host chaperoned or unchaperoned iron, hemoglobin and heme in the blood can provide a&#xD;
      growth-limiting nutrient to bacterial pathogens depending on the specific bacterial species&#xD;
      and their iron-uptake mechanisms. Bacterial co-evolution with the host has resulted in two&#xD;
      main strategies to combat host nutritional immunity: (1) chelation of iron away from&#xD;
      chaperone proteins with siderophores, and (2) direct uptake of hemoglobin and heme moieties.&#xD;
      Previous research and preliminary experiments conducted by our group, using ex-vivo growth&#xD;
      assays in adult serum, has shown that growth of a panel of neonatal pathogenic bacteria each&#xD;
      decreases in response to decreasing transferrin saturation and increases in response to&#xD;
      increasing hemoglobin concentration. In addition, the investigators have shown that the in&#xD;
      vitro growth of standard laboratory strains of four important causes of early neonatal sepsis&#xD;
      in the developing world (Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and&#xD;
      Streptococcus agalactiae) is decreased in hypoferremic serum collected from full term&#xD;
      neonates between 6-24 hours after birth compared to serum from the umbilical cord at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to study neonatal nutritional immunity and its role in neonatal susceptibility&#xD;
      to infection, the investigators will conduct an observational study in full-term (FT),&#xD;
      preterm (PTB) and low birth weight (LBW) vaginally-delivered neonates born at Serrekunda&#xD;
      Hospital in The Gambia. The investigators will fully characterize and quantify nutritional&#xD;
      immunity during the early neonatal period (Research Question 1, Research Question 2 and&#xD;
      Research Question 3) and the investigators will assess how it impacts bacterial growth using&#xD;
      in vitro assays (Research Question 4). Mothers will be consented and enrolled at delivery.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected once from the umbilical cord and at serial time points from&#xD;
      the neonates (see sampling schema).&#xD;
