  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical observational study investigates perioperative oxygen consumption and delivery&#xD;
      in elderly patients undergoing major surgery. The primary objectives are to characterise the&#xD;
      perioperative oxygen delivery, consumption and potential markers of oxygen debt. Secondary&#xD;
      objective is to estimate the correlation between oxygen delivery/consumption and&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes to guide the design of a future trial.&#xD;

      Background Intra- and postoperative fluid therapy aims to achieve or maintain pre-specified&#xD;
      thresholds of oxygen delivery/blood flow which can be accomplished by use of fluids with or&#xD;
      without inotropic drugs. The used thresholds of oxygen delivery were suggested over 40 years&#xD;
      ago, in considerably younger patients compared to the current patients. Update of the&#xD;
      characteristics of perioperative oxygen delivery and consumption is reasonable in modern&#xD;
      clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      relative changes of oxygen consumption induced by anaesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      relative changes of oxygen consumption and delivery during surgery and postoperatively,&#xD;
      oxygen extraction ratio (measured and estimated), potential markers of oxygen debt frequency&#xD;
      of in-hospital postoperative complications, mortality (30 Days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women ≥65 years undergoing major/complex surgical procedures, when intra-operative&#xD;
      cardiovascular monitoring is justified according to clinical decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: no study related intervention, general anaesthesia and surgery according to&#xD;
      clinical routine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: no blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study 1: feasibility assessment of study protocol of intra-operative measurements (n=&#xD;
      max 10) Pilot study 2: feasibility assessment of study protocol of postoperative measurements&#xD;
      (n= max 10) Main study: 60 subjects (20+´40) Planned analysis of oxygen consumption after 20&#xD;
      monitored subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of haemodynamic monitoring 24-36 hours Duration of observation of clinical outcomes:&#xD;
      7-10 days, mortality at 30 days postop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      monitoring of oxygen consumption and delivery monitoring of postoperative clinical outcomes&#xD;
      monitoring of markers of tissue injury&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments, Procedures and Schedule of Investigational Events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are identified by the operation planning list and assessed for eligibility. The&#xD;
      study information will be given verbal during the first hospital visit. Subjects who give&#xD;
      written informed consent will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      oxygen consumption by indirect calorimetry via face mask (in awake state) and via expiratory&#xD;
      extension tube of anaesthesia machine (unconscious state) cardiac output monitoring via&#xD;
      arterial line (LiDCO) blood samples: arterial and venous blood gase samples, Troponin-T urine&#xD;
      samples: N-gal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection from medical records on postoperative complications using the POMS&#xD;
      (postoperative morbidity survey) screening survey at days 3,7 and 10. Postoperative mortality&#xD;
      at day 30.&#xD;
