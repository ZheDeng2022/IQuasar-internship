          -  Male or female subjects &gt; 22 years of age and &lt; 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment area skin fold thickness &gt; 1cm (measured by caliper).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sufficient treatment area requiring at least 2 cooling cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No weight change exceeding 5% of body weight in the preceding month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agreement to maintain his/her weight (i.e., within 5%) by not making any major changes&#xD;
             in diet or exercise routine during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has signed a written informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Excessive skin laxity in the treatment area for which reduction of subcutaneous fat&#xD;
             may, in the opinion of the investigator, result in an unacceptable aesthetic result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prominent platysmal bands at rest which may interfere with assessment of treatment&#xD;
             area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of any cause of enlargement in the treatment area other than localized&#xD;
             subcutaneous fat, such as swollen lymph nodes or ptotic submandibular glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant enlargement on the anterior neck that may prevent the proper placement of&#xD;
             the applicator e.g. enlarged thyroid glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with dermal fillers, radiofrequency or laser procedures, or chemical peels&#xD;
             in the treatment area (below the mandible) within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Botulinum toxin or other aesthetic drug injections within the treatment area in the&#xD;
             past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of facial nerve paresis or paralysis (such as Bell's palsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of a fat reduction procedure (e.g., liposuction, surgery, lipolytic agents,&#xD;
             etc.) or implant in or adjacent to the area of intended treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior neck surgery, or prior surgery in the area of intended treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current infection in and adjacent to treatment area.&#xD;

             paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of Raynaud's disease, or any known condition with a response to cold&#xD;
             exposure that limits blood flow to the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of bleeding disorder or is taking any medication that in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion may increase the subject's risk of bruising.&#xD;

             month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any dermatological conditions, such as scars in the location of the treatment area&#xD;
             that may interfere with the treatment or evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active implanted device such as a pacemaker, defibrillator, or drug delivery system.&#xD;

          -  Pregnant or intending to become pregnant in the next 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lactating or has been lactating in the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable or unwilling to comply with the study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently enrolled in a clinical study of an unapproved investigational drug or&#xD;
             device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition or laboratory value that would, in the professional opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, potentially affect the subject's response or the integrity of the data&#xD;
             or would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject.&#xD;
