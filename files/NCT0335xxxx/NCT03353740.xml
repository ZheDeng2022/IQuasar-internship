        <description>Impact of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET on clinical management in patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) was measured using Pre-PET (Q1), post-PET (Q2), and post-treatment (Q3) questionnaires sent to referring physicians recording site of recurrence and intended (Q1 to Q2 change) and implemented (Q3) therapeutic and diagnostic management.
