  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world and with the highest&#xD;
      incidence in China. Surgery is the most effective therapeutic method for primary lung cancer.&#xD;
      Accurate prediction of residual postoperative pulmonary function in patients, especially&#xD;
      those with borderline pulmonary function, is crucial for proper qualification for surgery.&#xD;
      According to the 3rd American College of Chest Physicians(ACCP) evidence-based clinical&#xD;
      practice guideline (2013), both predictive postoperative (ppo) FEV1.0% and ppoDLCO% are&#xD;
      greater than 60% predicted are required as a first standard of lobectomy for patients with&#xD;
      primary lung cancer. And, according to the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guideline, patients&#xD;
      with ppoFEV1.0% and ppoDLco% less than 40% have high a risk for surgery. Pulmonary&#xD;
      ventilation / perfusion SPECT/CT has recently become available for prediction of lung&#xD;
      function, and it can be used to forecast pulmonary function in consideration of the pulmonary&#xD;
      circulation as well as effective residual lung function. Traditionally, prediction of&#xD;
      postoperative lung function was based on planar method in anterior and posterior projections&#xD;
      of lung scintigraphy. However, SPECT/CT enables measurement of ventilation / perfusion uptake&#xD;
      in each lobe of the lungs in a three dimensional way, which may avoid underestimating&#xD;
      ppoFEV1.0% and provide confidence in suggesting lobectomy or pneumonectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This experiment is intended to explore the use of Q.lung, a volume-based software to&#xD;
      semi-quantitatively calculate pulmonary ventilation/perfusion functional uptake and volume by&#xD;
      SPECT/CT. We hope it can get a more accurate prediction of postoperative residual pulmonary&#xD;
      function to provide better management for clinical surgery.&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. Inclusion criteria: age 30-80 years old; newly diagnosis of primary lung cancer with&#xD;
           radiological or pathological evidence; SPECT/CT scan was performed before surgery;&#xD;
           written and informed consent with signature before the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Exclusion criteria: with other tumor in addition to primary lung caner; receive surgery&#xD;
           prior to SPECT/CT scan; failed to complete preoperative and postoperative pulmonary&#xD;
           function tests; failed to perform scans; pregnancy, lactation, and impaired renal or&#xD;
           liver function; poorly controlled diabetes; poor compliance; contrary to the standard&#xD;
           operating procedures; not suitable for clinical trials (for example with mental&#xD;
           illness);&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Examination time&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preoperative lung function test was performed within a month prior to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preoperative pulmonary ventilation/perfusion SPECT/CT were performed within a month&#xD;
           prior to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Postoperative pulmonary function test as well as follow-up were performed within three&#xD;
           months after surgery 2. Pulmonary function test including but not limited to: forced&#xD;
           expiratory volume in 1s(FEV1), diffusing capacity carbon monoxide(DLCO), forced vital&#xD;
           capacity(FVC), maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), peak expiratory flow(PEFR), vital&#xD;
           capacity(VC), total lung capacity(TLC) 3. Pulmonary ventilation/perfusion SPECT/CT&#xD;
           imaging: acquisition protocol according to EANM guidelines for ventilation/perfusion&#xD;
           scintigraphy. Part 1. Using Technegas for ventilation imaging and 99mTc-MAA for&#xD;
           perfusion imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Image analysis：&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ventilation / perfusion SPECT/CT data were registered, processed and reconstructed in GE&#xD;
           Xeleris Workstation, quantitative measurements were using Q.lung software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Results including ventilation / perfusion uptake and volume (in counts and mL and&#xD;
           respective percentage) of each pulmonary lobar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Predicted postoperative FEV1 (as well as other pulmonary function values) were&#xD;
           calculated according to the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
           FEV1 fore-v = FEV1 pre × (1- Volume%); FEV1 fore-cv = FEV1 pre × (1- Counts%v); FEV1&#xD;
           fore-cp = FEV1 pre × (1- Counts%p).&#xD;
&#xD;
           *fore-v represents predicted postoperative value using volume; fore-cv represents&#xD;
           predicted postoperative value using ventilation uptake; fore-cp represents predicted&#xD;
           postoperative value using perfusion uptake; pre represents preoperative pulmonary test&#xD;
           value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A graphical method of the Bland-Altman plot was used to compare FEV1 (as well as other&#xD;
           pulmonary function values) obtained from predictions and post-operative measurements&#xD;
           (with certain systematic and random errors). Intervals of agreement were drawn as the&#xD;
           mean difference between predicted and measured values plus and minus 1.96 times the&#xD;
           standard deviation of the differences. Strength of linear relationship between predicted&#xD;
           and measured FEV1 values was quantified by the Pearson correlation coefficients with&#xD;
           significance based on t-statistics. P &lt; 0.05 is statistically significant.&#xD;
