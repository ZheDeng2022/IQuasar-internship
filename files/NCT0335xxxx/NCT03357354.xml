  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Action research has been developed in this direction in order to use a tool to identify food&#xD;
      disorder behavior among obese youths in their neighborhoods and social centers in vulnerable&#xD;
      neighborhoods of Marseille, with the aim of a multi-professional therapeutic management&#xD;
      (psychosocial support, theater) and a specialized orientation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This program consists of the participation of each patient recruited in collective workshops.&#xD;
      A total of 60 patients considered. Our hypothesis lies in the fact that for young people to&#xD;
      participate in an adapted device, taking into account the global needs of young people and&#xD;
      their entourage, would limit the deleterious effects of obesity and promote the young&#xD;
      person's autonomy and allow him to be a actor in the request for care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project's objective is to provide support in the form of workshops with patients&#xD;
      identified by the Marseille Hospitals Public Assistance Health Center as obese children and&#xD;
      adolescents, in a precarious situation; to identify the presence of binge eating disorders&#xD;
      and evaluate the impact of participation in these workshops on subsequent management by&#xD;
      highly specialized professionals in food disorder behavior.&#xD;

      The mobile team (EM) of the Marseille Hospitals Public Assistance Health Center has the&#xD;
      mission to inform, screen, support and guide the access to care of people in targeted&#xD;
      neighborhoods, said to be vulnerable, by the city's policy of Marseille. The health space, a&#xD;
      place of welcome and care, is located at a distance from any hospital structure within the&#xD;
      most vulnerable neighborhoods of the city.&#xD;
