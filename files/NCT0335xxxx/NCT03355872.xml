        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female participants, between 18 and 65 years of age, who have a diagnosis of&#xD;
             moderately to severely active RA for at least 6 months as defined by at least 6&#xD;
             swollen joints (66 joint count) and at least 6 tender joints (68 joint count) at&#xD;
             Screening and Baseline (Day 1), and DAS28-CRP&gt;3.2 at Screening. If a joint has both&#xD;
             swollen and tender symptoms, then the joint will be included in both the swollen&#xD;
             joints and tender joint categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current treatment for RA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Must be currently receiving and tolerating oral or parenteral MTX therapy at a&#xD;
                  dose of 10 25 mg per week for at least 12 weeks prior to Day 1. The dose should&#xD;
                  be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1. Patients must have had an&#xD;
                  inadequate response to small molecule or biologic DMARD therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients must be willing to receive oral folic acid (at least 5 mg/week or as per&#xD;
                  local practice) or equivalent during the entire study (mandatory co-medication&#xD;
                  for MTX treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Inadequate response to biologic DMARDs: anakinra and etanercept must be withdrawn&#xD;
                  at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1; tocilizumab must be withdrawn at least 12 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to Day 1; other agents must be withdrawn at least 12 weeks or 5 half-lives&#xD;
                  (whichever is longer) prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Inadequate response to small molecule DMARDs (other than MTX): Leflunomide must&#xD;
                  be withdrawn at least 8 weeks prior to Day 1 or a minimum of 2 weeks prior to Day&#xD;
                  1 if after 11 days of standard cholestyramine washout. Lower than 400 mg/day of&#xD;
                  oral hydroxychloroquine or lower than 250 mg/day of oral chloroquine is allowed,&#xD;
                  but the dose should be stable for at least 12 weeks prior to Day 1 until Week 24&#xD;
                  (if hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine have been discontinued, they must have been&#xD;
                  withdrawn at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1). Other DMARDs must be withdrawn at&#xD;
                  least 4 weeks prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Tripterygium wilfordii: ongoing therapy is allowed, but the dose should be stable&#xD;
                  for at least 12 weeks prior to Day 1 until Week 24; if discontinued, T.wilfordii&#xD;
                  treatment must have been withdrawn at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. If receiving current treatment with oral corticosteroids, the dose must not&#xD;
                  exceed 10 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent. During the 4 weeks prior to Baseline&#xD;

                  corticosteroids must have been withdrawn at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  exception of IV administration of 100 mg methylprednisolone 30 minutes prior to&#xD;
                  each infusion as this is part of the trial procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Any concomitant non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be stable for&#xD;
                  at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1; if discontinued, NSAIDs must have been withdrawn&#xD;
                  at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Males or females of child-bearing potential must agree to use an acceptable method of&#xD;
             contraception for 12 months following completion or discontinuation from the trial&#xD;
