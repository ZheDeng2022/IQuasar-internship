  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are a source of much morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Rates of PPCs exceed 30% in patients with multiple risk factors. Several studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated reduced PPCs in patients who underwent preoperative inspiratory muscle training.&#xD;
      These studies largely focused on cardiothoracic surgery and required the use of respiratory&#xD;
      therapists. The investigators hypothesize that preoperative, self-administered respiratory&#xD;
      therapy would reduce PPCs in patients with risk factors for PPCs undergoing any&#xD;
      non-cardiothoracic surgery. This study is a randomized, controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      preoperative use of an incentive spirometry device with usual care in patients undergoing&#xD;
      non-emergent, non-cardiothoracic surgical procedures under general anesthesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary complications account for &gt;50% of all adverse postoperative events&#xD;
      and are more costly and carry greater comorbidity than cardiac complications. Much research&#xD;
      has been performed to identify potential risk reduction strategies for PPCs. Until recently&#xD;
      all of these focused on intraoperative and postoperative interventions, including&#xD;
      lung-protective mechanical ventilation, lung expansion techniques, and use of regional&#xD;
      anesthesia and analgesia. In the last few years several studies have investigated the&#xD;
      potential role of preoperative interventions to improve respiratory status. These studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated benefit from preoperative inspiratory muscle training (IMT). A recent&#xD;
      systematic review found that any preoperative intervention, such as education, IMT, exercise&#xD;
      training or relaxation reduced PPC rates. However, these studies have focused on&#xD;
      cardiothoracic and abdominal surgery, and almost all have utilized respiratory&#xD;
      therapist-directed interventions. Likely due to the additional costs and difficulty of&#xD;
      arranging respiratory therapy on an outpatient basis, this promising new risk mitigation&#xD;
      strategy has yet to be adopted on a large scale. Incentive spirometry devices offer a&#xD;
      potentially easier and less costly preoperative respiratory intervention. Incentive&#xD;
      spirometers are a drug-free, easy to use, hand-held device that promotes deep breathing and&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength by providing visual feedback during sustained inhalation. It&#xD;
      opens weak or collapsed airways to mobilize and assist mucociliary clearance to the upper&#xD;
      airways where it can be coughed out. This study evaluates the hypothesis that providing&#xD;
      preoperative, patient self-directed respiratory therapy with use of an incentive spirometry&#xD;
      device will reduce the incidence of PPCs in patients with increased pulmonary risk undergoing&#xD;
      any major, non-cardiothoracic surgery with general anesthesia.&#xD;
