  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study that will evaluate the feasibility of collecting increasing amounts of&#xD;
      clinical study data from subjects through sensor and web/app based methods and integrating it&#xD;
      with data from their EHR to facilitate more efficient and meaningful research with acceptable&#xD;
      quality. Approximately 100 subjects with asthma and 100 subjects with chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD) will be enrolled in this prospective study. The subjects will be&#xD;
      identified through integrated EHR records following which eligible subjects will receive&#xD;
      study devices and training on proper use of the devices at Baseline visit. Data will be&#xD;
      collected remotely from subject reports, devices and sensors over six months.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1) and Weeks 5, 9, 13, 17, 21 and 25</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is an important measure of pulmonary function and is the maximum amount of air that can be forced out in one second after taking a deep breath. FEV1 was measured using spirometry. Participants were given a hand-held spirometer with instructions on its proper use. Baseline (Week 1) measurement was taken in clinic and the participants were instructed to perform home spirometry on a weekly basis for the remainder of the study. The spirometry use was linked to the Propeller Health application on the iPad, which provided visual cues for the spirometry and sent the data to the central database after completion of the session. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at specified time point minus Baseline value. Change from Baseline in FEV1 at 4-weekly intervals is presented.</description>

    <measure>Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Active Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 and 26</time_frame>
    <description>The PROactive tool is used to investigate dimensions of physical activity (symptoms, distress, difficulties, amount etc.) that are judged as being essential by participants living with COPD. The clinic visit version of PRO was used, and was offered via the participant's electronic PRO application every 28 days. This version of PRO includes 14 items, measuring a physical activity 'Total Score' with 2 domains ('amount' and 'difficulty'). The 'amount' domain is covered by 2 items (amount of walking outside and chores outside) and by 2 activity monitor outputs (vector magnitude units per minute [VMU/min] and steps per day). The 'difficulty' domain is covered by 10 items. Each domain score is based on the simple addition of items (scale ranging from 0 to 15 for amount domain and 0 to 40 for difficulty domain), and then scaled from 0 to 100. 'Total Score' is calculated as the sum of the two domains (amount and difficulty) divided by two, thus scored from 0 (worse) to 100 (much better).</description>

    <measure>Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms (E-RS) in COPD Total Score-COPD Cohort Only</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21 and 25</time_frame>
    <description>The E-RS: COPD scale is a derivative instrument used to measure the effect of treatment on the severity of respiratory symptoms in stable COPD. The E-RS utilizes the 11 respiratory symptom items contained in the 14-item Exacerbations of Chronic pulmonary disease Tool (EXACT). For the COPD cohort specifically, the daily EXACT was offered each evening. The domains included: respiratory symptoms (RS)-breathlessness (RS-BRL comprised of 5 items, score range [0-17]), RS-cough and sputum (RS-CSP comprised of 3 items, score range [0-11]), and RS-chest symptoms (RS-CSY comprised of 3 items, score range [0-12]). The total score was derived by summing the 11-item scores and ranged between 0-40 with higher values indicating severe respiratory symptoms. Scores for the week were summarized for each COPD participant where they completed the questionnaire on three or more days during the study week</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1)</title>
        <description>FEV1 is an important measure of pulmonary function and is the maximum amount of air that can be forced out in one second after taking a deep breath. FEV1 was measured using spirometry. Participants were given a hand-held spirometer with instructions on its proper use. Baseline (Week 1) measurement was taken in clinic and the participants were instructed to perform home spirometry on a weekly basis for the remainder of the study. The spirometry use was linked to the Propeller Health application on the iPad, which provided visual cues for the spirometry and sent the data to the central database after completion of the session. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at specified time point minus Baseline value. Change from Baseline in FEV1 at 4-weekly intervals is presented.</description>

        <title>Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Active Total Score</title>
        <description>The PROactive tool is used to investigate dimensions of physical activity (symptoms, distress, difficulties, amount etc.) that are judged as being essential by participants living with COPD. The clinic visit version of PRO was used, and was offered via the participant's electronic PRO application every 28 days. This version of PRO includes 14 items, measuring a physical activity 'Total Score' with 2 domains ('amount' and 'difficulty'). The 'amount' domain is covered by 2 items (amount of walking outside and chores outside) and by 2 activity monitor outputs (vector magnitude units per minute [VMU/min] and steps per day). The 'difficulty' domain is covered by 10 items. Each domain score is based on the simple addition of items (scale ranging from 0 to 15 for amount domain and 0 to 40 for difficulty domain), and then scaled from 0 to 100. 'Total Score' is calculated as the sum of the two domains (amount and difficulty) divided by two, thus scored from 0 (worse) to 100 (much better).</description>

Participants attended two visits at the Baseline (Visit 1) and approximately six months later (Visit 2). At Visit 2, the participants returned the study devices and attended exit interview to provide relevant feedback.</description>

          <title>PROactive Amount Domain Score</title>
          <description>The PROactive tool is used to investigate dimensions of physical activity (symptoms, distress, difficulties, amount etc.) that are judged as being essential by participants living with COPD. The clinic visit version of the PRO was used in this study, and was offered via the participant's electronic PRO application every 28 days. This version of the PRO includes 14 items, measuring a physical activity 'Total Score' with 2 domains (amount and difficulty). The amount domain is covered by 2 items (amount of walking outside and chores outside) and by 2 activity monitor outputs (vector magnitude units per minute [VMU/min] and steps per day). Amount domain score is based on the simple addition of items (scale ranging from 0 to 15) and then scaled from 0 to 100.</description>

        <title>PROactive Difficulty Domain Score</title>
        <description>The PROactive tool is used to investigate dimensions of physical activity (symptoms, distress, difficulties, amount etc.) that are judged as being essential by participants living with COPD. The clinic visit version of the PRO was used in this study, and was offered via the participant's electronic PRO application every 28 days. This version of the PRO includes 14 items, measuring a physical activity 'Total Score' with 2 domains ('amount' and 'difficulty'). The 'difficulty' domain is covered by 10 items. The difficulty domain score is based on the simple addition of items (0 to 40), which is then scaled from 0 (worse) to 100 (much better).</description>

        <title>Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms (E-RS) in COPD Total Score-COPD Cohort Only</title>
        <description>The E-RS: COPD scale is a derivative instrument used to measure the effect of treatment on the severity of respiratory symptoms in stable COPD. The E-RS utilizes the 11 respiratory symptom items contained in the 14-item Exacerbations of Chronic pulmonary disease Tool (EXACT). For the COPD cohort specifically, the daily EXACT was offered each evening. The domains included: respiratory symptoms (RS)-breathlessness (RS-BRL comprised of 5 items, score range [0-17]), RS-cough and sputum (RS-CSP comprised of 3 items, score range [0-11]), and RS-chest symptoms (RS-CSY comprised of 3 items, score range [0-12]). The total score was derived by summing the 11-item scores and ranged between 0-40 with higher values indicating severe respiratory symptoms. Scores for the week were summarized for each COPD participant where they completed the questionnaire on three or more days during the study week</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in COPD Assessment Test (CAT) Score-COPD Cohort Only</title>
        <description>The CAT is an 8 item questionnaire (cough, sputum, chest tightness, breathlessness, going up hills/stairs, activity limitation at home, confidence leaving the home, and sleep and energy) that measures health status of participants with COPD. Participants completed each question by rating their experience on a 6 point scale ranging from 0 (maximum impairment) to 5 (no impairment). Total score was calculated by summing the non-missing scores on the eight items and ranged from 0-40. Higher scores indicated greater disease impact. Week 1 was considered as Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at the specified time point minus Baseline value.</description>
