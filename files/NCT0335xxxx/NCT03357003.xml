  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tramadol is a grade II analgesics as World Health Organization definition. It can both be an&#xD;
      agonist on mu receptors, which provides it a low opioid action, and also be a&#xD;
      Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, which act on neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tramadol is metabolized by P450 2D6 cytochrome (CYP2D6) in O-desmethyltramadol (O-dt) which&#xD;
      is the most active form on the pharmacologic side (analgesic effect 2 to 4 times more&#xD;
      powerful than tramadol itself).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In caucasian population, 5 to 10% of patients are genetically qualified as &quot;poor metabolizer&#xD;
      phenotype&quot;; this status is correlated to a lower analgesic efficiency compared to &quot;rapid&#xD;
      metabolizer&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter study, CYTRAM, is under publication and allowed measurement of blood ratio&#xD;
      O-dT/tramadol as a way to know the phenotype of CYP2D6 to detect &quot;poor metabolizer phenotype&quot;&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, blood ratio O-dT/tramadol threshold under 0.1 detects &quot; poor metabolizer phenotype &quot;&#xD;
      status for postoperative patients treated by tramadol, with a good sensibility (87,5%) and&#xD;
      specificity (83.8%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Which impacts for current practice? The next step is to know if this blood ratio is linked to&#xD;
      an analgesic efficiency and a good tolerance for tramadol. A &quot;poor metabolizer phenotype&quot;&#xD;
      patient would have no benefit of tramadol posology increasing. Therefore, phenotype&#xD;
      detection, thank to blood ratio, could allow to switch quickly tramadol to another analgesic&#xD;
      treatment for &quot;poor metabolizer phenotype&quot; patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to forge a link between O-dT/tramadol ratio and analgesic&#xD;
      efficiency. Secondary objectives investigate side effects and frequency related to&#xD;
      O-dT/tramadol ratio and pain relief, and also impact of CYP2D6 - inhibitor treatments on the&#xD;
      blood ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is a correlation between this blood ratio and treatment efficiency and tolerance,&#xD;
      O-dT/tramadol ratio's detection will allow a better adaptation for some treatments&#xD;
      metabolized by CYP2D6. Therefore, this evolution will contribute to health quality and health&#xD;
      safety improvement.&#xD;
