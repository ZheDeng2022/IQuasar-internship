  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb amputees suffer complete lack of sensory feedback of current available prostheses,&#xD;
      which excludes the central nervous system from the correct sensory-motor integration. It&#xD;
      causes serious problems as: falls due to unexpected perturbations, asymmetric walking, low&#xD;
      mobility, higher power consumption, feeling the prosthesis as a foreign body, high cognitive&#xD;
      burden, and phantom limb pain occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will provide amputees with a prosthesis restoring sensory feedback and will&#xD;
      assess its benefits on the users.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical investigation described here aims at evaluating the benefit of a lower limb&#xD;
      prosthesis providing sensory feedback (bidirectional prosthesis), in selected transfemoral&#xD;
      amputees. The device is constituted by i) Rheo Knee XC, Pro Flex foot and customized&#xD;
      socket/liner structure from OSSUR. Rheo Knee embedded already an encoder coupled with a&#xD;
      Bluetooth unit, which is used to make communication with devices external to the knee itself;&#xD;
      ii) nerve stimulating system constituted by implantable intraneural electrodes from IMTEK,&#xD;
      iii) an external neurostimulator from AXONIC, and iv) sensorized sole from SensArs&#xD;
      Neuroprosthetics to apply under the prosthetic foot and driving the stimulating system. The&#xD;
      readout of the sensorized insole are transmitted via Bluetooth, together with the encoder&#xD;
      readout, to an external controller, which transduces it in parameters of stimulation. These&#xD;
      parameters are sent to the stimulator, which injects current into the intraneural electrodes.&#xD;
      As final result, the subject perceives sensory feedback from the prosthesis when using it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators call SENSY the sensory feedback restoration system. The subjects will use the&#xD;
      prosthesis with and without sensory feedback to execute walking tasks. The average change of&#xD;
      kinematics (including falls), metabolic cost, embodiment, and cognitive burden (EEG) when&#xD;
      intraneural stimulation is provided will be compared to the case in which there is no sensory&#xD;
      feedback. Standard clinical tests (as PEQ and CB&amp;MS) will be executed with and without&#xD;
      sensory feedback. Also, when the subjects will report attacks of phantom pain, they will&#xD;
      undergo a 10-minutes-stimulation session. Only stimulation without prosthesis is used in this&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, imaging of the cortical activity will be executed through functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI). This procedure will be only observational since no prosthesis or&#xD;
      sensory feedback will be used by the subjects.&#xD;
