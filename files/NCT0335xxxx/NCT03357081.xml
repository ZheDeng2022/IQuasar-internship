  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic and non-traumatic soft tissue hematomas are frequently encountered in the acute&#xD;
      care setting. The incidence of these hematomas appears to be on the rise secondary to the&#xD;
      increased use of anticoagulants among older patients for a variety of medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of soft tissue hematomas depends on the accurate diagnosis of any ongoing&#xD;
      bleeding as well as of identification of the injured vessel type. While the majority of cases&#xD;
      can be managed conservatively, expanding hematomas leading to hemodynamic instability or&#xD;
      ongoing blood loss might require embolization or surgical intervention. The mainstay&#xD;
      diagnostic imaging modality is multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) with intravenous&#xD;
      contrast that allows accurate assessment of hematoma size, location as well as evaluation for&#xD;
      active extravasation. However, many patients cannot undergo CT imaging due to underlying&#xD;
      kidney disease, allergy to contrast, or due to concerns for radiation exposure, especially in&#xD;
      young age. Currently there are no alternative tests for these patients with a similarly high&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to establish an imaging protocol and investigate the utility of&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in the diagnostic work-up of soft tissue hematoma as an&#xD;
      ionizing radiation-free alternative to computed tomography (CT) that can be used independent&#xD;
      from the kidney function of the patient.&#xD;
