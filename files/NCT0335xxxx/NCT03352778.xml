  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irradiation of the parotid gland with subsequent long-term xerostomia is a well-recognized&#xD;
      complication after radiotherapy for head and neck (HAN) cancers. A number of studies have&#xD;
      shown that IMRT could minimize the radiation dose to the parotid glands and hence the risk of&#xD;
      developing xerostomia. The benefit of IMRT has also been demonstrated in prior dosimetric and&#xD;
      non-randomized studies in NPC patients. In 2007, the investigators have published the&#xD;
      prospective randomized study of IMRT versus 2DRT in early stage NPC patients. In the study,&#xD;
      IMRT had lower incidence of observer-rated severe xerostomia, higher parotid and whole saliva&#xD;
      flow rate, than patients in 2DRT arm at 1 year after treatment. However, there was no&#xD;
      significant difference in patient-reported outcome, i.e. subjective xerostomia scoring,&#xD;
      between the 2 arms. The underlying reason for the incoherent findings in terms of objective&#xD;
      and subjective xerostomia outcome remains uncertain. One of the possible explanations for&#xD;
      this observation could be the better parotidsparing with IMRT alone may not entirely&#xD;
      sufficient to maintain oral cavity lubrication while the other mucin-secretory salivary gland&#xD;
      protection is also essential. Another possible explanation for the insignificant improvement&#xD;
      in patient-reported outcome with IMRT is the short follow-up time. Gradual recovery or&#xD;
      improvement in various quality of life parameters was not uncommonly seen several years after&#xD;
      definitive radiotherapy for HAN cancer patients. There is much interest in studying the long&#xD;
      term clinical outcome, especially the treatment-related complications, for the patients who&#xD;
      had randomized and treated in the prior presented prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the long term results, in particular the xerostomia rating will be assessed&#xD;
      and compared in NPC patients who had participated in the prior reported prospective&#xD;
      randomized study of IMRT vs 2DRT.&#xD;
