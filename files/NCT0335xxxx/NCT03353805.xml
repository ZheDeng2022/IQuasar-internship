    <textblock>
      The terrorist attack on the ram truck, which occurred on 14 July 2016 on the Promenade des&#xD;
      Anglais in Nice, involved a significant number of casualties in the civilian population: 86&#xD;
      dead including 10 children and adolescents, and 434 wounded. The attack harmed families&#xD;
      gathered for a festive event, the national holiday fireworks, and affected both adults and&#xD;
      children of all ages. The people directly involved in the attack number in the thousands:&#xD;
      wounded, threatened with death, bereaved, direct witnesses, workers - including firefighters&#xD;
      and health personnel (in situations of prolonged extreme tension or insecurity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the attacks in Ile-de-France in January and November 2015, Public Health France&#xD;
      conducted in 2015 and 2016 two large-scale studies to estimate the psycho-traumatic impact&#xD;
      for those involved in the attack, to know the use of care devices to provide useful&#xD;
      information, and ultimately provide information to improve the management devices in place.&#xD;
      IMPACTS carried out following the attacks of January, ESPA 13 November carried out following&#xD;
      the attacks of 13 November 2015, relate to two main types of population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-responders (civilian population) present on or near scenes of crime or their&#xD;
           relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persons intervened to secure the premises or provide assistance, or provide&#xD;
           psychological support the same day or within 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPACTS was conducted face-to-face with investigators and concerned 232 participants, 45&#xD;
      people of the medico-psychological relief (Samu, Cump, Hôtel Dieu) between 6 and 10 months&#xD;
      after the events. A second wave of interviews took place from 16 to 20 months after the&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESPA 13th November took place via a web-based questionnaire and 800 participants took part,&#xD;
      including 67 CUMPs, 121 hospital staff and 26 people from Samu between 9 and 12 months after&#xD;
      the events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the expertise of Public Health France and the model developed for the ESPA study on&#xD;
      November 13th, the Public Health Department of the University Hospital of Nice wished to&#xD;
      carry out a specific study among the health professionals of the University Hospital of Nice&#xD;
      and the Hospitals pediatrics of Nice CHU-Lenval, as well as students of the Faculty of&#xD;
      Medicine of Nice Sophia-Antipolis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many professionals of all categories were directly impacted: either at the scene of the&#xD;
      attack as a civilian population or as professionals, or in the care services that received&#xD;
      the victims and families (including services of the Pasteur2 hospital, Lenval Hospital on the&#xD;
      Promenade des Anglais).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population of medical students is also included in the study, and external students in&#xD;
      particular have made a significant contribution to the Institut Médico-Légal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This involvement could be done directly (presence as hospital staff at the scene of the&#xD;
      attack, care of the victims or their relatives, in the emergency and care services), but also&#xD;
      indirect (close and knowledge affected by the attack, specific repercussions in the local&#xD;
      context, forced changes in the organization of work). It is therefore all hospital&#xD;
      professionals, medical students (external, internal) and paramedical students who will be&#xD;
      involved in the study.&#xD;
