      This trial will evaluate the activity of dasatinib in combination with everolimus for&#xD;
      children with gliomas harboring PDGFR alterations, including newly diagnosed high-grade&#xD;
      glioma (HGG) or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) after radiation (stratum A); and&#xD;
      recurrent/progressive glioma (grade II-IV, including DIPG) (stratum B).&#xD;

    <description>The overall response assessment will take into account response in both target and non-target lesions, as well as the appearance of new lesions. Partial Response (PR) will be defined as ≥50% decrease in size of tumor in comparison to baseline measurements. Complete Response (CR) will be defined as The disappearance of all abnormal signal. This includes return to normal size of the brainstem for brainstem lesions.</description>
