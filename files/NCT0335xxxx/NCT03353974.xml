  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is often characterized by the presence of balance and cognitive&#xD;
      impairments. Cognitive functions play a key role in balance control. Simultaneously&#xD;
      performing cognitive tasks decreases walking and balance ability (Dual-Task cost).&#xD;
      Rehabilitative treatment of patients with MS does not have to consider separately the motor&#xD;
      and cognitive aspects. Video-Game Therapy (VGT) is a novel tool that allows a multimodal&#xD;
      training approach. VGT typically provides augmented feedback during training that can&#xD;
      contribute to learning motor skills. The main objective of this exploratory study will be to&#xD;
      test the effects of a commercially available VGT on balance and cognitive function in&#xD;
      ambulatory MS patients compared to a standardized balance platform training (BPT). Secondary,&#xD;
      we will explore the effects of VGT and BPT on other domains that are usually impaired in MS&#xD;
      population and that can be improved by motor rehabilitation, such as psychological&#xD;
      well-being, fatigue and Quality of Life.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects belonging to the experimental group will receive a Video Game Therapy (VGT) protocol using the Xbox console. They will receive 12 sessions of treatment within 4 weeks (3 sessions per week); each session will last 1 hour. To manage possible absence lasting one or more treatment sessions, a potential window of 5 weeks will be set to ensure the achievement of all 12 sessions. Will be required to concentrate in games whose major purposes are increasing balance, selective attention and attention shifting. During sessions the patient will be carefully controlled by a researcher who will prevent the risk of falling</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects belonging to the control group will receive the same amount of therapy (12 sessions) using a balance platform (Biodex Medical Systems, Inc., Shirley, NY). Balance/rebalancing, postural stability and weight-shifting exercises ill be administered with and without visual feedback. During the first session, the tasks will be performed at an &quot;entry level,&quot; and the exercise progression will be adjusted over time according to the patients' functional level (intermediate and difficult level). Balance platform therapy offered visual feedback and knowledge of performance (augmented feedback). The physiotherapist, as during VGT, provided additional external feedback.</description>
