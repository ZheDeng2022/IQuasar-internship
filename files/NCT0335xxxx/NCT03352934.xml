      The purpose of the AveNEC trial is to investigate the clinical activity and safety of&#xD;
      avelumab in patients with NEC G3 (WHO 2010), including &quot;NET G3&quot; who are progressive after&#xD;
      first line chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      According to the WHO classification of 2010, Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) are divided into&#xD;
      well to moderately differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET), which are graded depending on&#xD;
      their proliferation status into NET G1 (Ki67 index &lt; 2%) and NET G2 (Ki67 2-20%), and into&#xD;
      the poorly differentiated high grade neuroendocrine Carcinomas (NEC G3, ki67 &gt; 20%), which -&#xD;
      depending on their morphology - are subdivided into small cell as well as large cell NECs.&#xD;
      The vast majority (60-90%) of patients with high grade NEC are metastasized at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis with distant metastases present in approximately two third of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G3 neuroendocrine neoplasia according to the WHO classification of 2010 are not a homogenous&#xD;
      entity. Based on clinical and morphological criteria a differentiated subgroup with a Ki67 in&#xD;
      the lower proliferative range (usually between 20-55%) which is unofficially termed &quot;NET G3&quot;,&#xD;
      can be subdivided from the more aggressive and undifferentiated &quot;classical&quot; NEC G3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prognosis of patients with metastatic NEC G3 is poor, and median overall survival has&#xD;
      been reported to be 5 months with a 2-year survival rate of 11 % in the SEER data base for&#xD;
      gastrointestinal NEC. In two large series of GEP-NEC, median survival was 12-19 months for&#xD;
      patients with best available therapy (mainly platinum based chemotherapy) and as short as 1&#xD;
      month for those receiving only best supportive therapy. In contrast to the &quot;classical&quot; NEC G3&#xD;
      with a poorly differentiated morphology and a Ki 67 &gt; 55%, NET G3 typically do not respond as&#xD;
      well to a platinum based chemotherapy but a have a somewhat better prognosis with a 4-months&#xD;
      longer median survival as compared to classical NEC G3. Therefore, according to current&#xD;
      guidelines other treatment options like temozolomide based chemotherapy may be considered as&#xD;
      a first line therapy in patients with differentiated &quot;NET G3&quot; .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a strong and unmet medical need for a novel and effective second line treatment&#xD;
      option for these highly aggressive and rapidly progressing tumors. Considering the lack of&#xD;
      any other established therapeutic option and the very limited efficacy of alternative second&#xD;
      or third line chemotherapy in patients with NEC G3 (WHO 2010) who are progressive after a&#xD;
      first-line chemotherapy, the availability of a novel therapeutic option with a significant&#xD;
      clinical benefit (SD; PR; CR) in at least 30 % of the patients and with tolerable side&#xD;
      effects would represent an important and clinical highly relevant break through in the&#xD;
      treatment of these aggressive tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a strong rationale for investigating PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in NEC G3 (WHO 2010). High&#xD;
      grade NEC as well as LCNEC of the lung show a high mutational load, what is associated with a&#xD;
      strong immunogenicity and a better response to an anti-PDL1/PD1 immunotherapy, and increased&#xD;
      PDL1 expression has been demonstrated in high grade NEC. In intermediate NET the degree of&#xD;
      T-cell tumor infiltration was associated with recurrence and survival and in a study with 80&#xD;
      patients with bronchopulmonary NEN including high grade NEC the expression of PD-L1 and PD-1&#xD;
      was associated with a worse prognosis. Evidence from phase 2 to 3 trials shows&#xD;
      antiproliferative efficacy of an anti-PDL1/PD1 immunotherapy in high grade NECs. Furthermore,&#xD;
      Merkel cell carcinomas, which are classified as high grade neuroendocrine tumors, are&#xD;
      sucessfully treated with Avelumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avelumab is a fully human antibody that binds PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1&#xD;
      and PD-1. This removes the suppressive effect of PD-L1 on anti-tumor CD8+ T cells, resulting&#xD;
      in restoration of cytotoxic T cell response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the important role of PD-L1 in the suppression of T-cell responses, and the mode of&#xD;
      action of avelumab which blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptors, avelumab is&#xD;
      being developed as a potential therapy for subjects with various tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is assumed that at least 20-30 % of patients with progressive disease after at least one&#xD;
      first line chemotherapy will show a significant and clinically highly relevant benefit which&#xD;
      is defined as an objective tumor response with complete remission (CR), partial remission&#xD;
      (PR) or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST1.1.&#xD;
