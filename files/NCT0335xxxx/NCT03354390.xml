      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene transfer is a new cancer therapy takes white blood cells from a person and grows them in&#xD;
      a lab. The cells are changed with a virus to attack tumor cells, then returned to the person.&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if this therapy fights kidney cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if gene transfer is safe and causes tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People at least 18 years old with certain kidney cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with blood and urine tests. They may have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart, lung, and eye tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lab tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor samples taken&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed by a needle in an arm. It will go&#xD;
      through a machine that removes white blood cells. Plasma and red cells will be returned&#xD;
      through a needle in the participant s other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants cells will be grown in the lab and genetically changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the hospital 2-3 weeks. There they will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Get 2 chemotherapy drugs by catheter (thin plastic tube) inserted into a vein in the&#xD;
           chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Get the changed cells via catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Get a drug to increase white blood cell count and one to make the cells active.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recover for about a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have lab and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After leaving the hospital, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take an antibiotic for several months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have one- or two-day clinic visits every few weeks for 2 years, and then as determined&#xD;
           by their doctor. These will include blood and lab tests, imaging studies, and physical&#xD;
           exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up checks for up to 15 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an incurable condition. Current therapy for this&#xD;
      disease consists of the serial administration of agents such as VEGF, mTOR inhibitors and&#xD;
      immunotherapy (high-dose (HD) IL-2 or immune-checkpoint inhibitors). Long-term survival can&#xD;
      be achieved with high-doses IL-2 or immune-checkpoint inhibitors. However, of those patients&#xD;
      treated with immunotherapy, three quarters will not respond at all and only 5-8% will achieve&#xD;
      a complete and durable response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is also capable of inducing prolonged&#xD;
      disease regression in patients with metastatic clear cell RCC (ccRCC). In vitro studies have&#xD;
      established that transplanted donor T-cells targeting antigens expressed on RCC cells mediate&#xD;
      these anti-tumor effects. However, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be toxic and&#xD;
      associated with a 10-20% risk of procedure-related mortality. The observation that&#xD;
      transplanted donor T-cells have the potential to cure a subset of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      disease forms the basis for continued efforts in our laboratory to harness the power of&#xD;
      T-cells to cure this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team isolated a tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) line from peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained after an allogeneic transplant from a patient who showed&#xD;
      prolonged tumor regression. Using limiting dilution cloning, we identified an allogeneic&#xD;
      (derived from the stem cell donor) CD8+ T-cell clone that killed ccRCC cells in an HLA A11&#xD;
      restricted fashion. Using cDNA expression cloning, we identified a HERV-E derived antigen&#xD;
      expressed in the patient s ccRCC cells to be the target of this T-cell clone. Remarkably, we&#xD;
      found this HERV-E was expressed in the majority of ccRCC cells with no expression in normal&#xD;
      tissues. Based on the identification of the antigenicity of the HERV-E transcripts in ccRCC,&#xD;
      our team in collaboration with Dr. Nishimura s laboratory (Loyola University Cardinal&#xD;
      Bernardin Cancer Center) has cloned, expressed and characterized the TCR from this CD8+&#xD;
      T-cell clone that recognizes an HLA A11 restricted HERV-E antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research protocol is therefore designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      infusion of HERV-E TCR transduced CD8+/CD34+ enriched T cells in HLA-A*11:01 positive&#xD;
      patients with metastatic clear cell RCC. Subjects will receive a novel non-myeloablative&#xD;
      immunosuppressive conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by an&#xD;
      infusion of HERV-E TCR transduced CD8+/CD34+ enriched T cells. To mediate T cell survival and&#xD;
      sustain function, moderate-doses of IL-2 (aldesleukin) will be administered intravenously&#xD;
      twice a day for 14 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is safety by day 21. Secondary endpoints will include overall response&#xD;
      rate, progression-free survival and overall survival. Exploratory studies will include&#xD;
      persistence of circulating HERV-E TCR transduced CD8+/CD34+ enriched T cells, changes in&#xD;
      immune cell subsets and activation status of T cells, as well as, other immunologic&#xD;
      determinants with clinical outcomes at baseline, at different time points during treatment&#xD;
      and at the time of disease progression.&#xD;
