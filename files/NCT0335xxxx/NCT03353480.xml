  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) initiated a generic consistency evaluation program&#xD;
      to evaluate the quality and efficacy of the products manufactured in China in 2016. This is a&#xD;
      reference scaled bioequivalence study to support the program and to demonstrate the&#xD;
      bioequivalence between the 250 mg azithromycin tablet manufactured at Pfizer Dalian, China&#xD;
      (the localized originator, Test) and the 250 mg azithromycin tablet manufactured at Pfizer&#xD;
      Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, US (the originator, Reference) in healthy Chinese subjects under&#xD;
      fasted and fed conditions. This open-lable, randomized, single-dose 3-way crossover study&#xD;
      will enroll approximately 33 subjects for each condition. The primary endpoints are&#xD;
      azithromycin area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to 72 hours&#xD;
      post-dose (AUC72) and Cmax.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a reference scaled bioequivalence study to support a generic consistency evaluation&#xD;
      program, initiated by CFDA in 2016, for the evaluation of quality and efficacy of the&#xD;
      products manufactured in China. The selected strength of 250 mg tablet is the approved&#xD;
      strength. The primary objective is to demonstrate the bioequivalence between the 250 mg&#xD;
      azithromycin tablet manufactured at Pfizer Dalian, China (the localized originator, Test) and&#xD;
      the 250 mg azithromycin tablet manufactured at Pfizer Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, US (the&#xD;
      originator, Reference) in healthy Chinese subjects under fasted (Group 1) and fed (Group 2)&#xD;
      conditions. Approximately 33 Chinese healthy subjects will be enrolled for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints are azithromycin area under the serum concentration-time curve from&#xD;
      time zero to 72 hours post-dose (AUC72) and Cmax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of azithromycin&#xD;
      administered as a single oral dose of 250 mg tablet manufactured at Pfizer Dalian, China and&#xD;
      250 mg tablet manufactured at Pfizer Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, US in healthy Chinese subjects&#xD;
      under fasted and fed conditions. And the secondary endpoint is adverse events (AEs). Other&#xD;
      endpoints include Tmax of azithromycin, safety laboratory tests and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each group, subjects will be randomized to one of the 3 treatment sequences. Each&#xD;
      treatment sequence will consist of 3 periods, separated by a washout period of at least 14&#xD;
      days between each period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each period in both groups, each subject will be administered investigational&#xD;
      product at approximately 8:00 AM (± 2 hours). Blood samples for the analysis of azithromycin&#xD;
      in serum will be collected at pre-dose (within 30 minutes prior to dosing) and at 0.5, 1, 2,&#xD;
      3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours post dose in each period. Vital signs, physical&#xD;
      examination, laboratory tests and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed at&#xD;
      specified times. Tolerability and safety will be assessed for all treatments by monitoring&#xD;
      AEs.&#xD;

             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must be of Chinese ethnicity (individuals currently residing in mainland&#xD;
             China who were born in China and have both parents of Chinese descent).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).&#xD;

          7. Screening supine BP ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), following at least&#xD;
             5 minutes of rest. If BP is ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP&#xD;
