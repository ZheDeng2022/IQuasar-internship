  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor is a potent and fast-acting P2Y12-ADP receptor antagonist recommended as&#xD;
      first-line agent in ACS (2). This drug was associated with a 20% relative reduction in the&#xD;
      rate of MACE in ACS patients undergoing PCI compared to clopidogrel. This benefit came&#xD;
      without any increase in major bleedings compared to clopidogrel (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the PLATO trial, a limited number of kidney failure patients were included (21%) and&#xD;
      patients with terminal CKD were excluded. A sub-group analysis focused on CKD patients was&#xD;
      performed. Only 214 patients with CKD below stage 4 (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min) were&#xD;
      included (7). No patient with terminal CKD or undergoing chronic hemodialysis was included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of importance, kidney function impairment is frequent and affects up-to 40 % of ACS patients.&#xD;
      In addition, CKD is a powerful independent predictor of ischemic complications during ACS&#xD;
      (8-9).Indeed, CKD patients have a very high risk of MACE following ACS with an odd ratio&#xD;
      between 2 and 3 compared to patients with normal kidney function and event rates above 40% at&#xD;
      one year follow-up (8-13). Of importance these patients more often have high on-clopidogrel&#xD;
      platelet reactivity which was strongly associated with a worse clinical outcome (3,14-16). In&#xD;
      CKD patients HTPR was associated with death after PCI (15). Accordingly ticagrelor which&#xD;
      overcomes these limitations of clopidogrel could be associated with a major clinical benefit&#xD;
      in severe or terminal CKD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of ticagrelor and is active metabolites are excreted through the feces. Preclinical data&#xD;
      suggested that renal impairment had little effect on systemic exposure to the&#xD;
      drug(EMEA/H/C/1241 (28)). Recent pharmacodynamic and kinetic studies confirmed these&#xD;
      preclinical data on the safety of ticagrelor in severe and end-stage CKD (17-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore based on the rational above and to the lack of relevant clinical data, the optimal&#xD;
      P2Y12-ADP receptor antagonist for patients with stage 4 and 5 and patients undergoing chronic&#xD;
      dialysis remains undetermined in ACS treated with PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aimed to compare the clinical efficacy ticagrelor and clopidogrel in patients with stage 4&#xD;
      and 5 or on chronic hemodialysis undergoing PCI for ACS.&#xD;
