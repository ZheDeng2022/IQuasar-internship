  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the usefulness of the subcutaneous administration of a new Lasix&#xD;
      formulation. 20 patients will be evaluated in the first phase (pilot phase) and depending on&#xD;
      the results, an additional 40 patients will be enrolled (Evaluation Phase). Patients with&#xD;
      mild to moderate evidence of fluid overload who present to the cardiology service at St&#xD;
      Elizabeth's Medical Center, Brighton, Massachusetts (SEMC) will be included in the study.&#xD;
      Patients who qualify for thus study will be sent home with the sc2Wear™ Furosemide Infusor&#xD;
      therapy for three days. This is a pump that patients place on their abdomen and it then&#xD;
      delivers furosemide to the skin. Participants will be visited at home by a visiting nurse who&#xD;
      will give them further teaching on the sc2Wear™ Furosemide Infusor. The visiting nurse will&#xD;
      also be responsible for obtaining history (symptoms), physical examination (including&#xD;
      inspecting the skin for adverse reactions related to the pump), and laboratory draws,&#xD;
      supplementation of electrolytes as needed. Patients will be evaluated by the cardiology&#xD;
      service of SEMC within 24 hours of the last dose of the sc2Wear™ Furosemide Infusor. If a&#xD;
      patient is found to have satisfactorily responded but requires more therapy, an additional 4&#xD;
      days may be prescribed for total of seven consecutive treatments. If additional units are&#xD;
      prescribed, patients will be evaluated by the cardiology service of SEMC within 24 hours of&#xD;
      the last dose of the sc2Wear™ Furosemide infusion. Also an additionally, up to three-sc2Wear&#xD;
      furosemide at home treatments may be used as authorized by the treating physician in case the&#xD;
      patient experiences worsening heart failure within 30-days of enrollment (Rescue Treatment).&#xD;
      Participants will be seen in clinic for follow up at 30±3 days after the start of the study&#xD;
      for a post treatment.&#xD;

      Investigational Product: Furosemide Injection, 8 mg/mL, (total dose =80 mg) administered&#xD;
      subcutaneously by the sc2Wear Furosemide Infusor using a biphasic profile with 30 mg over the&#xD;
      first hour and then as 12.5 mg per hour over the subsequent 4 hours. Participants may be&#xD;
      prescribed a total of 3 days initial treatment followed by an optional additional 4 days of&#xD;
      sc2Wear furosemide treatment based on initial clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives: 1.) Evaluate the clinical effect of sc2Wear furosemide Infusor in the&#xD;
      in-home management of mild to moderate decompensated heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.) Evaluate the safety and tolerability of sc2Wear furosemide Infusor in the in-home&#xD;
      management of mild to moderate decompensated heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cardiology service will screen patients with mild to moderate fluid overload. Patients&#xD;
      who present with other serious or life threatening condition for which hospitalization would&#xD;
      be indicated are excluded. Women of child bearing potential will be screened for pregnancy&#xD;
      with a urine pregnancy test. Eligible participants will be educated on device preparation,&#xD;
      placement, removal and care in accordance with the Instructions of Use Manual. The screening&#xD;
      phase includes evaluation of the home situation to ascertain that sufficient support is or&#xD;
      can be made available for at home treatment as an alternative to inpatient care. In&#xD;
      appropriate settings, lay caregiver will also be trained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot Phase. Patients will be visited daily by Steward Home Care and Hospice for home health&#xD;
      nursing services in accordance with standard procedures. Nursing services will include&#xD;
      checking vitals, obtaining blood samples and evaluation for clinical improvement or&#xD;
      worsening. The first visit will be performed within 24 hours after enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures: The first sc2Wear Infusor will be prepared and placed on the patient as&#xD;
      part of the training. The patient will go home with the sc2Wear furosemide Infusor in place&#xD;
      on the abdomen to be activated upon arrival at home. Participants will be treated with the&#xD;
      sc2Wear furosemide Infusor daily for 3 consecutive days at home. Participants will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the cardiology service of SEMC within 24 hours after the 3rd dose of sc2Wear&#xD;
      furosemide. If a patient was found to have responded satisfactorily but requires additional&#xD;
      parenteral diuretics an additional 4 days may be prescribed for a total of 7 consecutive&#xD;
      treatments. If additional units are prescribed patients are to be evaluated the cardiology&#xD;
      service of SEMC within 24 hours after the last dose of sc2Wear furosemide Infusor. If the&#xD;
      subject requires further parenteral diuresis after the 7 days of at home treatment, they will&#xD;
      be converted to usual care at that time, which may require inpatient care. Participants will&#xD;
      be instructed to record daily morning weights during and after treatment until the second&#xD;
      post treatment evaluation. Interim clinic visits and laboratory assessments may be required&#xD;
      based on clinical considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be studied at Baseline and follow-up treatment visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HF Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dyspnea scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine laboratory panel (incl. electrolyte, pro-BNP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Injection site assessment Participants will visit the clinic 30 ± 3 days after the start&#xD;
           of the study for a post treatment evaluation.&#xD;
