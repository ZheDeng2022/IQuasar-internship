  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to investigate the effects of combined corneal wavefront-guided&#xD;
      transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy (tPRK) and accelerated corneal collagen&#xD;
      cross-linking (CXL) after intracorneal ring segment (ICRS) implantation in patients with&#xD;
      moderate keratoconus. Medical records of 23 eyes of 23 patients undergoing combined tPRK and&#xD;
      CXL after ICRS implantation were retrospectively analyzed. Uncorrected distance visual acuity&#xD;
      (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), manifest refraction spherical equivalent&#xD;
      (MRSE), corneal indices based on Scheimpflug tomography, higher-order aberrations (HOAs), and&#xD;
      corneal biomechanical properties were evaluated before and after ICRS implantation, and at 1,&#xD;
      3, and 6 months after combined tPRK and CXL. Corneal biomechanical properties were measured&#xD;
      using the dynamic Scheimpflug analyzer at approximately the same time of day.&#xD;

      3, and 6 months after combined tPRK and CXL. Corneal biomechanical properties were measured&#xD;
      using the dynamic Scheimpflug analyzer at approximately the same time of day. The dynamic&#xD;
      Scheimpflug analyzer automatically calculated corneal deformation amplitude, radius values,&#xD;
      and maximal concave power when the cornea is deformed to its greatest curvature by the air&#xD;
      puff. The deformation amplitude is defined as the maximum amplitude when the cornea is&#xD;
      deformed to its greatest concave curvature and is influenced by corneal stiffness. The radius&#xD;
      values represent the central concave curvature at the highest concavity (depressed to the&#xD;
      highest concavity), while maximal concave power is the inverse radius of the curvature at the&#xD;
      highest concavity.&#xD;
