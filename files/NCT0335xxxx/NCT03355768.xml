  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study employs a 1:1 randomization of patients to receive romidepsin alone verses&#xD;
      romidepsin plus pralatrexate for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). The primary objectives will be to identify a 75%&#xD;
      improvement in progression free survival (PFS) among patients receiving the combination&#xD;
      compared to single agent romidepsin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 8 years, 3 new classes of drugs have been approved for the group of diseases&#xD;
      recognized as peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). The novel anti-folate pralatrexate was the&#xD;
      first drug approved for patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL in 2009. Four histone&#xD;
      deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been approved including vorinostat, romidepsin,&#xD;
      belinostat, and chidamide (approved in China). The antibody drug conjugate Brentuximab&#xD;
      vedotin was approved in one subtype of PTCL, anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma. The HDAC&#xD;
      inhibitors and pralatrexate exhibit near lineage-specific activity with limited-to-no&#xD;
      activity in B-cell lymphomas. As single agents in the relapsed setting romidepsin and&#xD;
      pralatrexate exhibit response rates of 25-38% and 29-54% respectively across published phase&#xD;
      I and II studies. While these studies are not identical in their patient composition, they&#xD;
      included patients who are heavily pre-treated from a diversity of PTCL subtypes. A recent&#xD;
      case match control analysis has demonstrated that patients treated with pralatrexate on&#xD;
      PROPEL achieve a statistically significant survival advantage when compared to a matched&#xD;
      historical population. In addition, sub-analysis of patients treated on PROPEL revealed that&#xD;
      response and clinical benefit metrics (ORR, CR, duration of response (DOR) and progression&#xD;
      free survival (PFS)) with pralatrexate improved significantly as the therapy moved up earlier&#xD;
      in their treatment course. Patients achieving a response to romidepsin also exhibited a&#xD;
      prolonged DOR of 28 months, with the median DOR not being reached in patients achieving&#xD;
      complete response (CR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The curative treatment of PTCL is not likely to be accomplished by the use of any single&#xD;
      agent therapies. Clinically it makes sense to identify rational combinations of active agents&#xD;
      in an attempt to identify disease specific active combinations. In preclinical models of&#xD;
      T-cell lymphoma, in vitro cytotoxicity assays have clearly established a synergistic&#xD;
      interaction between pralatrexate and several HDACI, including romidepsin. In addition,&#xD;
      pralatrexate and romidepsin have differing mechanisms of actions and different toxicity&#xD;
      profiles which lends to the probability that the combination of these agents will be combined&#xD;
      safely with likely improved efficacy. Despite this rationale, the identification of a&#xD;
      biological rationale will provide important insights into the optimal strategies for combing&#xD;
      these different classes of drugs. It will also provide opportunities to develop biomarkers of&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is extremely rare especially in the United States and&#xD;
      Europe and is associated with considerable heterogeneity. Of the lymphomas, T-cell lymphomas&#xD;
      make up a larger fraction in Asia and Latin America likely owing to genetic predisposition&#xD;
      and early exposure to viral infections such as human T-lymphotropic virus type -1 (HTLV-1)&#xD;
      and Epstein barr virus (EBV). Although there are differences between subtypes, in general&#xD;
      patients with T-cell lymphomas have an inferior overall survival as compared to those with&#xD;
      their B-cell lymphoma counterparts. The median overall survival of patients with T-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma is only 1 to 3 years. There is presently no consensus on the best front-line therapy&#xD;
      for these patients, though most recognize cyclophosphamide- doxorubicin hydrochloride&#xD;
      (Adriamycin)-vincristine (Oncovin)-prednisolone (CHOP) or CHOP-based treatment as the&#xD;
      standard despite the poor results. While clinical trials have been important in identifying&#xD;
      novel agents active in relapsed disease, accrual to trials is often difficult given the&#xD;
      rarity of the disease. Incorporation of novel agents into the front-line setting has not yet&#xD;
      been realized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modest attempts to improve responses and duration of response have been made by intensifying&#xD;
      front-line chemotherapy with the addition of etoposide and by consolidating response with&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplantation in the first remission, though these maneuvers have&#xD;
      likely not significantly impacted the natural history of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past several years, the investigators have adopted a strategy of trying to develop&#xD;
      novel T-cell lymphoma active combinations, based on drug: drug synergy experiments in the&#xD;
      preclinical setting. For example, the investigators have established biological preclinical&#xD;
      and clinical evidence for the following doublets: (1) pralatrexate plus romidepsin (2)&#xD;
      hypomethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors (3) pralatrexate plus gemcitabine.(4) pralatrexate&#xD;
      plus bortezomib and (5) alisertib plus romidepsin. Each of these combinations leveraged a&#xD;
      strong rationale for the companion agent used in combination with the HDAC inhibitor and or&#xD;
      pralatrexate, leading to a clinical study in most cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from the phase I portion of the study demonstrate that the combination is safe and&#xD;
      produces clinically meaningful responses across a diversity of PTCL subtypes in patients who&#xD;
      are heavily treated. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled and were evaluable for toxicity.&#xD;
      There were 3 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in cohort 4 (pralatrexate 20mg/m2 &amp; romidepsin&#xD;
      12mg/m2given weekly x 2 Q21D) consisting of 2 Grade 3 oral mucositis and 1 Grade 4 sepsis.&#xD;
      The every other week (QOW Q28D) schedule had no DLTs at equivalent and higher doses. The&#xD;
      grade 3/4 toxicities reported in &gt;5% of patients included: neutropenia (28%),&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (28%), anemia (29%), oral mucositis (14%), hyponatremia (7%), pneumonia (7%)&#xD;
      and sepsis (7%). Twenty-three patients were evaluable for response. The overall response rate&#xD;
      (ORR) in the total, non-PTCL and PTCL populations was 57%; 33% (no CR) and 71% (40% CR)&#xD;
      respectively. Given these are two approved agents for relapsed PTCL, there is a clear&#xD;
      regulatory strategy following the completion of this study.&#xD;
