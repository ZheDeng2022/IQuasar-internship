  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a national, open label, multicenter, randomized split-mouth study in patients&#xD;
      from 18 to 70 years of age to compare the efficacy and acceptability of lidocaine gel&#xD;
      compared to injection anesthesia with articaine (infiltration anesthesia for the upper jaw&#xD;
      and infiltration or nerve block anesthesia for the lower jaw). It is planned that about 90&#xD;
      patients with a proven moderate periodontitis will be enrolled in 5 German study centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynexan Mundgel® (lidocaine hydrochloride) is a topical anesthetic gel containing lidocaine&#xD;
      that is commercially available as an anesthetic for temporary, symptomatic treatment of pain&#xD;
      at the oral mucosa, gingiva and lips. The gold standard for scaling and root planing (SRP) is&#xD;
      still the use of injection anesthesia. This raises the question what kind of anesthesia&#xD;
      patients would prefer if they had a free choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study Ultracaine® D-S 1:200,000 (articaine hydrochloride/epinephrine hydrochloride)&#xD;
      was selected as the injectable comparator drug because it is the most frequently used&#xD;
      anesthetic drug for infiltration and nerve-block anesthesia in Germany at present.&#xD;
