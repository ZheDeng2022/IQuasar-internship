  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a new neonatal follow-up model that offers additional support and&#xD;
      coping resources for parents during their child's NICU admission as well as during their&#xD;
      transition home. The Coached, Coordinated, Enhanced Neonatal Transition (CCENT) model&#xD;
      involves a key worker who will be the primary support for families during the first year of&#xD;
      their child's life. The key worker's role involves 1) parental coaching using an Acceptance&#xD;
      and Commitment Therapy approach, 2) coordinating care across various levels of care as well&#xD;
      as supporting families in system and resource navigation, and 3) provided proactive education&#xD;
      targeting normal challenges in caring for a child who required intensive care support. The&#xD;
      goal is to improve the psychosocial support and medical care coordination beyond the neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit as many of the medical and social concerns do not end at the time of&#xD;
      discharge. Primary objective is parent stress at 12 months.&#xD;
