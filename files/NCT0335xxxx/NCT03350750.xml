    <textblock>
      The Placebo-Controlled Effectiveness in Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (iNPH)&#xD;
      Shunting (PENS) trial is a multi-center blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled design&#xD;
      investigation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt surgery to study the shunt effectiveness in&#xD;
      iNPH patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary intervention will be setting the FDA-approved Certas Plus with Siphonguard,&#xD;
      programmable CSF shunt valve to active (open shunt group)(setting 4)(110 mm H2O) or placebo&#xD;
      (closed shunt group)(setting 8)(&gt;400 mm H2O)in a 1:1 ratio. By the time of the primary&#xD;
      objective evaluation at four months, the closed shunt group will have zero months of active&#xD;
      treatment, and the open shunt group will have four months of active treatment. At four&#xD;
      months, shunts for subjects in the closed shunt group will be adjusted to setting 4. To&#xD;
      maintain blinding, all patients will be adjusted/ mock adjusted to the active setting in a&#xD;
      similar fashion. Patients from both groups will not be adjusted before four months of active&#xD;
      treatment, unless judged medically necessary by the treating team. Following four months of&#xD;
      active treatment, all subjects in each group will have shunt adjustments according to&#xD;
      clinical standards at each center.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The primary intervention will be the initiation of the randomized initial shunt valve opening pressure setting to create a delayed treatment group in half of the study patients.&#xD;
Randomization will be to active or placebo (closed) shunt settings. At the time of the standard four-month evaluation, all subjects will be similarly non-invasively adjusted to bring all subjects in both groups to the active setting while maintaining blinding of the subjects. All settings will be verified by the adjusting neurosurgeon.</intervention_model_description>

    <ipd_description>After subject enrollment and follow up have been completed, the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) of the study will prepare a final study database for analysis. A releasable database will be produced and completely de-identified in accordance with the definitions provided in the Health insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Namely, all identifiers specified in HIPAA will be re-coded in a manner that will make it impossible to deduce or impute the specific identity of any patient. The database will not contain any institutional identifiers.&#xD;
The DCC will also prepare a data dictionary that provides a concise definition of every data element included in the database. If specific data elements have idiosyncrasies that might affect interpretation or analysis, this will be discussed in the dictionary document.&#xD;
In accordance with policies determined by the investigators and funding sponsors, the releasable database will be provided to users in electronic form.</ipd_description>
