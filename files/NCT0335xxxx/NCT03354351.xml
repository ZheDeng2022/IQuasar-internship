    <textblock>
      Mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and trauma-related stress (MD\AD\TRS) are common among&#xD;
      men, particularly those suffering from heart disease (HD). MD\AD\TRS are significantly&#xD;
      related to exacerbation of HD symptoms that often lead to death. Unfortunately, men are&#xD;
      significantly less likely than women to seek and receive appropriate treatment for their&#xD;
      mental health issues including MD\AD\TRS. Furthermore, there is little literature about the&#xD;
      use of the stepped care model in the Canadian setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of this interventional program is therefore to prevent, early detect and&#xD;
      treat MD\AD\TRS in men living with HD. This Participatory Action Research aims to implement a&#xD;
      stepped-care model for MD\AD\TRS in men in New Brunswick, Ontario, and quebec. The second&#xD;
      phase of the project proposes a quantitative study that will consist of testing the&#xD;
      effectiveness and acceptability (by the men and the involved health professionals) of the&#xD;
      stepped-care model. It will offer to post ACS-males a mental health related component&#xD;
      presently not available in the typical services of the NB health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at baseline (0 month) and at four follow-up (each 3-months) sessions&#xD;
      to manage the progress of each participant throughout their 12-month journey in the study.&#xD;
      Typical sociodemographic data will be collected, along with a questionnaire on Masculinity&#xD;
      Norms, Couples Satisfaction (when applicable), and four mental health assessment tools.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention proposed in this study is a stepped-care model comprised of three steps. The&#xD;
      intensity of the intervention increases for participants with each of the following steps: 1)&#xD;
      psychoeducation, 2) group therapy and 3) individual therapy. Recent evidence has shown the&#xD;
      need for more tailored assessment and treatment methods for men suffering from depression as&#xD;
      well as evidence showing the effectiveness of EFT (Emotionally-Focused Therapy)1. As such,&#xD;
      the stepped-care model approach will be based on cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) and&#xD;
      Emotionally-Focused Therapy (EFT). The research design is based on a quasi-experimental&#xD;
      paradigm and a prospective observational cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background information In 2012, the Canadian Institute for Health Information estimated that&#xD;
      6.8 million Canadians age 20 to 74 are affected by the following chronic conditions heart&#xD;
      disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
      Strikingly, nearly 40% more men than women are likely to be hospitalized for all types of&#xD;
      heart disease (HD) combined2. Mental health and physical health are fundamentally linked. It&#xD;
      is three times more likely that a person with HD will experience depression when compared to&#xD;
      people without HD2. Research on men's mental health in the context of HD, specifically in&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome (ACS), reveals an important relationship between HD and mood&#xD;
      disorders, anxiety disorders, and trauma-related stress in men (MD/AD/TRS)3. Co-existing HD&#xD;
      and mental illness contribute to worse health status and higher health care utilization&#xD;
      rates3. This is problematic because men underuse mental health services and health services&#xD;
      in general4. The principal reasons evoked to explain this are the lack of &quot;male-friendly&quot;&#xD;
      health services, the functional view that men have of their bodies, and their perception of&#xD;
      healthcare services as occasional &quot;fix-it&quot; cures4. Thus, while men appear to be at high risk&#xD;
      for HD and for the spectrum of MD/AD/TRS that often accompany it and slow the rehabilitation&#xD;
      from ACS, they are unlikely to receive preventative services, to seek and to receive&#xD;
      appropriate timely interventions for their psychological distress and mental illness. This in&#xD;
      turn, can jeopardize men's mental health, quality of life and physical health over the long&#xD;
      term, along with their life expectancy. Indeed, the occurrence of MD/AD/TRS has been shown to&#xD;
      impact the prognosis of ACS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of this study an Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) encompasses multiple heart&#xD;
      diseases having symptoms consistent with acute myocardial ischemia, including unstable angina&#xD;
      and myocardial infarctions (MI) (&quot;heart attacks&quot;) such as non-ST-segment elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (NSTEMI) and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)5. On the other&#xD;
      hand, Mood disorder or depressive disorders (MD) includes a variety of depressive conditions&#xD;
      that mainly cause an individual to not function normally from a mental and physical&#xD;
      standpoint. These conditions all show symptoms of sadness, emptiness and irritable mood6.&#xD;
      Anxiety disorders (AD) consist of the anticipation of future threats, which cause an&#xD;
      individual to be overly cautious or avoidant and result in such actions as misguided or&#xD;
      anticipatory muscle tension in normal-considered situations6. Trauma-related stress (TRS)&#xD;
      describes a condition where the individual's exposure to an event has caused unusual,&#xD;
      physical or mental, stress or trauma. The aftermath of these events can vary; with some&#xD;
      having the individual experiences anxiety and fear, but more often they will show a hedonic,&#xD;
      dysphoric, dissociative and aggressive symptoms6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant Literature and Data The psychological effects of HD are seen at the patient level&#xD;
      and their family (e.g. intimate partner)7-12. HD is related to decrease in sexual activity&#xD;
      and sexual satisfaction, decrease in effective interpersonal communication, and increase in&#xD;
      the amount and intensity of conflict in couple relationships13,14. This can be especially&#xD;
      problematic for men, because they tend to become more intensely physiologically aroused&#xD;
      (e.g., increase in blood pressure, cardiac reactivity, and limbic activation) for more&#xD;
      extended periods of time during and after conflicts with their partners than do women15,&#xD;
      which tends to lead them to shut down emotionally and to shut out their relationship partner&#xD;
      in an attempt to re-establish psychological and physiological homeostasis16-18.Unfortunately,&#xD;
      this type of &quot;stonewalling&quot;15 behaviour usually only serves to exacerbate couple conflict and&#xD;
      leads to distressed conjugal relationships16-18. Clinically significant symptoms of&#xD;
      depression and anxiety are known correlates of conjugal distress19-21. Furthermore, emotional&#xD;
      isolation is also a known risk factor for the development of TRS22,23. Patients with&#xD;
      MD/AD/TRS are at greater risk (two-fold) of major adverse cardiac events than those&#xD;
      without24; and at risk of recurrent HD and mortality25. All of this may contribute to poorer&#xD;
      prognosis of ACS patients with MD/AD/TRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite findings from some small-scale studies that indicate positive effects of&#xD;
      psychotherapy and pharmacological therapy on symptoms of depression and anxiety in the&#xD;
      context of HD26-28, the results of large controlled trials are equivocal. The Enhancing&#xD;
      Recovery in Coronary HD Patients (ENRICHD) study investigated MD, HD, social support and&#xD;
      CBT29-32. Their finding showed that CBT helped to reduce symptoms of depression in MI&#xD;
      patients in short term but the benefits waned after 30 months. Similarly, the Cardiac&#xD;
      Randomized Evaluation of Antidepressant and Psychotherapy Efficacy (CREATE) study suggested&#xD;
      that 12 weeks of Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) did not add to the effects of clinical&#xD;
      management on depression in cardiac patients when combined with the antidepressant&#xD;
      citalopram33. The psychological treatments that have been used to date thus appear to be&#xD;
      lacking for cardiac patients with depression, which emphasizes the need for the development&#xD;
      of ones that will have the desired effects on their psychological symptoms. Aside from the&#xD;
      handful of studies cited above, published reports of treatments/care of MD/AD/TRS in the&#xD;
      context of HD are virtually nonexistent. Thus far, all of the research in this area has&#xD;
      focused on generic treatments for men and women that might neglect the specific needs or&#xD;
      tendencies of either gender in terms of mental-health treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For aforementioned reasons, ensuring that men are properly informed, screened, and treated&#xD;
      for MD/AD/TRS in the context of HD is essential. It is also imperative that the preventive&#xD;
      approaches and the treatments they receive be tailored to their particular needs (e.g.&#xD;
      goal-oriented focus with specific and attainable objectives)34. As previous literature&#xD;
      pointed out, &quot;The rationale behind the development of male sensitive approaches is that men&#xD;
      generally have a harder time engaging in the activities germane to psychotherapy (e.g.,&#xD;
      identifying and discussing feelings, considering the intra- and interpersonal impact of one's&#xD;
      own behaviour and that of others, showing vulnerability, asking for help) than do women, for&#xD;
      a host of reasons related to both biology and socialization .&quot; Men are significantly less&#xD;
      likely than women to seek any kind of help for common mental-health problems4,36. Most of the&#xD;
      psychological services routinely offered tend to focus predominantly on symptom-management,&#xD;
      with little attention to the interpersonal connections that attenuate the loneliness and&#xD;
      isolation that contribute to MD/AD/TRS. A notable exception to this is IPT mentioned earlier.&#xD;
      Furthermore, to the investigators knowledge, IPT has not been applied to cardiac patients&#xD;
      with MD/AD/TRS, and it appears to be less effective for patients with little or no social&#xD;
      support or with dysfunctional conjugal relationships26. Recognition of the importance of&#xD;
      interpersonal relationships for mental health has led a handful of clinical researchers to&#xD;
      integrate relational components into their treatments for depression, anxiety, and comorbid&#xD;
      HD and to test their efficacy26,33,37,38. However, there has not yet been, to the&#xD;
      investigators knowledge, any systematic attempt to tailor and apply relationship-focused&#xD;
      treatments to the needs of men suffering from MD/AD/TRS as they recover from HD. These&#xD;
      include a focus on the intra- and interpersonal skills known to coincide with psychological&#xD;
      health (e.g., awareness and integration of primary affect into daily interactions in order to&#xD;
      meet socio-affective needs, realistic thinking, engagement in rewarding behaviours) and&#xD;
      presentation of these skills in ways that will resonate with male patients (e.g.,&#xD;
      task-focused approach, appropriate rationale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stepped-care models have been applied elsewhere for MD/AD/TRS treatment with general success&#xD;
      and acceptability. Studies have shown that the stepped-care implementation was received&#xD;
      positively in primary care settings39. It was also shown to be effective in reducing symptoms&#xD;
      and improving functioning among TRS patients40. According to the literature, the stepped care&#xD;
      model has also been used with cardiac patients and was acceptable, effective and&#xD;
      accessible41.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical relevance of the project Currently, in the province of New Brunswick, there a few&#xD;
      services offered or follow-ups available for ACS patients in relation to their mental health.&#xD;
      Some cardiac rehabilitation centers in the province offer access to psychological services to&#xD;
      ACS patients, but these are very limited compared to more intensive services such as&#xD;
      stepped-care models. These services include access to information on depression and a more&#xD;
      thorough Cardiac Wellness Program with access to a psychologist for patients who wish to&#xD;
      pursue their rehabilitation42. In the past few decades, implementation of stepped-care models&#xD;
      for the treatment of mood disorders have been seen globally43,44 and their adaptation deemed&#xD;
      as cost-effective45-47.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MD/AD/TRS stepped-care intervention proposed in this study will contribute to adopt&#xD;
      men-sensitive interventions and preventive approaches (information/education and early&#xD;
      detection) and to emphasize the link between HD and men's relationships and interpersonal&#xD;
      support by means of including identified significant people in their lives for their&#xD;
      treatment. Modifications to the stepped-care model will be integrated based on findings from&#xD;
      the qualitative study in phase 1 of the project which encompassed focus groups with men and&#xD;
      interviews with health professionals. Some of these modifications include utilizing language&#xD;
      that is men sensitive, giving a choice to men as to whether they would like to include their&#xD;
      partners in therapy and providing training for therapists on the stepped care model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the Phase 2 of the study Primary Objectives The primary objectives of this&#xD;
      observational study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of the&#xD;
      stepped-care model and thus to identify predictors of utilization, compliance and clinical&#xD;
      trajectory of men following an ACS, experiencing or not a common mental illness (MD/AD/TRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the study secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve the utilization of cardiac rehabilitation programs among men post-ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess changes of men perceptions towards masculinity and their relationship to their&#xD;
           partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop recommendations to support implementation and scaling-up the intervention in the&#xD;
           province.&#xD;
