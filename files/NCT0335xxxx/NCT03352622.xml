      The pharmacogenomics of the Colombian population with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), understood&#xD;
      as the individual response to drugs depending on the genome of each patient, can be an&#xD;
      explanation for the problems of effectiveness and safety that appear during the&#xD;
      pharmacotherapeutic treatment of RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are limited studies on the pharmacogenomics of the Colombian population;&#xD;
      Therefore, it is necessary to identify and classify the genetic polymorphisms characteristic&#xD;
      of Colombian patients with RA, which influence the response of methotrexate, infliximab,&#xD;
      etanercept, adalimumab and thus contribute to precision medicine and medical prescription&#xD;
      according to the Specificity of the genome of each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to determine the association of genetic polymorphisms with the response to&#xD;
      inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and methotrexate. To do this, a prospective&#xD;
      study of cases and controls will be performed in patients in 3 hospital of Colombia with&#xD;
      pharmacotherapeutic treatment of methotrexate, infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, in&#xD;
      monotherapy or combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, it is expected to contribute to the performance of specific genetic tests for RA&#xD;
      and the generation of a pharmacogenomic basis of the Colombian population with RA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis is an important public health problem; In recent years better health&#xD;
      outcomes have been achieved with the incorporation of synthetic and biological disease&#xD;
      modifying drugs. However, problems of variability in response are reported, leading to&#xD;
      ineffectiveness and adverse reactions in 30-40% of patients. In this sense, Pharmacogenomics,&#xD;
      through the study of genetic variants of proteins involved in the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of drugs, becomes a way to maximize the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work aims to give an overview of the pharmacogenomics of rheumatoid arthritis and the&#xD;
      possibility of using genetic tools to support the pharmacotherapeutic decision in the&#xD;
      clinical consultation, in order to improve the response to treatment of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relevance of this study is to provide the possibility of applying the candidate genes&#xD;
      selected for their biological importance, either in the kinetics or by their relation in the&#xD;
      pharmacological action, in the identification of individuals at risk of adverse effects or&#xD;
      With probability of being resistant to the treatment. Therefore, it is expected that the&#xD;
      information generated will be able to be used in daily clinical practice, contributing to&#xD;
      identify the best therapeutic option (greater effectiveness and safety) in patients with&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, it is expected that this type of information will&#xD;
      contribute to optimize the costs of care in this disease, which is classified in Colombia as&#xD;
      a high cost pathology, in which medicines can reach up to 86% of the total cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, individuals respond differently to drug therapy and no medication is 100% effective&#xD;
      in all patients, which may be due to an alteration in the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of drugs associated with conditions Genetic-environmental. In this context,&#xD;
      the study of candidate pharmacogenomic genes has been most successful in identifying and&#xD;
      explaining variation in pharmacological response, compared to candidate gene investigations&#xD;
      of the disease. Therefore, this work should contribute to the choice of the best therapeutic&#xD;
      option in patients with RA in Colombia and, thus, to strengthen the country's health sector.&#xD;
