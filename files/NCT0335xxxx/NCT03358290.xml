    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Achieving a Minimum 75% Improvement From Baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75) by End-of-treatment (EOT).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) combines the assessment of the severity of lesions (scaling, redness and plaque thickness) and the area affected into a single score in the range of 0.0 (no disease) to 72.0 (maximal disease). The body is divided into four sections: (1) Head and neck; (2) Upper limbs; (3) Trunk (including axillae and groin); and (4) Lower limbs (including buttocks).&#xD;
The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis.&#xD;
The PASI-75 response rate is defined as at least 75 percent (%) reduction in PASI score relative to Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Who Achieved Static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) Score of 0 or 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA of psoriasis is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the redness, thickness and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average redness, thickness and scaling are scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0 [no symptom] to 4 [severe symptom]). The total score is calculated as average of the 3 severity (redness, thickness and scaling) scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the sPGA score (0=cleared; 1=minimal; 2=mild; 3=moderate; and 4=severe).&#xD;
For this outcome measure, a score of 0 means no symptoms of psoriasis and a score of 1 means minimal symptoms of psoriasis.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Body Surface Area (BSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The total body surface area (BSA) affected by plaque-type psoriasis was obtained from the percentages of areas affected, including head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs. Each reported percentage was multiplied by its respective body region corresponding factor (head=0.1, upper limbs=0.2, trunk=0.3, lower limbs=0.4) and the resulting 4 values were added up to obtain the total psoriasis BSA (Range: 0 to 100).&#xD;
BSA (%)=0.1Sh + 0.2Sh+0.3St+0.4Sl, where S=body region surface area with psoriasis: h=head; u=upper limbs; t=trunk; l=lower limbs.&#xD;
Percent change from baseline to Week 12 in BSA was calculated by taking the Week 12 BSA and subtracting the baseline BSA, then dividing by the baseline BSA and multiplying by 100.&#xD;
A negative change from baseline at Week 12 indicates a reduction in the Psoriasis BSA compared to the baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Skindex-16 Overall Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Skindex-16 questionnaire contains 16 questions related to quality of life in subjects with skin disease. It consists of a short 16-item assessment completed by the subject, with each item rated on a 7-point Likert scale (0=never bothered to 6=always bothered). Each raw score is multiplied by 16.667 to transform all responses to a linear scale from 0 (no effect) to 100 (effect experienced all the time). Responses to the Skindex-16 are categorized into 3 subscales: symptom, emotional &amp; functional; their respective scores are expressed in a linear scale from 0 to 100. Overall scale score is an average of 16 items expressed in a linear scale from 0 to 100.&#xD;
Change from baseline to Week 12 in the Skindex-16 Overall Score was calculated by taking the Week 12 Skindex-16 Overall Score and subtracting the baseline Skindex-16 Overall Score.&#xD;
A negative change from baseline at Week 12 indicates an improvement in the subject's condition compared to the baseline.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Subjects Achieving a Minimum 75% Improvement From Baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75) by End-of-treatment (EOT).</title>
        <description>The psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) combines the assessment of the severity of lesions (scaling, redness and plaque thickness) and the area affected into a single score in the range of 0.0 (no disease) to 72.0 (maximal disease). The body is divided into four sections: (1) Head and neck; (2) Upper limbs; (3) Trunk (including axillae and groin); and (4) Lower limbs (including buttocks).&#xD;
The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis.&#xD;
The PASI-75 response rate is defined as at least 75 percent (%) reduction in PASI score relative to Baseline.</description>

The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis.&#xD;
Percent change was calculated by taking the Week 12 PASI score and subtracting the baseline PASI, and dividing by the baseline PASI, then multiplying by 100 to get the percent change from baseline.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Subjects Achieving PASI-90 (90% Improvement From Baseline in PASI)</title>
        <description>The psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) combines the assessment of the severity of lesions (scaling, redness and plaque thickness) and the area affected into a single score in the range of 0.0 (no disease) to 72.0 (maximal disease). The body is divided into four sections: (1) Head and neck; (2) Upper limbs; (3) Trunk (including axillae and groin); and (4) Lower limbs (including buttocks).&#xD;
The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis.&#xD;
The PASI-90 response rate is defined as at least 90 percent (%) reduction in PASI score relative to Baseline.</description>

        <description>The sPGA of psoriasis is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the redness, thickness and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average redness, thickness and scaling are scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0 [no symptom] to 4 [severe symptom]). The total score is calculated as average of the 3 severity (redness, thickness and scaling) scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the sPGA score (0=cleared; 1=minimal; 2=mild; 3=moderate; and 4=severe).&#xD;
For this outcome measure, a score of 0 means no symptoms of psoriasis and a score of 1 means minimal symptoms of psoriasis.</description>

        <description>The total body surface area (BSA) affected by plaque-type psoriasis was obtained from the percentages of areas affected, including head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs. Each reported percentage was multiplied by its respective body region corresponding factor (head=0.1, upper limbs=0.2, trunk=0.3, lower limbs=0.4) and the resulting 4 values were added up to obtain the total psoriasis BSA (Range: 0 to 100).&#xD;
BSA (%)=0.1Sh + 0.2Sh+0.3St+0.4Sl, where S=body region surface area with psoriasis: h=head; u=upper limbs; t=trunk; l=lower limbs.&#xD;
Percent change from baseline to Week 12 in BSA was calculated by taking the Week 12 BSA and subtracting the baseline BSA, then dividing by the baseline BSA and multiplying by 100.&#xD;
A negative change from baseline at Week 12 indicates a reduction in the Psoriasis BSA compared to the baseline.</description>

        <description>Skindex-16 questionnaire contains 16 questions related to quality of life in subjects with skin disease. It consists of a short 16-item assessment completed by the subject, with each item rated on a 7-point Likert scale (0=never bothered to 6=always bothered). Each raw score is multiplied by 16.667 to transform all responses to a linear scale from 0 (no effect) to 100 (effect experienced all the time). Responses to the Skindex-16 are categorized into 3 subscales: symptom, emotional &amp; functional; their respective scores are expressed in a linear scale from 0 to 100. Overall scale score is an average of 16 items expressed in a linear scale from 0 to 100.&#xD;
Change from baseline to Week 12 in the Skindex-16 Overall Score was calculated by taking the Week 12 Skindex-16 Overall Score and subtracting the baseline Skindex-16 Overall Score.&#xD;

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Skindex-16 Functioning Scale Score</title>
        <description>Skindex-16 questionnaire contains 16 questions related to quality of life in subjects with skin disease. It consists of a short 16-item assessment completed by the subject, with each item rated on a 7-point Likert scale (0=never bothered to 6=always bothered). Each raw score is multiplied by 16.667 to transform responses to a linear scale from 0 (no effect) to 100 (effect experienced all the time). Responses to the Skindex-16 are categorized into 3 subscales: symptom, emotional &amp; functional; their respective scores are expressed in a linear scale from 0 to 100. Functioning scale score is an average of items 12 to 16 expressed in a linear scale from 0 to 100.&#xD;
Change from baseline to Week 12 in the Skindex-16 Functioning Scale Score was calculated by taking the Week 12 Skindex-16 Functioning Scale Score and subtracting the baseline Skindex-16 Functioning Scale Score. A negative change from baseline at Week 12 indicates an improvement in the subject's condition compared to the baseline.</description>
