      The &quot;Singapore Chinese Health Study&quot; is a cohort study established by the Department of&#xD;
      Epidemiology and Public Health in National University of Singapore, together with&#xD;
      collaborators from several universities in the United States of America. This is a long-term&#xD;
      study to help doctors and scientists understand the influence of diet, lifestyle and&#xD;
      environment on the development of common diseases among Singaporean men and women. This&#xD;
      includes cancer, heart disease, stroke, dementia, osteoporosis, high cholesterol and&#xD;
      diabetes. The aim is to help us understand the causes of these diseases and to discover&#xD;
      effective and efficient approaches for prevention and treatment.&#xD;

      The cohort consists of more than 60,000 men and women who were enrolled in the Singapore&#xD;
      Chinese Health Study during 1993-1998. At the time of enrollment, participants were&#xD;
      interviewed in-person regarding their dietary habits and other lifestyle factors. About half&#xD;
      of them also donated small amounts of blood and urine for research between 2000 and 2004.&#xD;

      Beginning in April 1994, a 3% random sample of enrollees were re-contacted for donation of&#xD;
      blood/buccal cells and spot urine specimens. In January 2001, the accrual of biospecimens was&#xD;
      extended to include all consenting cohort enrollees. Hitherto, biospecimens have been&#xD;
      collected from about 32,800 subjects (28,439 bloods, 4,438 buccal cells, 31,201 urines),&#xD;
      representing a consent rate of about 60%.&#xD;
