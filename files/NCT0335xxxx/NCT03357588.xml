  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ITREMA trial is an open-label randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which HIV-1 infected&#xD;
      patients initiating first-line ART and already on first-line ART will be enrolled. Enrollment&#xD;
      will continue until 600 patients have been randomized. Patients initiating ART will be&#xD;
      randomized after six months of ART and patients already on ART will be randomized at 6 months&#xD;
      after the last viral load measurement. Patients in both arms will receive study visits every&#xD;
      three months for a total follow-up duration of 18 months after randomization to either of two&#xD;
      study arms. The control arm will receive standard of care HIV-1 treatment monitoring during&#xD;
      first-line ART in accordance with South African National Department of Health (NDoH)&#xD;
      guidelines. The intervention arm will receive intensified treatment monitoring during&#xD;
      first-line ART according to the treatment monitoring strategy under investigation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll adult HIV-1 infected patients who are about to initiate or have&#xD;
      already initiated first-line ART. Patient enrollment and randomization will be performed at&#xD;
      two different time points. Timing and criteria for enrollment and randomization are as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ART naïve patients: Patients are eligible for enrollment initiation of treatment with&#xD;
           first-line ART. Randomization is performed after availability of the first routine viral&#xD;
           load measurement, performed at month 6 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients on ART: Patients are eligible for enrollment after ≥ 1 year of virologically&#xD;
           suppressive first-line ART and only if a last viral load with a result &lt;1000 copies/mL&#xD;
           was performed within the last 6 months. Randomization is performed 6 months after the&#xD;
           last viral load (VL) result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 600 patients will be randomized into two trial arms. The trial will be&#xD;
      conducted on-site at one of the clinical facilities of Ndlovu Care Group&#xD;
      (http://www.ndlovucaregroup.co.za/), one of the partners in the project. This facility,&#xD;
      Ndlovu Medical Centre, is situated in the town of Elandsdoorn, Limpopo, South Africa, and&#xD;
      provides medical service to local South African patients who are unable to pay medical&#xD;
      insurance. The Ndlovu Care Group distributes antiretroviral medication in the framework of&#xD;
      the South African Department of Health antiretroviral treatment programme. This clinic is&#xD;
      currently providing ART to &gt;3600 patients. Patients on ART return to the clinic monthly for&#xD;
      collection of medication, pill count and adherence counselling, which allows intensification&#xD;
      of monitoring without substantial change of the infrastructure or frequency of visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomisation, patients in both study arms will return for study follow-up visits on a&#xD;
      three-monthly basis, at month 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 after start of ART or after the last&#xD;
      VL measurement. In addition, patients will be called back for additional study visits (max.&#xD;
      2) in case of a detected viral load &gt;1000 copies/ml during any of these visits. All visits in&#xD;
      both arms, including aforementioned additional call back visits will coincide with standard&#xD;
      of care medication collection visits to the clinic. In case of a switch to second-line&#xD;
      therapy, patients in both arms will continue three-monthly follow-up visits in an&#xD;
      observational manner, and guidelines for monitoring of second-line therapy are followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      300 patients randomly assigned to this arm will be monitored in full concordance with current&#xD;
      South African NDoH guidelines in use at the study site. Viral load measurements will be&#xD;
      performed at month 12 and 24 after start of ART (for newly initiated patients) or at month 12&#xD;
      and 24 after the last viral load measurement (patients already on ART). If a viral load &gt;1000&#xD;
      copies/ml is detected, the patient is called back for counseling for therapy adherence and&#xD;
      repeat viral load measurement, 2 months after the initial viral load measurement. If the&#xD;
      repeat viral load measurement is &gt;1000 copies/ml after adherence counseling, this is taken to&#xD;
      be indicative of therapy failure due to development of drug resistance and a switch to second&#xD;
      line therapy is made, together with intensified adherence counseling, without verifying the&#xD;
      cause of virological failure by performing drug level testing or drug resistance testing. If&#xD;
      viral load drops to &lt;1000 copies/ml after adherence counseling, the first line treatment is&#xD;
      maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      300 patients randomly assigned to this arm will be monitored using the investigational&#xD;
      intensified monitoring strategy. This strategy consists of 3-monthly viral load monitoring at&#xD;
      month 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 (after start of ART in initiating patients or after the last&#xD;
      viral load measurement in patients on ART). If a viral load measurement &gt; 1000 copies/mL is&#xD;
      detected, the patient will be called back for a follow-up study visit at the next monthly&#xD;
      medication collection visit (4 weeks after detection of elevated viral load). Upon arrival&#xD;
      drug level testing is performed, the viral load measurement is repeated, and a dried blood&#xD;
      spot prepared and stored at room temperature. Procedures following this depend on the result&#xD;
      of drug level testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If drug levels are detected by drug level testing, the result of the viral load&#xD;
           measurement is awaited. If the repeat viral load is &gt;1000 copies/ml, the dried blood&#xD;
           spot is shipped directly by courier to the World Health Organization (WHO) reference&#xD;
           laboratory for drug resistance testing. The reference laboratory will provide feedback&#xD;
           by means of a digital resistance report to the coordinating research physician. The&#xD;
           patient will be called back for a second follow-up study visit at the next monthly&#xD;
           medication visit (8 weeks after detection of elevated viral load), either for&#xD;
           prescription of second-line therapy or continuation of first-line therapy, guided by the&#xD;
           result of resistance testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If drug level monitoring at the first follow-up visit indicates that drug levels are not&#xD;
           detected, intensified counseling is performed at the same visit and first-line therapy&#xD;
           will be maintained, regardless of the result of the repeat viral load measurement. The&#xD;
           patient will not be called back and the next viral load will be performed at the next&#xD;
           scheduled three-monthly time point. However, if the viral load result at this visit is&#xD;
           again &gt;1000 copies/ml, drug resistance testing will be performed regardless of the&#xD;
           outcome of drug level testing.&#xD;
