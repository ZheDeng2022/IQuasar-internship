  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-centre observational study over one year investigating the mechanisms of muscle&#xD;
      homeostasis in patients with acute skeletal muscle atrophy following major aortic surgery&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some patients who are critically ill develop a syndrome of muscle weakness called Intensive&#xD;
      Care Unit Acquired Paresis. This syndrome involves the development of severe muscle wasting&#xD;
      and weakness and affects all skeletal muscles including the muscles which help one breathe.&#xD;
      Muscle wasting and weakness whilst critically ill cause prolongation of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, longer stays on the ICU, reduced mobility and prolonged rehabilitation in&#xD;
      survivors. It has also been shown to increase the risk of death on ICU, due to an inability&#xD;
      to wean patients from mechanical ventilation. Most patients recover; however in some, the&#xD;
      effects last for many years and patients may not recover fully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is some understanding of why this syndrome develops, the molecular processes&#xD;
      underlying the muscle wasting are not well understood. From the current scientific evidence,&#xD;
      the investigators have identified a group or family of proteins believed to be important in&#xD;
      the development of this condition, the activity of which are regulated by disease processes&#xD;
      thought to lead to Intensive Care Unit Acquired Paresis (e.g. infection, inflammation,&#xD;
      oxidative stress, immobility).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims to investigate the role of these proteins in human tissue from patients&#xD;
      who are at risk of Intensive Care Unit Acquired paresis. Even patients who do not go on to&#xD;
      develop the full syndrome, in the early stages of ICU care, show some signs of muscle changes&#xD;
      and loss of strength.&#xD;
