      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have confirmed that most patients with idiopathic REM sleep behaviour&#xD;
      disorder (iRBD) eventually develop neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, REM sleep without&#xD;
      atonia (RSWA), a hallmark of RBD feature, is a significant predictor of development of&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases in patients with iRBD. Some preliminary studies have implied that&#xD;
      isolated RSWA in the absence of RBD symptoms may also indicate neurodegeneration. However,&#xD;
      this speculation needs to be confirmed by more refined study with sophisticated measures in&#xD;
      both RSWA and markers of neurodegeneration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: 1) to determine the differences in striatal dopamine transmission and other&#xD;
      markers of neurodegeneration among individuals with isolated RSWA and healthy controls; 2) to&#xD;
      examine the correlation of severity of RSWA with striatal dopamine transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Case-control study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Community-based sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 1) iRBD first degree relatives with isolated RSWA (n=18) 2) iRBD first degree&#xD;
      relatives without isolated RSWA (n=18) 3) Community-based health controls without isolated&#xD;
      RSWA (n=18)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The dopamine transmission as measured by triple-tracer PET/ CT imaging protocol&#xD;
           including 18F-DOPA, 11C-Raclopride and 18F-FDG images;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Brain glucose metabolism and neurocognitive measures;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Severity of EMG activity during REM sleep&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the past two decades, a number of studies have confirmed that most patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic RBD will eventually develop neurodegenerative diseases, especially&#xD;
      α-synucleinopathies. Previous studies, including our preliminary data, suggested that RSWA is&#xD;
      a marker of predicting the conversion of neurodegenerative diseases in idiopathic RBD. In&#xD;
      other words, RSWA is an early marker of neurodegeneration in patients with idiopathic RBD.&#xD;
      However, a number of individuals who are absent of any RBD symptoms (including patients with&#xD;
      α-synucleinopathies, also have RSWA, which is described to have isolated RSWA. Only a few&#xD;
      studies have attempted to understand the clinical importance and predictive prognosis of&#xD;
      isolated RSWA. These preliminary studies suggest that isolated RSWA in healthy subjects may&#xD;
      be a silent biomarker of neurodegeneration. However, these preliminary findings need to be&#xD;
      replicated and confirmed by more refined study with dopamine neurotransmission neuroimaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study will enrich the limited scientific literature of the potential&#xD;
      pathogenesis and progression of isolated RSWA. By using an ongoing family study, we have&#xD;
      screened a number of individuals with isolated RSWA, who are the first degree relatives of&#xD;
      patients with RBD and are presumed to have a higher risk of neurodegeneration. Based on the&#xD;
      existing sample, the current study will provide the first neuroimaging data on isolated RSWA&#xD;
      to test the hypothesis that isolated RSWA, even in the absence of RBD symptoms, is an early&#xD;
      marker of neurodegeneration. Individuals with isolated RSWA are expected to show dopamine&#xD;
      dysfunction when compared with individuals without RSWA. If we confirm this hypothesis, the&#xD;
      findings in the current study will extend our understanding of the spectrum of RBD and RSWA.&#xD;
      The potential implication of our findings is that asymptomatic RSWA, especially in the&#xD;
      presence of family history, will harbour the neurodegenerative progression. The results will&#xD;
      pave the way for future prospective follow up to determine the course of neurodegeneration.&#xD;
      From an etiological understanding, it will help to expand the understanding of the evolution&#xD;
      course of synucleinopathy neurodegeneration. From an interventional angle, this study will&#xD;
      have significant implication for developing a longer prevention window for neuroprotective&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
