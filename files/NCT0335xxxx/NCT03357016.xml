  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postmenopausal women, as men, are more prone to central or android obesity than premenopausal&#xD;
      women. Abdominal fat mass accumulation is associated with an increase of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD) risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most exercise programs designed for weight loss have focused on about 30 min several times&#xD;
      per week of moderate intensity continuous training (MICT). Disappointingly, such exercise&#xD;
      programs have led to either none or low fat loss. Accumulating evidence suggests that high&#xD;
      intensity interval training (HIIT) should be an effective exercise protocol for reducing body&#xD;
      fat of overweight individuals, especially at the abdominal level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance Training (RT) is associated with increased muscle mass and strength gain in main&#xD;
      muscles groups. Thus, RT seems to be an interesting strategy to fight against deconditioning&#xD;
      and autonomy loss with age. Development of muscle mass enhances resting metabolism rate.&#xD;
      Thus, RT could raise daily energy expenditure ie. substrates' oxidation including lipids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study was to compare the effects of a 12-week moderate intensity continuous&#xD;
      training (MICT) program with high intensity interval training (HIIT) program combined or not&#xD;
      with a resistance training (RT) program on total abdominal and visceral fat mass and&#xD;
      substrate utilization in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that HIIT compared to MICT program would result in significantly greater&#xD;
      whole body and regional fat mass losses (abdominal and visceral) and would improve lipid&#xD;
      oxidation at rest and during prolonged moderate exercise. It is also hypothesized that HIIT&#xD;
      associated with RT could be the best strategy to reduce fat mass.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are dramatically spreading worldwide, and these trends are occurring&#xD;
      in both developed and developing countries. Fat mass and more particularly abdominal fat mass&#xD;
      is related to the development of cardio-vascular diseases (CVD). Postmenopausal women, as&#xD;
      men, are more prone to central or android obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most exercise programs designed for weight loss have focused on about 30 min several times a&#xD;
      week of moderate intensity continuous training (MICT). Disappointingly, such exercise&#xD;
      programs have led to either none or low fat losses. Accumulating evidence suggests that high&#xD;
      intensity interval training (HIIT) could be an effective exercise protocol for reducing&#xD;
      adipose tissue of overweight individuals, especially at the abdominal level. HIIT involves&#xD;
      brief high-intensity, anaerobic exercise followed by brief but slightly longer bouts of very&#xD;
      low-intensity exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance training (RT) program are currently proposed in order to reduce fat mass /&#xD;
      preserve fat-free mass. Their beneficial effects have been demonstrated, especially in the&#xD;
      elderly. Through development (or maintenance) of muscle mass, RT increases resting metabolism&#xD;
      rate, daily energy expenditure, and substrate (fatty acids) oxidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to compare the effects of a 12-week moderate intensity continuous&#xD;
      training (MICT) program with high intensity interval training (HIIT) combined or not with&#xD;
      resistance training (RT) program on total, abdominal and visceral fat mass and substrate&#xD;
      utilization at rest and during exercise in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      36 postmenopausal women will be randomly assigned to MICT (n= 12) or HIIT (n= 12) or HIIT +&#xD;
      RT (n= 12) group. Subjects performed three sessions per week during 12 weeks, on bicycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MICT: For the MICT protocol, each subject performed 35 min at 50% maximal aerobic power&#xD;
      (MAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIIT: For the HIIT protocol, each subject performed repeated cycles of sprinting for 8 s and&#xD;
      pedaling slowly for 12 s (between 20 and 30 rpm) for a maximum of 60 repeats per session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIIT+RT: For the HIIT+RT protocol, each subject performed HIIT protocol. Then they performed&#xD;
      a single set of 8 exercises with 1 or 2min resting period between exercises. Each set&#xD;
      consisted of 8-12 repetitions at about 80% maximum repetition (MR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total body and regional fat content will be measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry&#xD;
      (DEXA) before and after the intervention (3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will examine the effects of HIIT, MICT and HIIT + RT programs on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total fat mass (and appendicular fat mass) (DEXA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total fat free mass (and appendicular fat free mass) (DEXA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glycemic profile (plasma HbA1c, plasma glucose)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipid profile (TG, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Substrates oxidation at rest and during moderate exercise (40min, 50% of maximal oxygen&#xD;
           consumption VO2 max)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate sample size has been calculated given previous results about fat mass loss during&#xD;
      HIIT in women and considering the dropouts observed in this type of protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gaussian distribution of the data will be tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Data will be&#xD;
      presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Comparisons between groups will be made with&#xD;
      Mann &amp; Whitney U test or ANOVA when appropriate. Relationships between data will be assessed&#xD;
      by Pearson correlation. Significance will be accepted at the p&lt;0.05 level. Statistical&#xD;
      procedures will be performed using Statistica software.&#xD;
