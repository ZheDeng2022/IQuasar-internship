  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer among men and the second&#xD;
      among women in Brazil. Despite the high incidence and significance of CRC in Brazil, very&#xD;
      little is known about its prevalence among the asymptomatic population. Recently, a CRC&#xD;
      screening program was implemented at the Cancer Hospital of Barretos. Characterization of the&#xD;
      clinical findings detected in the screening population and the prevalence of basal CRC might&#xD;
      contribute to better organization of the program and define the best strategy for a future&#xD;
      national screening program. We hypothesize that recruitment and the early outcomes of our&#xD;
      screening program based on the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) will differ from the outcomes&#xD;
      corresponding to other populations due to sociodemographic differences. Aims: i. To implement&#xD;
      a data collection and storage system for follow-up of the screening program participants and&#xD;
      to measure early outcomes (adenoma, advanced adenoma and cancer) and associate them with&#xD;
      sociodemographic risk factors; ii. to quantify the risk of CRC in the Brazilian population&#xD;
      and to develop algorithms for risk stratification of CRC screening; and iii. to compare the&#xD;
      risk stratification to other countries with low, medium and high incomes. Methods:&#xD;
      Individuals aged 50 to 65 years will be included in the HCB screening program from November&#xD;
      2017 to December 2018. The following data will be collected from all participants:&#xD;
      sociodemographic and ethnic (skin color) characteristics; risk factors for CRC, such as&#xD;
      smoking and drinking; comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension;&#xD;
      and FIT, colonoscopy and histopathology examination results. Data collection will be&#xD;
      performed using the REDCap data collection/database system. The risk score will be formulated&#xD;
      using the Chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test) and simple logistic regression, and the&#xD;
      regression coefficients will be calculated. Then, the model identified for the training&#xD;
      sample will be replicated with a validation sample. The resulting score will be used to&#xD;
      calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value,&#xD;
      accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Kolmogorov D&#xD;
      statistic.&#xD;

      Variables and data collection Upon entry into the program, the following data will be&#xD;
      collected from all participants: sociodemographic and ethnic (skin color) characteristics;&#xD;
      risk factors for CRC, such as smoking and drinking; comorbidities, including diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus and arterial hypertension; and the FIT, colonoscopy and histopathology examination&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be performed using the REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at&#xD;
      Barretos Cancer Hospital (Paul et al., 2009). For this purpose, clinical forms were developed&#xD;
      containing questions relative to the data to be analyzed in the present project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy procedure Colonoscopies will be performed according to the routine procedures of&#xD;
      the Department of Prevention Endoscopy, HCB. Bowel preparation will begin on the eve of the&#xD;
      test and will consist of a residue-free liquid diet and oral intake of 10 mg of bisacodyl (5&#xD;
      mg/tablet, Boehringer Ingelheim do Brasil Química e Farmacêutica Ltda, São Paulo, Brazil) at&#xD;
      2:00 and 6:00 pm. On the test day, preparation will begin 5 hours before the procedure and&#xD;
      will consist of the oral intake of 500 ml of 20% mannitol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the colonoscopy, the patients will be sedated with fentanyl (0.05 mg/ml - Cristália&#xD;
      Produtos Químicos Farmacêuticos Ltda, São Paulo, Brazil), midazolam (5 mg/5 ml - Produtos&#xD;
      Roche Químicos e Farmacêuticos S.A., Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and propofol (10 mg/ml -&#xD;
      Cristália Produtos Químicos Farmacêuticos Ltda, São Paulo, Brazil) via the intravenous route.&#xD;
      Then, a flexible endoscope will be introduced up to the cecum and terminal ileum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen will be supplied at a flow rate of 2 l/min throughout the procedure. The heart rate&#xD;
      and oxygen saturation will be monitored. All tests will be performed using high-definition&#xD;
      colonoscopes (Olympus 180), and CO2 insufflation will be performed by senior endoscopists&#xD;
      with extensive experience in diagnostic colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be recorded throughout the procedure: colonoscope introduction and&#xD;
      withdrawal times; quality of bowel preparation according to the Boston scale; and location&#xD;
      and characteristics of the detected lesions. Accurate reports of the study outcomes (adenoma,&#xD;
      advanced adenoma and carcinoma), including the number, size and precise location, will have&#xD;
      paramount importance. The detected lesions will be classified following the Paris&#xD;
      classification (Paris Classification, 2002) as follows: type 0-I, polypoid (0-Is: sessile;&#xD;
      0-Isp: sub-pedunculated; and 0-Ip: pedunculated) and type 0-II, non-polypoid (0-IIa: slightly&#xD;
      elevated surface; 0-IIb: flat; 0-IIc: slightly depressed; and 0-III: excavated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis All statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS software for&#xD;
      Windows, version 21.0. In all cases, the significance level will be set to 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will be described in terms of the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and&#xD;
      quartiles for quantitative variables and through frequency tables in the case of qualitative&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk score will be formulated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will be composed of individuals diagnosed or not with cancer. Individuals with&#xD;
      adenoma or advanced adenoma and individuals without cancer will be excluded from the&#xD;
      analysis. Cases with a negative FIT will be considered No Cancer. Cases with a positive FIT&#xD;
      will be subjected to colonoscopy, the results of which will allow the classification of each&#xD;
      participant as Cancer or No Cancer. The sample will be randomly divided into two groups. The&#xD;
      first group will comprise 75% of the data and be named the training sample. The second group&#xD;
      will comprise the remaining 25% of the data and be named the validation sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training sample will be used to develop the risk score. First, the relationship of all of&#xD;
      the participants' characteristics with the outcomes (Cancer/No Cancer) will be investigated&#xD;
      using the Chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test) and simple logistic regression. All&#xD;
      characteristics with a p-value less than 0.2 in the previous assessment and other&#xD;
      characteristics that the investigators judge relevant will be included in a multiple logistic&#xD;
      regression model; then, the regression coefficients will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the model identified for the training sample will be replicated with the validation&#xD;
      sample; the resulting score will be used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive&#xD;
      predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy, area under the receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristic (ROC) curve and Kolmogorov D statistic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the model is considered discriminant, nomograms will be plotted, and risk groups will be&#xD;
      defined based on the risk score.&#xD;
