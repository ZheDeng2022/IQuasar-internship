  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) move blood from the left ventricle&#xD;
      (the largest chamber of the heart) to the aorta (the body's main artery) to help the heart&#xD;
      better meet the needs of the body and to improve survival for patients with advanced heart&#xD;
      failure (HF). The ability of the right ventricle (the large chamber on the right side of the&#xD;
      heart) to keep up with the improved blood flow following LVAD greatly effects how well a&#xD;
      person does following surgery. It is understood that a high pulmonary artery pressure&#xD;
      (pressure in the blood vessel that takes blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs)&#xD;
      measured before surgery, indicates that a higher risk of right heart failure exists after&#xD;
      LVAD implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is important because right heart failure after surgery is related to longer intensive&#xD;
      care unit (ICU) and hospital stays, increased morbidity (other health problems) including&#xD;
      organ failure and worse outcomes following heart transplant, and increased death rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sildenafil (RevatioÂ®) has been approved by Health Canada in the treatment of pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs) in patients with connective tissue&#xD;
      disease. Sildenafil has not yet been approved by Health Canada for the treatment of pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension in heart failure. Sildenafil lowers blood pressure in the lungs and lessens the&#xD;
      workload of the right ventricle (the right side of the heart). The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to determine if lowering blood pressure in the lungs, in heart failure patients at risk for&#xD;
      developing right heart failure after LVAD implant, lowers the incidence of right heart&#xD;
      failure, shortens ICU and hospital stays and reduces morbidity (other health problems) and&#xD;
      mortality (death rates).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, single arm study. Everyone who participates in this study will receive&#xD;
      sildenafil before and after LVAD surgery. It is expected that 24 patients who are scheduled&#xD;
      to have LVAD implantation for advanced heart failure will be enrolled from 6 sites across&#xD;
      Canada. Participants will be followed in the study for about 2 months.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initially implanted as a bridge to transplantation, LVADs are increasingly used for the&#xD;
      purpose of destination therapy. About 250 patients/year will receive LVAD device therapy in&#xD;
      12 implanting Canadian centres. Outcomes after LVAD implantation are critically dependent on&#xD;
      right ventricular (RV) function. Development of right heart failure (RHF) in LVAD patients&#xD;
      has a direct effect on mortality and is associated with a prolonged length of intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU) and hospital admission. RHF in LVAD patients leads to increased morbidity and is&#xD;
      associated with worse outcomes after cardiac transplantation. Despite improvements in&#xD;
      surgical and medical management the incidence of RHF after LVAD implantation has plateaued at&#xD;
      approximately 20-30%. A critical concept in the prevention of post-operative complications&#xD;
      involves appropriate patient selection and prophylactic measures directed toward risk factors&#xD;
      for development of RHF. To mitigate the risk of RHF after LVAD implantation, many implanting&#xD;
      centres are increasingly utilizing pulmonary vasodilating agents in the post-operative&#xD;
      period. Despite little evidence to support this approach, the phosphodiesterase-5A (PDE5)&#xD;
      inhibitor Sildenafil is now empirically administered for reduction of PVR in some centres&#xD;
      after LVAD implantation. Duration of therapy varies but may extend beyond 3 months and in&#xD;
      some cases may continue indefinitely or until the time of heart transplant. A small,&#xD;
      single-centre, open label study demonstrated that Sildenafil effectively reduced PVR in LVAD&#xD;
      patients with persistent pulmonary hypertension post-operatively, however only hemodynamic&#xD;
      endpoints were examined. Importantly, the investigation of this strategy was limited to those&#xD;
      with elevated PAP, irrespective of their clinical condition or pre-implantation hemodynamic&#xD;
      profile. There is a clear need for further research to establish the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      pulmonary vasodilators to either treat or prevent RHF in the LVAD patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the vasodilatory effects of sildenafil can prevent or&#xD;
      reverse the effects of elevated RV afterload and consequent RHF following LVAD implantation,&#xD;
      and that preoperative initiation of therapy in an at-risk population is feasible and will be&#xD;
      well tolerated. As such, there is a large potential for sildenafil to meet an unmet&#xD;
      therapeutic need for patients following LVAD implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      sildenafil therapy initiated prior to and continued after LVAD implantation for the purpose&#xD;
      of reducing PVR in patients at increased risk for development of RHF by INTERMACS criteria.&#xD;
      The feasibility of introducing sildenafil in this clinical setting along with the ability to&#xD;
      reduce PVR will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: a) To determine the efficacy of sildenafil to reduce the need for&#xD;
      prolonged inotropic support and post-operative ICU admission duration b) To determine the&#xD;
      tolerability and feasibility of the proposed dosing strategy c) To determine the impact of&#xD;
      sildenafil therapy on renal function and systemic arterial blood pressure d) To assess the&#xD;
      impact of sildenafil therapy on the likelihood of development of post-operative RHF by&#xD;
      INTERMACS criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Single-arm, open-label, prospective, multi-centre, interventional, feasibility and&#xD;
           efficacy, pilot study of sildenafil in patients undergoing LVAD implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This multi (6)-centre, Canadian trial is investigator initiated and industry sponsored.&#xD;
           The study design, coordination and conduction and other study tasks including monitoring&#xD;
           will be performed by the study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following enrolment into the study, subjects will have their data (i.e. weight, blood&#xD;
      pressure, pulse, lab work, medications, RHC data, ECG, physical exam), collected as&#xD;
      standard-of-care (SOC), included in their study chart. Participants will be started on&#xD;
      sildenafil at V1. If tolerated, subjects will be maintained on sildenafil pre and post-LVAD&#xD;
      implementation. On day 14 (+/- 2 days) subjects will have a RHC to evaluate right heart&#xD;
      function post-LVAD implantation. Subjects will return to the VAD (Ventricular Assist Device)&#xD;
      Clinic for regular visits following discharge until day 55 (EOS) for similar data collection.&#xD;
      Subjects will keep a daily sildenafil dosage diary from hospital discharge until day 55.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a brief telephone call at day 85 post LVAD implantation to evaluate&#xD;
      safety and outcome data.&#xD;
