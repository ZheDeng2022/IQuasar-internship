      Previous work has shown that gelatin supplementation could increase collagen synthesis in&#xD;
      humans. In this study subjects consume placebo, 5 or 15 g of gelatin with a standard amount&#xD;
      of vitamin C (48 mg) 1 hour before 6 minutes of jump rope exercise. The feeding and exercise&#xD;
      intervention was repeated every 6 hours while the subjects were awake for three days and the&#xD;
      amount of the amino terminal procollagen I peptide (PINP) was determined; a marker of&#xD;
      collagen synthesis, in the blood. Consistent with the hypothesis that gelatin increases&#xD;
      collagen synthesis in humans; the amount of PINP in the 15 g gelatin group was significantly&#xD;
      higher than either the placebo or the 5 g groups. These data conclusively demonstrate that&#xD;
      gelatin supplementation can increase exercise-induced collagen synthesis in humans.&#xD;
      Hydrolyzed collagen has a similar amino acid profile, in particular with high concentrations&#xD;
      of glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and arginine. Thus, the current study aims to determine&#xD;
      is the same dose of gelatin, hydrolyzed collagen and a gelatin/collagen mix, all with a&#xD;
      standard dose of vitamin C effect PINP levels similarly.&#xD;

      In preliminary work investigating the physiological determinants of maximal performance in&#xD;
      throwing events, researchers found that the best predictor of elite performance was the rate&#xD;
      of force development (RFD; Force (N) x time (sec)) when performing and isometric squat.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is not surprising that in order to maximize performance, athletes train to&#xD;
      optimize RFD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RFD is determined by three factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Neural activation of the muscles&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Type of motor protein (fast or slow myosin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Force transfer Interestingly, performance in power movements (that are highly dependent&#xD;
           on RFD) like vertical jump is closely related to tendon stiffness and inversely related&#xD;
           to muscle size. This indicates that force transfer, in the form of tendon stiffness,&#xD;
           plays an important role in performance and can explain a large amount of variance in&#xD;
           determining an athlete's ability to rapidly develop force during a dynamic movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stiffness of a tendon is determined by the amount and cross-linking of collagen within&#xD;
      the tissue. Acute exercise is known to increase collagen synthesis as well as the expression&#xD;
      of the primary enzyme involved in collagen cross-linking, lysyl oxidase. The result is a&#xD;
      denser and stiffer tissue after training. Even though the relationship between exercise and&#xD;
      collagen synthesis is known, whether this measure of performance can be improved with&#xD;
      nutritional interventions has not been determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study looking at amino acid levels following consumption of increasing doses of&#xD;
      gelatin (derivative of collagen) in human subjects has shown that the key primary and trace&#xD;
      amino acids found in collagen increase in human serum after consuming gelatin. Further, the&#xD;
      peak of these amino acids occurs 60 minutes after consuming the gelatin supplement.&#xD;
      Therefore, consuming a collagen supplement 1 hour before an exercise intervention should&#xD;
      maximize delivery of amino acids to bone and other connective tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether the gelatin supplement could increase collagen synthesis in humans,&#xD;
      subjects consumed placebo, 5 or 15 g of gelatin with a standard amount of vitamin C (48 mg) 1&#xD;
      hour before 6 minutes of jump rope exercise. The feeding and exercise intervention was&#xD;
      repeated every 6 hours while the subjects were awake for three days and the amount of the&#xD;
      amino terminal procollagen I peptide (PINP) was determined; a marker of collagen synthesis,&#xD;
      in the blood. Consistent with the hypothesis that gelatin increases collagen synthesis in&#xD;
      humans; the amount of PINP in the 15 g gelatin group was significantly higher than either the&#xD;
      placebo or the 5 g groups. These data conclusively demonstrate that gelatin supplementation&#xD;
      can increase exercise- induced collagen synthesis in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, supplementation with collagen hydrolysate has previously been shown to improve&#xD;
      cartilage function in a randomized clinical trial in patients with osteoarthritis [9].&#xD;
      McAlindon and colleagues showed that consuming 10 g of collagen hydrolysate per day resulted&#xD;
      in an increase in gadolinium enhanced MRI of collagen [9]. This finding suggests that the&#xD;
      hydrolyzed collagen increased cartilage formation. In agreement with this finding, a 24- week&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial in athletes showed that 10 g of GELITAÂ® collagen hydrolysate&#xD;
      significantly decreased knee pain. Mouse studies using C14 labeled hydrolyzed collagen&#xD;
      hydrolysate demonstrated that &gt;95% of the hydrolyzed collagen was absorbed in the first 12&#xD;
      hours after feeding. Interestingly, even though tracer from a separate C14 labeled proline&#xD;
      could be incorporated into skin collagen at the same rate as tracer from hydrolyzed collagen,&#xD;
      tracer from the hydrolyzed collagen was incorporated into the collagen of cartilage and&#xD;
      muscle two-fold more than the tracer from proline. These data suggest that musculoskeletal&#xD;
      collagen synthesis is greater in response to gelatin or hydrolyzed collagen than to the&#xD;
      individual amino acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though the blood measure of PINP levels likely reflects bone collagen synthesis, using&#xD;
      an engineered ligament model, a similar response has been demonstrated in tendons/ligaments&#xD;
      treated with serum from people 1 hour after supplementation with gelatin. This work has shown&#xD;
      that in the presence of serum isolated from the 5 and 15 grams of gelatin groups a step-wise&#xD;
      increase in the collagen content of the ligaments. From this work, it can be ascertained that&#xD;
      PINP can be used dependably as an indirect marker of collagen synthesis and that the changes&#xD;
      observed in bone (blood levels) reflect what is occurring in other connective tissues as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims to determine if the same dose (15 g) of gelatin, hydrolyzed collagen&#xD;
      and a mixture of gelatin and hydrolyzed collagen in a gummy form, all with a standard dose of&#xD;
      vitamin C (50 mg) have a similar effect on PINP levels; an indirect marker of collagen&#xD;
      synthesis.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Recreationally active male athletes between the ages of 18-50 years of age training&#xD;
             5-6 days per week including at least 1 training session of running per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving any medication that may interfere with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of more than 3 musculoskeletal injuries within the past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Health or dietary restriction that would be affected by the supplementation protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The initial phases of this study will be performed in males since collagen synthesis&#xD;
             varies significantly throughout the menstrual cycle in females. Since collagen is the&#xD;
             main outcome measure for this study this natural variation would confound the initial&#xD;
             phase of the work. Provided this work proves successful then we will aim to process&#xD;
             with similar research in females.&#xD;
