      The hypothesis is based on UMOD rs13333226 genotype, there are two strata of hypertensive&#xD;
      patients. The High-UMOD group (AA genotype) has increased UMOD excretion, greater salt&#xD;
      sensitivity, HTN, normal eGFR and greater BP response to loop diuretics like furosemide. The&#xD;
      Low-UMOD group (G allele) has decreased UMOD excretion, salt resistance, increased eGFR,&#xD;
      increased proximal tubular reabsorption of Na (possibly related to increased GFR), a poor BP&#xD;
      response to loop diuretics, and possibly diminished function of NKCC2. The High-UMOD strata&#xD;
      will have decreased delivery of Na+ to the distal tubule and collecting duct because NKCC2&#xD;
      function is normal and the study hypothesis is that the participants will be more responsive&#xD;
      to loop diuretics. In contrast, the Low-UMOD group (G allele) will not show a similar&#xD;
      response to loop diuretics. This may be related either to lower Na delivery to the TAL,&#xD;
      because of increased proximal tubular reabsorption of Na+, or a suppressed function of NKCC2.&#xD;
      The population distribution of the High-UMOD group (AA) is 67%. Our overall objective is to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that hypertensive subjects with uncontrolled HTN open possessing the AA&#xD;
      genotype of rs13333226 will be better responders to loop diuretics compared to those&#xD;
      possessing the G allele.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are over 1 billion people with HTN worldwide, and the World Health Organisation&#xD;
      suggests this will rise to 1.5 billion by 2020.(1) Up to 30% of hypertensive patients have&#xD;
      resistant HTN (uncontrolled BP on &gt; 3 drugs of which one must be a diuretic) and ~50% have&#xD;
      uncontrolled HTN, with a 7-fold higher cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, criteria such as ancestry and serum renin levels provide only a rough&#xD;
      indication of the underlying disease pathway and, while pharmacotherapy is the mainstay of&#xD;
      HTN management, the selection of antihypertensive therapy is essentially by trial-and-error.&#xD;
      Five drug classes are the main first-line agents for HTN, but response rates to any given&#xD;
      drug are only ~50%. There are no new anti-hypertensive drugs in clinical trials and there is&#xD;
      a need to either develop newer agents or target existing drugs to specific strata of&#xD;
      hypertensive patients in whom they would be beneficial. The recent failure of the Renal&#xD;
      Sympathetic Denervation trial, which used a novel device strategy for resistant HTN,&#xD;
      highlights the limited options available in the management of uncontrolled or resistant HTN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HTN as a phenotype demonstrates stratification in the population, based on the specific&#xD;
      pathophysiological and molecular pathways that are operative and this is reflected in the&#xD;
      current NICE guidelines. However, there has been little progress in stratification by&#xD;
      leveraging genomic and molecular information, although there is evidence that this may be&#xD;
      useful. Monogenic forms of HTN show that identification of the many causative mutations,&#xD;
      primarily affecting the kidney and sodium balance, can inform therapy - for example,&#xD;
      glucocorticoids in glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism and amiloride in Liddle syndrome.&#xD;
      Despite the successful adoption of the BHS/NICE treatment algorithm for the treatment of HTN,&#xD;
      there remains substantial clinical uncertainty about the preferred clinical management of&#xD;
      people with uncontrolled or treatment resistant HTN. Moreover, the choice of diuretic,&#xD;
      suggested in HTN guidelines, is not based on clinical trials for third line antihypertensive&#xD;
      agents. There is general consensus that resistant HTN is due to excessive sodium retention&#xD;
      and thus &quot;further diuretic therapy&quot; may be an effective treatment. The choice that one type&#xD;
      of diuretic will be superior to another has however not been studied and is usually&#xD;
      prescribed in a trial and error manner with diuretics that primarily target the distal&#xD;
      nephron (thiazide-like diuretic or spironolactone).&#xD;
