  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this Phase 1 trial is to study a potential drug-drug interaction between&#xD;
      macitentan and rosuvastatin, a model substrate of various transporter proteins (e.g. in the&#xD;
      gut).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rosuvastatin is a substrate of various transporter proteins including breast cancer&#xD;
      resistance protein (BCRP) and organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP). It is unknown&#xD;
      to which extent macitentan has an effect, if any, on BCRP transporters, especially intestinal&#xD;
      BCRP. The primary purpose of this Phase 1 study is to investigate the effect of macitentan on&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin, a model BCRP substrate.&#xD;
