      The purpose of this study is to analyze the immediate effects of an exercise protocol on the&#xD;
      vibration platform on the functional and neuromuscular performance of lower limbs, postural&#xD;
      control and life quality in healthy elderly.&#xD;

      The research is a randomized controlled trial that will be developed at the Laboratório de&#xD;
      Análise da Performance Muscular (LAPERN) of the Physiotherapy Department of the Federal&#xD;
      University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN). The population of the present study will be formed&#xD;
      by elderly individuals living in the city of Natal / RN, aged between 65 and 75 years, of&#xD;
      both sexes, without distinction of race, education and marital status. The research sample&#xD;
      will be of a non-probabilistic type, in which these will be allocated randomly into two&#xD;
      distinct groups: placebo group (GP) and experimental group (GE). This research was submitted&#xD;
      to the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) for UFRN through the national interface Plataforma&#xD;
      Brasil. The present research contemplates the ethical aspects based on Resolution 466/2012 of&#xD;
      the National Health Council (CNS) and the Declaration of Helsinki for research with humans.&#xD;
      In addition, the survey will be recorded in Clinicals Trial. All data will be recorded in a&#xD;
      database of the laboratory under confidentiality and can only be handled by the responsible&#xD;
      researchers. The study will only begin after the issuance of the referent opinion approving&#xD;
      the project. All subjects will be duly informed and instructed regarding the scheduled&#xD;
      procedures, which will only be executed after reading, accepting and signing the Term of Free&#xD;
      and Informed Consent (TFIC). After approval by the Research Ethics Committee, following&#xD;
      resolution 466/2012, a pilot study was carried out aiming at the adequacy of all the research&#xD;
      procedures, as well as the training of the researchers involved. Initially the research will&#xD;
      begin with the selection of the sample according to the inclusion criteria descried&#xD;
      elsewhere. The evaluation will be scheduled by telephone contact. Following this, the&#xD;
      volunteers will receive the TFIC for reading and due signature. The data collection process&#xD;
      will take place in four stages: (1) initial evaluation, (2) sample allocation (3) application&#xD;
      of exercise program and (4)reevaluation. The evaluations will be composed by the dynamometric&#xD;
      analysis associated with EMG (electromyography) and postural control analysis. The volunteers&#xD;
      will be allocated randomly into 2 groups: placebo group (with the platform off) or&#xD;
      experimental group (with the platform set at a frequency of 40 Hz and amplitude of 4 mm).&#xD;
      Both will perform a bout of exercise in the vibrating platform, consisting of a static&#xD;
      bipodal squat at 40 ° of knee flexion, with 4 sets of 1.5 min, with a rest interval of 1&#xD;
      minute. Immediately after the exercise the volunteers will be submitted to a revaluation,&#xD;
      with the same procedures of the initial evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will perform an isometric semi-squat exercise associated with the vibratory platform. The exercise will consist of 4 series of an isometric half-squat exercise with 1 minute and a half of duration and a rest interval of 1 minute. The vibratory platform will be connected at the beginning of each series, set at a vibration frequency of 40 Hertz (Hz) and peak-to-peak amplitude of 4 millimeters (mm) resulting in a peak acceleration of 128 ms2 (12.8 g). This should provide the equivalent of 3600 vertical vibrations, totaling 14400 vibrations per training session</description>
