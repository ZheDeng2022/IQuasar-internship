  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the coorelation between patient factors, health care&#xD;
      provider factors, drug factors and compliance in patients with relapsing forms of multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (RMS) treated with Disease Modifying Agents (DMA). We hypothesize that a number of&#xD;
      factors influence compliance with DMA's.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While compliance rates with interferons and glatiramer acetate treatment have been high when&#xD;
      assessed in the context of controlled clinical trials, we have observed substantially less&#xD;
      consistent rates of drug administration in general practice. Correspondingly, the magnitude&#xD;
      of drug efficacy achieved on clinical and surrogate markers of disease activity in the latter&#xD;
      patient group may be compromised compared to patients participating in controlled clinical&#xD;
      trials. Further, in many circumstances, the perception of breakthrough disease simply&#xD;
      constitutes treatment noncompliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Multiple Sclerosis Society reports only 50% of all MS patients and 60% with&#xD;
      relapsing remitting MS are taking disease modifying agents in the U.S. (Zwibel 2003) A number&#xD;
      of studies have investigated this challenging issue. When glatiramer acetate therapy was&#xD;
      specifically evaluated, the investigators found several factors to be associated with&#xD;
      compliance. They discovered adherence to be higher with the patient perception of physician&#xD;
      support of the medication prescribed, patient sense of control, higher levels of hope and no&#xD;
      previous use of other disease modifying therapy (Fraser, Hadjimichael, and Vollmer 2001).&#xD;
      Another study by Hadjimichael and Vollmer (1999) surveyed patients for reasons that&#xD;
      medications were discontinued. Disease progression, lack of improvement and side effects were&#xD;
      some of the reasons reported by patients for stopping disease-modifying therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression is another factor found to impact adherence. Mohr, Goodkin, Likosky, Gatto,&#xD;
      Baumann and Rudick (1997) saw increased rates of compliance with Interferon beta-1b therapy&#xD;
      in multiple sclerosis with the treatment of underlying depression. The study showed that&#xD;
      patients with increased depression were more likely to discontinue therapy. This link of&#xD;
      depression has also been demonstrated with noncompliance with antihypertensive medications.&#xD;
      (Wang,Bohn, Harooni et al. 2002) In another study, Mohr (2001) saw patient's experienced&#xD;
      level of anxiety with their injections was related to adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that a number of factors influence compliance with DMA's, these include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient factors&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Perceived quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Empowerment, sense of control &amp; hope&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Support structure (family, faith, injection assistance, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Depression&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Cognitive problems&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Perception of drug efficacy (benefit over costs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physician (HCP support) factors&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patient's perception of MD support&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Relationship with MD&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Access to nurses and other HCP support functions&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Services provided by physician/clinical practice (i.e. academic, community-based,&#xD;
                or MS clinic)&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Adequate education on MS, establishing reasonable expectations concerning the&#xD;
                benefit derived from therapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Drug factors&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. complexity of drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. drug associated side effects/tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Perceived MS symptom control&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Insurance coverage of the injection&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Concomitant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the factors that contribute to noncompliance to DMA therapies are identified, healthcare&#xD;
      professionals can evaluate how they can be impacted. The healthcare team can work towards&#xD;
      addressing those barriers where there is a possibility for change, to help improve patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the correlation between patient factors,&#xD;
      HCP support factors, drug factors, and compliance in patients with relapsing forms of&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (RMS) treated with Disease Modifying Agents (DMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to determine differences in patient compliance&#xD;
      between patients treated by academic centers/MS specialists and community neurology centers;&#xD;
      and to determine the factors that impact this difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are asked to sign (electronic agreement) a consent to participate in this&#xD;
      confidential study when they initially log-on to the study website. Patients are assigned a&#xD;
      unique identification number when they log into the internet for the first time to complete&#xD;
      the study survey. By using this assigned number, health information will be protected for&#xD;
      each individual. Patient names will be used only for purposes of check distribution and&#xD;
      participation in following studies if the patient consents. If a patient drops out of the&#xD;
      study, TNS Healthcare will contact the patient to find out the reason. The treating physician&#xD;
      does not know who elected to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design- This is a multicenter, retrospective trial administered through patient&#xD;
      surveys. We are utilizing the validated MS quality of life 54 (MSQOL-54), the Beck's Fast&#xD;
      Screen for medical patients, the Hope Herth Index, and a patient self-reported drug&#xD;
      compliance survey. The participating neurologists were asked to give patients with relapsing&#xD;
      forms of MS flyers describing the study. The flyers direct patients to the designated study&#xD;
      website to complete the confidential survey by internet. As described below, patients log-on&#xD;
      to the website a total of 3 times during the study period, Baseline (time 0), Month 1 (Time&#xD;
      1) and Month 2 (Time 2). Patients log on with a unique identification number rather than&#xD;
      names to ensure that confidentiality is maintained throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to have an equal number of patients treated with the four different DMA's,&#xD;
      AVONEX, Rebif, Copaxone, and Betaseron. The sample is to include at least 150-200 patients&#xD;
      from each of the MS Centers and 15-20 patients from each of the community sites, for a total&#xD;
      of approximately 1040 patients. Power analysis was performed assuming a 15% critical effect&#xD;
      value. The sample size was calculated to provide 80% power to detect the critical effect&#xD;
      value at a confidence interval of 95%. Response rates are estimated to be 60% for the first&#xD;
      wave and 75% for the second wave of questionnaires.&#xD;
