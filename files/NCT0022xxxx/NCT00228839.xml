    <textblock>
      Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) remains one of the most significant and potentially&#xD;
      lethal complications of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Depending upon the type of&#xD;
      transplant, the incidence of acute GVHD varies between 20 - 50% in related donor transplants,&#xD;
      or as high as 70 - 90% in unrelated donor transplants. Acute GVHD affects the skin, liver and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract and usually occurs within 20 - 40 days of the bone marrow&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steroids are the standard initial treatment of acute GVHD, with approximately 50% of the&#xD;
      patients either free of disease or requiring no further therapy. In the remaining patients,&#xD;
      the GVHD either does not respond or it comes back during the tapering of steroids. These&#xD;
      patients have a much worse prognosis with a mortality rate greater than 70%. Studies using&#xD;
      additional agents such as antithymocyte globulin (ATG), monoclonal antibodies, and&#xD;
      anti-lymphocyte globulin showed no improvement over the use of steroids alone. This leads the&#xD;
      investigators to look for new immunosuppressive agents that can reduce the risk and severity&#xD;
      of acute GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major purpose of this study is to evaluate the way the body uses and absorbs (the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile) a drug called anti tumor necrosis factor antibody (infliximab) for&#xD;
      the treatment of acute GVHD. Infliximab is currently indicated for the treatment of&#xD;
      immunologic-based diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, moderately to severely active Crohn's&#xD;
      disease, and fistulizing Crohn's disease), assuming patients have had inadequate responses to&#xD;
      conventional therapy. It is not approved for the treatment of GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I pharmacokinetic study that is coordinated by the Pediatric Blood and Marrow&#xD;
      Transplant Consortium (PBMTC). The study will be conducted in the Blood and Marrow&#xD;
      Transplantation (BMT) program at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta - Egleston, Emory&#xD;
      University Department of Pediatrics. The goal is to enroll 1 - 2 patients on this study;&#xD;
      accrual will be via the BMT program. Eligible patients must be less than 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with newly diagnosed acute GVHD will be able to participate in the study. Patients&#xD;
      will receive a single dose of infliximab in the clinic. Since this is a Phase I study, the&#xD;
      patients will have blood samples drawn to measure the pharmacokinetics of the drug. A total&#xD;
      of 16 blood samples will be drawn over 84 days. The samples will be labeled with a code,&#xD;
      processed, frozen, and then sent in a batch to the PBMTC designated laboratory for testing.&#xD;
      Patients will continue on any drugs they were getting for the prevention of GVHD. Additional&#xD;
      doses of infliximab may be given. This decision will be based on the results of the blood&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received corticosteroids at &gt;= 2 mg/kg/day for a minimum of 72&#xD;
             hours prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Overall clinical grade II-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) with intestinal involvement with&#xD;
             biopsy of at least one site &quot;consistent with&quot; aGVHD. Acute GVHD is defined in this&#xD;
             study as occurring within 100 days after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women of childbearing potential must use adequate birth control measures&#xD;
             (e.g., abstinence, oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, barrier method with&#xD;
             spermicide, or surgical sterilization) for the duration of the study and should&#xD;
             continue such precautions for 6 months after receiving the study drug infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent(s)/legal guardian must give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled infection(s), i.e. documented bacterial, viral or fungal&#xD;
             infection within 72 hours prior to study entry. Neither continuation of antibiotics&#xD;
             for a controlled infection nor prophylactic/empiric antibiotics warrant exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any one of the following opportunistic infections documented within 8&#xD;
             weeks prior to study entry are excluded: cytomegalovirus disease, pneumocystis&#xD;
             carinii, aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, atypical mycobacterium infection or other&#xD;
             pathogenic molds/fungi.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;

             study, requiring informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of ATG or similar product within 14 days prior to study entry requires study chair&#xD;
             approval. Judgment will be based on ATG dosing and timing.&#xD;

             history of pulmonary TB should have a thorough evaluation for TB prior to study&#xD;
             enrolment as recommended by a local infectious disease specialist or by guidelines on&#xD;
             TB screening published by the United States (US) Federal Centers for Disease Control&#xD;
             and Prevention (CDC).&#xD;
