  <brief_summary>

      1. To characterize the microstructure (fracture toughness, particle size of ceramic, and&#xD;
           inter-particle spacing) of three ceramic materials&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the hypothesis that lower fracture toughness of glass and/or crystal phase in&#xD;
           ceramics reduce wear damage of enamel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test the hypothesis that smaller sized crystals reduce wear damage of enamel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To test the hypothesis that larger inter-particle spacing reduces wear damage of enamel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To test the hypothesis that equivalent wear patterns exist in all directions between&#xD;
           enamel versus enamel and ceramic versus enamel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To test the hypothesis that bite force does not correlate with wear rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To test the hypothesis that salivary flow does not correlate with wear rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To test the hypothesis that a greater amount of wear is not associated with a loss in&#xD;
           vertical dimension of occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To test the hypothesis that a greater amount of wear does not correlate with secondary&#xD;
           cementum deposition as part of the passive eruption process.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. To test the hypothesis that maximum wear occurs early and wear rates level off within&#xD;
           the first two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. To test the hypothesis that in vitro wear analysis does not correlate with in vivo wear&#xD;
           measurements&#xD;

      A total of 36 teeth (1 crown per patient) needing crowns will be selected with the following&#xD;
      acceptance criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects must be over 18 years of age with good overall health. No contraindications to&#xD;
           dental treatment must be present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects must have overall good dental health with no active tooth decay (caries)&#xD;
           present and no periodontal disease. Pocket depth on all remaining teeth must not be more&#xD;
           than 4 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects must have no existing temporomandibular disorder, (e.g. clicking, popping, pain&#xD;
           on opening) or parafunctional habits (e.g. bruxism, clenching)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subjects must need a crown on either a second premolar, first molar or second molar on&#xD;
           any arch. Abutment teeth must be restorable and have a crown root ratio of at least 1:1.&#xD;
           Abutment teeth must have a complement of opposing non-restored or minimally restored&#xD;
           natural teeth. Minimally restored means nothing beyond a Class II amalgam restoration.&#xD;
           Opposing arch cannot be a full coverage restoration or a partial denture. Contralateral&#xD;
           tooth must be preferably present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subjects must exhibit good oral hygiene and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Subjects must not have any existing condition that could limit the flow of saliva; e.g.&#xD;
           saliva flow must be of normal quantity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data will be collected and will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General medical history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Primary casts taken with polyvinylsiloxane impression material&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bite force measurement in Newtons using a gnathodynamometer&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pocket depths of abutment teeth must be recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Periapical radiographs of abutment teeth. Radiographs will be taken at the exact&#xD;
           position with the use of the longitudinal radiographic analysis (LRA) technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Vertical dimension measured from the nasion to the lowest point on the chin&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A saliva sample will be collected to ascertain quality (viscosity) and quantity. The&#xD;
           parameters for analysis will be salivary pH, buffer capacity, secretion (ml/min),&#xD;
           protein (mg/ml), phosphate (mmol/l), Ca (mval/l), Na (mval/l), K (mval/l).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 36 teeth will be randomly assigned to receive either a metal-ceramic (D'Sign) or&#xD;
      an all-ceramic crown (IPS Empress2, Eris EXC). Randomization will be done through a random&#xD;
      number table. Teeth will be prepared by two operators: Dr. Josephine Esquivel-Upshaw and Dr.&#xD;
      William Rose both from the General Dentistry department. Provisional restorations will be&#xD;
      made from Integrity (Dentsply, USA) and final impressions will be made with a&#xD;
      polyvinylsiloxane material using the two-stage technique. Master casts will be mounted in&#xD;
      centric relation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single unit crown will be made from either two types of an all-ceramic material or a&#xD;
      metal-ceramic material and cemented with a dual cure resin cement. Adjustments will be made&#xD;
      with a high-speed handpiece and a fine diamond bur. Prior to cementation, all adjusted&#xD;
      surfaces must be polished or glazed. Occlusal surface thickness of the crowns will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline examination will be performed one week after cementation to ensure that the patient&#xD;
      is comfortable with the crown and no further adjustments are needed. A polyvinylsiloxane&#xD;
      impression will be made of the maxillary and mandibular arches to record the cemented crown&#xD;
      and its antagonist arch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-cementation casts will be poured with a Type IV gypsum product to enable proper&#xD;
      scanning. A 3D Laserscanner will be used to scan in the x, y and z planes of tooth/teeth&#xD;
      casts made from natural teeth. The vertical dimension will be recorded as well as periapical&#xD;
      radiographs taken of the abutment teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be asked to return after six months of cementation. Polyvinylsiloxane&#xD;
      impressions will once again be made of maxillary and mandibular arches and poured with Type&#xD;
      IV stone. The antagonist teeth and the crown will be scanned using the 3D Laserscanner.&#xD;
      Superimposition of baseline image and the six-month image will be performed and the amount of&#xD;
      wear in three dimensions calculated mathematically. Vertical dimension of occlusion will also&#xD;
      be determined by measurement of nasion to the lowest point on the chin and periapical&#xD;
      radiographs taken of the restored teeth using the LRA technique. This procedure will be&#xD;
      repeated every year for the next four years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of wear in microns will be determined for the x, y and z axes. Data will be&#xD;
      subjected to a one-way ANOVA (Î± = 0.05 ) to determine any significant difference in wear of&#xD;
      natural antagonist teeth and the ceramic crowns between baseline and yearly 3D images and&#xD;
      also differences in wear between the yearly 3D images. Occlusal thickness of restorations&#xD;
      will be determined based on the amount of wear calculated. Any presence of cracks or&#xD;
      fractures will be recorded. Correlation of the amount of wear and any changes in vertical&#xD;
      dimension and root cementum length will also be determined by comparison of nasion-chin&#xD;
      height at different intervals.&#xD;
