    <textblock>
      This study will examine if depression in a primary caregiver is associated with more&#xD;
      hospitalization or ER visits in children with asthma. This study will also explore whether&#xD;
      treatment for depression in the primary caregivers is associated with improvement in asthma&#xD;
      in school-aged children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is a very common childhood disorder of airway inflammation. The causes include&#xD;
      environmental irritants, cold temperature, and infection in the respiratory tract, and&#xD;
      emotional factors can contribute to symptom exacerbation. However, asthma is a disease that&#xD;
      can be well controlled if there is proper medication compliance and careful control of&#xD;
      environmental conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data suggests that psychiatric symptoms in the mothers of children with asthma are associated&#xD;
      with more asthma related hospitalizations in children. Thus, we want to explore this question&#xD;
      further using more specific diagnostic instruments in order to detect what types of symptoms&#xD;
      are associated with increased asthma related service utilization. Also, we want to explore if&#xD;
      effective treatment of the caregivers' symptoms is associated with decreased hospitalization&#xD;
      and emergency room visits for the child.&#xD;
