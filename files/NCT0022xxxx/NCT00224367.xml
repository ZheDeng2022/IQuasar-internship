  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fractures are a significant problem for healthcare providers due to the increasing&#xD;
      incidence of fractures in an ageing population. Hip fracture is the most frequent fracture&#xD;
      for people over 80 years of age and the second most frequent for those over 65 years. It is&#xD;
      projected that by 2051, 23% of the Australian population will be older than 65 and the number&#xD;
      of hip fractures will rise fourfold (17,000 in 2004, to 60,000 in 2051).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding management of hip fracture were&#xD;
      published in the Medical Journal of Australia in 1999 and updated in 2003. Seventeen aspects&#xD;
      of treatment were systematically reviewed, including mobilisation after surgery. Early&#xD;
      assisted ambulation within 48 hours post surgery was recommended (Chilov 2003 p 490).&#xD;
      However, the recommendation was based on observational (level 3) evidence only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early mobilization post surgery is resource intensive. Early mobilization is challenging and&#xD;
      uncomfortable for the patient and requires the assistance of one or sometimes two,&#xD;
      physiotherapists available seven days per week. Benefits must be rigorously evaluated to&#xD;
      justify recommendation. We undertook a randomized controlled trial of the effect of two&#xD;
      different 'time to first ambulation' intervals after hip fracture surgery on patient and&#xD;
      hospital outcomes.Our hypothesis was that early mobilisation would accelerate functional&#xD;
      recovery after hip fracture surgery.&#xD;

      Methods Inclusions: Consecutive patients admitted via the emergency department to The Alfred&#xD;
      hospital Melbourne, for surgical fixation of an acute fracture of the hip (by a compression&#xD;
      screw and plate or a hemiarthroplasty).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusions:fracture was pathological, postoperative orders were for non-weight bearing on the&#xD;
      operated hip, the patient was admitted from a nursing home or the patient was non-ambulant&#xD;
      pre-morbidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty eligible patients were randomly allocated, using a computer generated program, into one&#xD;
      of two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management All patients received routine, standard post-operative medical and nursing&#xD;
      clinical care, as currently practiced at The Alfred. All patients were transferred to sit out&#xD;
      of bed as early as possible after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambulation The physiotherapy ambulation re-education program was implemented once per day&#xD;
      over 7 days for all participants. The time to first walk differed between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection On admission: gender, age, preoperative mobility, social supports, mental&#xD;
      ability and medical comorbidity,pre-existing medical comorbidity (cardiac, respiratory,&#xD;
      neurological, diabetes) and mental ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional data from each patients medical record including: type of surgical fixation&#xD;
      (nail/screw and plate, hemi-arthroplasty), wait time to surgery, time surgery completed, and&#xD;
      time to first sit out of bed and time to first walk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures The primary outcome measure was the patient's functional level, represented&#xD;
      by the distance they walked and the level of assistance required to transfer from supine to&#xD;
      sit and sit to stand and to negotiate one step, on day-7 post surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures included discharge destination and length of stay in the acute&#xD;
      care (days from admission to discharge from The Alfred).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 8.2. (SAS Institute&#xD;
      Inc.,Carv, NC, USA). Continuous variables were compared using student t-tests and validated&#xD;
      using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square tests for&#xD;
      equal proportion. A two-sided p-value of 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size A difference between groups equivalent to one standard deviation was perceived to&#xD;
      be of clinical importance. With 30 subjects per group, this study had a 97% power to detect a&#xD;
      difference equal to one standard deviation with a two-sided p-value of 0.05. A minimum of 16&#xD;
      subjects per subgroup was required for this study to have an 80% power to detect a difference&#xD;
      equal to one standard deviation with a two-sided p-value of 0.05.&#xD;
