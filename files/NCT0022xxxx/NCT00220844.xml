  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of two tricyclic antidepressant agents&#xD;
      (TCAs), amitriptyline and desipramine, on gastric emptying and gastric accommodation using a&#xD;
      newly developed scintigraphic test that simultaneously measures both gastric emptying and&#xD;
      gastric volume (accommodation). These two tricyclic antidepressant agents are commonly used&#xD;
      at low doses to treat patients with refractory functional dyspepsia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The normal control subjects will be randomized to receive either amitriptyline or desipramine&#xD;
      as the tricyclic antidepressant agent, with 30 subjects per group. Subjects will undergo two&#xD;
      outpatient gastric emptying/volume tests and two satiety tests; one of each after 7 days of&#xD;
      treatment with oral consumption of the study agent and the other one of each after 7 days of&#xD;
      treatment with placebo. The order of the treatments (active drug or placebo) will be&#xD;
      randomized with 7 days washout between the studies. During the study, the subjects will&#xD;
      consume their regular diet. Subjects will also be randomized to receive either amitriptyline&#xD;
      25 mg po qhs as the active drug or desipramine 25 mg po qhs as the active drug. Side effects&#xD;
      of the agents will be monitored during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will undergo a brief history and physical exam prior to entering the study. The&#xD;
      subject will have height and weight measured. A questionnaire will be administered to the&#xD;
      subject inquiring about gastrointestinal symptoms and medical history. This is to screen for&#xD;
      a history of underlying pulmonary, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal disease. Females will&#xD;
      be studied only during the follicular phase (days 1-10) of the menstrual cycle, to minimize&#xD;
      the effect of the menstrual cycle on motility (Wald, at al). In addition, females will be&#xD;
      given pregnancy screening with a urine beta-human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test&#xD;
      (Sure-Vue; Fisher Scientific, Inc) prior to the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the simultaneous gastric volume/emptying tests, subjects will be studied in the fasting&#xD;
      condition. The study subject history and physical examination form will be filled out which&#xD;
      captures information on symptoms for the last week. An intravenous line will be started. The&#xD;
      subject will take study medication with a small sip of water. After 10 minutes, 10 mCi 99mTc&#xD;
      pertechnetate will be infused intravenously over 30 seconds. Imaging of the stomach will be&#xD;
      performed with a gamma camera 20 minutes after injection with both anterior and posterior&#xD;
      imaging followed by SPECT imaging using the General Electric Dual Head MAXXUS (General&#xD;
      Electric Medical Systems) connected to a General Electric Starcam 4000i computer. A total of&#xD;
      360o rotation around the subject will be obtained using a circular orbit (32 stops at 15 sec&#xD;
      per stop) with the heads for the camera close to the subject. After this, the patient will&#xD;
      ingest an egg sandwich labeled with 300 ÂµCi 111Indium-oxine cooked into the eggs to label the&#xD;
      solid material. The subject will consume 300 ml of unlabelled water. Imaging will then&#xD;
      commence immediately after meal ingestion (time 0) for 111In counts to assess solid-phase&#xD;
      gastric emptying using both anterior and posterior imaging. This will be followed immediately&#xD;
      by imaging for the 99mTc counts to assess gastric volumes. Imaging for 99mTc will be&#xD;
      performed with SPECT 3-D imaging. These will be repeated at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150,&#xD;
      180, 210, and 240 minutes after the meal ingestion. Our prior studies show that 4 hour&#xD;
      gastric emptying best characterizes gastric emptying. Peak gastric accommodation occurs at&#xD;
      0-40 minutes. At the time of each imaging, symptoms will be monitored. Symptoms of abdominal&#xD;
      fullness, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and bloating will be graded by the study subject from&#xD;
      0 (none) to 5 (severe). In addition, an inquiry into possible side effects to TCAs (sedation,&#xD;
      confusion, disturbed concentration, dry mouth, constipation, nausea, and urinary retention)&#xD;
      will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the next day, the subject will return in a fasting condition for the satiety test. The&#xD;
      methods are similar to those of Tack et al and Chial et al. The subject will take their study&#xD;
      medication. After 30 minutes, the subject will drink the nutrient drink Ensure at a rate of&#xD;
      100 ml every 5 minutes until the subject feels completely full. After each 100 ml, symptoms&#xD;
      will be monitored, scoring the symptoms of satiety (fullness), nausea, abdominal discomfort,&#xD;
      and bloating on a scale of (0-5). The volume of Ensure consumed by the subject will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
