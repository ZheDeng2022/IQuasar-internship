  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Specific Aim of this project is to compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      continuous oral contraceptives versus leuprolide/norethindrone in the treatment of&#xD;
      endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain. This comparison will be based on a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, trial of women with chronic pelvic pain who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      endometriosis at the time of surgery within the last 3 years. We hypothesize that, over a&#xD;
      12-month period of postoperative treatment, the efficacy of oral contraceptives is no worse&#xD;
      than leuprolide/norethindrone, and that treatment with oral contraceptives is more&#xD;
      cost-effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Background-Laparoscopic surgical treatment for endometriosis is typically associated&#xD;
           with a decrease of pain on a short-term basis, but 50% of patients have pain 12 months&#xD;
           after surgery. Often this leads to having repeat surgery to treat the endometriosis.&#xD;
           Instead of having repeat surgery, some physicians use medications to prevent the pain&#xD;
           and endometriosis from returning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The purpose of this study is to compare continuous oral contraceptives to&#xD;
           depot-leuprolide for control of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain after surgical&#xD;
           treatment of endometriosis. We will also be looking at the potential cost savings of&#xD;
           using oral contraceptives compared to depot-leuprolide, as depot-leuprolide is an&#xD;
           expensive medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the patient meets criteria, including confirmation of diagnosis of endometriosis, she&#xD;
           will then undergo an intake visit consisting of obtaining informed consent and&#xD;
           completion of several baseline questionnaires. This intake visit is estimated to last&#xD;
           1-2 hours. After informed consent has been obtained, the subject will be randomized to&#xD;
           one of the two treatment groups:One tablet of oral contraceptives (birth control pills)&#xD;
           everyday and an injection of saline (a sterile salt solution with no medication effect)&#xD;
           every 12 weeks for 48 weeks or One tablet of norethindrone everyday and an injection of&#xD;
           depot-leuprolide every 12 weeks for 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be seen one month after the first injection (Visit 1) and then at 12&#xD;
           (Visit 2), 24 (Visit 3), 36 (Visit 4) and 48 (Visit 5) weeks. Blood pressure and weight&#xD;
           will be recorded and a urine pregnancy test will be obtained. The Study Coordinator will&#xD;
           review with the patient any concerns she might have and record any adverse events.&#xD;
           Assessments of pain and quality of life will be made at weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 after&#xD;
           the intake visit. An injection (leuprolide acetate or saline plus inert powder) will be&#xD;
           given by an unblinded nurse at the intake visit, and at weeks 12, 24, and 36. In&#xD;
           addition, at the end of each medication visit, the patient will be given a three month's&#xD;
           supply of oral medication (capsules containing norethindrone acetate or a generic oral&#xD;
           contraceptive with 30ug ethinyl estradiol and 0.15mg levonorgestrel).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than 18 and pre-menopausal.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of endometriosis by laparoscopy or laparotomy within three years of entry.&#xD;
             The diagnosis of endometriosis will require either histology consistent with&#xD;
             endometriosis or operative records indicating visual evidence of lesions consistent&#xD;
             with endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate to severe pelvic pain preoperatively attributable to endometriosis (average&#xD;
             Numerical Rating Scale of 5 or more for three or more months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to comply with visit schedule and protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

             3-month injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any disorder that represents a contraindication to the use of oral contraceptives&#xD;
             (e.g. insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, history of thrombophlebitis, hypertension,&#xD;
             history of cardiovascular disease, smoker at 35 or more years of age) or GnRH analogs&#xD;
             (e.g., history of osteopenia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophorectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive pregnancy test at first postoperative (i.e, intake visit).&#xD;
