  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to find out whether taking regular inhaled steroids (eg&#xD;
      Pulmicort, Flixotide, Becotide, Becloforte) is good for the lungs of children and adults with&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis (CF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients are put on inhaled steroids because they are wheezy despite taking regular&#xD;
      bronchodilators (inhaled medicines that help open up the airways eg Ventolin, Bricanyl).&#xD;
      Occasionally young children are put on them when they wheeze with colds, and have simply&#xD;
      remained on them ever since. However many CF patients have been put onto inhaled steroids&#xD;
      because their doctors thought it might reduce the inflammation in the lungs and help improve&#xD;
      lung function. This inflammation (which is swelling of the lining of the airways) is known to&#xD;
      be important in CF and results from recurrent chest infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is believed, in theory, that inhaled steroids should be useful for most CF&#xD;
      patients, we are not sure how well they work in CF and it has not yet been possible to prove&#xD;
      this with standard studies. This would normally involve starting inhaled steroids in patients&#xD;
      who have not been taking them. We have therefore taken a different approach, namely to&#xD;
      withdraw them from some patients who have been on them for a long time, to see if there is&#xD;
      any effect of stopping them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important that we answer this question, as we do not want CF patients taking medicines&#xD;
      that may be unnecessary. CF patients already have to take many oral and inhaled medicines and&#xD;
      if we can cut down this burden, it would be helpful for everyone. Of course, we may find that&#xD;
      patients do need these medicines but at least we will then be certain that it is for a good&#xD;
      reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that withdrawing inhaled steroids is not associated with an earlier&#xD;
      onset of acute chest exacerbations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Long term, and often high dose, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are being&#xD;
      increasingly prescribed to patients with CF to combat lung inflammation. Despite five&#xD;
      published studies, a Cochrane systematic review has concluded that there is not enough&#xD;
      evidence of either benefit or harm. The number of CF patients already taking ICS in the UK&#xD;
      means recruitment into conventional studies has proved difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: to test the feasibility and safety of withdrawal of ICS in CF by performing a study of&#xD;
      randomised placebo-controlled withdrawal of ICS in children and adults already taking them.&#xD;
      The results will be used to determine the feasibility of a future prospective study to prove&#xD;
      whether starting ICS in CF patients not already on them, and those successfully withdrawn,&#xD;
      leads to benefit (in lung function and chest exacerbations) and/or harm, compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We will study 240 children and adults in 12 centres. We have matching placebo and&#xD;
      Flixotide metered dose inhalers to be used through a Volumatic, so any subjects currently on&#xD;
      Pulmicort or Becotide will switch to Flixotide 2 months during the run-in phase, and all&#xD;
      subjects will use their ICS through a spacer device. Patients will be randomised to continue&#xD;
      on ICS or take placebo for 6 months, in a double-blind fashion. Primary outcome is time to&#xD;
      1st exacerbation; secondary ones are decline in lung function, new courses of antibiotics and&#xD;
      rescue bronchodilator usage.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        .Diagnosis of CF (positive sweat test or DNA analysis). .Age over 6.0 years (no upper&#xD;
        limit). .FEV1 &gt; 40% predicted for gender, height and age. .Already taking ICS for at least&#xD;
        3 months. .Patients who are able to perform spirometry and can correctly use their&#xD;
        prescribed inhaler.&#xD;
&#xD;
        .Patients whose parents or legal guardians are willing to give written informed consent for&#xD;

             (ABPA), currently or within the previous month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cases in which the clinician feels unhappy about stopping ICS due to severe lung&#xD;
             disease or concomitant &quot;asthma&quot; (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Course of intravenous antibiotics (IVABs) within last month.&#xD;

             corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 2000mcg/d fluticasone for 17 years or over&#xD;

             investigators precludes their entry into the study.&#xD;
