  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a serious medical illness that can recur more than once in a person's lifetime.&#xD;
      Effective treatment methods are needed to maintain a state of remission in people who have&#xD;
      had prior episodes of depression. IPT is a brief and highly structured type of psychotherapy&#xD;
      that addresses interpersonal issues associated with depression. Previous studies have shown&#xD;
      that it is an effective method for treating depression. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of maintenance ITP in preventing relapse of depression in women who have&#xD;
      required combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy treatment to obtain remission of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this open label study will be recruited from a previous study, &quot;Maintenance&#xD;
      Psychotherapy in Recurrent Depression: Study I.&quot; In this study participants will initially&#xD;
      receive weekly sessions of IPT as well as medication treatment with fluoxetine. Any&#xD;
      participants who do not reach remission of depressive symptoms after 6 weeks will be given&#xD;
      other standard treatments for depression. Once remission of depressive symptoms is reached,&#xD;
      participants will continue receiving weekly IPT and fluoxetine treatment for 20 weeks. After&#xD;
      20 weeks, fluoxetine treatment will be discontinued, and all participants will receive IPT&#xD;
      alone for 6 weeks before entering the maintenance phase of the study. Upon entrance into this&#xD;
      phase, participants will be randomly assigned to receive IPT weekly, biweekly, or monthly for&#xD;
      18 months. Functioning and depressive symptoms will be assessed at Month 24.&#xD;
