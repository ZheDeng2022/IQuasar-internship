      We evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of duloxetine in the treatment of major depressive&#xD;
      episodes during the course of psychotic disorders&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive episodes (MDE) frequently occur during the course of schizophrenic&#xD;
      psychoses, both as as &quot;post-psychotic&quot; depressions, and also independently from psychotic&#xD;
      episodes. A number of clinical studies reported the application of different antidepressive&#xD;
      substances, such as Imipramine, Reboxetine or Venlafaxine. In general, the treatment of&#xD;
      schizophrenic patients with antidepressive drugs can be considered as necessary and save,&#xD;
      resulting in therapeutic guidelines of different psychiatric societies. However, since 5 to&#xD;
      10 % of the schizophrenic patients commit suicide, there is still much effort necessary in&#xD;
      order to improve the treatment of affective symptoms in schizophrenic psychoses.The recently&#xD;
      introduced antidepressive substance Duloxetine selectively inhibits as a SSNRI the reuptake&#xD;
      of serotonine and noradrenaline from the synaptic cleft. Duloxetine was proven as&#xD;
      antidepressive, anxiolytic and analgetic in a series of multi-centre, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      investigations. Based on these considerations and on successful experiences in single case&#xD;
      reports we aim to investigate the therapeutic effects of duloxetine in patients with lifetime&#xD;
      diagnoses of the schizophrenic spectrum.&#xD;
