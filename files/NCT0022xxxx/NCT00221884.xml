  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients undergoing surgery on their hand receive a form of anesthetic called &quot;axillary&#xD;
      brachial plexus block&quot;. This involves the injection of local anesthetic (freezing medication)&#xD;
      around the nerves that supply the upper limb, which are located in the arm pit. The technique&#xD;
      currently used by physicians performing this procedure is far from perfect, and in up to 1 of&#xD;
      every 5 patients it does not work well enough to allow surgery, and a different form of&#xD;
      anesthetic may need to be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an attempt to improve these results, we have recently developed a new technique, using&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging to &quot;see&quot; the nerves prior to giving the injection. Our initial results are&#xD;
      very promising, implying that this may be a highly successful and safe approach. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to determine if this technique is indeed more successful. In order to do&#xD;
      that, we will ask 110 patients for their participation. They will be divided in two groups,&#xD;
      at random. One group will receive the standard technique (transarterial, using a small needle&#xD;
      to find the artery that is close to the nerves). The other group will receive the injection&#xD;
      after identifying the nerves with ultrasound imaging. They will all receive the same type of&#xD;
      medication, and they will be tested every 5 minutes for half an hour to determine if the&#xD;
      block has been successful, according to pre-established criteria. Their pain control will be&#xD;
      assessed after the surgery and they will be called 24 hours and 1 week after the surgery to&#xD;
      assess their recovery and rule out any possible complications.&#xD;

      Ultrasonography has been used successfully to define the anatomy of the brachial plexus in&#xD;
      the interscalene, supraclavicular and axillary regions. This is a widely available&#xD;
      technology, it is non-invasive, portable, less expensive than other imaging modalities and&#xD;
      allows for real time imaging simultaneously with the block procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some recent case reports and small case series describing the use of ultrasound to&#xD;
      image the brachial plexus and to guide brachial plexus blockade 16,17,18. We have used&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging to succesfully identify the brachial plexus and guide needle localization&#xD;
      and nerve stimulation in 15 volunteers 19. In these healthy volunteers, we were able to&#xD;
      identify the brachial plexus in every subject, at four different anatomical levels :&#xD;
      interscalene, supraclavicular, axillary and mid-humeral (see figures). Needle localization&#xD;
      and nerve stimulation were also successful in every case. Moreover, preliminary data from an&#xD;
      ongoing series at our institution, shows that when ultrasound guidance is used,&#xD;
      supraclavicular brachial plexus block can be performed with a high success rate (97%)20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, whether ultrasound guidance truly improves success rates when compared to more&#xD;
      traditional techniques is still unknown. There has been no randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      published to date addressing this question.&#xD;
