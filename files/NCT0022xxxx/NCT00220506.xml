      Multiple sclerosis and fatigue Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS), occurring in 30%-80% of patients and for many of them fatigue is the most&#xD;
      disabling symptom (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of fatigue according to the MS Council for Clinical Practice Guidelines is as&#xD;
      follows: &quot;A subjective lack of physical and/or mental energy that is perceived by the&#xD;
      individual or caregiver to interfere with usual and desired activities&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As fatigue is a subjective and non-specific symptom, and can easily be confused with either&#xD;
      weakness or depressed mood, both common in MS, the following characteristics have been&#xD;
      defined to better diagnose MS-associated fatigue:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MS-related fatigue generally occurs on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It tends to worsen as the day progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It tends to be aggravated by heat and humidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is not directly correlated with either depression or the degree of physical&#xD;
           impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It may occur first thing in the morning even if the patient has had a restful full&#xD;
           night's sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current medications used for the treatment of MS-associated fatigue such as amantadine&#xD;
      hydrochloride and pemoline are useful to some, but not all patients. In a multicenter trial&#xD;
      (2) it was found that 100 mg amantadine twice daily significantly improves fatigue. Pemoline&#xD;
      in a placebo-controlled trial (3) failed to show significant effect on fatigue in MS patients&#xD;
      and was poorly tolerated as side effects occurred in 25% of patients. A third trial (4)&#xD;
      compared pemoline to amantadine and placebo, and showed only a positive trend for pemoline,&#xD;
      while amantadine had a benefit over placebo in some fatigue measures. There was also a marked&#xD;
      placebo effect in this trial, with approximately half of patients reporting improvement in&#xD;
      fatigue no matter what treatment (pemoline, amantadine or placebo) they were taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study proposal we intend to evaluate the effect of Provigil on MS-associated&#xD;
      fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possibility for add-on drug that will affect fatigue in MS is of importance, as fatigue&#xD;
      has a significant impact on activities of daily living, interfering with work, family life&#xD;
      and social activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. The fatigue scale named &quot;Fatigue Impact Scale&quot; The awareness of the impact of fatigue on&#xD;
      patient's quality of life (QOL) and the need to evaluate the effect of the different&#xD;
      therapies on this parameter resulted in the development and validation of different&#xD;
      questionnaires for the measurement of fatigue, i.e., the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), which&#xD;
      has been shown to measure both, fatigue and treatment effect on fatigue (6-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FIS is a reliable and validated 40-items questionnaire that is capable of selecting a&#xD;
      treatment effect. It is a made up of 3 sub-scales: physical, cognitive and social. Each&#xD;
      question is scored from 0-4, allowing a total score of 160. High scores indicate high&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
