  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the level of sulfur amino acids in the diet that is&#xD;
      needed to maintaining glutathione antioxidant status. This information could prove very&#xD;
      useful in medicine because it could allow identification of an optimal diet for control of&#xD;
      antioxidant levels. This diet could be used in conjunction with other therapies in order to&#xD;
      prevent or delay oxidative stress and any diseases that may result from this. Total study&#xD;
      participation will include a screening visit and a 14-day study period where dietary intake&#xD;
      of sulfur amino acids will be controlled. We aim to enroll 12 normal subjects at Emory&#xD;
      University Hospital.The primary hypothesis is that steady-state GSH/GSSG and CYS/CYSS redox&#xD;
      in human plasma will become oxidized due to SAA intake at 0% of the RDA and reduced due to&#xD;
      SAA intake at 3X the RDA.&#xD;

      The long-term objectives of this research are to improve the definition of optimal human SAA&#xD;
      intake. This will include defining Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI), estimated average&#xD;
      requirement (EAR), and the upper limit (UL) of intake by improving the understanding of the&#xD;
      physiologic and pathologic responses to variatiation in SAA intake. Using high-resolution&#xD;
      1H-NMR, we plan on developing comprehensive metabolic profiles that can indicate when SAA&#xD;
      intake is inadequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the current protocol are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether steady-state GSH/GSSG or Cys/CySS redox in human plasma is oxidized&#xD;
           due to sulfur amino acid intake at 0% of the RDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether steady-state GSH/GSSG or Cys/CySS becomes more reducing during&#xD;
           dietary sulfur amino acid repletion with SAA at 3X the RDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether low or high sulfur amino acid intakes induce primary and secondary&#xD;
           metabolic effects detectable by high-resolution 1H-NMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sulfur amino acids are involved in central metabolic processes. The biologically useful&#xD;
      sulfur is derived almost exclusively from the amino acids methionine and cysteine. Methionine&#xD;
      (Met) is an essential amino acid and is metabolized in individuals by the transulfuration&#xD;
      pathway to form cysteine (Cys) (1). In addition to use in the primary sequence of most&#xD;
      proteins, both Met and Cys are required for other metabolic functions. Met is converted to&#xD;
      S-adenosylmethionine, which is used for methylation reactions (2) for structural and&#xD;
      functional modifications of proteins, RNA and DNA, as well as synthesis of phospholipids and&#xD;
      signaling molecules. The carbon skeleton of Met is also used for biosynthesis of polyamines,&#xD;
      which are required for cell division and cell growth (3). Cysteine is used for biosynthesis&#xD;
      of glutathione (GSH), coenzyme A, taurine and sulfate (4). GSH functions in redox regulation&#xD;
      (5) and detoxification of oxidants and reactive electrophiles (6). Coenzyme A is central to&#xD;
      fatty acid metabolism and the citric acid cycle; taurine is utilized for bile acid synthesis&#xD;
      and osmotic regulation (7); sulfate is used as a structural component of oligosaccharides&#xD;
      (8), transport of steroid hormones (9) and detoxification of foreign compounds (10). Thus,&#xD;
      there is a requirement for adequate sulfur amino acid intake that extends beyond the need for&#xD;
      adequate amounts to maintain normal protein synthesis and turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sulfur amino acid intake in humans is variable and optimal SAA intake has not been adequately&#xD;
      defined. The average American diet contains about 100 g of protein daily (4); the mean SAA&#xD;
      intake is about 2.4 g (11). Daily intakes range from &lt; 0.3 g to &gt; 5 g (11). Most of the SAA&#xD;
      is derived from animal protein, which constitutes about 2/3 of the total protein intake. The&#xD;
      content of SAA in legumes and some types of nuts is about half of that in animal protein&#xD;
      while most other plant-derived foods contain only 10-20% of the SAA found in an equivalent&#xD;
      amount of animal protein. Because plant-derived foods are low in total protein, individuals&#xD;
      who do not consume animal protein are at risk of SAA deficiency. Conversely, if excess SAA&#xD;
      has associated health risks due to H2S or other toxic metabolites generated by colonic flora,&#xD;
      individuals consuming diets high in animal protein would be at risk (12). Hence, Dietary&#xD;
      Reference Intake values for SAA are needed as a foundation for improved dietary guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in quantity and timing of SAA intake can result in substantial effects on Met,&#xD;
      Cys and GSH homeostasis. Animal studies show that there is a diurnal variation in hepatic GSH&#xD;
      in which the level increases following consumption of foods high in Cys and decreases in the&#xD;
      post-absorptive period (16-17). The total amount of Cys present in GSH in the human body is&#xD;
      about 3 g, roughly equal to the SAA requirement for 3 d (13) so that the Cys&#xD;
      supply/utilization pattern can be considered in 4 phases. In the first phase, systemic Cys&#xD;
      supply is from dietary Cys and metabolism of dietary Met. During this phase, excess Cys&#xD;
      signals enhanced catabolism (18). Under post-absorptive conditions, probably for a period of&#xD;
      about a day, systemic supply of Cys occurs principally from hepatic release of GSH (14).&#xD;
      Under these conditions, Cys metabolism continues to support biosynthetic needs for taurine&#xD;
      and sulfate. Although not explicitly established for humans, diurnal variation in hepatic GSH&#xD;
      in mice ceases after 24 h of fasting so that systemic Cys supply probably enters a third&#xD;
      phase after about 24 h. In this phase, an increased fraction of total systemic supply is&#xD;
      likely to be derived from non-hepatic tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle; 15). Because sulfate&#xD;
      and taurine production normally occurs in the intestines and liver (19), a decline in&#xD;
      utilization of Cys for these functions is expected during this phase. A fourth phase appears&#xD;
      likely to occur after about 3 days in which conservation of Met and Cys would be maximal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, detoxification of foreign compounds by conjugation with GSH, sulfate or taurine&#xD;
      requires utilization of Cys. Such use can impose a substantial SAA demand; for instance,&#xD;
      metabolism of 4 doses of maximum strength acetaminophen, i.e., 4 g daily, will consume the&#xD;
      equivalent of up to 250 mg Cys for GSH conjugation and 640 mg Cys for sulfate conjugation&#xD;
      (13). This amount is very similar to the RDA for SAA. Thus, the combination of dietary and&#xD;
      environmental factors affecting SAA homeostasis and the complex metabolic effects that can&#xD;
      result from variation in SAA homeostasis emphasize the need for better means to evaluate&#xD;
      adequacy of SAA nutrition. This need is present for otherwise healthy individuals and is&#xD;
      accentuated in acute or chronic illness and during convalescence and metabolic/nutritional&#xD;
      stabilization during recovery from illness. The lower intake level was selected because it is&#xD;
      similar to the lower intake levels estimated from food frequency analysis (11). This level&#xD;
      could occur with a vegetarian diet with a poor selection of foods, but would not be as&#xD;
      extreme as found with prolonged fasting or starvation. The upper SAA intake level was&#xD;
      selected because 3X RDA is about 20% above the average intake of SAA in this country, thus&#xD;
      representing a somewhat high but otherwise normal SAA intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High resolution 1H-NMR and mass spectrometry provides an approach to investigate complex&#xD;
      metabolic effects of diet. Traditional methods to investigate dietary and nutritional&#xD;
      components have relied upon isolation and purification of substances with specific biologic&#xD;
      activities. However, the very large number of compounds in the diet, the multiple effects of&#xD;
      individual compounds, the metabolic changes in the compounds that occur after consumption and&#xD;
      the complex interactions of the compounds limit the ability to unravel complex effects such&#xD;
      as those due to variation in SAA intake during health, illness and recovery from illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available high resolution metabolic analysis (21) such as 1H-NMR and mass spectrometry (MS)&#xD;
      combined with bioinformatic tools provides a way to identify and establish a pattern of&#xD;
      metabolic changes attributed to SAA deficiency and excess. We believe that if the environment&#xD;
      is controlled and a dietary change (e.g. different level of SAA intake) is induced in an&#xD;
      individual, observed metabolic changes can be ascribed to the dietary change. High resolution&#xD;
      1H-NMR and MS are well suited for investigating changes in body fluid composition because a&#xD;
      large number of metabolites are present in body fluids, many metabolites can be detected&#xD;
      simultaneously and these metabolites can be analyzed and quantified with minimal or no sample&#xD;
      preparation. Examples are available from the studies of Nicholson and coworkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of multivariate statistical analysis of NMR data to evaluate metabolic responses of&#xD;
      living systems is under development for toxicologic screening of pharmacologic compounds&#xD;
      (24). The principles for detection of diet-related effects on health are the same as for the&#xD;
      toxicologic use; in effect, nutritional deficiencies, excesses or intolerances can be viewed&#xD;
      as toxicologic responses that are expressed in the metabolic profile. Thus, we believe that&#xD;
      the information-rich character of the NMR spectra with MS data can provide a powerful&#xD;
      approach to investigate both direct and indirect effects of nutritional variation in SAA&#xD;
      intake. Given the fundamental roles of SAA metabolites in cell growth regulation, digestion,&#xD;
      detoxification, antioxidant defense and hormonal signaling, and the potential risks of excess&#xD;
      SAA intake, metabolic profiling by NMR could provide a useful approach to define optimum SAA&#xD;
      intake and, in the future, to diagnose and treat SAA malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considerable information is available concerning the assignment of NMR spectra of urine and&#xD;
      plasma (e.g., Ref 22-24, 38-39); this information will provide a useful guide to possible&#xD;
      metabolites which could vary as a function of SAA intake. 2-D NMR and other techniques are&#xD;
      available for peak identification. However, the goals of this project do not require&#xD;
      identification of which chemical species change, only whether changes at specific frequencies&#xD;
      can be attributed to variation in SAA intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance. The sulfur amino acids, Met and Cys, are highly variable in human foods and&#xD;
      there are risks associated with both deficiency and excess. Both are required for physiologic&#xD;
      processes in addition to maintenance of protein synthesis and nitrogen balance, and, in&#xD;
      principle, excess of either could lead to generation of toxic sulfur metabolites in the&#xD;
      colon. The present study will test 2 novel approaches to define dietary sulfur amino acid&#xD;
      needs (i.e., plasma redox and metabolic analyses by NMR and MS). The results are expected to&#xD;
      establish the feasibility of using these approaches for improved definition of Dietary&#xD;
      Reference Intake values for these important nutrients.&#xD;
