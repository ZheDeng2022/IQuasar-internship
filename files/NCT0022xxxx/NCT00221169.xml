  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy is an important part of the treatment for lung cancer when treatment intent&#xD;
      is for cure. Radiation is a local modality of treatment, that is, it only treats the area&#xD;
      that the radiation can target. Therefore it is critical to be able to visualize all the areas&#xD;
      of tumor involvement. With current imaging tests such as computed tomography scans (CT), the&#xD;
      scans may not be sensitive enough to detect all areas of cancer involvement but with newer&#xD;
      imaging tests, such as positron emission tomography (PET), the investigators may be able to&#xD;
      better target all the tumor that the CT scan may miss. There are two clinical trials being&#xD;
      conducted by the Ontario Clinical Oncology Group (OCOG)looking at PET in lung cancer. This&#xD;
      proposal is a companion study to the OCOG PET lung trials. In brief, this study will evaluate&#xD;
      the ability of CT alone versus combined PET CT imaging to determine the size of the tumor (or&#xD;
      gross tumor volume) along with the tiny extensions of cancer cells (or microscopic&#xD;
      extension). The gross tumor volume and its extension as determined by CT or PET CT will then&#xD;
      be compared to measurements made on the surgically removed tumor. Treatment with radiation&#xD;
      therapy must include all the gross tumor and its extension in order to be successful for&#xD;
      cure. If the radiation treatment does not treat all the identified tumor then the chance for&#xD;
      cure is lost. There have only been two previous reports of the ability of CT to determine the&#xD;
      gross tumor volume and its extension. There are no similar reports using PET CT. This study&#xD;
      will be the first of its kind to evaluate how accurate PET CT can be in detecting the gross&#xD;
      tumor and its microscopic extension using the surgically removed tumor measurements as the&#xD;
      gold standard. If PET CT is able to more accurately determine the tumor volume including its&#xD;
      microscopic extension, then this will help oncologists to better treat lung cancer using more&#xD;
      accurate radiation treatment volumes.&#xD;

      Radiation therapy is an important component in the curative treatment of non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer. Targeting of the gross tumor has been facilitated by the use of CT simulation&#xD;
      allowing for more accurate delineation of the tumor. In addition multi-modality imaging&#xD;
      combining functional and anatomical information have allowed for further refinement in the&#xD;
      treatment planning process with significant impact on the planning target volume due to the&#xD;
      addition of PET imaging information. PET using 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) allows for more&#xD;
      precise detection of tumor since it is a functional image based on glucose metabolism rather&#xD;
      than structural abnormalities. Biochemical changes often precede any gross anatomical&#xD;
      abnormalities, therefore making PET a very powerful imaging modality. FDG PET has been shown&#xD;
      to be more sensitive and specific than CT in the staging of NSCLC.Radical radiation therapy&#xD;
      is indicated for early stage NSCLC when the patient is medically inoperable primarily due to&#xD;
      co-morbidities. In contrast for locally advanced NSCLC, radical radiation is used as part of&#xD;
      induction therapy or in the definitive treatment of NSCLC. In order to avoid a geographical&#xD;
      miss with precision radiation therapy, the gross tumor volume (GTV) is outlined and a margin&#xD;
      around the GTV is added to incorporate microscopic extension of disease, also known as the&#xD;
      clinical target volume (CTV). Standard margins of 1.0 to 1.5 cm are used to encompass the&#xD;
      gross tumor, microscopic extent and treatment setup uncertainties.There is surprisingly very&#xD;
      little data on what constitutes an adequate margin to encompass the microscopic extent around&#xD;
      the gross lung tumor. Studies involving conformal radiation therapy and dose escalation in&#xD;
      NSCLC have primarily used an empirical margin to define the CTV. A literature review revealed&#xD;
      only two studies evaluating the ability of CT to define the gross tumor and its microscopic&#xD;
      extension correlated with histopathological measurements [P Giraud et al 2000, R Chan et al&#xD;
      2001]. The two studies have produced conflicting results with recommended margins being from&#xD;
      zero mm to 6-8 mm around the GTV. There have been no studies evaluating the ability of PET to&#xD;
      define the size of the gross tumor and its microscopic extension.This is a companion study to&#xD;
      the two OCOG PET trials in NSCLC. It will evaluate the ability of CT alone versus PET CT to&#xD;
      define the gross tumor and its microscopic extension. The methodology will be based on&#xD;
      contouring the GTV with imaging modalities of CT and PET CT and correlating the findings with&#xD;
      histopathology.This proposed study will add new information on the ability of combined PET CT&#xD;
      to determine the microscopic extension of tumor in NSCLC. While no imaging modality can&#xD;
      detect microscopic extension, the newer technology of PET CT may give better resolution over&#xD;
      CT alone in the detection of tumor. The strength of this proposal is the required correlation&#xD;
      with pathological findings. If PET CT is able to accurately determine the extent of disease,&#xD;
      this will have major implications on treatment volumes and subsequent targeting for radiation&#xD;
      therapy using 3D conformal radiation therapy.&#xD;
