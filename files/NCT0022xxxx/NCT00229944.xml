  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholera remains an important cause of diarrhoeal illness and death in Asia, Africa and Latin&#xD;
      America. Antimicrobial therapy is an important adjunct to fluid therapy in the management of&#xD;
      patients with cholera, and should be given to all patients with clinically moderate-to-severe&#xD;
      disease since they can reduce the diarrhoea duration and stool volume by half. Current&#xD;
      therapy for cholera is limited by increasing prevalence of multiply-resistant strains of&#xD;
      Vibrio cholerae O1 or O139. Tetracycline and doxycycline had been the drugs of choice for&#xD;
      treating cholera, but multiply-resistant strains are now present in all areas where cholera&#xD;
      is endemic or epidemic. There is thus a need to identify alternative drugs that are effect in&#xD;
      treating this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azithromycin, a newer macrolide agent, is active in-vitro against V. cholerae, attains high&#xD;
      concentrations in the gut lumen, has a long half-life, and is better tolerated than&#xD;
      erythromycin, and older macrolide. In this study we will compare efficacy of a single, 1.0 g&#xD;
      oral doses of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin in male patients, aged 18-60 years, with cholera&#xD;
      due to V. cholerae O1 or O139. Patients with typical &quot;Rice watery&quot; stools of cholera, signs&#xD;
      of severe dehydration and characteristic cholera vibrios in a dark-field stool microscopy.&#xD;
      Patients who have coexisting illness which may confound assessment of the efficacy or safety&#xD;
      will not be eligible. Only those patients who have V. cholerae O1 or O139 isolated from their&#xD;
      pre-therapy stool and/or rectal swab culture and remains in the hospital for the entire&#xD;
      duration of the study will be eligible for efficacy evaluation. A written informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from each patients for their enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be hospitalized for full 5 days, and asked to return for a follow up evaluation&#xD;
      7 days after discharge. After initial rehydration, patients will be observed for 4 hours, and&#xD;
      only those with ³ 20 ml/kg of watery stools during this period will be enrolled for study.&#xD;
      Treatment will be random, and blinded to study staff and patients. Clinical success of&#xD;
      therapy will be defined as resolution of watery stool within 48 hours of administration of&#xD;
      the study drug, and bacteriologic success will be defined as the inability to isolate V.&#xD;
      cholerae O1 or O139 from fecal/rectal swab cultures of patients after 48 hours of therapy,&#xD;
      i.e. on day 3 and on all subsequent days of the study. Patients in whom therapy clinically&#xD;
      fails will be treated for 3 days with an effective alternate drug without opening the study&#xD;
      code. Ninety one evaluable patients will be required in each group to show with a power of&#xD;
      80% and a type I error of 5% that the two treatment regimens are equivalent (i.e. the 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval for the difference in efficacy between the two groups is not greater than&#xD;
      10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If single-dose azithromycin therapy is found effective it will provide an important option&#xD;
      for the treatment V. cholerae infections, especially those caused by multiply-resistant&#xD;
      strains.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 182 evaluable patients (those with a positive stool culture for V. cholerae O1 or&#xD;
      V. cholerae O139 and remain in the study for full 5 days) will be required for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the initial entry criteria will be admitted into the study ward of the&#xD;
      ICDDR,B, weighed (Dehydration Weight), assessed for hydration status and rehydrated using an&#xD;
      intravenous polyelectrolyte solution (&quot;Dhaka Solution&quot; containing 133 mmol/l of sodium, 13&#xD;
      mmol/l of potassium, 98 mmol/l of chloride and 48 mmol/l of bicarbonate) over a 3-hour period&#xD;
      in accordance with the WHO guidelines [53], and re-weighed (Rehydration Weight). Rice-based&#xD;
      oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution (sodium 90 mmol/l, potassium 20 mmol/l, chloride 80&#xD;
      mmol/l, bicarbonate 30 mmol/l, and rice powder 50 gram per litre) will be used as the primary&#xD;
      maintenance fluid once initial rehydration is accomplished, however, intravenous&#xD;
      polyelectrolyte solution will be used as the maintenance fluid for patients with excessive&#xD;
      vomiting (usually &gt; 4 episodes per hour) or with rapid stool losses (usually &gt;10 ml/kg.hour),&#xD;
      or those who are unable to drink enough ORS solution for maintenance of their hydration.&#xD;
      Patients will be allowed to drink plain water ad libitum after the initial rehydration. All&#xD;
      fluid intake and output during rehydration (and throughout the study) will be recorded. A&#xD;
      stool specimen will be collected from the patients for dark-field microscopic examination to&#xD;
      document the presence of V. cholerae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following rehydration, stool output will be measured for a 4-hour period in the maintenance&#xD;
      phase, to be called &quot;Observation Period&quot;, and those with a stool output of ³ 20 ml/kg during&#xD;
      this period and those who also have V. cholerae demonstrated in their stool dark-field&#xD;
      examination will be considered eligible for enrollment into the study if they provide&#xD;
      voluntary informed consent. This observation period will help establish that patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the study have moderate to severe disease, so that the potential impact of&#xD;
      therapy can be evaluated (as any therapy is likely to appear effective in mild disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On final enrollment into the study, a more complete history and physical examination will be&#xD;
      performed, and all findings will be recorded on pre-designed data collection forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients entered into study will be randomly assigned to receive either a single, 1 gram oral&#xD;
      dose of azithromycin or a single, 1 gram oral dose of ciprofloxacin. Patients entered into&#xD;
      study will be assigned a consecutive study number which will have been previously randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the two treatment regimens, and this randomization will be done using a&#xD;
      computer generated random number list with a fixed block length of 4. Study drugs will be&#xD;
      administered after completion of the four-hour observation period, and at least 2 hours after&#xD;
      the last food intake. The time of administering study drug will be considered as the&#xD;
      beginning (the &quot;0&quot; hour) of the study. For patients who vomit within 10 minutes of ingestion&#xD;
      of study drug, the dose of the study drug will be repeated. For this purpose, all study drugs&#xD;
      will be available in duplicate. Such events will be recorded, and data of these patients will&#xD;
      be carefully evaluated. The study drugs will be prepared in identical form to allow for&#xD;
      blinding of treatment. Randomization will be done by Pfizer, USA who will also provide coded&#xD;
      study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be hospitalized for 5 complete days to be counted from the time of&#xD;
      administration of the study drug (Each consecutive, 24-period constituting a day). The&#xD;
      following clinical and laboratory evaluations will be done for each of the study patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body Weight: On initial entry into the study, after initial rehydration, at &quot;0&quot; hour of&#xD;
           the study (which will coincide with administration of the study drug), and at 24 hour&#xD;
           intervals beginning from the time of administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and physical examination: On admission, after initial rehydration, at &quot;0&quot; hour&#xD;
           of the study, and at least once daily during hospitalization. This will also include&#xD;
           evaluation for potential adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs: Oral temperature, pulse and respiratory rates, and blood pressures will be&#xD;
           recorded on admission (dehydrated), after rehydration, at the end of the 4-hour&#xD;
           observation period (&quot;0&quot; hour of the study), and every 6 hours after administration of&#xD;
           the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of stool volume: Will be done for the rehydration period, the four hour&#xD;
           observation period, and for each 6-hour period after administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterization of stool: Individual stool will be categorized as either watery or soft&#xD;
           or formed; the worst stool character of each 6 hour study period will be used to&#xD;
           categorize that time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool culture for V. cholerae O1, O139 and non-Ol; and Shigella and Salmonella: Will be&#xD;
           done on admission, on study day two and at follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rectal swab culture for V. cholerae O1 and O139: Will be done on admission, and on each&#xD;
           study day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematological studies: Serum electrolytes, creatinine and serum Sp. gr., and haematocrit&#xD;
           will be determined before and after rehydration, and 24 hours after administration of&#xD;
           the study drug (3.0 ml of blood will be required for these tests each time, i.e. a total&#xD;
           of 9.0 ml of blood). Complete blood count, and platelet count will be done just before&#xD;
           administration of the study drug, however, this may also be done subsequently only if&#xD;
           clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacokinetic studies: For the first 40 patients enrolled into the study, venous blood&#xD;
           will be obtained for determination of the serum concentration of the study drugs at&#xD;
           either of the following time intervals from administration of the study drug- 3, 12, 24&#xD;
           or 48 hours. An indwelling catheter with two way stop cock will be introduced to avoid&#xD;
           repeated venipuncture which will be taken off 3 hours after administration of the study&#xD;
           drug; all subsequent blood samplings will be done by individual venipunctures. This will&#xD;
           require only 1.0 ml of venous blood, and serum will be separated and stored at -70EC&#xD;
           until assayed. For determination of stool concentration of the study drugs, aliquots of&#xD;
           stool (About 5.0 ml each) will be obtained from stool collected over each 6 hour period&#xD;
           during the first two days of the study, and like serum, will be stored and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Handling of Treatment Failures: If the study treatment is judged to have failed&#xD;
           clinically patients will be treated for 3 days with an agent other than azithromycin or&#xD;
           ciprofloxacin to which the isolate of V. cholerae will be found to be susceptible to.&#xD;
           The treatment code will not be broken for these patients. Patients with microbiological&#xD;
           failure will be treated with a suitable drug as determined by antimicrobial&#xD;
           susceptibility of such isolates.&#xD;
