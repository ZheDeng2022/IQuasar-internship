  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of evidence suggests that the symptoms of many fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS)&#xD;
      sufferers might be the result of an imbalance in one of the major stress response systems,&#xD;
      the autonomic nervous system. Thus respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) biofeedback, which has&#xD;
      shown promise in other conditions associated with an autonomic nervous system imbalance,&#xD;
      could be effective in FMS. With the aid of sensors and computers, biofeedback involves&#xD;
      modifying and/or learning how to control normally involuntary processes like blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate and the autonomic nervous system through relaxation and breathing. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to test the effectiveness of a 10-session RSA biofeedback treatment for the&#xD;
      symptoms of fibromyalgia. Forty patients receiving the RSA biofeedback treatment will be&#xD;
      compared to 40 patients receiving another form of biofeedback thought to be minimally helpful&#xD;
      (control group). Later, control group patients will also receive the RSA biofeedback&#xD;
      treatment. We will study improvement in symptoms like pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and&#xD;
      depression in the RSA biofeedback group and compare these improvements to those in the&#xD;
      control group. We will also assess whether these improvements persist over time and what if&#xD;
      any changes in the autonomic nervous system result from the treatment.&#xD;

      Eighty female patients between the ages of 18 and 65 will be recruited from the rheumatology&#xD;
      clinic at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey - Robert Wood Johnson&#xD;
      Medical School (UMDNJ-RWJMS). Qualified participants are those who have a diagnosis of FMS&#xD;
      from a board certified rheumatologist using the diagnostic criteria established by the&#xD;
      American College of Rheumatology. Because women account for over 85% of FMS patients only&#xD;
      women will be included as subjects. Excluded from participating will be women with any of the&#xD;
      following medical conditions: neurologic disease or brain injury, stroke or cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, serious pulmonary disease including asthma, liver or kidney disease, serious&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders, and major psychiatric conditions including psychoses, bipolar&#xD;
      disorder, alcohol or drug abuse, and eating disorders. Also excluded will be women with a&#xD;
      life threatening medical illness, communicative disorder, lack of fluency in English,&#xD;
      illiteracy, cardiac arrhythmia or high frequency and low frequency waves that are&#xD;
      indistinguishable or that interact. Patients will be required to add no medications to their&#xD;
      regimen during the study period (approximately 5 to 7 months). Based on the clinical judgment&#xD;
      of the investigators, patients may also be asked to withdraw from the study should they miss&#xD;
      two or more consecutive biofeedback sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After reading and signing the informed consent, all participants will receive a medical&#xD;
      evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of FMS based on the criteria established by the American&#xD;
      College of Rheumatology. All participants will be evaluated by board certified&#xD;
      rheumatologists affiliated with UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and remain blind to&#xD;
      participants' group assignment. This examination will include a baseline tender point count&#xD;
      or TPI that will be used as an exploratory measure. Next, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      return for an appointment at the Biofeedback Laboratory at UMDNJ-RWJMS. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to refrain from taking any caffeine or alcohol for twelve hours prior to this and&#xD;
      all other sessions where physiologic measures are to be collected. Before beginning&#xD;
      physiologic measures assessment, participants will complete the baseline outcome measures,&#xD;
      the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), the&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI), and the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) in a&#xD;
      quiet, private room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first appointment at the Biofeedback Laboratory will consist of introducing the&#xD;
      participant to the setting, equipment and basic procedure of biofeedback. To obtain baseline&#xD;
      physiological measures, we will take a 5-minute heart period recording and the other measures&#xD;
      including blood pressure, respiration, and muscle tension. For consistency across&#xD;
      participants on all resting 5-minute heart period recordings, a &quot;vanilla&quot; baseline task will&#xD;
      be included. The &quot;vanilla&quot; baseline is a minimally demanding color detection task shown to&#xD;
      provide a stable baseline against which changes in response to experimental challenges can be&#xD;
      measured. The task involves the presentation of a 10 to 12 cm rectangle on a computer monitor&#xD;
      that changes color every 10 seconds. Six colors are presented randomly and with equal&#xD;
      probability over the course of the baseline period. Subjects are told beforehand to count the&#xD;
      number of times the object changes back to a randomly determined initial color. At the end of&#xD;
      the task subjects are asked to report their count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will also undergo a simple task for the assessment of orthostatic&#xD;
      hypotension. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease of at least 20 mmHg in systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure when an individual moves from a supine to standing position. This assessment&#xD;
      will occur in the same lab where the biofeedback session occurs. First, both blood pressure&#xD;
      and pulse will be recorded with the participant in a standing position. This will serve as&#xD;
      the first recording of BP and pulse measures. Then, the participant will be instructed to lie&#xD;
      down completely flat on a floor mat (supine position) for 10 minutes. Approximately three&#xD;
      minutes after the participant goes from a supine to standing position, both blood pressure&#xD;
      and pulse will be once again recorded. A stand-alone blood pressure device will be used to&#xD;
      record these measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next using biofeedback, all participants will be taught to breathe at their resonant&#xD;
      frequency as described below. Based on the literature, we will consider the rate of breathing&#xD;
      that produces the highest frequency peak to be the participant's &quot;resonant frequency.&quot;&#xD;
      Finding the true resonant frequency is a complex task beyond the scope and resources of this&#xD;
      pilot project. Results from this analysis will advise matching participants on high&#xD;
      frequency/low frequency rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Assignment. Participants will then be randomly assigned to the active treatment group&#xD;
      or EEG biofeedback control group using a restricted randomization procedure controlling for&#xD;
      age, high frequency/low frequency rates, and general health status. Those assigned to the&#xD;
      active treatment group will be given ten weekly training sessions in RSA biofeedback, while&#xD;
      those in the control group will receive ten weekly sessions of EEG biofeedback starting&#xD;
      immediately. All questionnaire and psychophysiological data collected at baseline will be&#xD;
      repeated after the last training session 10 weeks later, and at 3 months. At the end of ten&#xD;
      weeks, the EEG biofeedback control group participants will be offered the opportunity to&#xD;
      participate in the 10-session RSA biofeedback program and subsequent intervention-related&#xD;
      assessments (after the last biofeedback session (10th) and at (3 months). The Week 10&#xD;
      assessment, taken at the conclusion of the EEG biofeedback treatment, will serve as the&#xD;
      control group's baseline to maintain 10-week pretest/posttest consistency between groups. EEG&#xD;
      biofeedback subjects will be compensated only once if they choose to participate in the RSA&#xD;
      biofeedback trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG Biofeedback Condition. Participants assigned to this condition will receive 10 sessions&#xD;
      of EEG alpha biofeedback. In each session, 20 minutes of biofeedback will be delivered using&#xD;
      a J&amp;J I-330-C2+ physiograph. The participant will learn how to modify specific brainwave&#xD;
      activity known as alpha. In particular, participants will be taught to increase amplitude of&#xD;
      alpha in the range of 8-12 Hz. Increased amplitude is this range is associated with&#xD;
      relaxation and reduction of anxiety, but not baroreflex gain. Participants will also practice&#xD;
      for two 20-minute periods daily using the same methods used to increase alpha found in lab&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RSA Biofeedback Condition. The biofeedback will consist of 10 weekly sessions of training, at&#xD;
      the same time of day for each subject. The details of the procedure for RSA biofeedback are&#xD;
      described in Appendix A. One single practitioner, a certified biofeedback technician, will&#xD;
      provide the biofeedback following the aforementioned protocol. In each session, 20 minutes of&#xD;
      biofeedback will be delivered using a J&amp;J C-2+ Physiograph. The participant will be taught to&#xD;
      breathe at her resonant frequency, as a first step to training the individual how to produce&#xD;
      maximal increases in amplitude of RSA. During the first session, we will measure heart rate&#xD;
      oscillation amplitudes while the individual breathes for intervals of two minutes each at&#xD;
      specific frequencies, ranging between 4 and 7 breaths per minute, respectively 4, 4.5, 5,&#xD;
      5.5, 6, 6.5, and 7 breaths per minute. We will provide a &quot;pacing stimulus&quot; for this purpose:&#xD;
      a light display that moves up and down on the computer screen at the target respiratory rate.&#xD;
      The participant will be instructed to breathe at the rate of that stimulus. We will consider&#xD;
      the frequency yielding the highest frequency peak on the moving Fourier analysis data&#xD;
      collected and displayed by the C-2 physiograph to be the resonant frequency. In subsequent&#xD;
      sessions, the individual will be given biofeedback for 20 minutes. The participant will be&#xD;
      instructed to practice breathing at her own resonant frequency for 20-minute periods twice&#xD;
      daily for the next week. Throughout training the individual will be cautioned to breathe&#xD;
      shallowly and naturally, in order to avoid hyperventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the second session, the participant will be directly given biofeedback for cardiac&#xD;
      variability, and instructed to increase the amplitude of heart rate fluctuations that occur&#xD;
      in conjunction with respiration. The feedback will be given in several forms. One is using a&#xD;
      beat-to-beat cardiotachometer display, superimposed on a measure of respiratory activity&#xD;
      taken from a strain gauge. The participant will be instructed to breathe approximately in&#xD;
      phase with heart rate changes, with the goal of maximally increasing amplitude of RSA. In&#xD;
      another display, the participant will be shown a moving frequency analysis of heart rate,&#xD;
      within the band of .005-.4 Hz. The display will be updated approximately every second, and&#xD;
      reflects the frequency of heart rate fluctuations within the past 30 seconds. The participant&#xD;
      will be instructed to increase the spectral power peak that occurred at approximately&#xD;
      resonant frequency. At the beginning and end of this and every biofeedback session&#xD;
      participants will be asked to rate their pain, muscle stiffness, fatigue, mood and cognitive&#xD;
      processes (memory and concentration) on a verbal scale of one to ten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third session, a stand-alone device will be provided for home practice HeartMath&#xD;
      Freeze Framer. This system analyzes heart rhythms and provides a display sensitive to&#xD;
      changes. A colorful game format is used to reward the user for increases in heart rate&#xD;
      coherence, which in turn will maximize amplitude of RSA. Participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      practice for two 20-minute sessions per day and note in the log included with the HeartMath&#xD;
      Freeze Framer instructions whether or not they practiced each day, the length of each&#xD;
      practice session, and any questions or observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biofeedback Data Collection Procedure. At sessions 1, 10, and at 3 months, a resting 5-minute&#xD;
      heart period using the &quot;vanilla&quot; task will be obtained before commencing biofeedback and at&#xD;
      the end of the session. During biofeedback, two 5-minute heart period recordings will be&#xD;
      taken, one at the beginning of the session and one at the end. Questionnaire data will then&#xD;
      be collected. Patients will be given a $25 payment for participation at the end of each data&#xD;
      collection session for a total of $75.&#xD;
