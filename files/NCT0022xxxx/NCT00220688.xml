      Randomised controlled trial of acupressure wrist bands for hospice in-patients suffering from&#xD;
      terminal cancer who are troubled by nausea and vomiting.&#xD;

      Pilot The study will be piloted with 10 patients to ensure that the protocol is acceptable to&#xD;
      patients and to inform a formal power calculation for a larger study. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to each arm according to a randomization programme at www.randomization.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 Instruction and placement of acupressure bands at the P6 acupuncture point bilaterally.&#xD;
      This point is located 2 cun (a Chinese measurement equal to approximately 3cm) proximal to&#xD;
      the midpoint of the transverse crease of the wrist between the tendons of palmaris longus and&#xD;
      flexor carpi radialis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 Instruction and placement of sham acupressure bands P6 acupuncture point bilaterally.&#xD;
      Sham acupressure bands have no stud to stimulate P6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may choose to have regular anti-emetics or a subcutaneous syringe driver after 24&#xD;
      hours if they are not happy with their level of nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Source and Number of Patients: Hospice in-patients. 10 patients for pilot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must meet the following criteria to be eligible to participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Have a diagnosis of advanced cancer with an estimated prognosis of less than 1 year but&#xD;
           more than 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe their nausea as at least moderate on a Likert scale OR at have had at least one&#xD;
           vomit per day for the last three days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Have an underlying cause for their nausea which is thought to be irreversible OR the&#xD;
           patient has made an autonomous choice not to proceed with treatment for any potentially&#xD;
           reversible cause (for example surgery for obstruction or drainage of ascites).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Can be male or female patients but must be over the age of 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Have signed a consent form prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If patients are taking corticosteroids the dosage should be stable for 3 days before and&#xD;
           during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Be thought to be well enough to complete the 3 day trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Arm lymphoedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Weakness, fatigue or confusion sufficient that patient is unable to take part.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Previous history of acupuncture/acupressure for nausea or vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. History of Parkinsonism or Parkinsonism on examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients will not be enrolled if they are sharing a room with another patient taking&#xD;
           part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visual Analogue Scale of nausea measured every 6 hours. If patients are asleep they will&#xD;
           not be waken for assessments overnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Duration of perceived nausea over preceding time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number of vomits per 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Volume of vomit per 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Adverse effects of acupressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Number of doses of PRN anti-emetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Measure of whether the patient felt the intervention helped at the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot will allow a formal power calculation to be performed to elucidate how many&#xD;
      patients need to be randomized to the full study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed by Sarah Vowler at the Centre for Applied Medical&#xD;
      Statistics.&#xD;
