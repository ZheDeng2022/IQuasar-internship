    <textblock>
      Bowel function after bowel surgery is delayed (postoperative ileus)by both opiates and the&#xD;
      surgery itself. We hypothesized that decreasing opiate use by other analgesics will speed the&#xD;
      return of bowel function after surgery. Lidocaine and Ketamine are drugs that appear to be&#xD;
      synergistic and do not slow peristalsis. This study is a Randomised Controlled Trial of&#xD;
      Lidocaine Infusion Plus Ketamine Injection versus Placebo to to determine whether they will&#xD;
      decrease opiate use and then whether decreased opiate use will speed the return of bowel&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

      Introduction: Postoperative ileus is a normal response to the surgical handling of bowel that&#xD;
      causes transient impairment of bowel motility after abdominal surgery. It is characterized by&#xD;
      distension, absence of bowel sounds, and lack of passage of flatus and stool. The duration of&#xD;
      postoperative ileus is related to the degree of surgical manipulation and the location of&#xD;
      surgery. Colonic surgery is associated with the longest duration of ileus. Morphine&#xD;
      patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) is commonly used to provide pain control&#xD;
      after bowel surgery. The bowel wall contains opiate receptors that decrease bowel peristalsis&#xD;
      in the presence of morphine. Thus, both surgery and PCIA slow return of normal bowel&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine and ketamine are non-opioid analgesics that have been shown to be safe and&#xD;
      efficacious in low doses when combined with morphine for post-operative pain control. Since&#xD;
      the addition of lidocaine or ketamine to a morphine PCIA regimen results in lower total use&#xD;
      of morphine, and since lidocaine or ketamine does not slow peristalsis, , it is reasonable to&#xD;
      expect that low-dose lidocaine or ketamine plus PCIA morphine will result in faster return of&#xD;
      bowel function than PCIA morphine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous lidocaine was first shown to relieve cancer pain in the 1950s. Since then,&#xD;
      intravenous lidocaine has been shown also to relieve pain after a wide variety of surgeries.&#xD;
      Ketamine is a non-opioid analgesic that has been shown to be safe and efficacious in very low&#xD;
      doses when combined with morphine for post-operative pain control . A review of ketamine for&#xD;
      postoperative pain control recently completed by Dr McKay has shown that ketamine is most&#xD;
      efficacious when given after a painful surgical insult, and that preoperative bezodiazepines&#xD;
      prevent ketamine-induced hallucinations (submitted for publication). Groudine, in patients&#xD;
      undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy, determined that intravenous lidocaine infusion&#xD;
      intraoperatively decreased the duration of postoperative ileus, decreased the pain scores&#xD;
      postoperatively, and resulted in a 50% reduction in morphine use, and a 20% reduction in&#xD;
      hospitalization time. This was felt to be due to early ambulation, earlier times to passing&#xD;
      gas and having a bowel movement, and faster advancement to a full diet and oral analgesics.&#xD;
      Lidocaine plasma levels were well below toxic range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a double-blind placebo-controlled study of patients undergoing elective or urgent&#xD;
      colon surgery with an anastomotic procedure. All patients will receive normal PCA morphine in&#xD;
      addition to study drugs or placebo. Research will be conducted at Saskatoon teaching&#xD;
      hospitals. This procedure was chosen as it is associated with a longer duration of ileus&#xD;
      compared to other abdominal surgeries and more likely to show a significant treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If previous data is applicable to colonic surgery then we can expect a decrease in&#xD;
      postoperative analgesic requirements, earlier return of bowel function, earlier progression&#xD;
      to full diet and earlier discharge dates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of lidocaine we propose has been shown to be safe in thousands of patients for whom&#xD;
      it was used to treat arrhythmias; that of ketamine in more than twenty studies of&#xD;
      postoperative pain control.&#xD;
