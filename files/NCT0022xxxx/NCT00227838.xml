  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to modify Integrated Group Therapy (IGT), which is has been&#xD;
      found successful for patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and substance use disorder(SUD), so&#xD;
      that it can be more readily adopted by community drug abuse treatment programs. IGT is being&#xD;
      reduced from 20 to 12 sessions in this trial, and is being conducted by front-line drug&#xD;
      counselors, to test its effectiveness in a more community-based setting. The training has&#xD;
      been expanded so that counselors without much psychopathology training or cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy experience can conduct IGT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IGT is being compared with 12 sessions of Group Drug Counseling (GDC) in a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, with a sample size of 60 subjects. GDC is the type of treatment one would&#xD;
      likely receive in a community drug abuse treatment program, in that it focuses primarily in&#xD;
      substance use, unlike IGT, which focuses equally on SUD and BD issues. Patients are followed&#xD;
      for a year after the end of the group therapy, to examine the long-term effects of the&#xD;
      treatment, and also to examine the longer-term relationship of substance use and mood.&#xD;
      Patients in the trial must be taking a mood stabilizer to enter the study. Any drug of abuse&#xD;
      is accepted, and all subtypes of BD are accepted.&#xD;
