  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if exercise affects the clotting of blood&#xD;
      (hemostasis). The effect of exercise on hemostasis will be determined in persons with spinal&#xD;
      cord injury, a population reported to have an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD). It is expected that this study will increase our understanding of CVD in persons with&#xD;
      SCI, and it will eventually help reduce the occurrence of premature heart disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular moderate intensity physical exercise decreases platelet aggregability as a&#xD;
      consequence of increasing levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and reducing levels of&#xD;
      plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In addition, the exercise-associated improvement&#xD;
      in the lipid profile and reduction in fat mass may decrease platelet aggregability and blood&#xD;
      coagulation, as well as increase fibrinolysis. Thus, it can be hypothesized that physical&#xD;
      exercise training has a powerful beneficial impact on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis.&#xD;
      Although, regular exercise has been shown to reduce the incidence of CVD and death or causes&#xD;
      a regression of symptoms in able-bodied individuals, this salutary effect of prolonged&#xD;
      (months) exercise in persons with SCI has not been documented. The present study will&#xD;
      evaluate the effects on hemostasis of exercise training in persons with chronic SCI. The&#xD;
      effect of exercise on hemostasis will be determined in persons with SCI, a population&#xD;
      appreciated to have an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is&#xD;
      anticipated that this study will ultimately increase our understanding of CVD in this group,&#xD;
      and it will eventually help reduce the occurrence of premature macrovascular disease.&#xD;
