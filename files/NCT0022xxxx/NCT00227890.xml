      This study will focus on treating substance abusing incarcerated teens using individually&#xD;
      administered Motivational Interviewing (MI) followed by group Cognitive Behavior Therapy&#xD;
      (CBT). The control group receives individualized Relaxation Training (RT) followed by group&#xD;
      Treatment as Usual (TU). Currently, there is little research regarding effective group&#xD;
      treatments for incarcerated teens and this study will address this gap in our knowledge base.&#xD;
      We seek to reduce substance use and associated risky behaviors post-release (including&#xD;
      driving under the influence, risky sexual behaviors, etc.).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This proposal is in response to RFA-DA-04-008, Group Treatment for Individuals in Drug Abuse&#xD;
      or Alcoholism Treatment. Of particular interest to the agencies are group therapies for&#xD;
      Conduct Disordered adolescents, reducing the spread of infectious disease, and mechanisms of&#xD;
      action. This proposal targets these areas of interest. This study will focus on treating&#xD;
      substance abusing incarcerated teens using 2 individually administered Motivational&#xD;
      Interviewing (MI) sessions followed by 10 group sessions of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT).&#xD;
      MI is conceptualized as preparation for group CBT. The control group receives individualized&#xD;
      Relaxation Training (RT) followed by group Treatment as Usual (TU). Currently, there is&#xD;
      little research regarding effective group treatments for incarcerated teens and this study&#xD;
      will address this gap in our knowledge base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposed randomized trial, a one-way design (MI/CBT vs. RT/TU) will be used to&#xD;
      determine whether MI/CBT enhances group therapy participation and reduces substance use and&#xD;
      related problems (such as crime, injuries and unprotected sex) post discharge in&#xD;
      substance-involved juvenile delinquents. RT/TU is based on the 12-step model and includes&#xD;
      psycho-educational components. Participants are followed during incarceration and for 6&#xD;
      months post incarceration. Primary outcome variables include alcohol and marijuana use, as&#xD;
      well as related behaviors (illegal activity, sex or injuries while drunk or high). It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that in comparison to teens in RT/TU, youth receiving MI/CBT will participate&#xD;
      more in therapy (according to teen, facility staff, and counselor ratings) and will show&#xD;
      lower levels of substance use and related problems after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequently, substance abuse treatment is unavailable to youths in the juvenile justice&#xD;
      system, and when treatment is available, it may be provided in group format using untested&#xD;
      therapies. A motivation/skills-based intervention (delivered in group format) may prove&#xD;
      efficacious in enhancing motivation and in reducing substance abuse and related problems.&#xD;
      This study extends previous research by rigorously evaluating group treatment for&#xD;
      incarcerated teens. We will examine processes contributing to the efficacy of group MI/CBT,&#xD;
      and the influence of race and ethnicity on treatment effects. The development of effective&#xD;
      interventions for substance using juvenile offenders has the potential to reduce substance&#xD;
      abuse and crime in this population.&#xD;
