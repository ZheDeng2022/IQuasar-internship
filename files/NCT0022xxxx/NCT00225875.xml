  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the rituximab at the&#xD;
      adults with a chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (&gt;=6 months of evolution) and severe&#xD;
      (platelets &lt;= 30x109/L) and candidate to a splenectomy. The objective is to obtain after a&#xD;
      treatment by the rituximab a satisfactory response to one year, defined by a number of&#xD;
      platelets higher than 50x109/L and at least 2 times superior with the persistent initial&#xD;
      figure without treatment during one year after the end of the treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Adults immune thrombocytopenic purpura has an evolution which is generally chronic defined by&#xD;
      the persistence of the thrombocytopenia 6 months after the diagnosis. The treatment is then&#xD;
      based on the splenectomy which is proposed by the majority of the teams when the platelets&#xD;
      are lower than 30x109/L. The splenectomy is effective at 70 to 80 % of the patients whereas&#xD;
      no medicamentous treatment makes it possible to obtain a comparable result. Nevertheless, it&#xD;
      exposes to immediate post-operative complications and to a risk of mortal fulminant&#xD;
      infections by encapsulated germs, in particular the pneumococcus. However, its long-term&#xD;
      effectiveness is discussed with a risk of relapse which would reach 50 % for certain teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rituximab could be an alternative to the splenectomy because of its great frequency of&#xD;
      effectiveness and its good tolerance in the short and medium term. None the medicamentous&#xD;
      treatments usually suggested in alternative to the splenectomy (disulone, danazol,&#xD;
      immunosuppressors) indeed makes it possible to obtain an answer prolonged after the stop of&#xD;
      therapeutic in a significant number of cases. Moreover, the use of the immunosuppressors such&#xD;
      as the cyclophosphamide, the azathioprine or the ciclosporine appears contestable at this&#xD;
      stage of the disease because of potential severity their side effects.The primary endpoint is&#xD;
      satisfactory response to one year, defined by a figure of plates &gt;=50x109/L and at least 2&#xD;
      times superior in the initial, and persistent figure without treatment during one year after&#xD;
      the stop of the treatment by rituximab. Secondary objectives are incomplete response to one&#xD;
      year, defined by a figure of platelets &gt;= 30x109/L and &lt; 50x109/L and at least twice the&#xD;
      figure initial or &gt; 50x109/L but lower than twice the persistent initial figure without&#xD;
      treatment during one year after the end of the treatment by rituximab. Splenectomy at one&#xD;
      year satisfactory Response to 2 years incomplete Response to 2 years Splenectomies at 2 years&#xD;
      Tolerance of the treatment.&#xD;
