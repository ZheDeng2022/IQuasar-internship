      Background: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most frequent cause of childhood disability in the US.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, current standard of care for CP in the U.S. is to a large extent ineffective.&#xD;
      The Chinese, on the other hand, claim to have an exceptionally high response rate with the&#xD;
      administration of an integrated package of care that includes the combination of intense&#xD;
      'conventional' therapies and acupuncture. Despite numerous anecdotal reports, this claim has&#xD;
      not yet been tested in a rigorous scientific way. Objective: To determine the effectiveness&#xD;
      of acupuncture when used as an adjunct to intense 'conventional' physical, occupational, and&#xD;
      hydro- therapies to improve function and quality of life in children with spastic CP.&#xD;
      Hypotheses: (1) Adjunctive acupuncture therapy will improve the gross and fine motor function&#xD;
      and the health related quality of life of children with spastic CP more than intense&#xD;
      'conventional' therapies alone. (2) The level of persistence of gross and fine motor function&#xD;
      and health related quality of life achieved with adjunctive acupuncture administered in&#xD;
      combination with intense 'conventional' therapies will be higher than those achieved with&#xD;
      intense 'conventional' therapies alone. Design: A parallel, two-arm, prospective,&#xD;
      evaluation-blind, pragmatic, non-inferiority, randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT).&#xD;
      Setting: This international collaborative study will be conducted at two different&#xD;
      localities: (1) At the Beijing Children's Hospital (BCH), where participants' recruitment,&#xD;
      intervention therapies, videotape evaluation, and data collection will be done, and (2) At&#xD;
      the University of Arizona, where scoring of the videotape evaluations and data analyses will&#xD;
      be done, and from where logistic support will be provided to assure the scientific integrity&#xD;
      of the study. Population: Approximately 100 children between the ages 1 and 6 years with&#xD;
      spastic CP. Intervention: Concurrent administration of acupuncture with intense&#xD;
      'conventional' therapies at the outset of the study vs. sequential administration of both&#xD;
      components. Outcomes: 'Gross Motor Function', 'Fine Motor Function', 'Range of Motion',&#xD;
      'Level of Motor Involvement', and 'Health-Related Quality of Life' measured at times&#xD;
      0,4,8,12,24,and 36 weeks. Evaluation: Independent blinded evaluation with respect to the type&#xD;
      of the intervention and the stage of the therapeutic schedule done in the U.S. based on&#xD;
      videotapes filmed in China. Data management: Web-based data center and intersite-networking&#xD;
      infrastructure. Data analyses: Intention to treat analysis supplemented by linear mixed&#xD;
      effects models with nested grouping factors. Significance and future directions: If the&#xD;
      hypotheses are confirmed the study would lay the groundwork for future research, and impact&#xD;
      clinical practice and health care policy as related to CP therapy.&#xD;

      The proposed study is a parallel, two-arm, prospective, evaluation-blind, randomized&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial (RCT). It has been designed to examine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      acupuncture when used as an adjunct to intense 'conventional' physical, occupational, and&#xD;
      hydro- therapies to improve function and quality of life in children with spastic cerebral&#xD;
      palsy (CP). This international collaborative study will be conducted at two locations: (1) At&#xD;
      the Beijing Children's Hospital (BCH), where participants' recruitment, intervention&#xD;
      therapies, videotape evaluation, and data collection will be done, and (2) At the University&#xD;
      of Arizona, where scoring of the videotape evaluations and data analyses will be done, and&#xD;
      from where logistic support will be provided to assure the scientific integrity of the study.&#xD;
      The specific aims of the proposed study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: To compare the outcomes achieved after 12 weeks of acupuncture administered&#xD;
      concurrently with intense 'conventional' therapies (physical, occupational, and&#xD;
      hydro-therapies) to those achieved with intense 'conventional' therapies alone in the&#xD;
      management of children with spastic CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1: Adjunctive acupuncture administered concurrently with intense 'conventional'&#xD;
      therapies will improve the gross and fine motor function and the health related quality of&#xD;
      life of children with spastic CP more than intense 'conventional' therapies alone, as&#xD;
      determined by standardized measures (see pgs. 20-22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: To examine the short and intermediate term persistence of any changes in the&#xD;
      outcomes achieved with acupuncture administered concurrently with intense 'conventional'&#xD;
      therapies (physical, occupational, and hydro-therapies) to those achieved with intense&#xD;
      'conventional' therapies alone in the management of children with spastic CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2: When compared three months after termination of therapy, the level of gross&#xD;
      and fine motor function and health related quality of life achieved with acupuncture&#xD;
      administered concurrently with intense 'conventional' therapies (physical, occupational, and&#xD;
      hydro-therapies) will be higher than those achieved with intense 'conventional' therapies&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking advantage of the fact that ethically all the Chinese children with spastic CP who&#xD;
      would participate in this study ought to receive acupuncture at one point or another as part&#xD;
      of their care (see pg. 12) we propose, as a secondary aim, to begin to examine whether the&#xD;
      timing of the administration of adjunctive acupuncture in relation to the timing of the&#xD;
      administration of intense 'conventional' therapies has any effect on the outcomes, as&#xD;
      determined by standardized measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is to be emphasized, that this study does not aim primarily at testing sequence effects&#xD;
      related to the most appropriate timing of administration of adjunctive acupuncture in the&#xD;
      treatment of children with spastic CP since a) it must first be examined whether acupuncture&#xD;
      has any effect at all in this population, and b) testing sequence effects would greatly&#xD;
      complicate the design of such a study to a point where it may render it not feasible. Rather,&#xD;
      we are simply taking advantage of the ethical obligation to provide every participant with&#xD;
      acupuncture at some point in time (not because it is proven from an efficacy standpoint but&#xD;
      because it is the standard of care in China) so as to begin to explore any potential temporal&#xD;
      relationships between administration of adjunctive acupuncture and outcomes. For example,&#xD;
      since Group 1 would receive adjunctive acupuncture concurrently with intense 'conventional'&#xD;
      therapies whereas Group 2 would receive adjunctive acupuncture therapy subsequently to&#xD;
      intense 'conventional' therapies (see Figure 1 on pg. 11), the design allows to begin to&#xD;
      explore whether adjunctive acupuncture administered subsequent to intense 'conventional'&#xD;
      therapies may have a booster effect on the degree of gross and fine motor function and health&#xD;
      related quality of life of children with spastic CP.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children between the ages of 12 and 72 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with a diagnosis of spastic cerebral palsy (CP) or mixed type CP where&#xD;
             spasticity is the dominant feature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age - Any child with CP who is younger than 12 months or older than 72 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Etiology - Any damage to the CNS that either (a) is not static in nature, such as&#xD;
             degenerative or progressive central nervous disorders, or (b) occurred after the first&#xD;
             year of life, or (c) any child who has a phenotypic pattern suggesting a chromosomal&#xD;
             abnormality (e.g., trisomy 13 or 18).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis - Children for whom the diagnosis of spastic CP or mixed-type CP with&#xD;
             spasticity as the dominant feature cannot be established with absolute certainty, or&#xD;
             children with dyskinetic CP. Rationale - To assure subject homogeneity, in cases in&#xD;
             which there is disagreement between the physicians with respect to the diagnosis of a&#xD;
             child, even if one of the physicians feels certain that a child has spastic CP, the&#xD;
             children would be automatically excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Co-morbidities - Medical conditions, whether acute or chronic, for which acupuncture&#xD;
             or intense 'conventional' therapies are considered contraindicated. Rationale -&#xD;
             assuring participants' safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Co-interventions - Any child receiving or scheduled to receive treatment(s) during the&#xD;
             study period that may confound the results (e.g., an orthopedic or neurosurgical&#xD;
             procedure, Botulinum toxin injections, a Baclofen pump or hyperbaric oxygen&#xD;
             treatment). Rationale -To avoid a threat to causal inferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parallel participation in another CP clinical trial. Rationale - To avoid pragmatic&#xD;
             and ethical issues that may arise as a result of a conflict of interests and limited&#xD;
             resources.&#xD;
