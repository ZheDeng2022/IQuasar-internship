  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at the effect of folate supplementation and depletion on the blood cells and&#xD;
      the colorectal cells. To examine the effect of these changes, blood samples and colorectal&#xD;
      biopsy samples are collected. The genetic material (RNA and DNA) is examined to see what&#xD;
      changes occur during the depletion and supplementation of folate. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      folate may help prevent colon cancer&#xD;

      Folate Depletion Arm and Supplementation Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The folate depletion study requires an 8-week run-in period. During this run-in period, all&#xD;
      participants will eat an average folate diet with no high folate containing foods. There are&#xD;
      two screening visits during this period where initial blood-work is done and participants&#xD;
      undergo nutritional consultation. Following the 8-week run-in period, subjects in the folate&#xD;
      depletion arm will be hospitalized for approximately 3 months at the Rockefeller University&#xD;
      Hospital. You may leave the hospital during the day, but are required to return each evening.&#xD;
      During this entire time, subjects are given a low folate diet. During the last month of the&#xD;
      study, folate supplements are given to replace folate in the body. A follow-up visit is&#xD;
      required approximately 1 month after the study period. Blood will be drawn every two weeks.&#xD;
      Four sigmoidoscopies will be taken at approximately monthly intervals. A male is required to&#xD;
      use an effective form of birth control throughout his participation in the study and for two&#xD;
      months after the study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The folate supplementation study requires an 8-week run-in period. During this run-in period,&#xD;
      all participants will eat an average folate diet with no high folate containing foods. There&#xD;
      are two screening visits during this period where initial blood-work is done and participants&#xD;
      undergo nutritional consultation. Following the 8-week run-in period, subjects in the folate&#xD;
      supplementation arm will be given a folate supplement for 8 weeks. During this entire time,&#xD;
      subjects will continue to eat an average folate diet with no high folate containing foods.&#xD;
      Blood samples and colorectal mucosa samples obtained during a sigmoidoscopy will be taken 3&#xD;
      times at 4 week intervals.&#xD;
