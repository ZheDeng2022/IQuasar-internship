  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a chronic disease with multiple metabolic defects that result in hyperglycemia&#xD;
      arising from inadequate insulin activity. Type 2 diabetes usually is the result of a&#xD;
      progression from reduced sensitivity of hepatic and peripheral tissue cells to circulating&#xD;
      insulin to a progressive inability of the body to produce adequate insulin to overcome&#xD;
      insulin resistance, resulting in impaired glucose tolerance and ultimately overt diabetes. In&#xD;
      the United States, an estimated 21 million people have diabetes, with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      occurring in approximately 90% to 95% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes also represents an important risk group for the development of accelerated&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis can be measured with different procedures. One of the&#xD;
      noninvasive, commonly used procedures is carotid B-mode ultrasound measurement of carotid&#xD;
      intima-media thickness, which has been shown to be a useful measurement for clinical&#xD;
      cardiovascular events in multiple studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery calcification is a marker of coronary artery disease, and electron beam&#xD;
      tomography is a sensitive tool for evaluation of coronary artery calcium. Electron beam&#xD;
      tomography measurements produce a coronary artery calcium score that represents plaque&#xD;
      burden. Subjects with diabetes mellitus have accelerated coronary artery disease. Even after&#xD;
      treatment of elevated lipid levels, rates for coronary events still exceed those seen in&#xD;
      non-diabetic subjects treated with the same lipid-lowering agents. Diabetic subjects also&#xD;
      continue to have increased mortality rates compared with non-diabetic subjects after a&#xD;
      myocardial infarction. Therefore, detection of sub-clinical atherosclerosis and prevention of&#xD;
      myocardial infarction in subjects with diabetes remains an important priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione developed by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd, and depends&#xD;
      on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Data suggests that thiazolidinediones&#xD;
      may inhibit the development of atherosclerosis in non-diabetic, atherosclerosis mouse models.&#xD;
      These findings suggest that this class of drugs may have an effect on vessel walls to&#xD;
      suppress development of atherosclerotic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the effects of pioglitazone and glimepiride on the rate of&#xD;
      progression of atherosclerotic disease as measured by carotid intima-media thickness and by&#xD;
      electron beam tomography of the coronary arteries in subjects with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
