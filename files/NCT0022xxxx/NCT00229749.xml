      Chronic active hepatitis C viral infections are difficult to treat: current drug therapies&#xD;
      can result in severe side effects that some patients will not tolerate. AVI-4065 Injection is&#xD;
      a new drug designed to prevent the virus from reproducing in the body. We tested this drug in&#xD;
      healthy adult volunteers to optimize the dosing regimen, and are now proceeding in adult&#xD;
      patients with chronic active hepatitis C infections. Patients who have the disease and who&#xD;
      have had treatment but without success, will be recruited for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of HCV patients initially consisted of subcutaneous injections given twice a&#xD;
      day for 14-days. Treatment arms of 28 days, twice or three-times per day have been added.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common blood-borne infection in the United States and a&#xD;
      worldwide public health problem of epidemic proportions. Benign in the acute phase of&#xD;
      infection, HCV infection usually becomes chronic in 70% of those originally infected. Chronic&#xD;
      HCV infection leads to inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), cirrhosis, end-stage liver&#xD;
      disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the United States alone, there are over 2.7 million&#xD;
      individuals with chronic HCV hepatitis. Standard treatment of chronic HCV hepatitis is&#xD;
      combination therapy for 24 to 48 weeks with alpha interferon and ribavirin. This combination&#xD;
      has limited efficacy, poor tolerability, and significant expense in terms of drug and&#xD;
      ancillary laboratory testing. It is well recognized that new treatment options are needed&#xD;
      which are more efficacious, potent, less toxic, and less expensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AVI BioPharma has pursued discovery of a drug against HCV using proprietary Neugene® or&#xD;
      Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomer (PMO) synthetic chemistry. Neugene (PMO) compounds, as&#xD;
      a drug class, are considered safe in humans and do not activate complement, alter clotting&#xD;
      times, or bind to α-adrenergic receptors (which can produce hypotension) like the&#xD;
      phosphorothioate antisense compounds. One PMO, AVI-4065, has been identified as likely to&#xD;
      inhibit all 5 genotypes of HCV based on in vitro and in vivo animal models. There are&#xD;
      specific data that confirm that AVI-4065 can inhibit HCV RNA dependent PNA polymerase (RdRp&#xD;
      encoded in NS5) and the HCV protease (NS3), in a non-competitive inhibitory fashion. The 50&#xD;
      percent Effective Concentration (EC50) is 308 nM, and the efficacy is nearly 100% at 3 μM.&#xD;
      These data suggest that AVI-4065 is capable of inhibiting HCV protein translation in a robust&#xD;
      manner at concentrations that should be achievable in patients. In rigorous GLP safety&#xD;
      pharmacology and toxicity models in a variety of animal species at dosage levels up to 5&#xD;
      times the maximum anticipated human dosage level, inclusive of non-human primates, AVI-4065&#xD;
      was considered safe, well tolerated and without dose-limiting toxicities. Additionally,&#xD;
      AVI-4065 Injection was safe and well-tolerated in the three dose-escalating groups of 31&#xD;
      healthy volunteers (Part I) with no serious adverse events. Adverse events that did occur&#xD;
      were few, self-limited and mild to moderate and did not require intervention; this&#xD;
      observation held true for the first HCV patients receiving AVI-4065 Injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AVI BioPharma's first human use of AVI-4065 Injection involved an open-label, multi-center,&#xD;
      exploratory, dose escalating design in healthy adult volunteers. The objective of this part&#xD;
      of the study was to assess safety, tolerability and to design a potentially therapeutic&#xD;
      dosage regimen. The objective of the second part of the study is to evaluate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and signals of HCV virus response in cohorts&#xD;
      of HCV patient volunteers that are interferon and ribavirin treatment failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of the drug to effect baseline HCV RNA levels over the study duration will be&#xD;
      evaluated using a conventional PCR-based assay. If there are promising results from this&#xD;
      phase of the clinical trial (viz., a 2 log decrease in HCV RNA levels from baseline within&#xD;
      study surveillance), it will provide the rational basis for additional clinical testing of&#xD;
      AVI-4065 Injection among HCV patients that are treatment refractory (viz., relapsers and&#xD;
      non-responders).&#xD;
