    <textblock>
      This study compared cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy with leuprolide acetate (LA) to&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy with saline injections for 12 months. Five white male&#xD;
      pedophiles (M age, 50 years; range, 36-58) volunteered for a two-year study. LA was&#xD;
      administered by Depo injection (7 mg initially, then 22.5 mg every 3 mos) for 12 months,&#xD;
      followed by saline placebo. Effects of LA on testosterone levels, sexual interest preference&#xD;
      by visual reaction time (Abel Assessment), penile tumescence (Monarch PPG), as well strong&#xD;
      urges and masturbatory frequency to children (polygraph), were measured every three months.&#xD;
      Subjects were treated with weekly cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy. On LA, testosterone&#xD;
      decreased to castrate levels. Because of the suppression of testosterone, physiologic arousal&#xD;
      response as measured by penile plethysmography (penile tumescence) was significantly&#xD;
      suppressed compared with baseline. However, sufficient response remained to detect pedophilic&#xD;
      interest. This pedophilic interest was also detected by visual reaction times. All subjects&#xD;
      self-reported a decrease in strong pedophilic urges and masturbation. When asked about having&#xD;
      pedophilic urges and masturbating to thoughts of children, polygraph responses indicated&#xD;
      subjects were not deceptive when they reported decreases. On placebo, testosterone and&#xD;
      physiologic arousal eventually rose to baseline levels. At baseline and on placebo, subjects&#xD;
      were consistently deceptive regarding increased pedophilic urges and masturbatory frequency&#xD;
      as noted by polygraph. Interest preference, as measured by Abel Assessment and Monarch PPG,&#xD;
      was generally unchanged throughout the study. Cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy augmented&#xD;
      with LA significantly reduced pedophilic fantasies, urges, and masturbation, but did not&#xD;
      change pedophilic interest during one year of therapy. Deceptive responses by polygraph&#xD;
      suggested that self-report was unreliable. Follow-up utilizing objective measures is&#xD;
      essential for monitoring efficacy of treatment in pedophilia. Our study supports the&#xD;
      supposition that modification of pedophilic behavior is possible. LA may augment&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy and help break the sequence leading to a reoffense.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hormone therapy is aimed at modification of the basic sex drive, whereas cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      psychotherapy targets cognitive processes that precede all events leading to pedophilic&#xD;
      behavior. Obsession/compulsion and sex drive might affect the decision process. Because of a&#xD;
      suggested relationship between obsessive compulsive disorder and paraphilias, SSRIs have been&#xD;
      utilized. Most reports have been documented from individual case studies or uncontrolled,&#xD;
      retrospective studies (Kafka, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reports of the efficacy of drug therapy for suppression of sexual drive and modification of&#xD;
      behavior continue to emerge. The anti-androgens, MPA and CPA, are the most widely used drugs.&#xD;
      They provide variable testosterone suppression, dependent on dose. LHRH inhibitors and GNRH&#xD;
      agonists also provide profound testosterone suppression. More recently, triptorelin, an agent&#xD;
      similar to LA, (Rosler &amp; Wilztum, 1998) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)&#xD;
      have also been investigated (Raymond, Grant, Kim,.&amp; Colemen, 2002; Stein, Hollander, Anthony,&#xD;
      Schneier, Fallon, Liebowitz, Klein, 1992).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite recent advances in the use of testosterone-suppressing drugs for the treatment of&#xD;
      pedophilia, limited information is available in the form of well designed, controlled&#xD;
      objective studies. The lack of standardized, objective outcome measures has hampered&#xD;
      objective assessment of efficacy of interventions for pedophilia (Briken, Hill, &amp; Berner,&#xD;
      2003; Hanson et al., 2002; Marshall &amp; Barbaree, 1990). A multi-disciplinary team of experts&#xD;
      is needed to assess concurrent, objective physiologic measures of response. Though some&#xD;
      results of treatment are promising, a reliable, well-tolerated approach that can be&#xD;
      objectively monitored for efficacy is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aspects of behavior that are affected by therapy, as well as the efficacy,&#xD;
      limitations, and side effects of treatment need to be determined (Briken, Hill, &amp; Berner,&#xD;
      2003; Raymond, Robinson, Kraft, Rittberg, &amp; Coleman, 2001). The present study assessed the&#xD;
      impact of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy alone versus cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy&#xD;
      augmented with a potent testosterone-lowering drug, LA, for suppression of pedophilic urges&#xD;
      and arousability. The psychotherapy program comprised cognitive and behavioral therapy.&#xD;
      Objective assessments of sexual interest preference and physical arousal, as well as sexual&#xD;
      urges and masturbation, were monitored before, during, and after therapy. The research&#xD;
      objectives were to explore the relationship between testosterone level and sexual interest&#xD;
      preferences, physiologic responses to sexual stimuli (auditory and visual), and self-reported&#xD;
      sexual behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD Subjects Five men (M age, 50 years; range, 36-58), with a diagnosis of pedophilia&#xD;
      (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and who were &quot;out of denial&quot; were recruited for&#xD;
      study. Subjects were identified by a focus group of judges, attorneys, Probation and Parole&#xD;
      officials, representatives from the District Attorney's office and psychologists who were&#xD;
      invited to a seminar regarding the Lupron Project. After potential subjects were identified,&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator screened case histories to determine eligibility for study&#xD;
      inclusion (Table 1). These potential subjects were contacted by the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
      They were interviewed, informed of the study, and invited to participate. Three additional&#xD;
      subjects were screened, but excluded. These included one psychotic adult, one adolescent, and&#xD;
      one elderly, nonerectile adult. The study was conducted during a two-year period in a medical&#xD;
      research center in north western Pennsylvania. The study was reviewed and approved by the&#xD;
      local Institutional Review Board. All subjects provided informed consent. Participation was&#xD;
      voluntary and not a condition of probation or parole. The subjects were informed that they&#xD;
      would receive either a drug or placebo without an indication of duration of dose, the&#xD;
      sequence, nor if a sequence would occur. The subjects did not know one another. They lived in&#xD;
      diverse geographical locations and their only contact was during group cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IQ data were available for four of the five participants, all of whom had normal IQ's. The&#xD;
      fifth participant, on whom IQ data were unavailable, was not considered to be intellectually&#xD;
      impaired. Four of the five participants reported having been sexually abused during their&#xD;
      childhood. Each subject was more than 16 years old and at least five years older than the&#xD;
      victim when offending was initiated (Table II). At baseline, the self-reported numbers of&#xD;
      victims for the five subjects totaled 329.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four of five had served lengthy prison sentences (M, 7.8 years) for conviction of sexual&#xD;
      crimes. All subjects had previous treatment in penitentiary or community-based sexual&#xD;
      offender programs. Two had a history of major depression and two had a prior diagnosis of&#xD;
      alcoholism. Two subjects reported bisexual pedophilic preference; two exclusively&#xD;
      heterosexual preference; and one an exclusively homosexual preference. At baseline and&#xD;
      throughout the study, all five subjects met the DSM-IV criteria for pedophilia, as well as&#xD;
      antisocial personality disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Berger, Berner,&#xD;
      Bolterauer, Gutierrez, &amp; Berger, 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Five male pedophiles entered a prospective, repeated measures, nonrandomized,&#xD;
      masked study. All subjects and investigators, except the Principal Investigator (PI), Project&#xD;
      Director, and Study Coordinator, were masked. The PI administered the drug or placebo; the PI&#xD;
      and Project Director designed the study and were cognizant of the dosing schedule; and the&#xD;
      Coordinator was responsible for supply of study drug. However, the PI, Project Director, and&#xD;
      Coordinator were not involved in direct data collection or evaluation of the subjects. Each&#xD;
      subject served as his own control. Subjects received weekly cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      psychotherapy for 24 months and LA depot injection, 7.5 mg at baseline and 22.5 mg at months&#xD;
      1, 4, 7, and 10. Flutamide (250 mg TID for 14 days) was only administered with the first&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flutamide is an acetanilid, nonsteroidal, orally active anti-androgen that exerts its&#xD;
      anti-androgenic action by inhibiting androgen uptake and/or by inhibiting nuclear binding of&#xD;
      androgen in target tissues or both. Flutamide has been demonstrated to interfere with&#xD;
      testosterone at the cellular level. This can complement medical castration achieved with LHRH&#xD;
      agonists that suppress testicular androgen production by inhibiting luteinizing hormone&#xD;
      secretion (Brogden, 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial injection, subjects were sequestered for one week for community protection.&#xD;
      After one year of therapy, LA was discontinued and saline placebo substituted. At baseline,&#xD;
      one month after initiation of LA therapy, and then at 3-month intervals, subjects underwent&#xD;
      Abel Assessment, Monarch Penile Plethysmography (PPG), polygraph, physical examinations,&#xD;
      laboratory studies, radiology studies, and psychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abel Assessment (Abel Screening, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia) Abel Assessment, a combination of&#xD;
      self-report and visual reaction time (VRT), was utilized according to manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions (Abel Screening, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia). Assessments were conducted by a&#xD;
      trained clinical staff member (Abel, Huffman, Warberg, &amp; Holland, 1998; Letourneau, 2002). A&#xD;
      questionnaire was also administered. The combined questionnaire and VRT results included&#xD;
      evaluation for 21 sexual interests, including paraphilias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess VRT (the amount of time a subject viewed a picture), a slide projector was used to&#xD;
      present still images of models onto a 12-inch computer screen. Models were clothed, generally&#xD;
      in swimsuits, and none were in sexual positions. Twenty-one stimulus categories, representing&#xD;
      21 potential sexual interests with approximately seven slides in each category, were viewed&#xD;
      by the subject. Slides depicted Caucasian and African American males and females comprising&#xD;
      preschool and school-age children, adolescents, and adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An examiner met individually with each subject and instructed him on advancing and rating the&#xD;
      slides. The subject viewed the slides in a dimly lit, quiet cubicle. After a practice&#xD;
      session, the subject completed the VRT in private. After viewing each slide, participants&#xD;
      rated each slide on a scale from 1 (extremely sexually repulsive) to 7 (extremely sexually&#xD;
      interesting). A computer recorded the amount of time a subject viewed and rated each slide.&#xD;
      Data from the second viewing time were utilized by Abel Screening, Inc. to compute the&#xD;
      z-scores. These were provided to the investigator in graph form, with a score for&#xD;
      self-reported interest. Per manufacturer's instructions, the Abel &quot;rule of thirds&quot; was&#xD;
      utilized to define the predominant sexual preference. Because of the large number of sexual&#xD;
      preference choices generated by the Abel method, a modification was adopted. For this study,&#xD;
      predominant sexual preference was defined as a relative visual reaction time z-score  1 SD.&#xD;
      The number of times each stimulus was  1 SD was recorded. If only one or none of the SDs&#xD;
      were  1, the two highest scores were recorded. This modification resulted in an objective&#xD;
      measure of only those selections that stimulated the longest VRT (Table III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To illustrate the difference in the modified Abel and the Abel &quot;Methods of Thirds&quot;, subject #&#xD;
      1 self- reported an interest in adolescent and adult males. His known victims were boys aged&#xD;
      12 to 17. Using the Abel &quot;Method of Thirds&quot; per manufacturer instructions, the interest&#xD;
      preferences included young and adolescent females, and young, adolescent, and adult males.&#xD;
      Using the modified Abel, the selection was truncated to adolescent and adult males, the exact&#xD;
      interest preferences self-reported by the patient (Table III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Z-scores for each stimulus set were reported at baseline, on LA, and off LA, respectively.&#xD;
      Assessments were compared before, during, and after treatment to determine if VRT associated&#xD;
      with pedophilic interest preferences changed with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that lowering testosterone to castrate levels would affect penile responsiveness and&#xD;
      potentially affect the Monarch PPG monitoring, the Abel Assessment was incorporated into the&#xD;
      study with the anticipation that pedophilic sexual preference could still be potentially&#xD;
      detected by visual reaction time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monarch PPG (Behavioral Technology, Inc., Salt Lake City, Utah) The Monarch Adult Projective&#xD;
      Audio Visual Set, Version 5 (Salt Lake City, Utah) was a commercially available set of&#xD;
      standardized stimulus materials that was used to assess all subjects. The stimuli contained&#xD;
      audio and visual depictions of males and females comprising preschool and grammar school&#xD;
      children, adolescents, and adults. The audio scripts were based on a projective, rather than&#xD;
      explicit, portrayal of sexual activity. Unlike most other PPG visual stimuli, the set&#xD;
      contained clothed pictures of children (all child models were shown in bathing suits or&#xD;
      underwear). No lewd or provocative poses were presented (Byrne, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this procedure, the subject was seated in a reclining chair located in a private room&#xD;
      equipped with an intercom. The audiovisual stimulus materials were presented via headphones&#xD;
      on a 14-inch television monitor. Stimulus presentation and collection of penile, galvanic&#xD;
      skin response (GSR), and respiration data were recorded and coordinated by a&#xD;
      microprocessor-based Monarch Data Recording Device (DRD) (Behavioral Technology, Inc., Salt&#xD;
      Lake City, Utah).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Penile circumference changes were measured using an indium gallium gauge supplied by&#xD;
      Behavioral Technology, Inc. The signal from the indium gallium gauge was amplified by 1000;&#xD;
      data retrieval was set at a rate of 10 samples per second. Each penile gauge was calibrated&#xD;
      to a full range of 3.0 cm before each assessment to ensure that the correlation between&#xD;
      circumference and deflection was linear. GSR electrodes and respiration belts were also used&#xD;
      for deterrence and potential detection of faking or suppression attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the assessment were compiled and analyzed using Monarch Adult Male Software Version&#xD;
      3.22f. This software guided the collection, management, and initial analysis of the PPG data.&#xD;
      The software analyzed the PPG data and provided maximum scores and area- under-the-curve&#xD;
      scores for each of the 22 segments of the test. A maximum penile tumescence score was&#xD;
      calculated for each subject for each category of stimuli. For the purposes of this study,&#xD;
      maximum penile tumescence was defined as any response above 20 points (.60 cm), which is 20%&#xD;
      of the calibration of the gauge. Murphy and Barbaree (1994) argued that a minimum level for&#xD;
      significance was 20%. To meet this requirement, a response was considered to be significant&#xD;
      if it was at least 20/100-scaled units from the beginning of the stimulus detumesced level.&#xD;
      Kuban, Barbaree, and Blanchard (1999) also suggested that this criterion was conservative.&#xD;
      Subject's PPG calibration and projected full-scale responding were set to 3.0 cm. Thus, the&#xD;
      cutoff of 20 points for significant responding falls within the 20% minimum criterion for&#xD;
      significant responding. The subject's PPG calibration and projected full-scale responding&#xD;
      were set to 3.0 cm circumference. A repeated measures ANOVA was performed on the PPG data to&#xD;
      assess significant changes in arousal level throughout the study ( = .05). To assess sexual&#xD;
      preferences, raw data for each subject were transformed to z-scores. The z-scores for each&#xD;
      stimulus were recorded at baseline, on LA, and off LA. All the responses  1 SD, or the two&#xD;
      highest responses, were recorded. Finally, a subject's classification as&#xD;
      pedophilic/nonpedophilic was determined by using a deviance differential (Harris, Rice,&#xD;
      Quinsey, Chaplin, &amp; Earls, 1992). This was calculated using z-score data and taking the&#xD;
      highest response to adults (male and female segments) minus the highest response to infants&#xD;
      and children (male or female preschool or grammar school age). The adolescent segment was&#xD;
      excluded from analysis. For the purposes of data analysis, deviance differential scores&#xD;
      greater than 0 were classified as nonpedophilic and scores less than 0 as pedophilic. A&#xD;
      deviance differential of O would mean that the subject was just as aroused to children as to&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects were assessed at baseline. One subject #1 did not respond to a level of clinical&#xD;
      significance (20 points). Further inspection revealed that this client did not obtain a&#xD;
      significant response at any point during the two-year study. He was removed from the analysis&#xD;
      of the PPG data (repeated measures ANOVA) because low level data generated from a&#xD;
      circumferential PPG transducer were not considered reliable (Kuban et al., 1999; Barbaree &amp;&#xD;
      Mewhort, 1994).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polygraph&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Axciton Computerized Polygraph System (Axciton Systems, Houston, Texas) and the Lafayette&#xD;
      Instrument LX-4000 (Lafayette Instrument Co., Lafayette, Indiana) were utilized. The examiner&#xD;
      was certified by the Colorado Sex Offender Management Board. For purposes of score&#xD;
      reliability and validity confirmation, the results were both scored by hand and scored using&#xD;
      the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory Polyscore computer scoring algorithm (Heil,&#xD;
      Ahlmeyer, Simons, &amp; English, 1999). Hand scoring is recognized by the American Polygraph&#xD;
      Association as the most accurate and reliable method of scoring. It was the only method used&#xD;
      to evaluate the data. The algorithm was used as a quality control check of the hand scoring&#xD;
      method. Subjects provided a separate informed consent before the first polygraph examination.&#xD;
      The test was administered in a private office. The examination took an average of two hours.&#xD;
      Subjects were tested every three months. Polygraph was standardized by an American Polygraph&#xD;
      Association approved test procedure and was administered by a single experienced examiner,&#xD;
      who was blinded to the dosing protocol. The polygraph examination process contained pretest&#xD;
      and posttest components. The examiner worked closely with the psychotherapist in developing&#xD;
      appropriate polygraph questions for confirmation of the disclosed number of victims and&#xD;
      offenses, discovery of new offenses, and or compliance with study conditions. This study&#xD;
      examined past victim and offense admissions data, as well as responses evaluating 30&#xD;
      paraphilias (Table IV). The pretest established which questions the examiner would ask based&#xD;
      on the subject's self report of new admissions of past offending or the absence of&#xD;
      accountability statements for known offending behaviors (identified in prison histories). The&#xD;
      subject's cardiovascular, respiratory, and galvanic skin resistance were assessed in response&#xD;
      to three specific key questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the past three months, have you masturbated to sexual thoughts about anyone under the&#xD;
           age of 18?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the past three months, have you purposely withheld important sexual information from&#xD;
           your therapist?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In the past three months, have you had strong urges to initiate sexual contact with&#xD;
           anyone under 18 years old? No consequences were imposed for deceptive responses. The&#xD;
           therapist and polygrapher worked closely and debriefed the subject after each assessment&#xD;
           to identify areas for counseling, behaviors to be monitored, and issues detected on&#xD;
           polygraph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy The psychotherapy program comprised cognitive and&#xD;
      behavioral therapy. The weekly sessions were co-facilitated by two therapists. After&#xD;
      establishing the rules for group therapy, psychotherapists guided participants through a&#xD;
      basic group curriculum that included breaking down defense mechanisms, identifying the&#xD;
      typology of sex offenders, and discussing the effects of sexual abuse on victims. The&#xD;
      counseling component involved insight-oriented cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy. This&#xD;
      provided a dynamic understanding of unconscious conflicts and interpersonal issues as they&#xD;
      related to each participant's offense cycle. Relapse prevention plans were constructed with&#xD;
      and for each participant. This self-controlled program was designed to teach offenders how to&#xD;
      recognize and intervene when they were behaving in a manner that would lead to a re-offense.&#xD;
      Relapse prevention enabled the individual to maintain the newly adopted behavior pattern,&#xD;
      such as refraining from deviant thoughts and actions. The relapse prevention plans described&#xD;
      red flags, offense cycles, interventions, and changes in thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and&#xD;
      behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychopathology The Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) was utilized to assess&#xD;
      subject's psychopathology (Hare, 1998). The Minnesota Sex Offender Screening Tool-Revised&#xD;
      (MnSOST-R) identified the most violent offenders and those offenders likely to re-offend&#xD;
      (Epperson et al., 1999). The Static-99, another sexual offender risk assessment, measured&#xD;
      long-term risk potential for child molesters (Hanson &amp; Thornton, 1999). The Yale-Brown&#xD;
      Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was utilized because of an inferred relationship between&#xD;
      obsessive compulsive disorder and sexual paraphilias (Goodman et al., 1989).&#xD;
