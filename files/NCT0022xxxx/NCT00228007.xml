      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of antidepressant medication treatment in reducing&#xD;
      HIV risk behaviors in intravenous drug users with depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression and injection drug use often come hand-in-hand. This is especially true in&#xD;
      populations with limited access to mental health care and with a high risk of illness and HIV&#xD;
      transmission. Depressed injection drug users in these populations usually continue their drug&#xD;
      use for extended periods of time, thereby further promoting the spread of HIV. This cycle has&#xD;
      created a significant public health problem. It is necessary to explore new approaches to&#xD;
      facilitate and maintain long-term behavior changes within this population. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with antidepressant medications in reducing HIV risk&#xD;
      behaviors in depressed intravenous drug users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this open label study will be randomly assigned to receive either&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment or no treatment. Participants in the treatment group will meet with&#xD;
      a psychiatrist monthly for 12 months. Based on psychiatric evaluations and participants'&#xD;
      medical histories, doctors will prescribe an appropriate antidepressant medication or a&#xD;
      combination of medications. Participants in the treatment group may also receive referrals&#xD;
      for other services if necessary. Participants assigned to receive no treatment will be&#xD;
      contacted at Months 3 and 9 to verify their contact information; they will also receive any&#xD;
      necessary referrals. All participants will partake in interviews at baseline and Months 6 and&#xD;
      12 to assess changes in HIV risk behavior and depressive symptoms.&#xD;
