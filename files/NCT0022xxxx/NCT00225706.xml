    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study of Caldolor administered to febrile hospitalized&#xD;
      pediatric patients every 6 hours for 24 hours is to determine the clinical equivalence of a&#xD;
      single dose of Caldolor compared to acetaminophen (paracetamol; APAP) for the treatment of&#xD;
      fever as measured by the AUC Tº within the first 6 hours of treatment (as compared to a&#xD;
      target temperature of 98.6ºF [37.0ºC]).&#xD;

          3. Have new (not chronic, within last 7 days) onset of fever, documented by temperature&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 101.0ºF (38.3ºC) (The preferred method of temperature&#xD;
             measurement is core. The route of temperature measurement used immediately before&#xD;
             randomization should be used immediately before dosing and for all temperature&#xD;
             measurements during the Treatment Period.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have written informed consent provided by legal parent, guardian, or authorized agent,&#xD;

             assessments (Where appropriate, participants of appropriate intellectual maturity&#xD;
             should personally provide written informed assent; age of assent may be determined by&#xD;
             Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) or Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) or be&#xD;
             consistent with local legal requirements.)&#xD;

             intracranial surgery or stroke within the previous 30 days, or have any history of&#xD;
             intracerebral arteriovenous malformation, cerebral aneurysm, or central nervous system&#xD;
             mass lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have a history of febrile convulsion or have a sibling with a history of febrile&#xD;
             convulsion&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have a history of congenital bleeding diatheses (e.g., hemophilia) or any active&#xD;
             clinically significant bleeding, or have underlying platelet dysfunction, including&#xD;
             (but not limited to) idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, disseminated intravascular&#xD;
             coagulation, or congenital platelet dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have gastrointestinal bleeding that has required medical intervention within the&#xD;
             previous 6 weeks, unless definitive surgery has been performed&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Have platelet count less than 30,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Be receiving full dose anticoagulation therapy (Prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin&#xD;
             is acceptable.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Have fever secondary to blood or drug reaction&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Have an expected life span of less than 14 days because of imminent withdrawal of life&#xD;
             support or severity of illness&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Be receiving ongoing or imminent treatment with corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Have neurogenic fever&#xD;
&#xD;
