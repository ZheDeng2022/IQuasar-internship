  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last decade, there has been an explosion of new knowledge of the neuroscientific basis&#xD;
      of alcohol-seeking behavior. Briefly, medications that modulate mesolimbic dopamine pathways&#xD;
      by facilitating gamma amino butyric function and inhibiting the action of excitatory amino&#xD;
      acids should reliably diminish alcohol's rewarding effects. Topiramate (a&#xD;
      sulfamate-substituted fructo-pyranose derivative) has these characteristics. In support of&#xD;
      this concept, we have shown in a phase-II-type medications clinical trial that topiramate is&#xD;
      significantly superior to placebo at improving drinking outcomes and decreasing craving among&#xD;
      (N = 150) alcohol-dependent individuals. Using the carefully controlled environment of the&#xD;
      human laboratory, we are submitting a revised application containing a set of systematic&#xD;
      studies to assess directly the mechanistic neuropharmacological processes that are associated&#xD;
      with topiramate's anti-drinking effects. This will provide a more comprehensive understanding&#xD;
      of the neurobiology of alcohol-seeking behavior and aid in the development of even more&#xD;
      effective compounds for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Thus, the specific aims of the&#xD;
      project are to: 1) determine the dose-relationship of acute effects of topiramate to reduce&#xD;
      alcohol effects related to its abuse and addiction potential. We hypothesize that topiramate&#xD;
      will reduce alcohol-induced craving, reward, and euphoria; 2) determine whether chronic&#xD;
      treatment with an acutely effective dose of topiramate produces substantial reductions in&#xD;
      alcohol-related cue-induced craving, thereby decreasing the potential for treatment relapse.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that chronic topiramate administration will desensitize (reduce) alcohol&#xD;
      craving produced by alcohol-related sensory cues; and 3) determine whether topiramate&#xD;
      interactions with and without alcohol are associated with neurocognitive impairment. Clinical&#xD;
      studies including ours have suggested that topiramate use may be associated with&#xD;
      neurocognitive effects such as loss of concentration and memory impairment. In our own study,&#xD;
      these effects were mild and not associated with reduced treatment compliance. Since alcohol's&#xD;
      ability to produce neurocognitive impairment may be mediated through similar ionic mechanisms&#xD;
      to that of topiramate, the proposed human laboratory setting affords us the unique&#xD;
      opportunity to more clearly delineate topiramate's neurocognitive effects in both the&#xD;
      presence and absence of alcohol. This study supports NIAAA's goal to develop effective&#xD;
      medications for treating alcoholism and to understand the basic underpinnings of the disease.&#xD;
