    <textblock>
      Lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease of unknown origin which is classified according&#xD;
      to its clinical features, the course, and laboratory findings. A rough classification divides&#xD;
      lupus erythematosus into three subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. discoid lupus erythematosus (dLE),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (scLE), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. systemic lupus erythematosus (sLEsLE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The onset of lupus erythematosus affects women three times more frequently than men, with an&#xD;
      onset between the 20th and 40th years of life. It is often aggravated or triggered by&#xD;
      multiple factors like UV-light, mainly UV-A, hormones (thyroid diseases), pregnancy, oral&#xD;
      contraceptives, stress or trauma. Some medications might also play a role as triggering&#xD;
      substances, for example antibiotics, psychotropic drugs, beta blockers, procainamide,&#xD;
      diuretics, piroxicam, and griseofulvin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus (sLEsLE) is 12 to 50/100.000 population&#xD;
      worldwide, the incidence is 2 to 8/100.000 per year. Skin disease is one of the most frequent&#xD;
      clinical complaints of patients suffering from sLEsLE. It has been found to occur in up to&#xD;
      70% of patients during the course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interesting subgroups of LE that are part of the study population suffer from discoid&#xD;
      lupus erythematosus (dLE) or subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (scLE) (Fritsch, 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discoid lupus erythematosus is the most common form of the chronic forms of cutaneous LE. It&#xD;
      is a very chronic inflammatory disease consisting of fixed, indurated, erythematous papules&#xD;
      and plaques that are often distributed on the head and neck. Without intervention, dLE&#xD;
      lesions may last for many years and are associated with extensive scarring. When dLE occurs&#xD;
      on the scalp, permanent scarring and alopecia may result. If the initial work-up of a patient&#xD;
      with localized lesion of dLE does not reveal evidence of sLEsLE, the risk of developing&#xD;
      sLEsLE is low, about 5%. When dLE lesions are generalized, this risk is slightly higher.&#xD;
      However, dLE lesions are not uncommon in patients with an established diagnosis of sLEsLE.&#xD;
      About 25% of sLEsLE patients will develop lesions of dLE at some time in the course of their&#xD;
      disease (Fitzpatrick, 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (scLE) was first described in the late 1970s. These&#xD;
      patients suffer from cutaneous lesions which have an eruption that is more persistent than&#xD;
      that of acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (&quot;butterfly rash&quot;), lasting weeks to months or&#xD;
      longer. The lesions of scLE consist of scaly, superficial, inflammatory macules, patches,&#xD;
      papules, and plaques, that are photodistributed, particularly on the upper chest and back,&#xD;
      lateral neck, and dorsal arms and forearms. Several different morphologic types of scLE have&#xD;
      been described: annular lesions, and two types of papulosquamous lesions, psoriasiform and&#xD;
      pityriasiform. About 50% of the patients with scLE will fulfil four or more criteria for the&#xD;
      classification of sLEsLE, though most of the scLE patients do not experience serious renal or&#xD;
      CNS involvement of lupus erythematosus. Typically, they suffer from skin disease,&#xD;
      photosensitivity, and musculoskeletal complaints. Dry eyes and a dry mouth are also not&#xD;
      uncommon. Some patients with scLE experience severe manifestations of SLEsLE, and thus all&#xD;
      scLE patients should be monitored for systemic disease (Fitzpatrick, 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequently, cutaneous complaints are of most concern to patients with scLE and dLE, and thus&#xD;
      dermatologists are generally the physicians managing this disease. Broad spectrum sunscreens&#xD;
      and sun-protective measures, including lifestyle-changes and clothing are perhaps the most&#xD;
      important initial measures. Some patients respond to potent topical steroids. Oral&#xD;
      antimalarial therapy is also beneficial in many patients. Less commonly used treatments&#xD;
      include dapsone, gold, immunosuppressive drugs, retinoids, and systemic steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatment with potent topical corticosteroids is very effective but longtime&#xD;
      application can provoke atrophy and fragility of the skin as well as telangiectasias erythema&#xD;
      perstans, perioral dermatitis and steroid acne. Systemic resorption depending on the dosage,&#xD;
      area, and way of application resulting in terms of a dysfunction of the&#xD;
      hypothalamus-hypophysis axis has been described (Korting, 1992). Contact allergies are very&#xD;
      uncommon, but have been reported (Lauerma et al. 1993).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main concern is the skin atrophy following long-term application of topical&#xD;
      corticosteroids. Therefore the need for alternatives is evident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pimecrolimus is an ascomycin and macrolactam derivative, acting as a calcineurin inhibitor&#xD;
      which binds calcineurin (Dissemond et al, 2002). The consequence of calcineurin binding is a&#xD;
      lack of activation of both T helper cell types 1 and 2. Further effects of these compounds&#xD;
      have been suggested on other inflammatory cells, such as Langerhans cells and mast&#xD;
      cells/basophils. Both entities, dLE and scLE are characterized by B-cell activation due to&#xD;
      affected T-cell activation and the formation of multiple autoantibodies. This results, among&#xD;
      other symptoms, in inflammatory infiltrates, especially on the face. Pimecrolimus cream is&#xD;
      already approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Furthermore, there have been studies&#xD;
      in other indications like psoriasis, allergic and irritant dermatitis. Pimecrolimus has been&#xD;
      developed for the potential treatment of psoriasis, allergic, irritant and atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
      Animal studies with tacrolimus ointment cream used for lupus dermatoses have shown to be&#xD;
      promising (Neckermann et al., 2000; Meingassner et al. 1997; Bochelen et al. 1999). Topical&#xD;
      tacrolimus therapy was applied to facial skin lesions in 7 cases of cutaneous lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus (cLE). Three systemic LE and one discoid showed a marked regression of their&#xD;
      skin lesions after tacrolimus therapy, but three patients with discoid LE were resistant to&#xD;
      the therapy. A good response was observed for facial erythematosus lesions with edematous or&#xD;
      telangiectatic changes in systemic LE (Yoshimasu et al, 2002, Furukawa et al., 2002). In&#xD;
      discoid LE with typical discoid lesions, tacrolimus brought no improvement. Pimecrolimus&#xD;
      seems to be more promising than tacrolimus due to the altered skin penetration profile.&#xD;
      Topical pimecrolimus cream, in contrast to corticosteroids, does not provoke any skin atrophy&#xD;
      (Dissemond et al., 2002; Queille-Roussel et al.; 2001) and might be a good alternative to the&#xD;
      standard treatment of potent corticosteroids, even if only a part of the patient population&#xD;
      will respond to Elidel® treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical formulations of pimecrolimus cream have been shown to be effective in atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis, chronic irritant hand dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, and also in&#xD;
      psoriasis, but in this case, under semi-occlusive conditions. Pharmacokinetic studies with&#xD;
      pimecrolimus cream 1% indicate a consistently low systemic exposure in infants, children and&#xD;
      adults with atopic dermatitis regardless of the extent of lesions treated and of the duration&#xD;
      of therapy. These results support the twice daily administration of pimecrolimus cream in&#xD;
      long-term use on an as needed basis, with no limitation on the duration of treatment and on&#xD;
      the extent of skin surface area treated. The pimecrolimus cream 1% and the corresponding&#xD;
      vehicle were devoid of significant irritation, contact sensitization, phototoxic, or&#xD;
      photoallergic potential, in the standard local tolerability studies in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be without occlusion, since occlusive treatment is not considered&#xD;
      clinically relevant for the areas on the face in lupus erythematosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Untreated lupus plaques in the same patient show equal expression of the clinical signs of&#xD;
      erythema, induration and scaling. This allows the possibility to design a within-patient&#xD;
      study to compare the various formulations of interest for efficacy and local tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic absorption is very low. A pharmacokinetic study of patients with atopic dermatitis&#xD;
      who applied 1% pimecrolimus cream twice daily for three weeks did not show any absorption in&#xD;
      72% of the cases. Side effects were not observed (van Leent et al., 1998 a and b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the biological profile, a clinical hypothesis is formulated claiming that Elidel®&#xD;
      is well tolerated and effective in the treatment of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (scLE and&#xD;
      dLE). This study is designed to test this hypothesis.&#xD;
