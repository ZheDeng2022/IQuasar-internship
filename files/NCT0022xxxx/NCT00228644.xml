  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Availability of sulfur amino acids (SAA) is critical for glutathione/glutathione disulfide&#xD;
      (GSH/GSSG) and cysteine/cystine (CYS/CYSS) redox in vivo and for many other physiologic&#xD;
      functions including protein synthesis, nitrogen balance, digestion, osmotic regulation,&#xD;
      detoxification, hormonal regulation, biologic methylations, and cell growth regulation. GSH&#xD;
      conjugation and sulfate conjugation represent quantitatively important pathways for chemical&#xD;
      detoxification, which imposes substantial burden upon SAA supply. The primary hypothesis is&#xD;
      that SAA deficient diet and acetaminophen (APAP) administration will perturb Cys metabolism&#xD;
      and GSH redox homeostasis in human plasma and urinary output of SAA metabolites. Because both&#xD;
      of these variations affect SAA homeostasis, it is believed that the combination of these&#xD;
      treatments will produce an interactive effect in which 2-day SAA deficiency will alter APAP&#xD;
      metabolism, APAP will affect SAA homeostasis, and the treatments together will alter the&#xD;
      global metabolic profile, as measured by 1H-NMR spectroscopy.&#xD;

      The objectives of this research are to evaluate toxicological perturbations of metabolism due&#xD;
      to complex chemical mixtures and diet-chemical interactions using high-resolution 1H-NMR.&#xD;
      These experiments are designed to provide data on the extent of normal variation in metabolic&#xD;
      profiles within healthy individuals and, in combination with key GSH redox measurements, will&#xD;
      show whether changes due to chemical exposure and diet can be discriminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the current protocol are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether SAA-free diet (2 days) and APAP (2 doses at 15 mg/kg) independently&#xD;
           alter SAA homeostasis and metabolism and thiol-disulfide redox state (GSH/GSSG and&#xD;
           Cys/CySS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether 2 doses of APAP interact with SAA-free diet (2 days) in effects on&#xD;
           plasma GSH concentration and redox state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To use 1H-NMR spectroscopy to determine whether metabolic changes induced by the&#xD;
           combined exposure to APAP and SAA-free diet are quantitatively or qualitatively&#xD;
           different from that induced by either alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sulfur amino acids are involved in central metabolic processes. The sulfur-containing amino&#xD;
      acids, methionine and cysteine, are required for diverse, critical biologic functions,&#xD;
      including protein synthesis, methylation, fatty acid metabolism, osmotic regulation and&#xD;
      regulation of cell division and growth (1-5). Methionine (Met) is an essential amino acid and&#xD;
      is metabolized in individuals by the transulfuration pathway to form cysteine (Cys) (6). In&#xD;
      addition to use in the primary sequence of most proteins, both Met and Cys are required for&#xD;
      other metabolic functions. Met is converted to S-adenosylmethionine, which is used for&#xD;
      methylation reactions (1) for structural and functional modifications of proteins, RNA and&#xD;
      DNA, as well as synthesis of phospholipids and signaling molecules. Cysteine is used for&#xD;
      biosynthesis of glutathione (GSH) and sulfate (2). GSH functions in redox regulation (7) and&#xD;
      detoxification of oxidants and reactive electrophiles (8); sulfate is used as a structural&#xD;
      component of oligosaccharides (3), transport of steroid hormones (4) and detoxification of&#xD;
      foreign compounds (9). Because the SAA are irreversibly modified in the aforementioned&#xD;
      processes, there is a requirement for adequate sulfur amino acid intake that extends beyond&#xD;
      the need for adequate amounts to maintain normal protein synthesis and turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sulfur amino acid intake in humans is variable and optimal SAA intake has not been adequately&#xD;
      defined. The Recommended Dietary Allowance for SAA is based upon nitrogen and sulfur amino&#xD;
      acid balance studies and for an adult male is about 1 g (210 mg Met plus 800 mg Met or Cys)&#xD;
      (10,11). The average American diet contains about 100 g/d of protein (2); the mean SAA intake&#xD;
      is about 2.4 g, but there is a large variation, ranging from &lt; 0.3 g to &gt; 5 g (12). Most of&#xD;
      the SAA is derived from animal protein, which constitutes about 2/3 of the protein intake.&#xD;
      Except for legumes and some nuts, a gram of plant-derived protein contains only 10-20% of the&#xD;
      SAA content of animal protein (13,14). Because plant-derived foods are low in total protein,&#xD;
      individuals who do not consume animal protein are at risk of SAA deficiency. The number of&#xD;
      Americans with low dietary intake of SAA is relatively small, but most people undergo&#xD;
      intermittent periods of SAA deficiency due to food selection, dieting, fasting and illness.&#xD;
      The non-protein content of Cys in human liver is about 1 g, largely present in GSH, and&#xD;
      approximates the daily SAA requirement (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemical detoxification places a burden upon SAA supply. GSH conjugation and sulfate&#xD;
      conjugation represent common and quantitatively important pathways for metabolism of foreign&#xD;
      compounds. One example, which is proposed for use in the present study, is acetaminophen&#xD;
      (APAP). About 15% of APAP is excreted as the parent compound and about 55% is metabolized by&#xD;
      conjugation with glucuronic acid (16-18). The remainder is metabolized by conjugation with&#xD;
      sulfate (25%) and GSH (5%). If one considers the metabolism of 4 doses of maximum strength&#xD;
      acetaminophen (MW 151), i.e., 4 g daily, will consume 200 mg of Cys during GSH conjugation&#xD;
      and 1 g of Cys to supply sulfate for conjugation (15). Without added sulfate or sulfite in&#xD;
      the diet, most of the sulfate is derived from dietary SAA (2,19). Thus, the total equivalents&#xD;
      of SAA needed for metabolism of the maximum daily dose of APAP is greater than the RDA for&#xD;
      SAA. Thus, an interaction between APAP intake and SAA deficiency is expected, and this&#xD;
      interaction may be significant even at normal therapeutic dosing and a relatively modest&#xD;
      level (e.g., 1 or 2 days) of SAA insufficiency. We propose that this will provide a useful&#xD;
      model to investigate chemical interactions in humans and the major metabolites of APAP and&#xD;
      Cys are readily measurable so that the converse effects, APAP on SAA metabolism and SAA&#xD;
      availability on APAP metabolism, can be determined. Both Cys deficiency and APAP metabolism&#xD;
      affect GSH homeostasis, and our clinical assay for GSH redox (7, 20-21) provides a sensitive&#xD;
      means to evaluate interactive effects of these 2 experimental manipulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High resolution 1H-NMR and mass spectrometry provides an approach to investigate complex&#xD;
      metabolic effects of diet. Traditional methods to investigate interactive effects of chemical&#xD;
      exposure have relied upon detection of specific pathologic and physiologic responses for&#xD;
      combinations with specific biologic activities. An alternate approach is to use available&#xD;
      high resolution metabolic analyses (22) combined with bioinformatic tools, to examine&#xD;
      metabolic effects of chemical interactions in a global manner. In principle, by&#xD;
      simultaneously examining effects on hundreds of metabolites, this approach provides the&#xD;
      possibility to detect unanticipated interactive effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A guiding principle for development of high-resolution metabolic analyses is that metabolic&#xD;
      profiles in healthy individuals share common features while toxicologic and pathologic&#xD;
      consequences of diet, disease, environment or genetics are reflected in variations in that&#xD;
      metabolic profile. Studies in rodents show that characteristic patterns of metabolic change&#xD;
      are associated with organ-specific toxicity for chemical agents that share no structural&#xD;
      similarity (23-24). If this approach is extended to humans to identify healthy and unhealthy&#xD;
      metabolic profiles, such patterns could provide a powerful new approach to identify and&#xD;
      diagnose toxicities associated with chemical mixtures and diet-drug interactions. This&#xD;
      proposal is to conduct a pilot study to determine whether diet-drug interactions can be&#xD;
      detected in metabolic patterns of healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that if the environment is controlled and specific chemical exposures are changed&#xD;
      (e.g., +APAP, +dietary SAA), we will observe metabolic changes that can be ascribed to the&#xD;
      respective exposures. High resolution 1H-NMR, liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry&#xD;
      (MS) are well suited for investigating changes in body fluid composition because a large&#xD;
      number of metabolites are present in body fluids, many metabolites can be detected&#xD;
      simultaneously. Examples are available from the studies of Nicholson and coworkers (23,&#xD;
      24).The use of multivariate statistical analysis of NMR data to evaluate metabolic responses&#xD;
      of living systems is under development for toxicologic screening of pharmacologic compounds&#xD;
      (25). The principles for detection of chemical interactions in free-living humans are the&#xD;
      same; in effect, changes in metabolic profile are expected to provide a sensitive means to&#xD;
      non-invasively detect conditions of risk for toxicity and pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considerable information is available concerning the assignment of NMR spectra of urine and&#xD;
      plasma (e.g., Ref 23-25, 36-37); this information will provide a useful guide to possible&#xD;
      metabolites which could vary as a function of SAA intake and APAP exposure. 2-D NMR and other&#xD;
      techniques are available for peak identification. However, the goals of this project do not&#xD;
      require identification of which chemical species change, only whether changes at specific&#xD;
      frequencies can be attributed to variation in SAA intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance. While there is general consensus that chemical interactions pose significant&#xD;
      human health risks, identification of such risk remains a largely intractable problem.&#xD;
      Detailed metabolic analyses combined with bioinformatic methods provides a potentially&#xD;
      powerful approach to identify such risk in terms of perturbed metabolic profile. However, the&#xD;
      large variety of foods and drugs consumed by different individuals complicates the already&#xD;
      difficult task to distinguish between signal and noise and validate stability and recovery&#xD;
      for hundreds of metabolites. The significance of the current proposal is that we will use&#xD;
      repetitive measures within individuals under highly controlled environmental and dietary&#xD;
      conditions to determine whether exposure to a chemical under non-toxic conditions results in&#xD;
      a sufficient perturbation of metabolism to be detected by this promising analytical approach.&#xD;
      The results will show whether 1H-NMR has the sensitivity to detect metabolic effects due to&#xD;
      variations of chemical exposure and dietary intake that are common among humans. If so, the&#xD;
      results will establish that 1H-NMR analysis can be used not only to study consequences of&#xD;
      chemical toxicity but also to study risk of toxicity due to chemical interactions that occur&#xD;
      under usual occupational and therapeutic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. PRELIMINARY STUDIES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of GSH/GSSG redox to evaluate oxidative stress. This proposal is based upon our&#xD;
      long-standing efforts to understand the control and function of the GSH-dependent antioxidant&#xD;
      system in humans. The balance between GSH and GSSG is determined by the balance of oxidation&#xD;
      due to oxidative stress and the capacity of the NADPH-dependent reductase to reduce GSSG back&#xD;
      to GSH. Studies on the interactions of GSH and cysteine pools in human plasma revealed that&#xD;
      GSH redox characteristics are suitable for use as an indicator of the balance between&#xD;
      oxidative and antioxidant processes (26). In addition, our studies of human cells in culture&#xD;
      show that substantial variation in GSH/GSSG redox occurs during the normal life cycle of&#xD;
      cells (13, 27-28) and, most central to the present proposal, substantial oxidation can be&#xD;
      induced by Cys deficiency (29). These results imply that variation in GSH/GSSG redox may be&#xD;
      more than an indicator of oxidative stress, it may be an indicator of the cell survival/cell&#xD;
      death balance which is central to tissue homeostasis. With this interpretation, the GSH/GSSG&#xD;
      redox reflects underlying tissue health; an oxidized state serves as the platform for&#xD;
      toxicity regardless of whether this oxidation is due to a genetic abnormality, nutritional&#xD;
      deficiency, inflammation, or chemical exposure. Thus, any chemical exposure that results in&#xD;
      GSH oxidation or cysteine utilization should exacerbate effects due to limited cysteine&#xD;
      intake. Because a) sulfur amino acid deficiency is associated with oxidation of&#xD;
      thiol/disulfide redox, b) sulfur amino acids are required for so many different metabolic&#xD;
      processes, and c) so many enzymes are potentially affected by a change in thiol/disulfide&#xD;
      redox state, diverse metabolic effects may occur that are not readily predicable from the&#xD;
      metabolic profile of cysteine or from the metabolic pathways of chemicals detoxified by&#xD;
      cysteine-dependent pathways. Hence, a central question of the current proposal is whether a&#xD;
      chemical exposure which increases demand for sulfur SAA interacts with the dietary&#xD;
      availability of SAA to produce perturbations of metabolism that can be detected by high&#xD;
      resolution 1H-NMR spectroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies of GSH/GSSG redox variation. We made the surprising finding that substantial&#xD;
      oxidation (approximately 25 mV) was apparent in individuals &gt;60 compared to &lt;43 y old (30).&#xD;
      We also found that diabetic individuals were about 20 mV more oxidized than similarly aged&#xD;
      individuals without known disease. In a follow-up study, we found that GSH/GSSG redox as a&#xD;
      function of age was biphasic, with no apparent association with age below 45 y and a linear&#xD;
      oxidation with age after 50 y. Preliminary data from our study of diurnal variation in&#xD;
      GSH/GSSG redox status show that there was an increase in GSH during the evening and nighttime&#xD;
      hours and that the redox state was more reduced during this time period. These results are&#xD;
      consistent with rodent studies showing that hepatic GSH undergoes a diurnal variation linked&#xD;
      to sulfur amino acid intake (31-32). These results support our central hypothesis that sulfur&#xD;
      amino acid intake is a determinant of plasma GSH/GSSG redox state in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of chemical exposure on GSH redox in humans. We have performed 2 clinical studies&#xD;
      which indicate that chemical exposure alters sulfur amino acid homeostasis as detected by&#xD;
      changes in plasma GSH and Cys pools. As indicated above, one of these showed that GSH redox&#xD;
      became more oxidized as a consequence of chemotherapy (33). A second study showed that both&#xD;
      Cys and GSH pools were oxidized in individuals who smoked cigarettes compared to those who do&#xD;
      not (34, 38). Together, these studies indicate that chemical exposures can induce significant&#xD;
      changes in Cys and GSH homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interactions of GSH and cysteine pools in human plasma. To determine the interactions of the&#xD;
      GSH/GSSG and Cys/CySS pools, thiol and disulfide forms were measured in plasma from 24&#xD;
      healthy individuals aged 25-35 (26). In this study, GSH concentration correlated with Cys&#xD;
      concentration, but no correlations were observed between GSSG and CySS or between the reduced&#xD;
      and oxidized components. The lack of equilibration of these values supports the&#xD;
      interpretation that plasma GSH and Cys redox values are dynamic indicators of the systemic&#xD;
      balance between oxidative and antioxidant processes (26).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cys deficiency in vitro results in substantial oxidation of GSH/GSSG redox. In a study of Cys&#xD;
      deficiency and readdition of Cys in colon carcinoma HT29 cell line, we found that culture in&#xD;
      medium with low Cys and CySS resulted in decreased GSH and GSSG with an associated 80 mV&#xD;
      oxidation of the GSH/GSSG redox state (29). Upon addition of either Cys or CySS, redox of&#xD;
      GSH/GSSG recovered in 1 h while GSH concentration continued to increase over 8 h (33). These&#xD;
      results have now been confirmed in Hela cells and normal human retinal pigment epithelial&#xD;
      cells (not shown) indicating that variation in Cys availability to cells has a general effect&#xD;
      on GSH/GSSG redox state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidation of extracellular thiol/disulfide redox state sensitizes cells to chemical-induced&#xD;
      toxicity. Oxidative stress increases expression of death receptor components, Fas and Fas&#xD;
      ligand (35). To determine whether changes in thiol/disulfide redox state could affect&#xD;
      sensitivity to chemical toxicity, normal human retinal pigment epithelial cells were cultured&#xD;
      in media with systematic variations in Cys and CySS concentrations to give a range of redox&#xD;
      values found in vivo in human plasma and then treated with the oxidant t-butylhydroperoxide.&#xD;
      The results showed that cells cultured at more reduced redox states were more resistant to&#xD;
      oxidant-induced apoptosis than were cells cultured at more oxidized redox states. While it is&#xD;
      not yet clear how general this effect is with regard to other cell types and other chemicals,&#xD;
      the results suggest that the change in redox state, per se, may be an important determinant&#xD;
      of susceptibility to toxicity. Together with the above findings, these results provide strong&#xD;
      justification for exploring whether an interaction between chemical exposure and diet can&#xD;
      induce detectable redox changes and whether diverse metabolic consequences of variation in&#xD;
      thiol/disulfide redox state can be detected by high resolution metabolic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-resolution 1H-NMR of human urine. To examine the sensitivity of our instrumentation to&#xD;
      obtain NMR spectra suitable for measurements of metabolic changes in response to varied&#xD;
      sulfur amino acid intake, we obtained spectra from urine collected on 2 successive days&#xD;
      without and with oral supplementation with 3 g Cys. Samples (300 μl) were mixed with 150 μl&#xD;
      of 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 50 μl 2H2O prior to recording spectra with a&#xD;
      Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer. Although the data are too preliminary to make conclusions,&#xD;
      results demonstrate that spectral quality is similar to that reported by Nicholson and&#xD;
      colleagues (23-25, 36-37) and suitable for detection of changes in concentrations of a large&#xD;
      number of metabolites. In particular, peaks identified by Nicholson were present and several&#xD;
      differences were evident between samples with supplemental Cys and without.&#xD;
