    <textblock>
      Within the framework of a prospective double-blind and randomized study evaluating the&#xD;
      efficacy of continuous intrathecal baclofen therapy (CIBT) on paroxysmal dysautonomia (main&#xD;
      objective) and hypertonia, recovery and tolerance (secondary objectives) during the initial&#xD;
      recovery phase of severe head injury, continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion will be&#xD;
      delivered. The first week of study is double-blind: the first of two parallel groups receives&#xD;
      CIBT and the second group receives placebo. The main outcome (number of neurovegetative&#xD;
      episodes) is assessed at the end of first week. The second week of study is open labeled:&#xD;
      active treatment is continued in the first group and the second group starts active CIBT&#xD;
      treatment. The third week of study, treatment is stopped in both groups.&#xD;

      Background. Severe brain trauma and especially serious brain lesions inducing coma lead to&#xD;
      many cases of disability. A large number of these patients (about 30%) present&#xD;
      neurovegetative and hypertonic episodes that are associated to a bad vital prognosis and the&#xD;
      degree of disability. Several teams including two in France have reported the efficacy of&#xD;
      intrathecal baclofen on such neurovegetative episodes that to date have not been able to be&#xD;
      treated efficiently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. The main objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy of infused intrathecal&#xD;
      baclofen on the number of neurovegetative episodes in seriously brain-injured patients. The&#xD;
      secondary aims are to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment on hypertonia, to assess changes&#xD;
      in waking and treatment safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. Double-blind randomized trial on two parallel groups. The second part of the&#xD;
      study is open label: both groups receive the experimental treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group: continuous progressive dose of intrathecal baclofen for one week;&#xD;
      constant dose of baclofen during the second week receives at a dose determined after the&#xD;
      first week. Treatment is stopped after two weeks, but patients are assessed until the end of&#xD;
      the third week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: intrathecal placebo for one week; progressive dose of intrathecal baclofen&#xD;
      during the second week. Treatment is stopped after two weeks, but patients are assessed until&#xD;
      the end of the third week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes. The main outcome is the number of neurovegetative episodes in the last 48 hours of&#xD;
      the first week of treatment. Secondary outcomes are hypertonia as measured by the Ashworth&#xD;
      scale on D2 to D5 of all three weeks. Waking will be assessed by the WHIM scale on D5 each&#xD;
      week. Adverse events are assessed throughout the 3 weeks of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria. Inclusion criteria are focal or diffuse encephalic lesions leading to&#xD;
      coma (Glasgow score &lt;8), age 18 years or over, in waking phase (spontaneous eye-opening)&#xD;
      since at least one month and less than six months, severe hypertonia of the lower members&#xD;
      (mean Ashworth score &gt;= 3) with neurovegetative episodes (at least 10 in 48 hours) and/or&#xD;
      decortication after failure of treatment per os (clonidine, beta-blocker, baclofen per os).&#xD;
      Non inclusion criteria are surgical, anesthetic or allergic contraindication to baclofen,&#xD;
      uncontrolled sepsis directly threatening the implanted device or associated medullary trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results. Throughout the trial the patients will be hospitalized in the neurosurgical&#xD;
      or neurological intensive care departments. Expected results are a very clear decrease in the&#xD;
      number of neurovegetative episodes and a substantial reduction in hypertonia, at least in the&#xD;
      lower limbs. It will also be possible to quantify the consequences of these improvements on&#xD;
      waking.&#xD;
