      This project is being done in order to determine if the music of Mozart will have a soothing&#xD;
      effect on premature infants while in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The primary&#xD;
      effect to be anticipated will be a reduction in heart rate from baseline, decreased motor&#xD;
      activity from baseline, as well as an increase of time in which the babies are in quiet sleep&#xD;
      states while the music is being played.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon admission, all infants in the NICU are placed on monitors that continuously track their&#xD;
      heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. During our study, data will be collected&#xD;
      from the monitors already in use. Total time of observation will be approximately 3 hours. In&#xD;
      addition, a monitoring device called an Actiwatch will also be used. This device looks&#xD;
      similar to a traditional wristwatch and will be loosely strapped to the ankle or wrist of&#xD;
      each infant using a foam and velcro strap. This device continuously monitors the baby's&#xD;
      movements allowing us to determine if there is a change in the baby's activity level while&#xD;
      the music is being played. It will record the baby's activity prior to the start of the music&#xD;
      and will continue until 30 minutes after the music has stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The music of Mozart will be played using a small speaker in the baby's isolette. The volume&#xD;
      of the music will be set at 10 decibels over background noise, which on previous measurement&#xD;
      has been found to be approximately 55 decibels (about the same as a running refrigerator or&#xD;
      as the sound of rainfall; 60 decibels is the volume of normal conversation). The volume in&#xD;
      the crib will be continuously monitored throughout the hour. As a final recording device, we&#xD;
      will also intermittently be using video to capture the reactions of these infants to the&#xD;
      music. The study will be done once a week per infant on the same day and at the same time&#xD;
      every week&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All infants born at 28 weeks gestation or who are at least 28 weeks corrected age are&#xD;
             eligible to participate. Only those in isolettes (incubators) will be included. Once a&#xD;
             baby has been transitioned to a bassinet or crib, the baby will be pulled from the&#xD;
             study. In order to be included, these infants must be in stable condition (without&#xD;
             serious active medical issues) as decided by their doctor and must be breathing&#xD;
             without the use of a ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria will include a history of intraventricular hemorrhage involving the&#xD;
             white matter (as diagnosed by head ultrasound), as well as those infants born with&#xD;
             severe congenital deformities.&#xD;
