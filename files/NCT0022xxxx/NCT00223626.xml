    <textblock>
      Cocaine addiction is a serious health problem with no available medical treatment for&#xD;
      preventing relapse. Topiramate, a medication which lowers dopamine levels, may have the&#xD;
      ability to diminish cocaine cravings in addicts. The purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of topiramate in reducing cocaine's rewarding effects in individuals&#xD;
      addicted to cocaine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that is found primarily in the brain. High GABA levels&#xD;
      result in low levels of dopamine, another neurotransmitter that is the brain's &quot;feel good&quot;&#xD;
      chemical and which plays a primary role in cocaine drug addiction. Cravings for cocaine can&#xD;
      be reduced by lowering dopamine levels. This makes topiramate, a GABA-altering medication, a&#xD;
      potential treatment for cocaine addiction. This study will evaluate the subjective,&#xD;
      behavioral, and physiological effects of topiramate in individuals addicted to cocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will initially attend a 4- to 6-hour screening session. This will&#xD;
      include review of medical and drug histories, standardized psychological questionnaires, a&#xD;
      physical exam, and blood collection. Eligible participants will then be admitted to the&#xD;
      inpatient clinic. During the first day of experiment, participants will receive instructions&#xD;
      and information about the study procedures. They will also undergo a physical exam, an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, standardized psychological questionnaires, and blood and urine collection.&#xD;
      A single test dose of cocaine will be administered intravenously to all participants to&#xD;
      ensure safety with continuation in the study. Vital signs will be monitored hourly throughout&#xD;
      the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment will last 25 days and will enroll 24 individuals addicted to cocaine. In this&#xD;
      three-part experiment, participants will be admitted to the inpatient clinic for an 8-day&#xD;
      study session. Following this session, they will be discharged from the clinic for a 1-week&#xD;
      washout phase. Participants will then return to the inpatient clinic for another 8-day study&#xD;
      session. The two study sessions will be identical. During both sessions, participants will&#xD;
      first receive topiramate or placebo for 4 consecutive days. While continuing to receive&#xD;
      topiramate or placebo, participants will then also receive intravenous cocaine or placebo for&#xD;
      3 consecutive days.Participants will be monitored by the study physician. Electrocardiograms&#xD;
      will be used to monitor heart activity, and blood will be drawn frequently to monitor levels&#xD;
      of cocaine and topiramate. Participants will complete standardized questionnaires several&#xD;
      times each day to assess mood changes and cognitive function.&#xD;
