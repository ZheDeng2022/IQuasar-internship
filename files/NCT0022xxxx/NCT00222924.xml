  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is being carried out to learn more about research findings from a study&#xD;
      that was completed last year. Those findings revealed that within the skeletal muscle cells&#xD;
      of individuals with type 2 diabetes, there was often damage to the mitochondria (the muscle&#xD;
      cell's power source or the machinery of the muscle cell that produces energy). In individuals&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes, the liver continues to release sugar even when sugar levels are normal;&#xD;
      the pancreas is not able to produce and release insulin normally; and the muscle and fat&#xD;
      cells no longer respond as effectively to insulin. These defects lead to an abnormal rise of&#xD;
      sugar in the blood. In this study, we want both to look more closely at the mitochondria and&#xD;
      see if there is potential for improving mitochondrial functioning (improving the machinery of&#xD;
      the muscle cell that produces energy) and reversing mitochondrial damage through a weight&#xD;
      loss or a combined exercise/weight loss program. The program you get assigned to will be&#xD;
      determined by a process called randomization (like a flip of a coin).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recent research from our laboratory has detected novel findings concerning damage to&#xD;
      mitochondria within skeletal muscle in type 2 diabetes (type 2 DM), damage that is evident&#xD;
      morphologically and by functional criteria. In this project, we propose, firstly, to more&#xD;
      fully test this hypothesis of an impaired bio-energetic capacity, and to begin to examine the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of damage to mitochondria in type 2 DM. We are also interested in assessing the&#xD;
      potential for reversing damage, and improving functional capacity of mitochondria through a&#xD;
      weight loss or a combined exercise and weight loss intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first specific aim is to measure the functional capacity of mitochondria in human&#xD;
      skeletal muscle in type 2 DM and in those at apparent risk for type 2 DM (obese, sedentary,&#xD;
      non-diabetic adults with the Metabolic Syndrome and/or impaired glucose tolerance). The&#xD;
      second specific aim is to examine the morphology of mitochondria in human skeletal muscle in&#xD;
      type 2 DM and in those at apparent risk for type 2 DM. The third specific aim is to examine&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of mitochondrial damage in type 2 DM and in those at apparent risk for type&#xD;
      2 DM. The fourth specific aim is to assess whether exercise and diet can improve&#xD;
      mitochondrial function and morphology in type 2 DM and in those at apparent risk for type 2&#xD;
      DM.&#xD;
