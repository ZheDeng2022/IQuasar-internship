      This study seeks to determine if increasing the dose of continuous renal replacement therapy&#xD;
      (CRRT) reduces 90-day all cause mortality in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients with severe&#xD;
      acute renal failure (ARF).&#xD;

      Study Title - Multicentre, Unblinded, Randomised, Controlled Trial to assess the effect of&#xD;
      Augmented vs. Normal Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) on 90-day all-cause&#xD;
      mortality of Intensive Care Unit Patients with Severe Acute Renal Failure (ARF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Phase - IV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale - This study will provide high quality evidence from a mulit-center&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial about the comparative effects of different targets for CRRT dose&#xD;
      in patients with ARF treated in the Australasian intensive care setting. This evidence will&#xD;
      have direct relevance to decisions about the care of critically ill patients admitted to&#xD;
      intensive care units in Australia and New Zealand. If this study confirms the treatment&#xD;
      effect reported in the Lancet study, augmented dose CRRT is likely too become the standard of&#xD;
      treatment, saving 250-300 lives/year in Australia and 15,000 lives/year worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design - The proposed study will compare an &quot;augmented&quot; CRRT regimen to deliver an&#xD;
      effluent rate of 40 ml/kg/hr compared to &quot;normal&quot; CRRT at an effluent rate of 25ml/kg/hr in&#xD;
      ICU patients with severe ARF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Participation - 90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Number of Subjects - Assuming a 90-day mortality rate of 60% in our control&#xD;
      group the study of 1,500 patients will have 90% power of detecting an 8.5% absolute reduction&#xD;
      from a 90-day mortality of 60% in the control group to 51.5% in the intervention group&#xD;
      (P&lt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximate duration of Study - 36 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary - The primary study outcome is death from all causes at 90 days after randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death within the in the intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death within 28 days of randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death prior to hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need for and duration of other organ support (inotropic/vasopressor support and&#xD;
           positive pressure ventilation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRRT-free days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dialysis-independent survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The treating clinician believes that the patient requires CRRT for acute renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The clinician is uncertain about the balance of benefits and risks likely to be&#xD;
           conferred by treatment with higher intensity or lower intensity CRRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The treating clinicians anticipate treating the patient with CRRT for at least 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Informed consent has been obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The patient fulfils at least ONE of the following clinical criteria for initiating CRRT:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Oliguria (urine output &lt; 100ml/6hr) that has been unresponsive to fluid&#xD;
                resuscitation measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Hyperkalemia ([K+] &gt; 6.5 mmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Severe acidemia (pH &lt; 7.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Urea &gt; 25 mmol/liter.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Creatinine &gt;300 micromol/L in the setting of ARF.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Clinically significant organ oedema in the setting of ARF (eg: lung).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient age is &lt;18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Death is imminent (&lt;24 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There is a strong likelihood that the study treatment would not be continued in&#xD;
           accordance with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The patient has been treated with CRRT or other dialysis previously during the same&#xD;
           hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The patient was on maintenance dialysis prior to the current hospitalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The patient's body weight is &lt;60 kg or &gt;120kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Any other major illness that, in the investigator's judgment, will substantially&#xD;
           increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximate Number of Subjects - 1500&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximate Number of Study Centres - 35 centres distributed in both Australia and New&#xD;
      Zealand will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Administration - Each participant will be randomised to receive CRRT in the&#xD;
      technical form of CVVHDF either at an intensity of 25ml/kg/hr of effluent flow(normal CRRT)&#xD;
      or 40 ml/kg/hr of effluent flow (augmented CRRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Evaluation - Safety for individual patients will be assessed on an ongoing basis by&#xD;
      physical examination, including vital signs, outputs from dialysis machine records,&#xD;
      laboratory assessments, and monitoring of adverse events. Overall study safety will be&#xD;
      ensured by an Independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee, independent from all Trial&#xD;
      investigators, which will perform ongoing review of predefined safety parameters and study&#xD;
      conduct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Evaluation - Overall survival at 90 days post randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis - The interim analyses will be conducted when approximately 500 and 1000&#xD;
      patients have completed 90 day follow up, as dictated by the Data Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee. The final analysis will occur when outcome data for the target 1500 subjects is&#xD;
      available. At interim and final analysis, the baseline and outcome variables will be compared&#xD;
      using Students t test, Chi squared and the Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. Survival&#xD;
      analysis will be assessed using the Mantel-Cox test. The final statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed according to a pre-determined statistical analysis plan (Critical Care and&#xD;
      Resuscitation, 2009 in press).&#xD;
