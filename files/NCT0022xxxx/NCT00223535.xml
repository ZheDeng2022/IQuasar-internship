  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether patients who participate in cognitive&#xD;
      remediation prior to a skills training program learn and perform the skills better than&#xD;
      patients who do not participate in cognitive remediation.&#xD;

      Subjects are 40 stable outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are&#xD;
      receiving medication and routine follow-up care at community clinics in San Antonio, Texas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive baseline assessments and then are randomly assigned to either Cognitive&#xD;
      Remediation (CR) or Keyboarding Skills (KS) for a period of 8 weeks. Following 8 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment in either CR or KS, all patients participated in Social Skills Training (SST) for a&#xD;
      period of 8 weeks. Assessments conducted by raters blinded to treatment condition are&#xD;
      repeated following either remediation or control treatment, and again following SST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment groups Cognitive Remediation (CR) -- The CR program is based upon teaching&#xD;
      techniques developed within educational psychology that promote intrinsic motivation and task&#xD;
      engagement. The program uses existing computer software packages (e.g., Oregon Trail) with&#xD;
      engaging story lines or activities, and built-in reinforcement of correct responses to help&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia develop attention, memory, planning, and problem-solving skills.&#xD;
      CR is delivered in a computer lab setting with a facilitator present to assist patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keyboarding Skills (KS) -- Control Treatment: The control treatment is an engaging self-paced&#xD;
      software program designed to teach typing skills. KS is delivered in a computer lab setting&#xD;
      with a facilitator present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the KS and CR are administered in small groups of three to five patients each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social Skills Training (SST) -- SST is a manual-driven, behavioral rehabilitation program&#xD;
      teaching basic conversation and social problem-solving skills (Bellack et al., 1997). SST&#xD;
      runs for 8 weeks and is conducted in small groups that meet twice weekly.&#xD;
