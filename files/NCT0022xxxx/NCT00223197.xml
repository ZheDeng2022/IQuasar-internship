  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine if pregnenolone supplement is associated with a&#xD;
      reduction in substance use and craving in patients with recurrent major depressive disorder&#xD;
      or bipolar disorder and substance abuse/dependence. This research also wants to explore if&#xD;
      pregnenolone supplements are associated with improvement in psychiatric symptoms and memory,&#xD;
      which are often negatively affected in these patients. It is hypothesized that patients&#xD;
      receiving pregnenolone supplements would show greater improvements in mood symptoms and&#xD;
      memory, and crave substances less than the patients receiving placebo.&#xD;

      Seventy five - (75) outpatients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled&#xD;
      after completing an IRB-approved informed consent process. Baseline evaluation will include a&#xD;
      medical and psychiatric history, structured clinical interview for DSM-IV (SCID), mood&#xD;
      assessment with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD, 17-item version), Inventory&#xD;
      of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS-SR) (Rush et al., 1996), Hamilton Rating Scale&#xD;
      for Anxiety (HRSA), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and, and cognitive assessment with the&#xD;
      Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Stroop Test Color Trails, Wechsler Test of Adult&#xD;
      Reading and the Brief Visual Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) will be performed. Substance use&#xD;
      (days/week) of use, urine drug screens and time to relapse will be monitored. Craving for&#xD;
      substances will be monitored with visual analogue scales. Pregnenolone or placebo will be&#xD;
      initiated at one capsule/day (50 mg/d if active medication). Pregnenolone and the placebo&#xD;
      will be obtained from Abrams Pharmacy, which has ensured the potency (the supplier uses GMP&#xD;
      pharmaceutical standards). Participants will return for reassessment every 2 weeks for 8&#xD;
      weeks with the HRSD, IDS-SR, YMRS, ISS, and a neurocognitive battery (e.g. RAVLT, Stroop Test&#xD;
      and Trails B). Side effects will be monitored with the PRD-III Somatic Symptom Scale (Thase&#xD;
      et al., 1996). At week 4 subjects who not having significant side effects and have not had a&#xD;
      50% reduction in HRSD scores will have the dosage increased to two capsules per day (100 mg/d&#xD;
      if active medication). Participants will be paid $30 at weeks 2, 4, and 8. Participants who&#xD;
      respond favorably will, at completion, have the option of continuing this over-the-counter&#xD;
      supplement if they so choose with their physician's knowledge and approval.&#xD;
