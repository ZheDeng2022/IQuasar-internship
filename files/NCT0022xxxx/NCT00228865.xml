    <textblock>
      To determine if restoring normal metabolic function in patients with either Type I or Type II&#xD;
      Diabetes can improve overall cognitive function. Patients are treated once a week with&#xD;
      pulsatile intravenous insulin therapy mimicking normal insulin secretion and high amounts of&#xD;
      oral glucose consumption.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that the glucose metabolic pathway (glycolysis) is the primary fuel generator in&#xD;
      the brain and nerve tissue, the heart and vascular tissue, the eye, the kidney and the liver&#xD;
      Deficient metabolic states such as seen in the glucose metabolism of diabetics can lead to&#xD;
      sequelae. These damaging effects are exacerbated by altered cellular metabolites,&#xD;
      specifically the increase in catabolic and decrease in anabolic factors. It has been shown&#xD;
      over the past twenty years that normalization of metabolism in diabetic patients can be&#xD;
      accomplished by mimicking the normal endogenous insulin pattern (ie., in pulses). Pulsatile&#xD;
      insulin infusion has been demonstrated to reverse the diabetic metabolic state from primary&#xD;
      fat utilization to carbohydrate utilization. This has been correlated with a stabilization of&#xD;
      kidney function in patients with overt diabetic nephropathy, stabilization of blood glucoses,&#xD;
      stabilization of blood pressure patterns, and reversal of hypoglycemic unawareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with cognitive disorders (Alzheimer's type), infusion of intravenous insulin over&#xD;
      a short interval (hours) improves cognitive function. Patients with this type of disorder&#xD;
      have fewer insulin receptors in the affected areas of brain and insulin resistance by&#xD;
      measurement of insulin and glucose levels in spinal fluid. This study is designed to study&#xD;
      the effects of Pulsatile insulin on patients with diabetes mellitus and impaired cognitive&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic individuals without other primary causes of cognitive impairment (brain tumor,&#xD;
      previous neurosurgery, medications impairing memory) and able to swallow without difficulty&#xD;
      will undergo pulsatile insulin treatments weekly over a period of 6-12 months with renewals&#xD;
      for successive six month periods. Serial cognitive studies using Mindstream testing, Wechsler&#xD;
      Memory Scale II and other localizing cognitive function tests will be done before the start&#xD;
      of of treatment and every 3 months thereafter.This study began in 2002 and is continuing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The respiratory quotient (RQ) is a measurement of CO2 exhaled and O2 inhaled and is&#xD;
      proportionate to the fuel sources being used by the body, primarily the liver over short&#xD;
      periods of time. The higher the RQ, the more glucose and less alternative fuel sources are&#xD;
      being utilized. Following the RQ change helps determine the effectiveness of physiological&#xD;
      insulin administration in increasing anabolic functions in diabetic individuals. By improving&#xD;
      the body's glucose metabolism and thereby causing beneficial effects of anabolic factors, the&#xD;
      possibility of serious complications can be decreased. In addition the use of oral&#xD;
      carbohydrate at the same time along with the physiologic insulin administration stimulates&#xD;
      the appropriate gut hormones which augment this effect, a response which cannot be duplicated&#xD;
      with intravenous glucose. The purpose of our studies is to induce the physiologic&#xD;
      administration of insulin along with the augmenting effect of oral carbohydrates, and by&#xD;
      returning the normal fuel and organ metabolism as noted by RQ changes, evaluate its&#xD;
      effectiveness in altering the deleterious effects on bodily functions in diabetic&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RQ is determined by the use of a metabolic cart. Individuals breathe into a mask for 3-5&#xD;
      minutes after a rest period of 30 or more minutes. The ratio of exhaled volume of CO2 to the&#xD;
      inhaled volume of O2 is determined as the RQ. The physiologic range is 0.7 to1.3. Individuals&#xD;
      using fat as a primary fuel have a ratio of 0.7, protein or mixed fuels is 0.8-0.9 and&#xD;
      carbohydrate is 0.9-1.0. Those taking excessive calories will have RQ's higher than 1.05. The&#xD;
      RQ can be followed serially and this is before and after each treatment. Three treatments are&#xD;
      given during each visit to the center. The amount of intravenous insulin and oral glucose&#xD;
      given is determined by the RQ changes during the previous treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment encourages the glucose metabolism in diabetics to normalize in multiple organs,&#xD;
      especially muscle, retina, liver, kidney and nerve endings. The process fundamentally&#xD;
      requires the administration of high dose insulin pulses similar to those found in non&#xD;
      diabetic humans by their pancreas into the surrounding portal circulation. Oral carbohydrates&#xD;
      are given simultaneously to augment the process and prevent hypoglycemia. The process is&#xD;
      monitored by frequent glucose levels and respiratory quotients (RQ). RQ is measured by a&#xD;
      metabolic cart which determines the ratio VCO2/ VO2. This ratio is specific for the fuel used&#xD;
      at any one time by the body. The glucose levels are monitored to keep glucose levels&#xD;
      appropriate and the RQ determines the need to readjust the infusion protocol in each patient&#xD;
      for subsequent insulin infusion sessions.&#xD;
