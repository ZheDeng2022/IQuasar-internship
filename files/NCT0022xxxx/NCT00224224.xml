  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to identify objective differences between primary care and&#xD;
      traditional medicine residents in clinical performance, continuity of care and utilization of&#xD;
      resources. Specifically, this retrospective study will analyze the database collected by&#xD;
      CLIMACS, the computer system at Cornell Internal Medicine Associates (CIMA). This system is&#xD;
      used for clinical and administrative purposes; it manages and tracks patient's information&#xD;
      and demographics, appointment booking, clinical diagnosis, prescriptions and medications,&#xD;
      laboratory and radiology test, and consults. In our study, we will analyze a subset of the&#xD;
      CLIMACS database from previous years.&#xD;

      Three areas will be examined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical performance&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Continuity of care&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Utilization of resources&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical performance will be assessed using Health Plan Employer data and Information Set&#xD;
      (HEDIS) performance standards. These standards were developed for the purposes of quality&#xD;
      assessment, and in our study we will examine the following HEDIS standards:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Breast Cancer Screening- the proportion of women between the ages of 52 and 64 who have&#xD;
           had a mammogram within a two year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cervical Cancer Screening- the proportion of women between the ages of 21 and 64 who had&#xD;
           a Pap test in the preceding 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cholesterol Screening- the proportion of patients ages 20 to 39 and 40-59 who have had&#xD;
           their cholesterol tested at least once in the past five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Asthma admission rate- the proportion of asthmatics admitted to the hospital for the&#xD;
           care of asthma per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Diabetic Standards-&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Admission for cellulitis/ 1000 diabetics per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Admission for diabetes/ 1000 diabetics per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Inpatient days per 100 diabetics per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Prevalence of ischemic heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Prevalence of severe renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Diabetics with &gt;2 hemoglobin A1C drawn per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuity of Care will be assessed by 3 different indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The proportion of visits that are made to the designated primary care provider of the&#xD;
           number of visits made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The proportion of missed appointments of the total number of appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The proportion of walk in visits of the total number of appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resource utilization will be assessed by examining the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of lab test per year per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Number of specialty consults per year per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hospital admission rates per patient per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cost to medications. Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the study. In&#xD;
           clinical practice access to CLIMACS is limited to the medical providers and&#xD;
           administrators by individuals access codes. Furthermore, our study will remove specific&#xD;
           identifiers to maintain the anonymity of both the patients and residents.&#xD;
