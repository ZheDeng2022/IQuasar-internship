        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must meet all the following inclusion criteria to be considered for admission to&#xD;
        the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female adult patients aged between 18 and 64 years (inclusive). A female of&#xD;
             childbearing potential may be enrolled provided she:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  has a negative pregnancy test at Screening and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  is routinely using adequate contraception prior to and during the study and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  agrees not to attempt to become pregnant during the study and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  is not lactating A female of non-childbearing potential will be defined as one&#xD;
                  who has been postmenopausal for at least one year or has been surgically&#xD;
                  sterilised.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients receiving a first renal transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who fulfil the criteria to receive an allogenic renal transplant (according&#xD;
             to the Eurotransplant (ET) manual on organ allocation and the Bundes√§rztekammer&#xD;
             allocation criteria) and who are listed on a waiting list.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who, after the nature of the study and the disclosure of their data has been&#xD;
             explained to them, have freely given Informed Consent in writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In vitro demonstration of the suppressive effect of the donor TAIC for the&#xD;
             donor-recipient pair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria (for the recipient)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria (for the recipient):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients presenting any of the following exclusion criteria must not be included in the&#xD;
        trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have received a renal transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have an active infection at the time of entry into the study (Screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Recipient and donor pairs who show the following incompatible EBV or CMV&#xD;
             constellation: the donor is EBV or CMV positive and the recipient is EBV or CMV&#xD;
             negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients and/or donors who have positive evidence of HIV or have active virus&#xD;
             hepatitis B and C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with a history of alcohol and/or drug abuse or sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who are pregnant women or nursing mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to one of the immunosuppressives&#xD;
             administered during the course of the study: ATG, tacrolimus, or steroids&#xD;
             (prednisolone).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with a history or present symptoms of autoimmune vasculitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Detection of &gt; 5% HLA antibodies (all current and historic values).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with a malignancy or history of malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with renal insufficiency due to a vasculitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients whose condition requires continuous systemic administration of&#xD;
             immunosuppressives.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Missing immunosuppressive effect of the donor TAIC for the donor-recipient pair in&#xD;
             vitro test.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients who are simultaneously participating or plan to participate in any other&#xD;
             clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Psychiatric or emotional problems or lack of knowledge of the German language which&#xD;
             would invalidate the giving of Informed Consent or limit the ability of the subject to&#xD;
             comply with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Unwillingness or inability to provide Informed Consent or to participate&#xD;
             satisfactorily for the entire trial period&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Patients with corresponding donors presenting any one of the exclusion criteria&#xD;
             documented in the Eurotransplant guidelines ( ) must not be included in the trial.&#xD;
