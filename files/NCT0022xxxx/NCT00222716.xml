      The primary aim of this study is to compare the effect of an individualized adherence&#xD;
      intervention (TI) and a structured adherence intervention (TS) to usual care on adherence to&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy in persons infected with HIV (PWHIV). The secondary aims address the&#xD;
      relationship between adherence and quality of life (QOL), and between adherence and clinical&#xD;
      response. The exploratory aims focus on examining the effect of self-efficacy on the&#xD;
      relationship between the intervention and adherence, the effect of adherence on the&#xD;
      relationship between self-efficacy and outcomes (clinical response and quality of life), as&#xD;
      well as the effects of symptoms, alcohol and/or drug use, chronic interpersonal problems,&#xD;
      mood, social support, optimism, perceived burden of medication regimen, perceived stigma,&#xD;
      purpose in life, co-morbidity, personality, literacy, and intimate partner abuse on&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and psychometric analyses of the instruments. The sample of 300 (plus 51&#xD;
      dropouts) PWHIV who are taking antiretroviral therapy and without cognitive dysfunction will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms. Those individuals who are deemed to be&#xD;
      100% adherers (approximately 25-50) will be assigned to the control group, but will be&#xD;
      followed separately as a natural history substudy and interviewed. Data will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline, post-treatment, post-maintenance, post-booster, and 18 months. Electronic event&#xD;
      monitors, diaries, the Self-reported Medication-taking Scale, and the ACTG Adherence&#xD;
      Follow-up Questionnaire will be used to assess adherence. The Digit Vigilance Test will be&#xD;
      used to assess the effect of sustained attention on adherence. QOL will be measured using the&#xD;
      MOS-HIV, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, and the Perception of Illness Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale. Clinical response will be assessed using viral load, CD4 T-cell count, AIDS defining&#xD;
      conditions, and hospitalizations. Variables influencing self-efficacy (measured with an&#xD;
      investigator-developed Self-efficacy Scale) will be examined: symptoms ( CRCD Symptom&#xD;
      Checklist), alcohol and/or drug use (AUDIT), chronic interpersonal problems (IIP), social&#xD;
      support (Interpersonal Support Evaluation List), optimism (Life Orientation Test), anxiety&#xD;
      (Beck Anxiety Inventory) and Beck Depression Inventory II), perceived burden of regimen&#xD;
      (visual analog scales), perceived stigma (Perceived Stigma of HIV Scale), purpose in life&#xD;
      (Purpose in Life Scale), co-morbidity (CRCD Co-Morbidity Scale), personality characteristics&#xD;
      (NEO-FFI), health literacy (Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults), knowledge about&#xD;
      HIV medication adherence (HIV Medication Adherence Knowledge), and intimate partner abuse&#xD;
      (Abuse Assessment Screen). A repeated measures model with planned comparisons will be used to&#xD;
      test the hypotheses for the primary aim. Structural equation modeling will be used to examine&#xD;
      the relationships identified in the secondary and exploratory aims. PWHIV who adhere to their&#xD;
      therapy may live longer, require fewer hospitalizations, and have an improved QOL.&#xD;
