      Objectives: The study objective is to demonstrate that the UVADEX® Sterile Solution&#xD;
      formulation of methoxsalen used in conjunction with the UVAR XTS Photopheresis System can&#xD;
      have a clinical effect on the skin manifestations of CTCL (mycosis fungoides) in early stage&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Single-arm, open-label treatment using UVAR XTS Photopheresis System. Treatment&#xD;
      consists of two photopheresis treatments on successive days every 4 weeks for six months.&#xD;
      Those patients completing the first 6-month period may be continued on photopheresis for a&#xD;
      6-month follow-up period. Patients who do not respond to photopheresis therapy after 6 months&#xD;
      may have concurrent therapy with low dose bexarotene and interferon added as outlined in the&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients (Planned and Analyzed): The study plan is for a minimum of 50 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Male or female patients with CTCL diagnosis of&#xD;
      stage IA, IB or IIA with measurable skin lesions (patches or plaques) and a minor blood&#xD;
      abnormality. Patients must be refractory to at least one treatment for early stage CTCL such&#xD;
      as PUVA, Electron beam, oral steroids, high potency topical steroid, topical nitrogen&#xD;
      mustard, methotrexate, interferon, or bexarotene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration, Batch or Lot Number: UVADEX liquid methoxsalen&#xD;
      20mcg/mL in conjunction with the UVAR XTS Photopheresis System. UVADEX is injected into the&#xD;
      photoactivation bag during photopheresis therapy in accordance with the approved drug package&#xD;
      insert and UVAR XTS operator's manual. UVADEX dose is less than 200mcg per treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Treatment: The study will consist of 2 treatment periods, a 6-month initial&#xD;
      period and a 6-month follow-up period where photopheresis therapy may continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy: The primary endpoint will be the overall response based on skin-weighted&#xD;
      assessment. Secondary endpoints will also include time to response, duration of response, and&#xD;
      a &quot;Quality of Life &quot; assessment. The size and number of lymph nodes and flow cytometry&#xD;
      analyses will also be considered. Experienced skin observers will perform skin scores on each&#xD;
      patient at enrollment. Skin scores will be recorded as the percentage of the patient's body&#xD;
      involved with patch or plaque lesions. A successful response to therapy will be patients who&#xD;
      have a greater than 50% improvement in skin involvement (PR) or complete skin improvement&#xD;
      (CR) without worsening in nodes, blood or visceral organs. Patients with 25%-50% improvement&#xD;
      will be considered as minor response (MR), + or - 25% will be SD, and PD will be defined as&#xD;
      25% worsening from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Safety is assessed by the incidence and intensity of adverse events, whether clinical&#xD;
      or based on laboratory results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods: The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients who have CR and&#xD;
      PR of their skin lesions.&#xD;
