  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effect of pelvic floor muscle training in women aged 70 years and over, who&#xD;
      have proven stress urinary incontinence. The hypotheses to be tested are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. That pelvic floor muscle training is effective in relief of symptoms of stress urinary&#xD;
           incontinence as measured by a greater reduction in the number of episodes of&#xD;
           incontinence, quantity of urine lost and improvement of quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. That women who undertake pelvic floor muscle training will show greater improvement of&#xD;
           pelvic floor muscle function than women who have behavioural (bladder) training, as&#xD;
           measured by real time transabdominal ultrasound.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence is associated with significant personal stress, shame and social stigma&#xD;
      and affects around one-third of women over 60 years of age. It restricts the amount of&#xD;
      physical activity and can lead to social isolation and poor health. Pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      re-education by physiotherapists is the most commonly recommended method of conservative&#xD;
      management. Although a recent Cochrane review concluded that it was an effective treatment&#xD;
      for women with stress and mixed incontinence, there is still no strong evidence for the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this intervention in elderly women. It has also been suggested that bladder&#xD;
      training alone is equally effective in patients with stress urinary incontinence, urge and&#xD;
      mixed incontinence. This is contrary to current clinical experience. It is therefore&#xD;
      important to distinguish the relative effectiveness of these interventions used in isolation&#xD;
      in order to ensure that urinary incontinence is managed in the most effective and efficient&#xD;
      way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons: pelvic floor muscle training group and bladder training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 5 months during the&#xD;
      intervention period. Both groups will then continue with their home program for a further 7&#xD;
      months until their final assessment (Assessment 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will include: volume of urine lost during a stress test, completion of&#xD;
      accident diaries, Degree of 'bother', quality of life using the Kings Health Questionnaire,&#xD;
      and assessment of pelvic floor function using real time transabdominal diagnostic ultrasound.&#xD;
