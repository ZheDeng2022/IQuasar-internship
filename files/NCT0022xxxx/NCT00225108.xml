    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains the most common cause of maternal death in the developed&#xD;
      world. VTE includes two conditions, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).&#xD;
      DVT refers to a blood clot that has formed in a deep vein, often in the legs and/or pelvis&#xD;
      and PE refers to the passage of these clots into the lungs (which can be fatal). VTE is up to&#xD;
      10 times more common in pregnant women than non-pregnant women of comparable age. More than a&#xD;
      third of pregnancy related VTE occur during the 6 weeks after delivery. When compared with&#xD;
      vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery further increases the risk of pregnancy associated VTE by&#xD;
      three-fold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A medication called low molecular weight heparin is sometimes prescribed during pregnancy and&#xD;
      after delivery to prevent VTE. However, clinical practice varies because there hasn't been&#xD;
      adequate research to determine that this medication is safe and effective at preventing VTE&#xD;
      during this time. The potential benefits of the medication must also be weighed against its&#xD;
      cost and possible side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers are conducting a study that will assess the effectiveness and safety of low&#xD;
      molecular weight heparin in women who are at moderate to high risk of VTE after a cesarean&#xD;
      section. They will monitor these women to determine if those who received the medication have&#xD;
      fewer blood clots. Participants will also be monitored closely for any side effects.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains the most common cause of maternal mortality&#xD;
      in the developed world. VTE is up to 10 times more common in pregnant women than non-pregnant&#xD;
      women of comparable age. More than a third of pregnancy related VTE occur during the brief&#xD;
      postpartum period (6 weeks). When compared with vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery further&#xD;
      increases the risk of pregnancy associated VTE by three-fold. Pregnancy associated VTE is&#xD;
      unique in that isolated iliac vein thrombosis is more likely and long term morbidity&#xD;
      (post-phlebitic syndrome) is common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an absence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of thromboprophylaxis after&#xD;
      C-section to guide practice. Many national societies have guidelines on thromboprophylaxis&#xD;
      however these are not evidence based and compliance with these guidelines is poor.&#xD;
      Thromboprophylaxis may be associated with adverse effects (bleeding, heparin induced&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia, skin reactions), inconvenience and cost. It is critical that the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of thromboprophylaxis following cesarean delivery be assessed in well designed and&#xD;
      conducted randomized trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: We are conducting a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study. The&#xD;
      pilot study seeks to answer the question: Is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled&#xD;
      multicentre trial of low molecular weight heparin thromboprophylaxis feasible in moderate to&#xD;
      high risk women post cesarean section with DVT detected by pelvic vein (MRV) or leg vein (leg&#xD;
      compression ultrasound) imaging? Our ultimate goal is to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is LMWH effective in preventing postpartum DVT following cesarean section in women at&#xD;
           moderate to high risk of VTE?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is LMWH safe in preventing postpartum DVT following cesarean section in women at&#xD;
           moderate to high risk of VTE?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is LMWH cost effective in preventing postpartum DVT following cesarean section in women&#xD;
           at moderate to high risk of VTE?&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: We propose a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study of&#xD;
      prophylactic LMWH in women at moderate to high risk for VTE following cesarean section.&#xD;
      Eligible, consenting and randomized participants will receive once-daily injections of study&#xD;
      drug (4,500 IU tinzaparin sodium (InnohepÂ®;) or placebo) within 6 to 24 hours postpartum and&#xD;
      continue until 3 to 7 days postpartum. On the day of hospital discharge, bilateral leg&#xD;
      imaging with compression leg ultrasounds and pelvic vein imaging with MRV will be completed.&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be adjudicated DVT documented on ultrasounds or MRV on the day of&#xD;
      hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes will include symptomatic DVT and PE, death from PE,&#xD;
      major and minor bleeding, HIT during the six week postpartum period. All outcomes will be&#xD;
      adjudicated by an independent committee of experts blinded to study drug allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a sample size of 134 patients we will have over 80% power to detect a 50% relative risk&#xD;
      reduction in the primary outcome event rate and a large enough sample to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility objectives of the pilot study (i.e. obtain a precise estimate of the primary&#xD;
      outcome event rate [DVT], a precise estimate of the multicentre recruitment rate, feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of blinded study drug and placebo administration, feasibility of obtaining&#xD;
      local study centre MRV and central interpretation of MRV and a preliminary relative risk&#xD;
      reduction estimate with study drug compared to placebo to inform final study sample size&#xD;
      determination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RELEVANCE: Maternal mortality is a devastating outcome with far reaching emotional and&#xD;
      societal implications. Evidence to guide thromboprophylaxis in women at risk for the number 1&#xD;
      cause of maternal mortality is required.&#xD;
