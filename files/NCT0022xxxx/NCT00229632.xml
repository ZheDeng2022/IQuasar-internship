      This study will determine whether a drug called idebenone is safe and effective in reducing&#xD;
      the level of oxidants that are believed to damage the nervous system and hearts in patients&#xD;
      with Friedreich's ataxia. Friedreich's ataxia is caused by an abnormality in the gene that&#xD;
      makes a protein called frataxin, which is necessary for the proper functioning of&#xD;
      energy-producing parts of cells called mitrochondria. In Friedreich's ataxia, the&#xD;
      mitochondria become overloaded with iron, and high levels of harmful compounds called&#xD;
      oxidants are formed. These oxidants are believed to damage the cells of the nervous system&#xD;
      and hearts of people with Friedreich's ataxia. Idebenone is a man-made drug similar to a&#xD;
      naturally occurring compound known as Coenzyme Q10. This study will test whether idebenone&#xD;
      can alleviate some of the symptoms of Friedreich's ataxia and slow or halt the progression of&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with genetically confirmed Friedreich's ataxia who are between 9 and 18 years of&#xD;
      age, weigh between 65 and 175 pounds and can walk 25 feet with or without an assistive device&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with blood tests and a review of&#xD;
      their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical interview and physical examination. Tests include blood and urine tests, an&#xD;
           electrocardiogram, or EKG (recording of the electrical activity of the heart),&#xD;
           echocardiogram (ultrasound test showing the pumping action of the heart, thickness of&#xD;
           the heart walls, and any valve leakage), and a detailed neurological examination,&#xD;
           including maneuvers such as copying a drawing and putting pegs in a board. Patients'&#xD;
           parents are asked questions about how they feel their child's disease affects the&#xD;
           child's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the heart muscle and blood flow to the&#xD;
           heart. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and&#xD;
           organs. The patient lies on a table that is moved into the doughnut-shaped MRI scanner,&#xD;
           wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the&#xD;
           scanning process. A catheter (plastic tube) is placed in a vein in the child's arm so&#xD;
           that a chemical called gadolinium can be injected during the MRI study. Gadolinium&#xD;
           brightens areas of the heart, improving the ability to see the heart and blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical medicine and rehabilitation evaluations to test the child's physical&#xD;
           functioning. These tests include gait evaluation, measurements of the ability to exert&#xD;
           and maintain a constant force, assessment of visual-motor control and fine motor&#xD;
           control, aerobic exercise endurance testing, and measurement of the ability of the&#xD;
           child's heart and lungs to increase their effectiveness with exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Idebenone/placebo treatment. Patients are given a 6-month supply of either idebenone&#xD;
           pills or placebo (pills that look like the study drug but have no active ingredient) to&#xD;
           take three times a day. Patients are seen by their primary care physician after 1 and 3&#xD;
           months on the study medication for a brief physical examination. In addition, they have&#xD;
           blood and urine tests once a month while on medication to check for any abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-month examination. After 6 months on the study drug, patients return to NIH to repeat&#xD;
           all the tests listed above to determine the effects of idebenone treatment.&#xD;

      Background: Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is a progressive, autosomal recessive, multisystem&#xD;
      degenerative disease for which there is currently no effective treatment. Recent studies have&#xD;
      suggested that lipid-soluble antioxidants lead to a modest reversal of cardiomyopathy in&#xD;
      patients with FA. It is possible that antioxidants may also prevent the progression of&#xD;
      neurodegeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This will be a 6 month phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of idebenone administered to adolescents and children with FA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: We aim to enroll 48 subjects composed of children (ages 9-11) and&#xD;
      adolescents (ages 12-17) with FA divided evenly among 4 treatment arms (placebo, low,&#xD;
      intermediate, and high dose idebenone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Our primary objective is to examine the change in the level of oxidative stress by&#xD;
      measuring the oxidative marker 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine from baseline and after 6 months of&#xD;
      treatment with placebo or varying doses of idebenone. Following informed consent and assent,&#xD;
      patients will undergo an initial medical history and physical followed by specific&#xD;
      neurological, functional, and cardiac testing over a two-day outpatient visit. Patients will&#xD;
      provide blood and urine samples for safety laboratory and biochemical analysis. Each patient&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of 4 treatment arms and will be provided with a 6 month supply of&#xD;
      study drug or placebo which will be administered three times a day. Patients will have&#xD;
      follow-up laboratory monitoring after 1 and 3 months and at the end of the study.&#xD;
      Additionally, patients will also have an EKG, vital signs, including orthostatics, and a&#xD;
      physical examination performed after 1 and 3 months by their primary care physician. Patients&#xD;
      will return after 6 months for follow-up exam, testing, and laboratory monitoring over a&#xD;
      two-day outpatient visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Parameters: The primary endpoint in this phase 2 trial is the change in the level of&#xD;
      the oxidative stress marker 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine. Secondary endpoints include types and&#xD;
      frequency of adverse events, if any, compliance with the dosing regimen, and measurements of&#xD;
      the following: International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS), Friedreich's ataxia&#xD;
      Rating Scale (FARS), force control, gait analysis, quantitative sensation testing, fine motor&#xD;
      control, health related quality of life score (SF-10), functional capacity, aerobic capacity,&#xD;
      left ventricular wall mass, noninvasive measures of systolic and diastolic ventricular&#xD;
      function, metabolic markers, markers of mitochondrial DNA damage, and gene expression&#xD;
      profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future Directions: We hope that the results of this phase 2 study will assist us in&#xD;
      developing a multi-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase III trial.&#xD;
