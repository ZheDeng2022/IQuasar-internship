    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a common disorder with an incidence of about 6 per 1000. The incidence&#xD;
      progressively increases above age 50. By age 75, the incidence is two to three fold compared&#xD;
      with any age group. Unfortunately, older individuals are especially at risk to incur&#xD;
      significant side effects to anti-epileptic drugs. A newer anti-epileptic drug may markedly&#xD;
      improve seizure management in older individuals as it is removed by the kidneys and not the&#xD;
      liver and does not interact with other medications. We expect it to be tolerated well in&#xD;
      terms of effects on memory, thinking,balance, and walking. The current study assesses the&#xD;
      side effects of levetiracetam in healthy volunteers aged 65 to 80. Use of healthy volunteers&#xD;
      eliminates the effects of seizures on the outcome.&#xD;

      III. INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Antiepileptic Drugs And Cognitive Dysfunction Epilepsy is the most common&#xD;
      debilitating neurologic disorder, with a prevalence of about 6/1000 in the general population&#xD;
      (Hauser and Hesdorffer, 1990). Along with the disabling psychosocial and physical&#xD;
      disadvantages that accompany epilepsy, medication concerns are frequently reported (Gilliam F&#xD;
      et al. 1997). The majority of adverse events related to medications pertain to cognition&#xD;
      (Baker GA et al. 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of factors contribute to cognitive dysfunction in persons with epilepsy, one of&#xD;
      which is treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The effects of AEDs appear to display a&#xD;
      dose dependent relationship to cognitive functioning. Even more striking adverse effects on&#xD;
      cognition are found as a result of AED polytherapy. Evaluation of the cognitive effects of&#xD;
      AEDs in patients with epilepsy can easily be confounded by seizure effects, underlying&#xD;
      cerebral injury, genetic, factors, and chronic impact of living with seizures. To limit the&#xD;
      confounding cognitive effects of epilepsy, investigators have examined the cognitive effects&#xD;
      of AEDs in healthy volunteers. Meador et al. (1995) have presented data demonstrating mild&#xD;
      untoward effects of three common first line AEDs in a group of young healthy adults employing&#xD;
      a randomized, double-blind, incomplete block crossover design. More than one-half of the&#xD;
      neurocognitive dependent variables exhibited AED effects when compared with non-drug&#xD;
      baselines. Studies of newer drugs have shown variable impairment with gabapentin and&#xD;
      lamotrigine showing less impairment compared to the older, first-line drugs and to&#xD;
      topiramate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epilepsy In The Elderly The incidence of epilepsy increases as age advances beyond 50. Indeed&#xD;
      there is a two- to three-fold increase above the age of 75 years compared with any other age&#xD;
      group (Ramsay et al. 2004). This special population is at increased risk for development of&#xD;
      adverse events related to AED treatment as they are likely to have multiple medical&#xD;
      conditions, take numerous concomitant medications, have different metabolic characteristics,&#xD;
      and are more likely to suffer from neurologic conditions such as stroke and dementia. The&#xD;
      elderly are more susceptible to cognitive impairment by AEDs. However, little is known of&#xD;
      factors affecting health-related quality of life in senior adults with epilepsy (Martin et&#xD;
      al., 2003)6. All older AEDs have clear pharmacokinetic disadvantages as they are liver&#xD;
      metabolized with many known drug interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levetiractam Levetiracetam was approved by the FDA in 1999 for the treatment of epilepsy.&#xD;
      Levetiracetam was shown to be an effective pharmacologic treatment for refractory partial&#xD;
      seizures in a number of large multicenter clinical trials (French, et al., 2001; Cramer et&#xD;
      al., 2003; Morrell et al., 2003). The pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam has particular&#xD;
      advantages over other anti-epileptic drugs. Pharmacologic advantages include low protein&#xD;
      binding, renal clearance, and an absence of drug interactions (Perucca and Johannessen,&#xD;
      2003.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the older patient with epilepsy, levetiracetam is likely to offer an excellent&#xD;
      alternative to other AEDs that are known to interact with other medications. Levetiracetam&#xD;
      has performed favorably in adults with epilepsy (Ben-Menachem &amp; Gilland, 2003; Morrell et&#xD;
      al., 2003). The efficacy of levetiracetam has been demonstrated for epilepsy in older adults&#xD;
      (Cramer et al. 2003; Kraemer &amp; Edrich, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical experience suggests that Levetiracetam is a well-tolerated medication with minimal&#xD;
      cognitive or sedative effects. Levetiracetam is a structural analogue of piracetam, a drug&#xD;
      used as a nootropic (cognitive enhancing) agent in Europe. However, a recent&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study of adjunctive levetiracetam therapy for intractable complex partial&#xD;
      seizures showed several CNS adverse events more common than placebo, including somnolence,&#xD;
      asthenia, and dizziness (Morrell et al., 2003). The occurrence of these specific cognitive&#xD;
      adverse events were relatively modest ranging from one to seven per cent relative to placebo.&#xD;
      Data detailing the cognitive and mood profile of levetiracetam in healthy older adults are&#xD;
      limited. Kraemer and Edrich (2003) using pooled clinical trial data found no differences in&#xD;
      the incidence of central nervous system events between elderly patients and younger adults in&#xD;
      a large clinical trial. Similarly , the KEEPER trial found no difference in frequency of side&#xD;
      effects to levetiracetam in younger verses adults over 65 (range 65 to&gt;85) . The KEEPER trial&#xD;
      was a phase IV study that has limited interpretability as it was open label (Ferrendelli et&#xD;
      al., 2003). Clinical experience has been consistent in showing good tolerability in the&#xD;
      elderly (French 2001 ;Cramer et al 2003a; Ferrendelli et al, 2003 ; Pryor and Ramsay, 2003 ;&#xD;
      Ramsay et al,2003 ; Werz et al 2003 ; Alsaadi et al 2004). However, the neurocognitive and&#xD;
      mood effects of levetiracetam in older adults have not yet been documented in well designed&#xD;
      trials to specifically address this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have demonstrated similar seizure-free rates for the second generation AEDs, with the&#xD;
      main difference being their side effect profile. Evidenced based medicine requires data to&#xD;
      support prescription practices, and we hypothesize that the current data will provide support&#xD;
      for the use of levetiracetam in older adults with epilepsy. We predict no significant effects&#xD;
      of the study drug on cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS Objective The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the effects of levetiracetam to placebo on neuropsychological and mood function in&#xD;
      elderly healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological evaluations of cognitive function, behavioral responses, speech, and&#xD;
           mood (See Appendix 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early discontinuation for adverse events V. STUDY DESIGN General Description This is a&#xD;
           randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover study of levetiracetam in&#xD;
           healthy older adults. The study is divided into 6 phases, which will occur over a total&#xD;
           of 14 weeks: Screen (-2 weeks), Randomization (0 weeks), First Drug Treatment Period (4&#xD;
           weeks), Washout (2 weeks), Second Drug Treatment Period (4 weeks), and Post-Treatment (2&#xD;
           weeks) (Appendix 2). Each Drug Treatment Period is further divided into the Titration,&#xD;
           Maintenance, and Taper Phases. Following Screening, subjects will be randomized (1:1) to&#xD;
           receive either levetiracetam or placebo the First Drug Treatment Period. After&#xD;
           completion of this phase and the subsequent Washout, subjects will receive the alternate&#xD;
           therapy in the Second Drug Treatment Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological testing will be performed at screening, baseline, and during each&#xD;
      maintenance phase. Each neuropsychological testing involves about two hours of pen and paper&#xD;
      testing. A complete list of tests is given in Appendix 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will occur at University Hospitals of Cleveland, Department of Neurology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Inclusion Criteria&#xD;

           of all types.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Have a serious illness in the past month that may confound the interpretation of study&#xD;
           results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Be on anticoagulation with warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Have experienced a prior adverse reaction or hypersensitivity to either study medication&#xD;
           or to related compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Be currently participating in another clinical study in which the subject will be&#xD;
           exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational drug or device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures to be performed and visit schedule Screening Clinic Visit 1(Visit 1, week -2): At&#xD;
      screen, participating subjects will sign informed consent. Subjects will undergo exam to&#xD;
      determine whether they qualify for participation in the study. Examination will include a&#xD;
      complete physical and neurological examination, vital signs, neuropsychological assessment,&#xD;
      MMSE, and Berg Balance Test. Neuropsychological assessment will require about 2 hours of pen&#xD;
      and paper testing. Participants must score within -1.0 SD of the mean performance of age- and&#xD;
      education-matched peers on each neuropsychological test. Participants must also not present&#xD;
      on the physical or neurological exam with any exclusionary criteria Participants that meet&#xD;
      the screening criteria will be invited back for the baseline visit (week 0). Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to bring with them at the baseline visit their medical records from their primary care&#xD;
      physician and signed releases for their medical records will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization (week 0): Subjects will be randomized to receive either levetiracetam or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline - Clinic Visit 2 (Visit 2, week 1): medical history, comprehensive physical and&#xD;
      neurological examination, vital signs. Neuropsychological assessment will be completed. This&#xD;
      involves pen and paper testing over about two hours. Laboratory evaluation will be performed&#xD;
      including complete blood count, basic metabolic sceen including creatinine, hepatic function,&#xD;
      coagulation parameters, and urine toxicology screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drugs and Dosages KEPPRA (levetiracetam) 500 mg scored tablets will be supplied with&#xD;
      matching placebo tablets. The dosage of levetiracetam will be about 1000 mg per day to be&#xD;
      consistent with clinical experience with the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Titration During the Titration Phase of each Drug Treatment Period, doses of levetiracetam&#xD;
      (or placebo) will be started at 250 mg twice a day (500 mg total daily dose) and increased&#xD;
      over a period of two weeks to a target maintenance dose of 1000mg/day in divided dose,&#xD;
      according to the dosing schedule outlined in the table that follows (Appendix 2). Upon&#xD;
      achieving the target maintenance dose, subjects will receive this dose for one week during&#xD;
      the Maintenance Phase. Following the Maintenance Phase, study drug will be tapered off over a&#xD;
      period of one week and maintained off drug for one week (weeks 6 through 7) (washout period).&#xD;
      The second treatment period will then begin (6 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic Visit 3 (week 5) will occur at the end of the drug maintenance phase of the first Drug&#xD;
      Treatment Period and include neurological examination, vital signs, and blood draw for drug&#xD;
      serum concentration requiring about 60 minutes. Visit 2 will also include neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing taking about two hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic Visit 4 (week 7 - baseline 2) will occur at the end of the first drug washout and will&#xD;
      involve a neurological and physical examination taking about 45-60 minutes. Subjects will&#xD;
      complete Neuropsychological Assessment. Participants will then begin the second treatment&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic Visit 5 (week 11) will occur at the end of the drug maintenance phase of the second&#xD;
      drug treatment period and will also include neurological examination, vital signs, and blood&#xD;
      draw for drug serum concentration taking about 60 minutes. Visit 5 will also include&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing taking about two hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic Visit 6 (Final visit, week 13): will occur after washout of the second drug and will&#xD;
      again involve comprehensive physical and neurologic examination taking 45 to 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone calls will be made weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12 to check on medication use and side&#xD;
      effects for study participants that have a spouse or caregiver at home. Participants that&#xD;
      report that they live alone will be called 3 times weekly during the study period (e.g.,&#xD;
      Monday, Wednesday, Friday).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power analysis was conducted to determine the minimum sample size needed to detect changes&#xD;
      on neuropsychological test scores with a formula for repeated measures of continuous data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      N = [2/kZ&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the within subject standard deviation (the standard deviation of repeated&#xD;
      observations in the same individual) is unknown for studies with levetiracetam, data from&#xD;
      similar research with anti-epileptic medications and published normative data for these tests&#xD;
      suggests the within subject standard deviation varies from a standardized 0.1 to 0.6 units. A&#xD;
      minimum power of 0.80 ( was selected for the study. A minimum detectable difference in&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests scores was set at a 0.5 units (a half a standard deviation in change&#xD;
      for a neuropsychological test score). A standardized measure of mean difference was selected&#xD;
      as the raw scores of neuropsychological instruments vary, and converting raw scores to&#xD;
      standard scores allow all test scores to be compared using a common metric. Based on a&#xD;
      two-tailed significance of 0.05 (= .05), the minimum N needed is 18 subjects (Z = 1.96&#xD;
      and  = 0.84). With 20 participants, assuming a within subject standard deviation of 0.5&#xD;
      units and  = 0.05, the minimum detectable difference will be 0.467 standard deviation units&#xD;
      (slightly less than a ½ a standard deviation of change). It should be noted that for several&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests the within subject change is less than 0.2 SD units. With a smaller&#xD;
      within subject SD, and using the same parameters above, N = 20 yields a minimum detectable&#xD;
      difference of 0.187 standard deviation units (small effect size). The change in&#xD;
      neuropsychological measures found in other antiepileptic medications (e.g., carbamazepine and&#xD;
      topiramate) has been from 0.2 to 2.5 units (e.g., Meador et al., 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain 20 completed subjects, experience from previous studies demonstrates a 50% dropout&#xD;
      rate. Therefore, approximately 40 subjects will need to be enrolled to achieve the 20&#xD;
      completed participants for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be conducted on both intent-to-treat and per-protocol. Any subject who is&#xD;
      valuable for the safety analysis that also has baseline and end of drug treatment period&#xD;
      neuropsychological data available for each of the two drug periods will be evaluated for the&#xD;
      intent-to-treat analyses of the parameters of interest. Mood and neuropsychological data will&#xD;
      undergo analysis of variance (MANOVA) appropriate for a two-period crossover study.&#xD;
      Alternative forms will be used when available. To compensate for practice effects and&#xD;
      evaluate for measurement error, baseline will be defined as the average of the evaluations&#xD;
      conducted at pre-treatment baseline and the post-treatment period (week 12).18 Subjects who&#xD;
      discontinue prematurely will be tested two weeks after withdrawing. This will be considered&#xD;
      the post-treatment period for these subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Risks and Benefit There is no benefit to participating in this study. In the pivotal&#xD;
      trials 15 % receiving Levetiracetam discontinued the study compared to 11.6% receiving&#xD;
      placebo. Levetiracetam has reported only non-serious, reversible side effects. The most&#xD;
      common significant side effect of levetiracetam is somnolence (i.e., lethargy), asthenia,&#xD;
      infection, dizziness, and unsteady gait. Less common side effects include thinking&#xD;
      abnormalities, memory problems, anxiety, depression, agitation, vertigo, and paresthesias.&#xD;
      Rarely, levetiracetam has been associated with psychotic disturbance that resolved after&#xD;
      treatment was discontinued (0.7%). The adverse event profile of levetiracetam is generally&#xD;
      less than that to other medications such as lamotrigine, topiramate, phenytoin,&#xD;
      carbamazepine, and bactrim. All study medication should be discontinued at the first sign of&#xD;
      hallucinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Compensation. Subjects will be compensated for their time and inconvenience.&#xD;
      Reimbursement assumes that a subject will invest about 14 hours over the three months of the&#xD;
      study not including travel time. This is a significant imposition as we expect most&#xD;
      volunteers to be gainfully employed. They will also be undergoing three blood draws and have&#xD;
      the inconvenience of taking medications for almost two months. The compensation will be&#xD;
      prorated to the amount of testing completed: $50 for screening visit, $200 for completing&#xD;
      visit 3 (first treatment arm), $275 is given at visit 5 for completing the study. The maximal&#xD;
      reimbursement is $525. Payment will be made at the end of participation in the study. Based&#xD;
      on the subject volunteering 14 hours of their time, not including travel time, this equates&#xD;
      to $37.50 per hour. This participation reimbursement rate is similar to the reimbursement&#xD;
      rate of similar studies conducted at this institution and is also mirrored at other similar&#xD;
      academic medical centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. Volunteer Recruitment and Confidentiality. Advertisements in the form of flyers (Appendix&#xD;
      3) will be distributed around University Hospital and Case Western Reserve University and in&#xD;
      the hospital weekly flyer &quot;Monday Morning&quot;. Volunteers face no harm to grades, job status,&#xD;
      promotion or evaluation by participating or by withdrawing. Individuals within the Neurology&#xD;
      Department will be excluded. Information will be confidential.&#xD;
