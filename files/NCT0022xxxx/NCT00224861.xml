  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific goals of this project are to (1) refine the Home Automated Telemanagement (HAT)&#xD;
      program according to the JNC 7 Report based on focus group review conducted by the key&#xD;
      personnel, primary care providers, and patients and to fully implement the multidisciplinary&#xD;
      model for hypertension telemanagement in African Americans as an adjunct of ambulatory care&#xD;
      and (2) evaluate in a randomized clinical trial the impact of HAT on hypertension care&#xD;
      delivery and on patients' clinical outcomes using both clinic- and patient-level variables.&#xD;
      The comparison will be made with the standard of hypertension care recommended by the JNC 7&#xD;
      Report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following primary hypothesis related to clinic-level outcomes will be tested: Use of HAT&#xD;
      will be associated (1) with improved proportion of treated patients who achieve blood&#xD;
      pressure goals meeting JNC 7 recommendations, and (2) with a significant reduction in&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Researchers will also explore the impact of HAT on&#xD;
      physician awareness and use of the hypertension treatment guidelines promulgated by the JNC 7&#xD;
      Report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following secondary exploratory hypothesis related to patient-level outcomes will be&#xD;
      evaluated: The HAT program will have a positive impact on behavioral and cognitive factors&#xD;
      that play an important role in the process of patient self-management, including hypertension&#xD;
      treatment self-efficacy, health locus of control, health beliefs, and hypertension knowledge.&#xD;
      Researchers will also investigate the impact of HAT on patients' compliance with&#xD;
      multi-component treatment plans (including adherence to medication regimens and therapeutic&#xD;
      lifestyle changes) and explore the effect of the HAT system on patients' ability to reach&#xD;
      dietary, physical activity, weight control, and sodium consumption goals recommended by the&#xD;
      JNC 7 Report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study researchers will explore the impact of HAT on patient satisfaction with&#xD;
      medical care, health-related quality of life, and health services utilization. Researchers&#xD;
      will also assess acceptance of the HAT system by both patients and providers. Finally,&#xD;
      researchers will perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of using the HAT system for&#xD;
      hypertension control.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies demonstrated that successful chronic disease management requires a coordinated&#xD;
      effort that includes health care providers who follow recent clinical guidelines in their&#xD;
      everyday practice, educated patients who are adherent to their prescribed treatment plans,&#xD;
      and comprehensive patient-provider communication. Studies employing telecommunication&#xD;
      technologies have been successful in affecting the major components of chronic disease care,&#xD;
      including physician practice patterns, patient adherence to therapy, and patient-provider&#xD;
      communication. These studies were focused mainly on an improvement of a single component of&#xD;
      the clinical care process. To date there have been no studies evaluating a coordinated&#xD;
      approach that concurrently employs all of these components in an integrated framework linked&#xD;
      to primary care. In this study researchers propose to evaluate a multi-component&#xD;
      telemanagement system providing integrated support to both clinicians and patients in&#xD;
      implementing hypertension treatment guidelines according to the JNC 7 Report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will use the HAT system as a test platform for their intervention. The HAT system&#xD;
      was developed to facilitate implementation of current clinical guidelines and to provide an&#xD;
      integrated, multi-component chronic disease management intervention. HAT was designed as an&#xD;
      Internet-based telemedicine system that (1) provides ongoing education to patients about&#xD;
      their chronic disease, (2) helps patients follow their self-care plans, and (3) helps health&#xD;
      care practitioners treat and monitor their patients' self-management process according to&#xD;
      current clinical guidelines. The HAT system consists of (1) patient units (a computer or&#xD;
      palmtop connected with a disease-specific testing device, such as a blood pressure monitor),&#xD;
      (2) a HAT server that analyzes and stores self-testing results, and (3) clinician units that&#xD;
      are used to review patient results on the Web. During each telecommunication session patients&#xD;
      perform self-testing and receive structured disease-specific education, patient-tailored&#xD;
      counseling, and advice on how to follow their individual self-care plans based on the current&#xD;
      results of self-testing. The information for patients includes text, audio, and video&#xD;
      components. In instances of patient noncompliance with self-testing, medication nonadherence,&#xD;
      or failure to follow the physician-prescribed treatment plan, the system gives feedback to&#xD;
      the patient to motivate better compliance and alerts the patient's physician and/or nurse who&#xD;
      may contact the patient as well. This design can be easily adapted for any chronic condition&#xD;
      by utilizing an appropriate disease-specific testing device and reprogramming decision&#xD;
      support logic according to the particular disease management guidelines. In previous studies&#xD;
      researchers have demonstrated (1) a high level of acceptance of the HAT system by patients&#xD;
      from a low-income, inner-city area without previous computer experience, (2) acceptance of&#xD;
      the system by physicians and nurses taking care of their patients, and (3) the validity of&#xD;
      self-testing results in adult patients who used HAT. The system is currently being used to&#xD;
      evaluate efficacy of home telemanagement of patients with asthma in the NIH- and ALA-funded&#xD;
      studies. In this proposed study, researchers seek to advance their understanding of the&#xD;
      applicability and utility of the HAT technology by focusing on its impact on African&#xD;
      Americans with hypertension.&#xD;
