      Peripheral nerve blocks of the limbs are very useful in providing anesthesia and pain relief&#xD;
      for orthopedic procedures in the limbs (elbows, arms, knees, and legs). Considering that&#xD;
      current nerve block techniques involve locating the main nerves at the top of the limb and&#xD;
      &quot;freezing&quot; those neural structures in order to provide pain relief to the rest of the&#xD;
      extremity, a comprehensive study of the nerves located lower in the limbs is needed. This&#xD;
      study provides a step in the direction of the development of techniques for advanced nerve&#xD;
      blockade that target nerve structures lower in the limbs to provide precise pain relief&#xD;
      rather than widespread numbness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study aims to use direct ultrasound guidance to develop a comprehensive&#xD;
      examination and identification of the peripheral nerves in the lower region of the upper and&#xD;
      lower limbs (arms and legs). In a sense, this process allows us to &quot;visualize&quot; the nerves. In&#xD;
      the future, with the experience of visualizing these nerves with the ultrasound machine, we&#xD;
      can develop techniques that may allow us to perform anesthetic blockade with greater success&#xD;
      and fewer complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ultrasound exam will be performed on 8 healthy volunteers to view the peripheral nerves in&#xD;
      the lower arm in three locations: the elbow area, the wrist area, and the midpoint of the arm&#xD;
      between the elbow and the wrist. A set of 8 healthy patients will be given an ultrasound exam&#xD;
      to view the peripheral nerves located in the lower leg by imaging three locations: the knee&#xD;
      area, the ankle area, and the midpoint of the leg between the knee and the ankle. The&#xD;
      appropriate nerves will be identified by ultrasound and images will be captured and recorded&#xD;
      for further corroboration. The group of 16 subjects will allow for varied observations of&#xD;
      anatomical positions of neural and vascular structures, while keeping the sample size fairly&#xD;
      small. No injections will be made at any time during this study.&#xD;

      The nerves of the upper extremities derive from the brachial plexus, and likewise, the nerves&#xD;
      of the lower extremities derive from the lumbo-sacral plexus (1). In clinical practice, nerve&#xD;
      blocks are commonly performed to provide postoperative analgesia after orthopedic procedures&#xD;
      involving the upper and lower extremities (2,3). They may also be used as a sole anesthetic&#xD;
      technique during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two main concerns with upper and lower extremity blocks, as with other regional&#xD;
      anesthetic techniques, are technical failure and block related complications. The most cited&#xD;
      complications are bleeding from inadvertent arterial or venous puncture, intravascular&#xD;
      injection of local anesthetic resulting in central nervous system or cardiac toxicity, and&#xD;
      intraneural injection of local anesthetic resulting in peripheral neuropathy of varying&#xD;
      degrees (4,5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both technical failures and complications are related at least in part, to the fact that all&#xD;
      the techniques used to date are blind. Anatomical landmarks (as described in the literature)&#xD;
      and nerve stimulators are helpful ways to localize the nerves to be blocked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that the best approach to improve success rate and minimize complications of&#xD;
      peripheral nerve blocks is to use image-guided techniques. In the last few years, different&#xD;
      imaging modalities have been used to evaluate the peripheral nerves of the upper and lower&#xD;
      extremities. Studies currently underway at our institution seek to develop a comprehensive&#xD;
      technique for upper and lower extremity nerve blocks. However, this involves anesthetizing&#xD;
      from the top of the limb in order to numb the entire extremity. More research is needed to&#xD;
      derive a comprehensive examination of the peripheral nerves found in the lower regions of the&#xD;
      upper and lower extremities. While CT scanning and MRI are probably the techniques of choice&#xD;
      when it comes to diagnosing nerve pathology, they would not be useful in the perioperative&#xD;
      setting due to the lack of portability and the inability to perform real time imaging&#xD;
      simultaneously with nerve block performance (6,7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound has been used successfully in the last few years to image the peripheral nerves of&#xD;
      the upper extremity (8,9). The development of higher frequency ultrasound probes, and higher&#xD;
      imaging resolution has made it possible to localize and evaluate peripheral nerves with&#xD;
      ultrasound, something that was not possible only 10-15 years ago. The anatomy of the brachial&#xD;
      plexus has been described by a number of authors. There have been some preliminary studies&#xD;
      looking into the possibility of developing a real-time ultrasound guided technique for upper&#xD;
      extremity blocks (10, 11, 12, 13,). Studies performed at our institution involving refining a&#xD;
      technique for upper extremity blocks show encouraging results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is clear, that ultrasound can be used to a further degree of sophistication in order to&#xD;
      image peripheral nerves in the lower parts of the upper and lower limbs. As expressed by many&#xD;
      of the referenced authors, ultrasound use is likely to increase significantly in the coming&#xD;
      years, both in the areas of diagnostic radiology and clinical regional anesthesia, to guide&#xD;
      nerve blocks (17). As a result, it is evident that the development of an advanced technique&#xD;
      for anesthetic blockade - which targets a precise location or nerve - can derive from this&#xD;
      knowledge and recognition of peripheral nerves located in the lower parts of limbs. To this&#xD;
      date, nonetheless, there is no systematic evaluation of the nerves located in the lower&#xD;
      regions of the upper and lower limbs by ultrasound.&#xD;
