      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether EGG readings obtained from both&#xD;
      normal subjects and dyspeptic patients are reproducible from one EGG recording to another on&#xD;
      a different day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to determine whether the EGG readings are analyzed&#xD;
      and diagnosed consistently when reviewed and compared by multiple blinded readers when the&#xD;
      same tracing is reviewed.&#xD;

      This is a single-center study. The duration of this trial is estimated to be six months. A&#xD;
      total of Forty (40) subjects will be recruited into this study. It will be two Groups; ten&#xD;
      (10) normal healthy subjects will be recruited by poster advertisement and thirty (30)&#xD;
      patients who either present to the Gastroenterology Department of Temple University Hospital&#xD;
      with varying signs, symptoms or complaints of gastric discomfort, or who are scheduled to&#xD;
      undergo an EGG test by their Gastroenterologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study subject/patient will have a total of two (2) EGGs with Water load tests performed&#xD;
      for this study. Each EGG exam will be performed approximately one (1) week of each other, but&#xD;
      no more than 4 weeks apart, and will be read in a blinded fashion by three (3) separate&#xD;
      independent readers, in order to see if the readings are consistent with the previous&#xD;
      readings that were obtained, as well as, by the readers themselves (Inter-reader rater&#xD;
      reliability). Each reader will be blinded to the subject status (normal/healthy or patient)&#xD;
      and also to the specific test they are reading (initial exam [Visit 1], or follow-up exam 1&#xD;
      week after Visit 1 [Visit 2]). All EGG exam results will be coded in order to keep them&#xD;
      blind.&#xD;
