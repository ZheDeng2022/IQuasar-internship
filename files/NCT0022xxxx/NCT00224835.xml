  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a widely used&#xD;
      complementary medicine intervention, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), in which&#xD;
      mindfulness meditation and yoga are the principal components in the treatment of a chronic,&#xD;
      often fatal illness that affects tens of millions of Americans. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      conduct a single center randomized controlled trial in which 150 patients will be assigned to&#xD;
      either a mindfulness meditation condition, a disease education control condition, or a&#xD;
      stress-monitoring usual care control condition. They will test the following specific&#xD;
      hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In comparison to either of the control conditions, significantly more coronary artery&#xD;
           disease (CAD) patients in the mindfulness meditation condition will demonstrate&#xD;
           reductions in mental stress-induced ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The ratio of low-to-high frequency of spectral power in heart rate variability during&#xD;
           ambulatory monitoring will be significantly decreased following the participation in a&#xD;
           stress reduction program compared with those in a disease education or usual care&#xD;
           condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients in the mindfulness meditation condition will report greater improvement in&#xD;
           quality of life (i.e., reductions in general psychological symptomology, anger, anxiety,&#xD;
           depression, and daily stress, along with increases in optimism and stress coping&#xD;
           efficacy) than patients in either of the control conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Day-to-day variability in self-reported mental stress will be inversely related to&#xD;
           day-to-day stress coping efficacy in the entire sample and time spent in mindfulness&#xD;
           practice in the active treatment condition, and these relationships will be maintained&#xD;
           over a 3-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients with CAD and mental stress ischemia who show an *abnormal peripheral artery&#xD;
           response during baseline studies will show a significant improvement after mindfulness&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Abnormal responses will be defined as peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) tracings&#xD;
                that decrease greater than 20% in amplitude during mental stress.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute and chronic psychological stress has been shown to be a risk factor for cardiac events.&#xD;
      More recently with the advent of new technology allowing cardiac imaging, acute psychological&#xD;
      stressors have been shown to produce myocardial ischemia in certain subsets of patients with&#xD;
      CAD. Several studies have shown that the production of myocardial ischemia in response to&#xD;
      acute psychological stress in the laboratory is a marker for adverse events in patients with&#xD;
      CAD. Several pathways by which psychologically induced stress may trigger ischemic events&#xD;
      have been proposed, and a number of studies have provided evidence that stress affects&#xD;
      ischemic events via these pathways. Stress interventions have been shown to have a positive&#xD;
      impact on CAD outcomes, with only one thus far testing their effects on ischemic events.&#xD;
      Furthermore, some studies have reported positive results with coronary risk factors using&#xD;
      meditation and yoga. Current clinical meditation literature suggests that a mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation-based stress reduction program (i.e., multicomponent, psychoeducational program&#xD;
      based in mindfulness meditation that cultivates an ability to pay attention to one's&#xD;
      moment-to-moment experiences in a nonjudgmental, nonreactive fashion) will be able to reduce&#xD;
      stress reactivity in CAD patients. It is predicted that such reductions in stress reactivity&#xD;
      will result in reduced radionuclide imaged perfusion defects during a laboratory mental&#xD;
      stress task. Although it has not been used with heart patients, it has demonstrated good&#xD;
      results with both stress and symptomology in the general and other medical populations. We&#xD;
      believe that similar results will be seen in CAD patients with effects acting through the&#xD;
      following pathways: 1) decreased sympathetic tone and 2) increased parasympathetic tone. The&#xD;
      overall goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of a meditation-based stress&#xD;
      reduction program for the reduction of mental stress-induced ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the efficacy of MBSR, patients will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. The&#xD;
      MBSR condition will be provided training in mindfulness meditation methods. The patient&#xD;
      education control group will be provided information about CAD in a didactic format. This&#xD;
      condition will control for the nonspecific effects of contact in a therapeutic setting.&#xD;
      Excluding intervals spent in personal meditation practice in the mindfulness meditation&#xD;
      condition, the length of sessions in the two intervention conditions will be approximately&#xD;
      equal. The third group, a stress-monitoring usual care control condition, will control for&#xD;
      the effects of symptom measurement reactivity in patients receiving routine medical care.&#xD;
