  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CYP2C9, is one of the major drug metabolism enzymes accounting for about 20% of the hepatic&#xD;
      cytochrome P450 content and being second only to CYP3A4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will explore different possible drug interactions with CYP2C9 substrates&#xD;
      by evaluating the effect of prototype inducers and inhibitors on the phenotypic trait&#xD;
      measurement. It is expected that the identification of drugs that might interact with CYP2C9&#xD;
      substrates will be used to rationalize future drug interaction studies designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the actual magnitude of effect and its clinical implications. This approach should be&#xD;
      particularly useful when applied to those CYP2C9 drugs characterized by a narrow therapeutic&#xD;
      index (i.e. warfarin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of three study periods separated from each other by a two weeks&#xD;
      washout period. In the course of the study the subjects will receive in a double blind,&#xD;
      crossover fashion, rifampin 300 mg. twice daily, diclofenac 50 mg twice daily. and&#xD;
      fluconazole 200 mg. twice daily, each for one week. All drugs will be administered as&#xD;
      identical looking tablets that will be prepared at the pharmacy of the Hadassah University&#xD;
      Hospital and their order of administration will be randomized.On the day prior to, on day 6&#xD;
      of and 7 days following each drug period, the activity of CYP2C9 will be evaluated by the&#xD;
      administration of a single phenytoin 300 mg. dose. The subjects will be requested to collect&#xD;
      their urine for 24 hours and a single blood sample will be obtained 12 hours post phenytoin&#xD;
      intake.&#xD;
