  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder affects approximately 16% of the adult population over the&#xD;
      lifetime. Controlled studies indicate that short-term antidepressive medications or&#xD;
      psychotherapy produce full remission in only about 46% of patients. Furthermore, about 80% of&#xD;
      patients will continue to have subsequent recurrences after remission of the first episode,&#xD;
      with each episode increasing the probability of future recurrences. This pilot study will&#xD;
      examine whether antidepressive medications plus one of three commonly available types of&#xD;
      psychotherapy used in the short-term treatment of depression can protect against the&#xD;
      recurrence of depression if active treatment is extended to 18-months duration. Results will&#xD;
      aid designing a more complete study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with an acute episode of major depressive disorder with at least one prior episode&#xD;
      will be randomized to Antidepressive medications (ADM) plus 18-months of either&#xD;
      Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or Dynamic psychotherapy (DYN), or to a standard control&#xD;
      therapy, Supportive Clinical Management (SUP-CM). We will determine whether a higher&#xD;
      percentage of those receiving either CBT or DYN remain well after three years of follow-up,&#xD;
      compared to those receiving the standard control treatment. We will also examine the&#xD;
      reduction in psychological risk factors as well as potential economic benefits of the three&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;

      Major Depressive Disorder affects approximately 15% of the adult population over a lifetime.&#xD;
      Controlled studies indicate that short-term antidepressive medications or psychotherapy&#xD;
      produce full remission in only about 46% of patients. Furthermore, about 80% of patients will&#xD;
      continue to have subsequent recurrences after remission of the first episode, with each&#xD;
      episode increasing the probability of future recurrences. The World Health Organization&#xD;
      estimates that by the year 2020 depression will be the second largest cause of medical&#xD;
      disability worldwide. As a result, there is a need to validate treatments that produce&#xD;
      remission and prevent recurrences upon long-term follow-up. Furthermore, since several&#xD;
      treatment types are currently widely practiced, there is a need to demonstrate both their&#xD;
      efficacies and cost effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a pilot study to determine the feasibility and provide estimates for a&#xD;
      randomized controlled study of combined antidepressive medications plus one of three forms of&#xD;
      psychotherapy in common use for adults with an acute episode of recurrent major depression.&#xD;
      Two treatments of interest, Cognitive-behavioural (CBT) and psychodynamic (DYN) psychotherpy,&#xD;
      will be compared to Supportive Clinical Management (SUP-CM), which will serve as the control.&#xD;
      Overall, the study will compare each active psychotherapy to the control treatment for&#xD;
      retention-attrition, and efficacy in producing remission, preventing recurrence after up to&#xD;
      18-months of treatment, and improving functioning. Secondary aims will explore whether&#xD;
      putative psychological risk factors for depression improve more in the active psychotherapies&#xD;
      than in the control condition, and determine whether this improvement predicts or mediates&#xD;
      staying well. Finally, we will develop preliminary estimates of the cost-effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-offset of the three treatment conditions at termination and 3 year post-treatment&#xD;
      follow-up. If either or both active treatments give estimates of superior prevention of&#xD;
      recurrences or residual symptoms and impairment, these estimates will be used to plan a&#xD;
      subsequent more definitive study, including their relative cost-effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-offset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults (N=30, 10 per condition) meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for an acute episode of major&#xD;
      depressive disorder with at least one prior episode will be randomized to 18-months of either&#xD;
      (1) Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or (2) Psychodynamic psychotherapy (DYN), to a&#xD;
      standard control treatment (3) Supportive Clinical Management. All patients will receive&#xD;
      antidepressive medications (ADM), which will be prescribed according to a pre-defined&#xD;
      protocol similar to the CANMAT guidelines. Once remission has been achieved, continuation of&#xD;
      ADM will follow the same guidelines in all three therapy conditions. Assessments will include&#xD;
      the LIFE-method to code the course of depressive episodes and dysthymia, the HRSD-17 and&#xD;
      BDI-2, role functioning and impulse symptom measures, and theoretically based measures of&#xD;
      both cognitive, affective and dynamic psychological risk factors, and health care costs and&#xD;
      economic productivity. Patients will be assessed at intake and six month intervals for the&#xD;
      treatment period and three year subsequent follow-up, totaling up to 54 months for each&#xD;
      patient. The HRSD-17 and economic data will be collected more frequently. Intent-to-treat&#xD;
      analyses will compare each active treatment to the control treatment. If 18-months of either&#xD;
      of these two most commonly used psychotherapies provides estimates of reduced recurrence and&#xD;
      morbidity compared to standard treatment, these estimates will be used to design and power a&#xD;
      subsequent complete study including cost-effectiveness and cost-offset.&#xD;
