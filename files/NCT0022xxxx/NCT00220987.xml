  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to compare the effects of the two blood glucose targets on 90&#xD;
      day all-cause mortality in Intensive Care patients who are predicted on admission to stay in&#xD;
      the ICU for at least one full calendar day. The hypothesis is that there is little difference&#xD;
      in the relative risk of death between patients assigned a glucose range of 4.5 - 6.0 mmol/L,&#xD;
      and those assigned a glucose range of less than 10.0 mmol/L with insulin being infused if&#xD;
      blood glucose exceeds 10.0 mmol/L, and adjusted when needed to maintain blood glucose of 8.0&#xD;
      - 10.0 mmol/L.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NICE-SUGAR study is a multi-centre, open label, randomised controlled trial of blood&#xD;
      glucose management with an intensive insulin regimen to maintain blood glucose between 4.5 -&#xD;
      6.0 mmol/L versus an insulin regimen maintaining blood glucose less than 10.0 mmol/L with&#xD;
      insulin being infused if blood glucose exceeds 10.0 mmol/L, and adjusted when needed to&#xD;
      maintain blood glucose between 8.0 - 10.0 mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure patient safety, the target blood glucose concentration must be closely monitored&#xD;
      and the results known to the clinical staff treating the patients. As patient safety is&#xD;
      paramount, it is not possible to blind the clinical staff to treatment allocation. In this&#xD;
      open-label trial, bias will be minimised by ensuring concealment of treatment allocation&#xD;
      prior to randomisation. The unblinded design risks introducing a systematic difference in&#xD;
      some other treatment between the two groups, this is unlikely in the ICU setting where many&#xD;
      other interventions will be administered simultaneously. The primary outcome measure is&#xD;
      mortality and therefore not subject to ascertainment bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment effect in Van den Berghe's study was limited to patients who stayed in&#xD;
      Intensive Care for five days or longer, but all ventilated patients were admitted to the&#xD;
      study at the time of ICU admission. Identifying patients who will stay in the ICU for five&#xD;
      days or longer is problematic whereas it is relatively easy to identify patients,&#xD;
      particularly patients admitted for routine post-operative monitoring, who will be discharged&#xD;
      alive from the ICU after the day following admission. For that reason we propose to consider&#xD;
      all patients but exclude those expected to be discharged alive or dead before the end of the&#xD;
      day following admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The attending Intensive Care physician will make this assessment. In addition it is essential&#xD;
      that patients who will stay in the ICU for greater than the eligible criteria time frame but&#xD;
      who have a very low risk of death are excluded. For this reason we will exclude patients who&#xD;
      are able to eat (or who are tube fed due to pre-existing bulbar or laryngeal dysfunction) and&#xD;
      patients who do not merit an arterial line as part of their normal management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are moribund and at imminent risk of death (brain death or cardiac standstill)&#xD;
      will be excluded. This exclusion is on the basis that treatment allocation can not alter the&#xD;
      patient's outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power calculations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ANZICS adult patient database contains information on mortality of patients staying more&#xD;
      than 48 hours in ICUs. In the financial years 2000, 2001 and 2002, of 43,760 patients treated&#xD;
      in intensive care for greater than 48 hours for whom complete data were available, 9476 died&#xD;
      prior to hospital discharge. The hospital mortality rate was 22%. As we will exclude less&#xD;
      sick patients who stay greater than 48 hours and 90-day mortality is the primary outcome&#xD;
      measure, the study has assumed a 90-day mortality rate of 26% in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 6100 patients will be recruited, approximately 5100 of these patients will be&#xD;
      recruited from the ANZICS CTG centres and approximately 1000 patients will be recruited in&#xD;
      Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The George Institute for International Health will take responsibility for the web-based&#xD;
      randomisation. This will be available 24 hours a day. A minimisation program will stratify&#xD;
      treatment allocation by type of critical illness (medical vs. surgical) and by country.&#xD;
      Randomisation will be achieved via a password protected fully secure study website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the lower range group, a continuous infusion of insulin administered by syringe pump will&#xD;
      be commenced if the blood glucose concentration exceeds 6.0 mmol/L and the infusion rate will&#xD;
      be adjusted to maintain the blood glucose concentration between 4.5 - 6.0 mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the higher range group, a continuous infusion of insulin administered by syringe pump will&#xD;
      be started if the blood glucose concentration exceeds 10.0 mmol/L and the infusion rate&#xD;
      adjusted to keep the blood glucose concentration to less than 10.0 mmol/L and titrated when&#xD;
      needed to maintain the blood glucose concentration between 8 - 10 mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjustments to the insulin dose will be made based initially on the measurement of whole&#xD;
      blood glucose in undiluted arterial blood performed initially at hourly intervals. Sampling&#xD;
      of arterial blood will require the presence of an intra-arterial catheter in situ for routine&#xD;
      clinical management at the time of enrolment. The frequency of blood glucose measurement may&#xD;
      be reduced to two-hourly and then four hourly once the insulin regimen, blood glucose&#xD;
      concentration and calorie intake are sufficiently stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical staff (both doctors and nurses) in the study ICUs will undergo formal training and&#xD;
      familiarisation with the insulin regimens by local study coordinators assisted by staff from&#xD;
      the appropriate national study coordinating centre. Subsequently the administration of&#xD;
      insulin will be adjusted by the intensive care doctors and nurses using the study algorithm&#xD;
      accessed via the secure, password protected, encrypted study website. The study algorithm&#xD;
      recommends insulin infusion rates whilst allowing clinician discretion, ultimate&#xD;
      responsibility for the safe and effective use of insulin infusions remains with the treating&#xD;
      clinicians&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients being discharged from the ICU will receive conventional blood glucose management&#xD;
      subsequent to discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing the Incidence of Hypoglycaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major focus of the research coordinators and principal investigators will be to educate&#xD;
      staff on the safe use of both insulin regimens in the study. All episodes of biochemical&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia will be considered serious adverse events and be reported to the coordinating&#xD;
      centre within 24 hours. These data will also be reported to the independent data and safety&#xD;
      monitoring committee. If it apparent that there is an unacceptable incidence of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia, either in the study overall or in any particular centre or centres, then the&#xD;
      study committees will take appropriate steps to reduce the incidence. Depending on the timing&#xD;
      and cause of the episodes, this may include any or all of altering the blood glucose control&#xD;
      algorithm, altering the nutrition guidelines, instituting routine IV glucose supplementation,&#xD;
      increased education at one or more centres or suspending the study at one or more centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation of randomised treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will continue until the patient is eating and not requiring supplementary&#xD;
      enteral or parenteral nutrition, or until the earlier of ICU discharge or death or 90 days&#xD;
      after randomisation. If during the 90-day follow up period the study treatment is ceased and&#xD;
      the patient subsequently deteriorates so that they again satisfy the study entry criteria,&#xD;
      the study treatment will be recommenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any time during the trial the treating ICU physician deems it in the patient's best&#xD;
      interest (for example if the patient suffers significant or repeated episodes of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia) then, at the discretion of the treating physician, the study treatment can be&#xD;
      withdrawn. Patients withdrawn from the randomised treatment will be followed up according to&#xD;
      the study follow up schedule and analysed according to the intention to treat principle&#xD;
      unless they or their legal surrogate specifically requests such follow up be ceased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ancillary Treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other aspects of patient management are unaffected by study procedures and the treating&#xD;
      clinicians will be free to provide whatever care is deemed appropriate and necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal study outcome will be whether the patient is alive or dead at 90 days. This&#xD;
      will be determined by the research coordinator at each participating centre. The study&#xD;
      monitor will verify the source documentation at each monitoring visit. As death is such a&#xD;
      robust outcome, unintended bias in outcome assessment is unlikely. Intentional bias would&#xD;
      require collusion between the study monitor and research nurses and is considered most&#xD;
      unlikely. Given the robustness of the outcome measure, it is unnecessary to establish a&#xD;
      blinded outcome committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes, also determined over the same period include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death in the ICU, by 28 days and by 90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of ICU stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need for organ support (inotropes, renal replacement therapy and positive pressure&#xD;
           ventilation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of blood stream infections&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence and severity of hypoglycaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the subgroup of patients admitted with diagnosis of traumatic brain injury, a follow&#xD;
           up to determine long term functional status as determined by Extended Glasgow Outcome&#xD;
           Scores (GOSE) will be collected at Day 90 and Six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of results&#xD;
&#xD;
      The George Institute will be conducting the statistical analyses. All analyses will be&#xD;
      performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Baseline and outcome variables will be compared&#xD;
      using Students t test, Chi squared and the Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. Odds ratios&#xD;
      will be estimated using multiple logistic regression analysis. Survival analysis will be&#xD;
      performed using Kaplan Meier and Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent statistician will conduct two blinded interim analyses when we have primary&#xD;
      outcome data for 2000 and 4000 patients and these will be submitted to the DSMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and Data Monitoring Committee&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent Safety and Data Monitoring Committee chaired by Professor Sir Richard Peto at&#xD;
      Oxford University, comprising experts in clinical trials, biostatistics, and intensive care&#xD;
      has been established. The committee will review unblinded data on patient characteristics,&#xD;
      treatment compliance and study outcomes at two interim analyses (availability of primary&#xD;
      outcome for 1500 and 3500 patients), at any other time point the committee may deem necessary&#xD;
      to protect study participants, and at the final analysis. The committee will be charged with&#xD;
      informing the study management committee if at any time there emerges:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evidence beyond reasonable doubt of a difference between randomised groups in all cause&#xD;
           mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evidence likely to change the practice of many clinicians already familiar with the&#xD;
           available evidence about the comparative effects of the two blood glucose regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the definition of beyond reasonable doubt will be left to the judgement of the Safety&#xD;
      and Data Monitoring Committee, other committees have considered that a difference in total&#xD;
      mortality between randomised groups of three standard deviations would normally constitute&#xD;
      such evidence. While a major focus of the Committee's brief will be to monitor total&#xD;
      mortality, they would also be provided data on serious adverse events and would not be&#xD;
      precluded from making recommendations based on other outcomes such as cause-specific death or&#xD;
      serious non-fatal adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide reliable evidence about the comparative effects of different targets&#xD;
      for blood glucose concentration in patients treated in the Australasian and Canadian&#xD;
      intensive care setting. This evidence will have direct relevance to decisions about the care&#xD;
      of critically ill patients admitted to ICUs in Australia and New Zealand, Canada and the rest&#xD;
      of the world. If the study confirms the treatment effect reported in Van den Berghe's study,&#xD;
      maintaining normoglycaemia would likely become a treatment standard worldwide.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are eligible for INCLUSION in the study if ALL the following criteria are&#xD;
             met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. At time of the patient's admission to the ICU the treating ICU specialist expects&#xD;
                  the patient will require treatment in the ICU that extends beyond the calendar&#xD;
                  day following the day of admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patient has an arterial line in situ or placement of an arterial line is imminent&#xD;
                  (within the next hour) as part of routine ICU management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be EXCLUDED from the study if ONE or MORE of the following criteria are&#xD;
        present:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age &lt; 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Imminent death (cardiac standstill or brain death anticipated in less than 24 hours)&#xD;
             and the treating clinicians are not committed to full supportive care. This should be&#xD;
             confirmed by a documented treatment-limitation order that exceeds a&#xD;
             &quot;not-for-resuscitation&quot; order.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients admitted to the ICU for treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar&#xD;
             state.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient is expected to be eating before the end of the day following admission&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who have suffered hypoglycaemia without documented full neurological&#xD;
             recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient thought to be at abnormally high risk of suffering hypoglycaemia ( e.g. known&#xD;
             insulin secreting tumour or history of unexplained or recurrent hypoglycaemia or&#xD;
             fulminant hepatic failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. If a patient has previously been enrolled in the NICE-SUGAR Study (patients cannot be&#xD;
             enrolled in the NICE-SUGAR Study more than once).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. If the patient can not provide prior informed consent, there is documented evidence&#xD;
             that the patient has no legal surrogate decision maker and it appears unlikely that&#xD;
             the patient will regain consciousness or sufficient ability to provide delayed&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient has been in the study ICU or another ICU for longer than 24 hours for this&#xD;
             admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There is no upper age limit for inclusion into the study unless any of the specific&#xD;
        exclusion criteria are present.&#xD;
