    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to examine the combined effect of both dorsiflexion&#xD;
      night splints and medial arch supports and compare it to the effect of these interventions&#xD;
      each by itself in the treatment of plantar fasciitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plantar fasciitis is an overuse injury causing inflammation at the origin of the plantar&#xD;
      fascia and is characterized by plantar heel pain that is provoked by taking the first few&#xD;
      steps in the morning and by prolonged standing. It is the most common clinical problem that&#xD;
      causes inferomedial heel pain in adults. It is estimated that more than two million people&#xD;
      receive treatment for plantar fasciitis in the United States each year. Despite its&#xD;
      familiarity to physicians, the exact etiology of plantar fasciitis remains obscure. The&#xD;
      variety of treatments noted in the literature attests to the uncertainty of the etiology and&#xD;
      pathogenesis of plantar fasciitis. It has been suggested that the success of conservative&#xD;
      care for the treatment of patients with plantar fasciitis requires a combination of treatment&#xD;
      modalities. Although many authors have stated that mechanical therapy should be considered a&#xD;
      cornerstone of any effective treatment plan, some debate remains regarding the most effective&#xD;
      form of mechanical treatment. The literature provides evidence to support the use of&#xD;
      dorsiflexion night splints and medial arch supports in the treatment of plantar fasciitis. A&#xD;
      night splint is used to address early morning pain by preventing contracture of the plantar&#xD;
      fascia and Achilles tendon overnight. An arch support, on the other hand, addresses the end&#xD;
      of the day pain by preventing overstretch of the plantar fascia during prolonged weight&#xD;
      bearing. Therefore, both night splints and arch supports may be necessary to treat plantar&#xD;
      fasciitis as they complement each other by both controlling nocturnal contracture of the&#xD;
      plantar fascia and Achilles tendon and reducing stresses imposed on the plantar fascia during&#xD;
      the day, respectively. This prospective randomized study, to the best of our awareness, is&#xD;
      the first that addresses this problem by examining the combined effect of these treatment&#xD;
      modalities and comparing it to the effect of a night splint or arch support each by itself.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the night splint and arch support together will be more effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of plantar fasciitis than night splint or arch support alone in terms of increasing&#xD;
      the range of pain-free passive ankle dorsiflexion, relieving heel tenderness and pain, and&#xD;
      reducing disability imposed by the heel pain/plantar fasciitis. A secondary hypothesis of&#xD;
      this study is that those with limited passive dorsiflexion of the ankle will benefit from a&#xD;
      night splint more than those with normal passive dorsiflexion of the ankle and those with a&#xD;
      low medial longitudinal arch will benefit from an arch support more than those with a normal&#xD;
      medial longitudinal arch in terms of the previously mentioned outcomes. The range of motion&#xD;
      will be measured with a goniometer; heel tenderness will be measured with a pressure&#xD;
      algometer; and pain and disability will be measured by the Foot Function Index.&#xD;
