  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optimal pelvic floor muscle function is known to assist bladder and bowel function and&#xD;
      control, pelvic organ support, as well as other areas of health. It is also known that&#xD;
      problems in some of tehse areas can be a consequence of pelvic surgery. By addressing the&#xD;
      requirements for good bladder and bowel function/control, and organ support in the early&#xD;
      post-surgery phase when tissue repair and scar formation are critical, it is proposed that&#xD;
      there will be a rduction in the longterm prevalence of bladder problems, bowel difficulties&#xD;
      and weakened pelvic floor and abdominal muscles in post-surgery patients. This study is a&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial to compare patients undergoing a physiotherapy-supervised pelvic&#xD;
      floor muscle training and behavioural therapy program with a control group. It is&#xD;
      hypothesised that at the 12 month post-operative follow-up assessment, the treatment group&#xD;
      will demonstrate better outcomes in bladder and bowel function and control, as well as&#xD;
      stronger pelvic floor muscle contractile strength than the control group.&#xD;

      Optimal pelvic floor muscle function is known to assist bladder and bowel function and&#xD;
      control, pelvic organ support, as well as other areas of pelvic health. It is also known that&#xD;
      problems in some of these areas can develop after pelvic surgery. By addressing the&#xD;
      requirements for good bladder and bowel function/control, and organ support in the early&#xD;
      post-surgical phase when tissue repair and scar formation are critical, it is proposed that&#xD;
      there will be a reduction in the long-term prevalence of bladder and bowel dysfunction, and&#xD;
      weak pelvic floor and abdominal muscles in post-surgical patients. There have been no&#xD;
      previous studies investigating whether a physiotherapy intervention can assist pelvic&#xD;
      function in this group of surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the effect of a physiotherapy treatment program on pelvic&#xD;
      function following gynaecological surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons: Pre- and post-operative physiotherapy treatment vs no treatment following&#xD;
      gynaecological surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Pelvic floor muscle strength, urine leakage, quality of life, sexual&#xD;
      functioning, general fitness, measured at 3, 6 and 12 months post-operatively&#xD;
