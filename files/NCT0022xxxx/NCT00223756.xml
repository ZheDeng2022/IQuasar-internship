      The primary purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new&#xD;
      outpatient low vision rehabilitation program that is targeted to serve legally blind veterans&#xD;
      with central vision loss. The hypothesis is that veterans in the treatment group will&#xD;
      self-report less difficulty performing daily activities than veterans in the control group&#xD;
      who are on a waiting list for VA low vision or blind rehabilitation programs.&#xD;

      Abstract: Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimates are that there will be 854,000 severely visually impaired veterans in the year 2005&#xD;
      and 890,000 in the year 2010. Statistics, based upon the 2000 census, suggest that it will be&#xD;
      well into the next decade before the number of severely visually impaired veterans begins to&#xD;
      decrease. Waiting time for admission to VA blind rehabilitation centers (BRCs) is often a&#xD;
      year or more. Low vision services are an important aspect of blind rehabilitation, as 85% of&#xD;
      veterans admitted to BRCs have useful remaining vision. In the private sector, low vision&#xD;
      services are provided in outpatient settings. Yet, legally blind veterans are still&#xD;
      encouraged, if not required, to attend regional inpatient programs to obtain therapy with low&#xD;
      vision devices because a reimbursement model is not available for outpatient blind&#xD;
      rehabilitation and few low vision outpatient clinics have rehabilitation professionals to&#xD;
      provide this training. The VA system needs alternative service delivery options for veterans&#xD;
      who are unable to participate in inpatient rehabilitation. Outpatient low vision programs&#xD;
      should provide continuity of care with the regional BRC programs and insure local access to&#xD;
      low vision care that is high quality, timely, and cost-effective. Currently, the VERA&#xD;
      Reimbursement Model allocates $27,826 per blind rehabilitation admission. Outpatient low&#xD;
      vision programs have the potential to substitute for inpatient low vision services and more&#xD;
      costly inpatient rehabilitation programs may not be necessary for higher functioning&#xD;
      veterans. The purpose of the proposed research is to measure the effectiveness of a low&#xD;
      vision outpatient program for legally blind veterans with central vision loss from macular&#xD;
      diseases that could be provided at local VA facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the mean change in self-report of difficulty performing daily activities&#xD;
           measured with the Veteran's Affairs Low Vision Visual Function Questionnaire - 48 (VA LV&#xD;
           VFQ-48) reading domain scores from baseline to 4 months after randomization [two months&#xD;
           after veterans participate in a low vision outpatient program or usual care (waiting&#xD;
           list) control group].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if the mean change in VA LV VFQ-48 composite and reading domain scores from&#xD;
           baseline to 4 months after randomization [two months after veterans participate in a low&#xD;
           vision outpatient program or usual care (waiting list) control group] can be predicted&#xD;
           by baseline measures of visual impairment, functional status and life state or explained&#xD;
           by measures of functional status after rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perform an economic evaluation of costs and cost-effectiveness of the low vision&#xD;
           outpatient program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compare the mean change in VA LV VFQ-48 scores from the clinical trial from baseline to&#xD;
           4 months after randomization (two months after veterans participate in a low vision&#xD;
           outpatient program) to historical data on the mean change in VA LV VFQ-48 scores from&#xD;
           the Hines BRC program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Compared to the usual care (waiting list) control group, veterans in the&#xD;
      treatment group will self-report a reduction of .78 logits or more in difficulty performing&#xD;
      daily living activities measured by the VA LV VFQ-48 reading domain scores from baseline to 4&#xD;
      months after randomization (two months after veterans participate in a low vision outpatient&#xD;
      program).The .78 logit change is clinically significant, as this improvement corresponds to&#xD;
      the change in visual ability that would accompany a 6-line improvement on an EDTRS visual&#xD;
      acuity chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The NIH includes visual impairment, chronic visual deficiencies that impair&#xD;
      everyday function that are not correctable by ordinary glasses, among the 10 most prevalent&#xD;
      causes of disability in America. Persons confronted with vision loss often feel limited and&#xD;
      frustrated performing everyday activities such as reading, traveling from place to place, and&#xD;
      recognizing objects or people. As a result, they may experience loss of self esteem, social&#xD;
      isolation, difficulty working and reduced independence. The low vision team evaluates the&#xD;
      level of remaining vision, prescribes special lenses or devices and techniques for using&#xD;
      remaining vision more effectively. Low vision rehabilitation restores independence by&#xD;
      enabling persons with vision loss to perform daily living tasks independently at home, at&#xD;
      work or within the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: the proposed study is a randomized clinical trial conducted at two sites.&#xD;
      Subjects are 122 legally blind veterans from Hines Hospital and Heffner VAMC. Veterans will&#xD;
      be randomized to treatment from a new low vision outpatient program or a usual care (waiting&#xD;
      list) control group. Following a low vision examination, veterans in the treatment group will&#xD;
      receive 5 (2-2 1/2 hour) therapy sessions at the local VA sites and one home visit to&#xD;
      evaluate the home environment and set up prescribed devices. The primary outcome measure is&#xD;
      change in reading domain scores on the VA LV VFQ-48, a telephone questionnaire where subjects&#xD;
      self-report their difficulty performing daily living activities in the community. Other&#xD;
      measures include, instructors rating of veteran's visual skills and use of low vision devices&#xD;
      after rehabilitation, visual skills for reading (PEPPER VSRT), health status (SF-36), and&#xD;
      symptoms of depression (CES-D). Outcomes will be compared with T tests. Multiple linear&#xD;
      regression models will be used to identify predictors and explain outcomes. Costs and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of outpatient treatment compared to treatment in an inpatient BRC will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
