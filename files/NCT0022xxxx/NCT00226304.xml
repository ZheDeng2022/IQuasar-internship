      This study will evaluate the usefulness of two tests in quickly distinguishing whether a&#xD;
      patient with HIV infection and focal brain lesions (an injury in a specific area of the&#xD;
      brain) has a rare type of cancer called primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), or a&#xD;
      parasitic infection called toxoplasmic encephalitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxoplasmic encephalitis is caused by a parasite and can be treated with antibiotics. PCNSL&#xD;
      (lymphoma of the brain or spinal cord) must be definitively diagnosed with a brain biopsy&#xD;
      (removal of a small piece of brain tissue), and the treatment is radiation therapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tests under study for diagnosing PCNSL or toxoplasmic encephalitis are measurement of&#xD;
      Epstein Barr virus (EBV) DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and FDG-PET scan of the brain. EBV&#xD;
      is often found in the CSF of people with PCNSL. The study also will compare the accuracy of&#xD;
      two imaging techniques-TI-SPECT and FDG-PET-in distinguishing between toxoplasmosis and&#xD;
      PCNSL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who have HIV infection and at least one focal brain lesion&#xD;
      without a prior history of PCNSL or toxoplasmic encephalitis may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Each candidate is screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and urine&#xD;
      tests and MRI scans of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon entering the study, all participants take medication to treat toxoplasmic encephalitis.&#xD;
      They undergo lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to obtain CSF for analysis, an FDG-PET scan, and a&#xD;
      201TI-SPECT scan. For the PET scan, a radioactive substance is injected into an arm, followed&#xD;
      by scanning in a doughnut-shaped machine similar to a CT scanner. SPECT is similar to PET but&#xD;
      uses a different radioactive tracer, and the patient lies on a table while the SPECT camera&#xD;
      rotates around the patient's head. Patients whose test results indicate a low risk for&#xD;
      lymphoma continue antibiotic therapy for toxoplasmosis. They have repeat MRI scans around 4,&#xD;
      7, and 14 days after starting the drug to monitor the response to therapy. Antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy is initiated in patients who are not already on such a regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose test results indicate a high risk for PCNSL have a CT scan to look for&#xD;
      evidence of lymphoma elsewhere in the body and are referred for consultation with a&#xD;
      neurosurgeon to discuss undergoing a brain biopsy. The brain biopsy is done in the operating&#xD;
      room under general anesthesia. A small cut is made in the scalp and a small opening is made&#xD;
      in the skull over the area of the brain to be biopsied. A needle is placed in the opening in&#xD;
      the skull and, guided by CT or MRI, moved to the abnormal area of the brain, where a small&#xD;
      piece of tissue is removed for study under a microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients found to have toxoplasmosis are discharged from the hospital to the care of their&#xD;
      primary care physician after they are getting better and are tolerating all their&#xD;
      medications. They return to NIH for follow-up visits about 4 weeks, and 6 months after&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients found to have lymphoma are referred to the National Cancer Institute for screening&#xD;
      for enrollment in a treatment protocol. Patients who are not eligible for a treatment&#xD;
      protocol are referred back to their primary care physician or for another NIH treatment&#xD;
      protocol, if one is available. Patients with lymphoma are seen at the NIAID outpatient clinic&#xD;
      for follow-up visits and laboratory examinations every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Epstein Barr Virus (EBV)-associated primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) remains a&#xD;
      major problem among AIDS patients. The clinical presentation is often clinically&#xD;
      indistinguishable from toxoplasmic encephalitis. The method of choice for establishing the&#xD;
      definitive diagnosis is brain biopsy. This procedure can be associated with a significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, and therefore less invasive means of diagnosing cerebral mass&#xD;
      lesions have been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, an accepted standard of care for HIV-infected patients that present with signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of focal brain lesions is to empirically treat for toxoplasmic encephalitis. Brain&#xD;
      biopsy is often deferred until there is demonstration of lack of clinical response or&#xD;
      progression on empiric therapy. As a result, treatment initiation is frequently delayed.&#xD;
      During this time it is not unusual for further clinical deterioration to occur before&#xD;
      appropriate therapies can be initiated. Frequently, the alternative approaches then become a&#xD;
      question of appropriate palliation rather than curative intent therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Less invasive diagnostic tests to assist in the diagnosis have been investigated. Based on&#xD;
      the finding that essentially 100% of HIV-related PCNSL are EBV-associated, the detection of&#xD;
      EBV DNA by PCR amplification in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has demonstrated clinical&#xD;
      usefulness in the diagnosis, as has the use of neuroradiologic imaging to detect the&#xD;
      malignancy. Prior studies have demonstrated that the use of a combination of neuroradiologic,&#xD;
      immunologic, and clinical variables in the workup of focal brain lesions in HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients to be quite accurate in identifying patients in need of brain biopsy, but a&#xD;
      diagnostic algorithm that incorporates the combination of the most sensitive and specific&#xD;
      tests in a timely manner has not yet been explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to evaluate an algorithm for the workup of HIV infected patients with focal&#xD;
      brain lesions so as to expedite the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of PCNSL. The goals of&#xD;
      the study are to 1) determine the specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value of&#xD;
      a diagnostic algorithm that entails the use of the combination of EBV detection in the CSF&#xD;
      and FDG-PET scanning to diagnose PCNSL; 2) evaluate the time to response to anti-toxoplasmic&#xD;
      encephalitis therapy, and 3) evaluate the sensitivities and specificities of FDG-PET and&#xD;
      (201)Tl-SPECT scanning in identifying PCNSL. Up to one hundred HIV-infected patients with&#xD;
      history of at least one focal brain lesion will be screened for enrollment. All patients will&#xD;
      be treated empirically for toxoplasmic encephalitis until an alternative diagnosis is&#xD;
      confirmed. All enrolled patients will be treated concurrently with antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
      Patients identified to have PCNSL will be referred to the NCI Treatment of PCNSL Protocol for&#xD;
      further treatment if the study is open for enrollment.&#xD;
