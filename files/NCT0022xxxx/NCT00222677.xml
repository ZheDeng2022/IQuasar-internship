      To determine whether aspirin is more effective than placebo for the prevention of recurrent&#xD;
      symptomatic venous thromboembolism when given for at least two years after the initial 6-12&#xD;
      month of oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous thromboembolism, which includes deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a&#xD;
      common disease with an annual incidence of 0.5-1.6 per 1000 in the general population.1-4&#xD;
      Standard treatment with intravenous or subcutaneous heparin or low molecular heparin relayed&#xD;
      with oral anticoagulants is highly effective in preventing recurrent episodes of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism.5 However, oral anticoagulant therapy has a number of limitations including&#xD;
      an increased risk of major bleeding and the need for laboratory monitoring to adjust dose.&#xD;
      Because of these limitations, venous thromboembolism is usually treated with oral&#xD;
      anticoagulants for a limited period of time. Anticoagulants are generally discontinued when&#xD;
      the risks and inconvenience of remaining on treatment outweigh the risk of recurrent venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism. Indeed, recent studies showed that after discontinuation of anticoagulant&#xD;
      treatment, the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism remains high in patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic venous thromboembolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, four major randomized trials have evaluated extended-duration treatment with oral&#xD;
      anticoagulants in patients with venous thromboembolism. In each of these trials more than 90%&#xD;
      of recurrences occurred after oral anticoagulants had been discontinued 6-9. The rate of&#xD;
      recurrence after discontinuation of oral anticoagulants was similar in patients assigned&#xD;
      long-term therapy compared with short-term therapy (about 15% in the 2-3 years after warfarin&#xD;
      discontinuation) which indicates that although oral anticoagulants are highly effective to&#xD;
      prevent recurrence, it have no impact on the natural history of idiopathic venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism. Taken together, these data suggest that effective therapy should be&#xD;
      continued indefinitely in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism if recurrence is to&#xD;
      be avoided. Indeed, once oral anticoagulants are discontinued, there are currently no&#xD;
      established safe and effective alternatives to prevent recurrence in patients with idiopathic&#xD;
      venous thromboembolism. However, the long-term use of oral anticoagulants is not only&#xD;
      inconvenient because of the need for close laboratory monitoring but also is constrained by&#xD;
      an increased risk of major bleeding, including fatal and intracranial bleeding. In randomized&#xD;
      trials of extended-duration oral anticoagulants (target INR 2.0-3.0) for the treatment of&#xD;
      venous thromboembolism,6-9 the annual incidence of intracranial bleeding was 0.3%, major&#xD;
      bleeding 3%, and the case-fatality rate of major bleeding approximately 10%. In addition,&#xD;
      5-15% of patients experienced minor bleeding each year. These data highlight the need to&#xD;
      identify simple, safe, effective, and widely applicable strategies for the long-term&#xD;
      prevention of recurrent deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic venous thromboembolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 3% of patients with venous thromboembolism experience an arterial cardiovascular event&#xD;
      (myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden otherwise unexplained death) in the 2-3 years after&#xD;
      the first episode of venous thromboembolism10. The long-term use of oral anticoagulants could&#xD;
      potentially prevent these adverse events. Barriers to the more widespread appropriate use of&#xD;
      oral anticoagulants include physician concerns regarding the risk of bleeding, particularly&#xD;
      in the elderly, as well as the need for close monitoring and regular blood tests to measure&#xD;
      the INR. A simple, safe, effective, and widely applicable pharmacological approach is needed&#xD;
      for the prevention of these events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical utility of aspirin in the management of venous thromboembolism is a matter of&#xD;
      debate. The Pulmonary Embolism Prevention Study 11 demonstrated that 35 days of low-dose&#xD;
      aspirin (160 mg daily) compared with placebo reduced the risk of symptomatic venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism, including fatal pulmonary embolism, by about one-third (RRR 36%, 95% CI:&#xD;
      19-50%, p=0.0003) in patients undergoing emergency surgery for hip fracture or elective joint&#xD;
      arthroplasty. There was no excess of fatal or intracranial bleeding. In the Heart and&#xD;
      Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS)12 2800 postmenopausal women with coronary artery&#xD;
      disease were randomized to hormonal replacement therapy or placebo. A secondary analysis&#xD;
      showed that the use of aspirin was independently associated with a 50% reduction (95% CI:&#xD;
      20-80%) in risk of venous thromboembolism during an average of 4.1 years of follow-up. Taken&#xD;
      together, these data suggest that aspirin reduces the risk of a first episode of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism by about one-quarter (i.e., 25% risk reduction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic overview including more than 8000 patients from randomized trials on&#xD;
      antiplatelet primary thromboprophylaxis suggested that antiplatelet therapy was effective to&#xD;
      prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in high risk patients (Antiplatelet&#xD;
      Trialists' Collaboration).13 Antiplatelet therapy was associated with a relative risk&#xD;
      reduction [RRR] of 39%; (p=0.00001) in the incidence of venous thromboembolism in high-risk&#xD;
      medical patients or undergoing orthopedic or general surgery. There was no excess in cerebral&#xD;
      or fatal bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The European Stroke Prevention Study 2 (ESPS 2)14 evaluated the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      aspirin, dipyridamole (extended-release preparation), or aspirin and dipyridamole, versus&#xD;
      placebo, for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke in 6,600 patients. Prespecified&#xD;
      secondary analyses found that aspirin resulted in a 30% reduction in venous thromboembolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding, particularly within the gastrointestinal tract, is the only important side effect&#xD;
      of low-dose aspirin therapy in patients that are not already known to be aspirin intolerant&#xD;
      (e.g., allergy). Long term, low-dose aspirin therapy (i.e., 160 mg per day), is associated&#xD;
      with about a two-fold increase in the risk of bleeding.15-17 This increase of bleeding is&#xD;
      small in patients without known contraindications to aspirin. Evidences from randomized&#xD;
      trials of aspirin in asymptomatic subjects, patients with vascular risk factors, or patients&#xD;
      with a past history of vascular disease (more than 250,000 patient-years of follow-up),&#xD;
      showed an absolute excess of major bleeding with aspirin from 0.3 to 1.7 episodes per 1000&#xD;
      patient-years, equivalent to an absolute risk of 1 event for every 1000 patients treated.15&#xD;
      Increasing doses of aspirin, even within the range of 100-300 mg per day, were associated&#xD;
      with an increasing risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, with the lowest risk occurring in&#xD;
      patients receiving 100 mg daily.15;18-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, aspirin could achieve a risk reduction of 30 to 40 episodes of deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis or pulmonary embolism for every 1000 patients treated, at a cost of 1 bleed&#xD;
      requiring transfusion in high-risk patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism. Aspirin&#xD;
      is simple to administer and does not require laboratory monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study we propose to evaluate the use of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of&#xD;
      recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with previous idiopathic venous thromboembolism&#xD;
      who have received initial 6-month treatment with oral anticoagulants.&#xD;
