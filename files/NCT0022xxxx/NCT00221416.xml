  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated study whose primary aim is to determine the effectiveness&#xD;
      of aripiprazole (AbilifyÂ®) in helping persons with symptoms of mania whose current&#xD;
      medications do not completely control those symptoms. Aripiprazole is a medication that has&#xD;
      been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of&#xD;
      Schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of this research is to explore whether CYP 2D6 polymorphisms are related to&#xD;
      side effects with aripiprazole. The goal of this research is to identify individuals who&#xD;
      metabolize aripiprazole more rapidly or slowly, which will potentially help the clinician&#xD;
      make dosing adjustments and decrease the risk of adverse events.&#xD;

      The primary aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      aripiprazole for the treatment of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. The&#xD;
      secondary aim of this study is to determine if common polymorphic variations in the CYP 2D6&#xD;
      gene underlie the inter-individual variability in aripiprazole systemic drug exposure and the&#xD;
      occurrence of treatment emergent side effects.&#xD;
