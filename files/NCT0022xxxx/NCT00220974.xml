  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to find out if a special website might help people discover if&#xD;
      they have high cholesterol and then enable them to manage their cholesterol more&#xD;
      appropriately. The primary aim of this trial is to determine the effects on consumers' use of&#xD;
      cholesterol lowering therapy of an online service that provides automated, individually&#xD;
      tailored, advice about eligibility for cholesterol lowering treatment. The primary null&#xD;
      hypothesis being tested is that the service will result in no change in the use of&#xD;
      cholesterol lowering treatments by consumers that use the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim of the trial is to see if it is possible to improve the cholesterol&#xD;
      management of the friends or relatives of consumers that use the I-CAT service. The&#xD;
      corresponding secondary null hypothesis being tested is that the I-CAT service will result in&#xD;
      no change in the use of cholesterol lowering treatments by the friends or relatives of the&#xD;
      consumers that use the service.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Internet-based Cholesterol Assessment Trial (I-CAT) is a masked, randomised, controlled&#xD;
      trial that will include at least 3,700 consumers followed for between 8 and 16 weeks. All&#xD;
      consumers that participate in the study will ultimately be offered the I-CAT service, which&#xD;
      provides individually tailored information about the management of cholesterol-related risk&#xD;
      via an interactive website. However, by offering the service immediately to one group&#xD;
      (intervention) and delaying it by 8 weeks in the other group (control) it will be possible to&#xD;
      precisely and reliably determine the effects of the I-CAT service on consumers and their use&#xD;
      of cholesterol lowering interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two types of individuals involved in the study: 'index cases' and 'friends or&#xD;
      relatives' of the index cases. The index cases will be randomised to intervention or control&#xD;
      and will comprise the study participants on which the main outcome analyses will be based.&#xD;
      Friends and relatives of the index case will only be involved insomuch as they will be asked&#xD;
      to visit the site by the index case as part of the evaluation of the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Index cases will comprise mainly individuals already known to be at high risk of a&#xD;
      cholesterol-related disease event - for example individuals with established vascular&#xD;
      disease, individuals with multiple risk factors and individuals already using&#xD;
      cholesterol-lowering therapy. Index cases will be recruited using advertising materials&#xD;
      placed at a range of sites including hospital in patient services, hospital out patient&#xD;
      services, general practices, pharmacies, pathology services and the Internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals that provide informed consent (index cases and friends or relatives) will be&#xD;
      asked to answer as many questions as possible from the XX questions in the baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire. The questionnaire will seek information about the individual's cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease history, their risk factors, their cholesterol levels, their use of any medications&#xD;
      or other strategies to reduce their cholesterol-related cardiovascular risk and any family&#xD;
      history of cardiovascular disease or high cholesterol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once baseline data collection is complete index cases will be randomised to either&#xD;
      intervention or control. Randomisation will be done automatically in real time by a central&#xD;
      computerised service. The intervention group will receive immediate feedback from the I-CAT&#xD;
      service. The control group will receive general information about cholesterol-related disease&#xD;
      risk derived from existing materials prepared by the National Heart Foundation of Australia.&#xD;
      Hyperlinks to a range of relevant websites will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, after returning to the website at 8 weeks and providing follow-up information,&#xD;
      all control group participants will receive the same tailored feedback from the I-CAT service&#xD;
      as was given to the intervention group participants at randomisation. In this way, all study&#xD;
      participants will ultimately receive the same advice but by providing one group with&#xD;
      immediate advice and one group with delayed advice it will be possible to precisely and&#xD;
      reliably determine the value of the I-CAT service to consumers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All primary analyses will be of comparisons between the index cases in the intervention group&#xD;
      and the index cases in the control group conducted according to the principle of&#xD;
      intention-to-treat. For each outcome the analyses will compare the proportions of index cases&#xD;
      reporting the outcome (or the mean values for each outcome) between randomised groups.&#xD;
      Comparisons of proportions will be done using Chi-square tests and comparisons between means&#xD;
      will be done using t-tests.&#xD;
