  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholera is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children and adult in&#xD;
      developing countries. We will evaluate the effect of supplementation of zinc on reduction of&#xD;
      duration and severity of cholera. Since cholera is primarily a disease of older children and&#xD;
      adults, we intend to study the effects of zinc supplementation among children of 3 to 14&#xD;
      years of age, whose initial stool weight will be &gt;4ml/kg/hour in 1st 6 hours and dark field&#xD;
      examination is positive. 90 subjects in each group hospitalized with cholera with diarrhea&#xD;
      for less than 24 hours will be selected. After inclusion in the study, informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained from guardian explaining the full procedure in the hospital. The subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either zinc or placebo until diarrhea resolves. History of illness and&#xD;
      baseline information will be collected in the hospital through interview, which may take&#xD;
      duration of 10 minutes.After 6 hours of initial rehydration, fluid balance study will be&#xD;
      carried out on all subjects until diarrhea resolves. 1 ml (1/4 teaspoonful) of blood sample&#xD;
      will be taken to assess serum zinc level on admission after initial hydration and will be&#xD;
      repeated on the day of recovery. This procedure carries a small risk of infection if not done&#xD;
      under sanitary conditions; however, we will maintain proper sanitation, so there is no risk&#xD;
      in the procedures. There is no potential risk in this study.20mg elemental Zinc will be given&#xD;
      daily in 2 divided doses till cholera resolves. Both groups will receive syrup or tablet&#xD;
      Erythromycin 50mg/kg/24 in 4 divided doses for 3 days. Oral rehydration solution/intravenous&#xD;
      acetate fluid will be used for rehydration. Daily body weight will be taken and stool will be&#xD;
      sent for C/S until the day of recovery or 5 days. Zinc loss in stool will be seen in 20% of&#xD;
      random stool samples. Information obtained from history and the laboratory investigations of&#xD;
      subject will be kept strictly confidential and no one other than the investigators of this&#xD;
      study and the Ethics Committee of this Centre will/ has access to the information. The study&#xD;
      will benefit the patients as study physician will do close observation, examination and will&#xD;
      take care frequently, as research staff will monitor systematic progress and take necessary&#xD;
      action. Study micronutrient (zinc) is shown to have benefit in children in acute diarrhea. If&#xD;
      the results of the study is positive, it will benefit the patients in their treatment during&#xD;
      this study and thereafter. The data will be analyzed for clinical effects of zinc on&#xD;
      diarrhea.The study will help to improve the treatment strategy of cholera in children. The&#xD;
      study will use hospital records, which will be returned after completion of the study. Stool,&#xD;
      urine and 1 ml (1/4 teaspoonful) of venous blood will be taken to assess serum zinc level.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double blind randomized clinical trial using zinc and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to one of two groups, A or B. Block randomization will be done&#xD;
      using block length of 6. Group A will receive Zinc+ Erythromycin and Group B: will receive&#xD;
      Placebo+Erythromycin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose of Erythromycin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Syrup/tab Erythromycin 50mg/kg/24 hours in 4 divided doses for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose of zinc:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc acetate will be given at 10mg twice daily (10mgx2=20mg elemental zinc) until cholera&#xD;
      resolves (the time of passage of last unformed stool or first formed stool followed by 24&#xD;
      hours without any diarrheal stool).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Composition of the syrup:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, the bulk of the base syrup will be consist of the same chemicals; in&#xD;
      addition to this, group A will have the treatment substance (i.e. elemental zinc 20 mg/day)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Syrup A: Quantity per 5 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc Acetate 10 mg elemental zinc&#xD;
&#xD;
      Syrup B: Base substance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Base Substance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ascorbic acid 30 mg Glycerin USP 1.2 ml Propylene glycol USP 0.75 ml Sorbitol 70% BP 2.0 ml&#xD;
      Methyl Paraben USFN 3.5 mg Polysorate-80 50 mg (Tween -80) BPC Lemon oil PH grade 0.0125 ml&#xD;
      Caramel Brown colour 1 mg Purified water 0.75 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical procedure in the hospital:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the selection criteria will be observed for initial six hours, while their&#xD;
      urine and stool specimen will be collected separately. Patient whose initial stool-output&#xD;
      &gt;4ml/kg/hour during this period and dark field examination of stool is positive will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Patients will be kept in study ward. After complete hydration,&#xD;
      patients will be randomised in blocks of 6 to one of two groups A and B. Group A will receive&#xD;
      syrup zinc and group B will receive placebo till cholera resolves. Both the groups will&#xD;
      receive the identical bottles containing syrup with same flavor and only single unique serial&#xD;
      number will be written on the bottles. The number will indicate an exact subject of study.&#xD;
      Both the groups will receive Syrup/Tab Erythromycin. 1ml blood will be collected for serum&#xD;
      zinc on admission after complete dehydration and this test will be repeated at the time of&#xD;
      discharge. Stool culture and sensitivity (C/S) will be sent daily until the day of recovery&#xD;
      or 5 days. Balance will be performed on all the patients till cholera resolves. If any&#xD;
      complication develops after enrollment, study will be discontinued and patient will be&#xD;
      treated accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of dehydration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reduce observational variation, especially regarding the assessment of dehydration, a&#xD;
      standardized form is developed for the assessment of dehydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITION* (1=normal, 2=irritable/lessactive, 3=lethargic/comatose) MUCOSA (1=normal, 2=dry)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EYES (1=normal, 2=sunken) THIRST* (1=normal, 2=thirsty, 3=unable to drink) SKIN TURGOR*&#xD;
      (1=normal, 2=reduced) PULSE* (1=normal, 3=feeble/absent)&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEHYDRATION STATUS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. no sign of dehydration&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. some dehydration (two signs coded 2 with at least one key sign*)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. severe dehydration (some dehydration, plus one key sign* coded 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      (* This method was recently validated by a group of international experts in oral rehydration&#xD;
      therapy who were invited to ICDDR, B and is currently being used in a large WHO sponsored&#xD;
      multi-centre trial for the evaluation of low osmolarity ORS. The investigators have been&#xD;
      trained in this method).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehydration phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients recruited in this study, will have either, some dehydration or severe&#xD;
      dehydration. Therefore, before being randomized into study, during initial 6 hours all the&#xD;
      patients will be rehydrated either by ORS or intravenous fluid. Patients with signs of some&#xD;
      dehydration will be rehydrated by ORS and patients with severe dehydration will be rehydrated&#xD;
      intravenously as described below. The following IV fluids will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium Potassium Chloride Acetate Dhaka Solution (mmol/L) (mmol/L) (mmol/L) (mmol/L) 133 13&#xD;
      98 48 Rate of administration will be 100 ml/kg over 4 hours, plus volume-for-volume&#xD;
      replacement for ongoing losses hourly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If, at the end of four hours:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient is fully rehydrated, he/she will be randomized to one of the treatment&#xD;
           groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Some dehydration persist, IV infusion will continue at the rate of 50 ml /kg over 2&#xD;
           hours, plus replacement volume for volume of ongoing losses;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Severe dehydration persists, IV infusion will continue for an additional 2 hours at the&#xD;
           rate of 100 ml/kg, plus replacement of ongoing losses. This is very unusual, however,&#xD;
           occurring only in very few patients who pass large watery stools frequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at the end of six hours, the patient is fully rehydrated patient will be randomized to one&#xD;
      of the treatment group. If signs of dehydration persist after 6 hours, the patient will be&#xD;
      excluded from study. All intake and output during this initial rehydration phase will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of rehydration, subjects will be randomized to one of the two groups Group A&#xD;
      and Group B. Group A will be given zinc acetate and group B will be given placebo. The&#xD;
      supplementation of zinc or placebo will be continued till diarrhea resolves. Ongoing stool&#xD;
      losses will be replaced with equal volume of Rice-ORS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardize hospital diet will be given to all patients which includes milk suji, rice,&#xD;
      vegetable, daal, bread banana and chicken or fish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intake and output measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All oral and intravenous fluid will be measured and recorded until cholera resolves. Stool&#xD;
      weight will be measured separately from urine every 8 hours until cholera resolves. Urine&#xD;
      will be separated and measured 8 hourly, weight of vomitus will also be taken 8 hourly. Daily&#xD;
      clinical examination will be done by the investigators and study physician with observation&#xD;
      on stool consistency and character.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical recovery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical recovery will be defined as the time of passage of last unformed stool or first&#xD;
      formed stool followed by 24 hours without any diarrheal stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We assume that zinc will reduce 20% of mean duration of illness compared to erythromycin&#xD;
      group18 at 90% power and 5% level of confidence. Therefore the sample size will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      n=2 (SD)2 aß/(D)2 n=2 (5)2 10.5/(2.6)2 n=77.66=78 per treatment group So the total number of&#xD;
      samples will be 78 x 2 =156. Considering 15% drop out the total number of samples will be&#xD;
      156+24=180&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of weight gain:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight will be taken on admission and daily until cholera resolves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Microscopic examination&#xD;
&#xD;
           1. Dark field examination will be done on stool samples on admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Microbiological assays:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1 Daily stool C/S will be done till cholera resolves or 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Micronutrient assay:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Serum zinc level will be obtained on day 1 and on the day of recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Randomly zinc loss in cholera will be seen in 20% samples.&#xD;
