      During clinical anesthesia, it is astonishing that CO2 monitoring consists mainly of&#xD;
      end-tidal PCO2 to confirm endotracheal intubation and to estimate ventilation, and O2&#xD;
      monitoring consists of a single PO2 measurement to detect a hypoxic gas mixture. Better&#xD;
      understanding of how O2 and CO2 kinetics monitoring can define systems pathophysiology will&#xD;
      greatly enhance safety in anesthesia by detecting critical events such as abrupt decrease in&#xD;
      cardiac output (Q.T) by vena-caval compression during abdominal surgery, occurrence of CO2&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism during laparoscopy, rising tissue O2 consumption (V.O2) during light&#xD;
      anesthesia, and onset of anaerobic metabolism (V.CO2 is disproportionately higher than V.O2).&#xD;

      During clinical anesthesia, it is astonishing that CO2 monitoring consists mainly of&#xD;
      end-tidal PCO2 to confirm endotracheal intubation and to estimate ventilation, and O2&#xD;
      monitoring consists of a single PO2 measurement to detect a hypoxic gas mixture. Better&#xD;
      understanding of how O2 and CO2 kinetics monitoring can define systems pathophysiology will&#xD;
      greatly enhance safety in anesthesia by detecting critical events such as abrupt decrease in&#xD;
      cardiac output (Q.T) by vena-caval compression during abdominal surgery, occurrence of CO2&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism during laparoscopy, rising tissue O2 consumption (V.O2) during light&#xD;
      anesthesia, and onset of anaerobic metabolism (V.CO2 is disproportionately higher than V.O2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the previous grant period, discoveries of CO2 kinetics during non-steady state revealed&#xD;
      significant gaps in understanding of O2 kinetics. To this end, a 5-compartment lung model of&#xD;
      gas kinetics in the body during non-steady state has been developed, that incorporates&#xD;
      complex interactions between O2 and CO2 in the lung, blood, and tissues. This computer model&#xD;
      was used to formulate the following hypotheses, and will elucidate mechanisms underlying the&#xD;
      subsequent measured data in anesthetized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have already developed two innovative devices that are essential for the&#xD;
      V.O2 measurement: A fast response temperature and humidity sensor, and a mixing device (a&#xD;
      bymixer) for the measurement of mixed gas fraction, especially designed for anesthesia&#xD;
      systems. The investigators have also designed a sophisticated bench system for the validation&#xD;
      of both devices, which showed the high accuracy and performance of our measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses that will be tested in our overall research theme include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That pulmonary O2 uptake (V.O2) in anesthetized patients is much lower than the value&#xD;
           quoted in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That inhalation anesthesia influences V.O2 differently than total intravenous anesthesia&#xD;
           (TIVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That an acute decrease in cardiac output (Q.T) (by patient position change) will&#xD;
           transiently decrease V.O2 but the decrease in CO2 elimination (V.CO2) is sustained&#xD;
           because tissue CO2 stores are a hundred fold greater than O2 (please see previously&#xD;
           approved IRB protocol, HS# 2000-1325).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) decreases V.O2 and V.CO2 due to decreases&#xD;
           in Q.T and alveolar ventilation (V.A), and appearance of high ventilation-to-perfusion&#xD;
           (V.A/Q.) units (please see previously approved IRB protocol, HS# 2000-1325).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That Trendelenburg (head down) position increases V.O2 and V.CO2 due to increase in Q.T.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That V.O2 can help to determine the necessity of blood transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That the continuous measurement of the respiratory quotient (RQ=V.CO2/V.O2) can detect&#xD;
           transition to anaerobic metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That the continuous measurement of the respiratory RQ can be a good alternative to&#xD;
           arterial blood gas sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That the continuous measurement of the respiratory RQ can determine the necessity of&#xD;
           nutritional support during long operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, the investigators will study the clinical implications of these&#xD;
      measurements, believing that they are the missing links in anesthesia monitoring. Elucidating&#xD;
      the mechanisms underlying this acute pathophysiology will advance the understanding of O2 and&#xD;
      CO2 kinetics during non-steady state, and allow the non-invasive diagnosis of critical events&#xD;
      during clinical anesthesia conferring increased safety, especially for the majority of&#xD;
      healthy patients who receive only non-invasive monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A separate section of the study, which compliments the metabolic gas exchange study with the&#xD;
      bymixer flow system is the examination of respiratory gas with a portable mass-spectrometer&#xD;
      to detect volatile organic compounds during anaerobic metabolism. The experimental anaerobic&#xD;
      model is adult patients undergoing a surgery that requires tourniquet. Anaerobic metabolism&#xD;
      will be detected by acid base balance blood test, the bymixer flow measurement and the mass&#xD;
      spectrometer. Anesthesia will be maintained by total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and each&#xD;
      patient will have an arterial line. No other intervention would be taken. It is an&#xD;
      observational type study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All adult patients at UCIMC who are undergoing anesthesia and surgery are eligible for&#xD;
             the studies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class 1 or 2 (generally&#xD;
             healthy patients). We plan on studying 100 patients, divided into 5 equally numbered&#xD;
             groups. A power analysis of the sample size shows the need for minimum of 20 patients.&#xD;
             High risk 3 subgroups (ASA 3), approximately 20 adult patients (included within the&#xD;
             100 planned patients), will be investigated for the (1) RQ correlation with arterial&#xD;
             blood gas, (2) for the exercise study and (3) for the esophageal Doppler studies.&#xD;
             These study groups include patients that are categorized as ASA 1, 2 or 3, (total of&#xD;
             60 patients) however; the total number of ASA 3 patients will not exceed 20. Subjects&#xD;
             having surgeries around the head and neck, as well as surgeries that require the&#xD;
             patient to lie face down will be excluded from the study&#xD;

             Obstructive Lung Disease classification&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Worsening airflow limitation, (FEV1 ≤30% ), and usually the progression of symptoms,&#xD;
             with shortness of breath typically developing on exertion), bullous lung disease, or&#xD;
             raised intra-cranial pressure (except for the high risk subgroup mentioned before)&#xD;

        Esophageal Doppler:&#xD;
