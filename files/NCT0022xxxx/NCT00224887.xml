      Primary Hypothesis Children whose mothers receive the FBC sessions will have significantly&#xD;
      lower BMI one year after the intervention compared to control group children whose families&#xD;
      receive an active placebo control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses In families that receive the FBC, household availability of fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables will increase, and availability of high fat foods will decrease, as measured by&#xD;
      multiple household food inventories, compared to control group families exposed to an active&#xD;
      placebo intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Household level of food security, mothers' food purchase motives and family food interaction&#xD;
      will influence the effects of the FBC on household food supplies.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease accounted for 40.6% of deaths in the United States in 1998. Although&#xD;
      CVD does not manifest until adulthood, risk factors for CVD, such as obesity, may develop in&#xD;
      childhood and persist into adulthood. We propose to test the efficacy of an intervention&#xD;
      designed to prevent obesity in low-income, Mexican American children. Mexican-American&#xD;
      children are more obese than other minority groups in the U.S. population, and are the&#xD;
      fastest growing minority group in the U.S.A. Poor dietary practices, especially food habits&#xD;
      that are acquired as families acculturate to the American food supply, are thought to be&#xD;
      associated with children's excess weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial in which 150 families receive family-based&#xD;
      behavioral counseling (FBC) sessions and 150 families receive an active placebo control&#xD;
      intervention. Mothers and their second or third grade children from sixteen low-wealth&#xD;
      elementary schools will be randomized into either the treatment or control interventions. The&#xD;
      purpose of the FBC sessions is to change children's food environment. Specifically, we intend&#xD;
      to increase the amount of fruit and vegetables, and decrease the amount of high fat foods&#xD;
      available to children in their homes. In addition, we will encourage parents to model healthy&#xD;
      dietary practices for their children. Two intervention strategies, a video, &quot;What's to Eat?&quot;&#xD;
      developed for this population and photographs of each family's food practices, taken by&#xD;
      family members, will be used in the counseling sessions. The control intervention will&#xD;
      consist of group sessions using a curriculum that adapts standard nutrition recommendations&#xD;
      for traditional Mexican-American foods. Community health advisors will conduct both the FBC&#xD;
      and control sessions. The primary outcome of the trial is children's BMI. The secondary&#xD;
      outcome is household food supplies. We hypothesize that within a one year timeframe,&#xD;
      children's whose mothers are exposed to the FBC will have lower BMI's compared to children&#xD;
      whose mothers receive the active placebo control intervention. The mechanism through which we&#xD;
      intend to change weight status is altering the type of foods available to children in their&#xD;
      homes. Therefore, two household food inventories, one collected prior to and one after the&#xD;
      family's payday will be used as secondary outcomes. In addition, mothers' reports of&#xD;
      household food security level, food purchase motives, and family food interaction will be&#xD;
      collected as covariates. Measurements will be collected within one month of completing the&#xD;
      interventions and at six months and one year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family Based Counseling. Community health advisors visit mothers who are randomly assigned to&#xD;
      the FBC sessions once a month, for six months, in their homes. During the first session,&#xD;
      mothers watch the video, &quot;What's to Eat?&quot; with the CHA and discuss food related parenting&#xD;
      issues. In the subsequent five sessions, photographs of the family's food habits, taken by&#xD;
      mothers, are used as visual aids for the intervention sessions. In addition, at each session,&#xD;
      the CHA provides mothers with a food sample related to their dietary change goal. Examples of&#xD;
      the types of foods provided to families include fat free milk, cooking oil spray, fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables or low fat yogurt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Based Nutrition Sessions Families assigned to the group sessions are invited to one&#xD;
      group session a month for six months. Group sessions are held in the morning and the evening&#xD;
      to accommodate mothers' schedules. The groups sessions are based on a standard&#xD;
      Mexican-American nutrition curriculum. This curriculum consists of a video and five lesson&#xD;
      plans based on the USDA Food Guide Pyramid that emphasize foods indigenous to the Mexican&#xD;
      diet. In addition to lessons from the curriculum, nutrition games, based on popular game&#xD;
      shows such as &quot;Nutrition Jeopardy&quot; and &quot;Family Feud&quot; are also played during the sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure - Children's Weight Status Height &amp; Weight: Standing height will be&#xD;
      measured twice, to the nearest millimeter, using a portable direct reading stadiometer. If&#xD;
      the two measures differ by more than 5 mm, a third measure will be obtained. Body weight will&#xD;
      be measured twice, to the nearest 0.1 kg, using digital scales with subjects wearing light&#xD;
      indoor clothing without shoes. If the two measures differ by more than 0.2 kg, a third&#xD;
      measure will be obtained. The mean of the two measures, or the median of three measures, are&#xD;
      used to calculate BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Variable Our intervention is designed to prevent obesity in children by&#xD;
      changing their food environments. Therefore, the secondary outcome for this research is&#xD;
      changes in the type of food available to children in their homes. Specifically, a,&#xD;
      quantitative household food inventory that assess the actual amount of fruit, vegetables,&#xD;
      high fat foods and total food energy is collected. Inventories are collected within three&#xD;
      days of grocery shopping. Two trained research assistants conduct each inventory, which&#xD;
      require approximately 15 to 60 minutes to complete. All foods except spices, hot sauces,&#xD;
      baking powder, baking soda, coffee, tea and spoiled foods are collected in the inventories.&#xD;
      The amounts listed on the label of packaged, canned, or frozen foods are recorded, and if&#xD;
      opened, the proportion remaining in the package is recorded. The amount of meat or cheese is&#xD;
      recorded in pounds based on the package label. The number of fresh fruits, vegetables and&#xD;
      eggs are counted. Beverages are recorded in fluid ounces or gallons. Prepared foods on the&#xD;
      stove or leftover in the refrigerator are estimated in cups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers' Socio-environment Measurements Demographics: Demographic variables, including&#xD;
      household composition, who in the household shares the same food supplies, and where mothers&#xD;
      purchase or receive food supplies (including WIC or food donations) will be collected from&#xD;
      the mothers. To examine the variability in household food supplies relative to pay day,&#xD;
      mothers will also report when their family receives pay checks. Children's demographic&#xD;
      variables will include gender, age, and grade level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Household Level of Food Security: Food security is defined as people's assured access to&#xD;
      enough acceptable food, that is acquired in socially acceptable ways, for an active and&#xD;
      healthy life. This construct will be measured using the 18 item U.S.D.A. Core Food Security&#xD;
      Module (FSM). This instrument conceptualizes food security as consisting of four components:&#xD;
      1) quantity of food, 2) quality of food, 3) food anxiety and 4) food acquisition in socially&#xD;
      acceptable ways (166, 167). Households are categorized into four levels of food insecurity:&#xD;
      1) food secure, 2) food insecure without hunger, 3) food insecure with moderate hunger and 4)&#xD;
      food insecure with severe hunger (i.e., children's food intake is restricted).&#xD;
