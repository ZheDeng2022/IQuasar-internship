  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that can cause&#xD;
      substantial pain and joint tenderness, significant joint damage, and serious disability. The&#xD;
      treatment goals are minimization of the signs and symptoms of the disease, and the reduction&#xD;
      of irreversible joint damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying RA is elucidated, the&#xD;
      opportunity to target specific inflammatory processes with new therapies has improved.&#xD;
      Rheumatoid arthritis is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease and there are various therapies,&#xD;
      including newer experimental therapies, which target either the activation of T cells or the&#xD;
      neutralization of their effector mechanisms. These newer therapies have shown benefit in&#xD;
      human and animal models of RA. Extracorporeal photoimmune therapy (ECP) has been shown to be&#xD;
      safe and effective in the palliative treatment of the skin manifestations of cutaneous T cell&#xD;
      lymphoma. Experimental studies have also demonstrated activity of ECP treatment in several T&#xD;
      cell mediated diseases including graft versus-host disease, rejection after organ&#xD;
      transplantation, and selected autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate a cell-based therapy (ECP) in patients who have an inadequate&#xD;
      response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biological agents to determine&#xD;
      if ECP treatment can reduce the signs and symptoms of RA in this refractory patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a history of RA per the ACR criteria for the classification of RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have moderately to severely active RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Moderately to severely active RA patients are defined as those patients meeting the&#xD;
        following classification criteria, upon review by a physician, during screening: At least&#xD;
        nine tender joints; At least six swollen joints;&#xD;
&#xD;
        PLUS (at least one of the following):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Morning stiffness, lasting greater than or equal to 45 minutes; Erythrocyte Sedimentation&#xD;
        Rate greater than or equal to 28 mm/hour (ESR, to be evaluated at a local laboratory) or C&#xD;
        reactive protein (CRP) greater than or equal to 15 mg/dL (to be evaluated at a central&#xD;
        laboratory).&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Patients must have an inadequate response and continue to have moderately to severely&#xD;
        active disease while on current or previous treatment with at least one agent from both of&#xD;
        the following groups: methotrexate (greater than or equal to 15 mg/week, or maximum&#xD;
        tolerated dose) or leflunomide (20 mg/day, or maximum tolerated dose) for at least 12 weeks&#xD;
        prior to screening; etanercept ( greater than or equal to 25 mg/2 x week SC, or maximum&#xD;
        tolerated dose) for at least 12 weeks prior to screening, infliximab (greater than or equal&#xD;
        to 3 mg/kg IV, or maximum tolerated dose) for at least 14 weeks duration prior to&#xD;
        screening, or adalimumab (greater than or equal to 40 mg SC every 2 weeks, or maximum&#xD;
        tolerated dose) for at least 12 weeks prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: In individual cases or in a country where access to anti TNF agents is limited or&#xD;
        anti TNF agents are unavailable, the Investigator should document the reason for lack of&#xD;
        availability of this treatment. Those patients who have not been treated with an anti-TNF&#xD;
        agent would still be eligible for the study if they have failed treatment with at least two&#xD;
        additional DMARDs, besides MTX and/or leflunomide. All patients may have also failed&#xD;
        treatment with other biological agents or a protein A column.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not on oral corticosteroids. OR Patients who have been on a stable&#xD;
             dose of oral corticosteroids at a prednisone equivalent dosage greater than or equal&#xD;

             Abstinence or partner/spouse sterility may also qualify at the Investigator's&#xD;
             discretion. If a female patient is of childbearing potential, she must have a negative&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to tolerate the extracorporeal volume shifts associated with ECP&#xD;
             treatment due to the presence of any of the following conditions: uncompensated&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
             disease, severe asthma, renal failure, or hepatic failure.&#xD;
