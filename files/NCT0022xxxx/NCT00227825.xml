      The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot study of Motivational Enhancement Therapy&#xD;
      (MET), an empirically validated behavioral change strategy, with young adults who are HIV +.&#xD;
      The aim is to determine if MET is effective in increasing general health promotion behaviors,&#xD;
      adherence to HIV+ specific medical treatment over and above taking medication, and decreasing&#xD;
      risky behaviors in young adults who are HIV positive. The longer-term objective is to&#xD;
      identify and way to decrease HIV transmission rates, disease progression, illness episodes,&#xD;
      and hospitalizations in this high-risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: 1)Youth receiving the motivational intervention plus referrals will report&#xD;
      greater reductions in risky behaviors than youth in the control group receiving standard care&#xD;
      plus referrals at 3-months post-baseline. This hypothesis will first be tested in the whole&#xD;
      sample using an overall risk index. Then, the hypothesis will be tested with each behavior&#xD;
      (reduced drug and alcohol use, condom use, taking medications,) within the subgroups&#xD;
      reporting problem levels of that behavior; 2)Youth in the intervention group will demonstrate&#xD;
      improved viral loads, will report greater improvement in perceived health status, depression,&#xD;
      general psychological distress, disclosure to sexual partners, and will demonstrate greater&#xD;
      attendance of medical and support service appointments than youth in the control group at 3&#xD;
      months post-baseline; 3)Youth in the intervention group will report greater reductions in&#xD;
      temptation to engage in risky behaviors, increased self-efficacy, and improvements in&#xD;
      readiness to change their behavior than youth in the control group at 3 months post-baseline;&#xD;
      4)The differences between the intervention and control group from pre- to post- intervention&#xD;
      will be maintained at 6, 9, 12, and 15 months post-baseline (3, 6, 9, and 12 months after&#xD;
      intervention completion).&#xD;

      The proposed study is a randomized clinical trial with a wait-list control. The sample will&#xD;
      be 60 HIV+ young adults between the ages of 16 to 24 years recruited from the DMC Horizons&#xD;
      Project and other community based HIV programs. Self referred persons meeting the diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria of HIV+ will also be accepted. There are no exclusion criteria. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: MET NOW or MET LATER. MET LATER is the wait list&#xD;
      control group. The only difference between the groups is the timing of the intervention and&#xD;
      data collection. All subjects will complete 5 research visits and 4 MET therapy sessions.&#xD;
      Research visits consists of an interview, completion of self-report questionnaires, a 20cc&#xD;
      blood drawn for complete blood count (CBC), viral load and CD4 count, and adherence rating&#xD;
      completed by the physician. Established questionnaires are used to measure health behaviors,&#xD;
      sexual risk behaviors, substance use, self-efficacy, stage of change, social support, health&#xD;
      beliefs, and mental health status. Research visits take about 1 = hours. Therapy sessions&#xD;
      consist of MET provided by a trained therapist. Sessions last about 1 hour and focus on&#xD;
      changing behavior to improve health, increase medical adherence, and/or reduce risk. Subjects&#xD;
      choose the behaviors they want to change. There are a total of 4 sessions over 3 months. The&#xD;
      MET NOW group will begin session immediately after the first (baseline) research visit and&#xD;
      the MET LATER group will begin therapy sessions approximately 9 months after the first&#xD;
      research visit. All subjects will be paid $25.00 for the first research visit with a $5&#xD;
      increase for each subsequent research visit, a total of $175.00 for the 5 research visits.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive $10 gift certificate at each therapy session. Cab vouchers or parking&#xD;
      fees will be provided for each therapy or research session.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A sample of 60 HIV+youth, ages 16-24, will be recruited from the four health care&#xD;
             sites in the Michigan Title IV Project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In order to increase the likelihood that the current intervention will be easily&#xD;
             transportable to real world settings, exclusion criteria are kept to a minimum. No&#xD;
             exclusions will be made due to co-morbid mental health problems ( i.e. ADHD, conduct&#xD;
             disorder, depression, anxiety disorder), with the exception of thought disorder (i.e.&#xD;
             schizophrenia, autism). It is assumed that severe psychosis in conjunction with HIV&#xD;
             may require management strategies beyond the scope of the MET interventions (i.e.&#xD;
             residential placement). As resources are not available in the current grant to hire&#xD;
             and train therapists who are bilingual or translate study questionnaires/measures,&#xD;
             subjects will required to speak English fluently. Hispanic or Arabic families who meet&#xD;
             this criterion will be included in the study. Currently, all clients at the clinic&#xD;
             sites meet this last criterion.&#xD;
