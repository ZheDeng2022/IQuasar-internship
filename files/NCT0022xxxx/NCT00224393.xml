      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Enbrel in patients with primary&#xD;
      systemic amyloidosis using a one-stage, phase II study design with an interim analysis. This&#xD;
      study will also assess survival and progression times, symptom relief, and toxicity&#xD;
      associated with Enbrel in primary systemic amyloidosis patients. Two groups of patients with&#xD;
      very different risk profiles can be identified with respect to this disease. Patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic cardiac disease and/or at least two involved organs ar at high risk and&#xD;
      historically have a median survival less than six months. Patients without these conditions&#xD;
      have a significantly better prognosis. Both subgroups will be studied in the present study,&#xD;
      and essentially two phase-II clinical trials, one for each subgroup, will be run in parallel.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &gt;=18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory values obtained &lt;=14 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No limitation on the cardiac ejection fraction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin &lt;3 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;=500/microliters&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histochemical diagnosis of amyloidosis as based on detection by polarizing microscopy&#xD;
             of green bi-refringent material in Congo red-stained tissue specimens or&#xD;
             characteristic electron microscopy appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrable M-protein in the serum/urine or clonal population of plasma cells in the&#xD;
             bone marrow or immunohistochemical stain with anti-light chain anti-sera of amyloid&#xD;
             fibrils.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1, 2, or 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic organ involvement with amyloid to justify therapy. This could include&#xD;
             liver involvement, cardiac involvement, renal involvement, peripheral neuropathy, or&#xD;
             soft tissue involvement. Must have more than purpura or carpal tunnel syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously treated or untreated. No limit to prior therapy provided there is adequate&#xD;
             residual organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to self-inject medication or have a caregiver who can administer the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Amyloid-specific syndrome, such as, carpal tunnel syndrome or skin purpura as only&#xD;
             evidence of disease. The finding of vascular amyloid only in a bone marrow biopsy&#xD;
             specimen or in a plasmacytoma is not indicative of systemic amyloidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of non-AL amyloidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Melphalan or other alkylating agents, high-dose dexamethasone or alpha interferon &lt;=4&#xD;
             weeks prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of corticosteroids, but patients may be on chronic steroids if they are&#xD;
             being given for disorders other than amyloid, i.e., adrenal insufficiency, rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Nursing women&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate&#xD;
                  contraception (condoms, diaphragm, birth control pills, injections, intrauterine&#xD;
                  device [IUD], surgical sterilization, abstinence, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically overt multiple myeloma (monoclonal BMPC &gt;30%), and at least one of the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bone lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hypercalcemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active malignancy with the exception of adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell&#xD;
             skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated Stage I or II cancer from&#xD;
             which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any other cancer from which&#xD;
             the patient has been disease-free for 5 years.&#xD;
