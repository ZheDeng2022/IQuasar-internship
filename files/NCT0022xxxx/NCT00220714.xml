  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients who have recently received a diagnosis of schizophrenia (e.g., &quot;first-episode&#xD;
      schizophrenia&quot;) respond very well to their antipsychotic medication when they are acutely&#xD;
      ill. Once they are more stable, research has shown that first-episode patients need to remain&#xD;
      on their antipsychotic medication. Follow-up studies show that stopping medication&#xD;
      prematurely is the most common cause of relapse and readmission. It is important to have new&#xD;
      ways to help patients stay stable in the community in order for them to continue on with&#xD;
      their rehabilitation and recovery process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last decade, new antipsychotic medications have been developed that are more&#xD;
      effective and have fewer side effects than older antipsychotics. The new medicines are often&#xD;
      called &quot;atypical&quot;, and were only available by pill or capsule for long-term treatment. Most&#xD;
      recently, one of the atypical medications - risperidone - became available as a long-acting&#xD;
      injection that can be given once every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that patients recovering from an acute episode and who then&#xD;
      go on to receive a long-acting version of atypical antipsychotic medication (long-acting&#xD;
      risperidone microspheres) will stay on their medications for longer than those who take their&#xD;
      atypical medication (any available first-line atypical) in the oral (pill) form.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overview: Before the atypicals were introduced, some of the older antipsychotics were&#xD;
      available in oral (pill or capsule) and long-acting (depot) versions. Despite the potential&#xD;
      advantages of the depot versions, in those days clinicians in the United States have&#xD;
      historically limited the use of long-acting, &quot;depot&quot; antipsychotics to their most&#xD;
      treatment-resistant, chronic, patients. Therefore, most clinicians did not routinely consider&#xD;
      starting a long-acting antipsychotic early in the course of treatment, such as after the&#xD;
      first-episode of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This whole issue was less relevant after the atypical medications came out, because they were&#xD;
      only available in oral versions for long-term treatment. Now that one of the atypical&#xD;
      medications (risperidone) is available for use in the United States, the issue of appropriate&#xD;
      use of oral vs. long-acting atypical is now very relevant to clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For first episode patients, there are been two issues that suggest that the route of&#xD;
      medication delivery is an important area to study. First is that almost all first-episode&#xD;
      patients will stop their medication too soon. Second, a there now is atypical antipsychotic&#xD;
      available in a long-acting preparation (long-acting risperidone, but this option is not often&#xD;
      used right away after a first episode, so there is little guidance for clinicians about the&#xD;
      effectiveness of long-acting antipsychotics used right away after a first-episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study compares the effectiveness of the long-acting route of medication to&#xD;
      improve adherence and reduce relapse among patients who have been recently diagnosed with&#xD;
      schizophrenia or a related psychotic disorder. After patients are stabilized with an atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotic and have received patient and family psychoeducation, consenting patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to a prospective, random-assignment open-label study comparing any available&#xD;
      first-line oral atypical antipsychotic to long-acting risperidone for the maintenance&#xD;
      treatment of patients recovering from acute treatment of first-episode schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is divided into three study phases. Study Phase I is the acute phase, where&#xD;
      consenting patients would be given an acute open-label trial of an oral antipsychotic.&#xD;
      Patients who respond within a maximum of 12 weeks to acute therapy will then be invited to&#xD;
      participate in Phase II of the study. Patients agreeing to Phase II will then be randomized&#xD;
      into staying on their oral antipsychotic medication vs. switching to a long-acting atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotic (long-acting risperidone). Patients would be followed for 12 weeks to determine&#xD;
      whether or not they accept a recommendation of long-acting antipsychotic or continued oral&#xD;
      antipsychotic. Then patients enter into Study Phase III, where they are followed for at the&#xD;
      remainder of the year. We want to learn how often patients will accept their doctor's&#xD;
      recommendation of a long-acting injection, whether persons taking their antipsychotic&#xD;
      medication in long-acting form do better in terms of willingness to stay on their medication,&#xD;
      or have better symptom control or fewer side effects, than persons where the doctor&#xD;
      recommends the medication in oral (pill) form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary: Patients recently diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia, e.g. the&#xD;
      &quot;first-episode&quot; patient might benefit from an atypical antipsychotic given in a long-acting&#xD;
      route of drug- delivery. However, long-acting antipsychotic therapy is not routinely&#xD;
      considered in first-episode patients. Studying the acceptance and ultimate effectiveness of a&#xD;
      long-acting atypical antipsychotic would be very helpful in understanding how to help&#xD;
      patients stay stable and ultimately prevent a revolving door pattern that, if it continues,&#xD;
      can be devastating to the recovery process.&#xD;
