    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of the most frequent forms of chronic pain and can result&#xD;
      in significant functional impairment. This is often associated with major depression too.&#xD;
      Previous research reported significant beneficial effects of antidepressant medication in&#xD;
      alleviating depression and pain intensity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of Escitalopram, a new kind of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) in patients with&#xD;
      CLBP in a prospective, randomized and double-blind clinical trial. The main hypothesis is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -in comparison to placebo, subjects with CLBP and Cipralex report a significant reduction in&#xD;
      depressive symptoms (&gt;= 50% of HAMD questionnaire) after 4 weeks of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience. Chronic pain, including chronic low&#xD;
      back pain, represents a major public health problem. Risk factors of chronicity of low back&#xD;
      pain include high levels of psychological distress prior to or during the episode, premorbid&#xD;
      association with work status or employment dissatisfaction, unemployment, poor self-rated&#xD;
      health and low levels of physical activity. Other psychosocial features are poor social and&#xD;
      educational status, previous sexual or physical abuse. Furthermore, mechanical strain on the&#xD;
      spine from heavy lifting, repetitive lifting, twisting and vibration, including driving&#xD;
      increase the risk. Static work postures, prolonged standing or walking, road traffic&#xD;
      accidents and falls are also significantly related.While there is little evidence for a&#xD;
      specific personality profile, stress, distress, anxiety, mood disorders and depression were&#xD;
      consistently related to neck and back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLBP is associated with significant disability, functional impairment, high rates of&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms including anxiety and depression, and loss of other physical roles.&#xD;
      These may produce social and functional problems, which include reduced earning capacity,&#xD;
      unemployment and family disharmony. Chronic pain is also associated with loss of self&#xD;
      confidence and self-esteem, leading to social withdrawal and social isolation. Men with CLBP&#xD;
      have significantly higher lifetime rates of major depression, alcohol use disorder and major&#xD;
      anxiety disorder. After age of pain onset, CLBP subjects had over 9 times the risk of&#xD;
      developing major depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression is believed to be mediated by 5-HT and norepinephrine through the raphe nucleus&#xD;
      and locus coeruleus projections to the cerebral cortex and forebrain limbic systems, whereas&#xD;
      pain is believed to be mediated in part through descending 5-HT and norepinephrine pain&#xD;
      pathways that provide inhibitory input to the dorsal horn neurons in the spinal cord. Global&#xD;
      deficiences in 5-HT or norepinephrine neurotransmission would be predicted to affect both&#xD;
      mood and pain thresholds, possibly accounting for the hgh comorbidity of painful symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with depression.Accordingly, enhancement of both neurotransmitter or 5-HT alone&#xD;
      would be expected both to improve symptoms of depression and to normalize pain thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In antidepressant treatment of CLBP, only 2 studies were published using SSRIs. One reported&#xD;
      significantly higher pain intensity reduction in maprotilin group compared to paroxetine and&#xD;
      placebo. The other showed no effect of paroxetine on depression or pain. Patients on SSRI,&#xD;
      however, reduced the amount of analgesic medication.&#xD;
