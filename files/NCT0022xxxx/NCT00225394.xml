  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CMV viral disease negatively affects transplant patients. CMV is the most prevalent infection&#xD;
      in transplant patients and 3 month drug regimens to prevent the virus have been mostly&#xD;
      unsuccessful, usually after the drug has been stopped, the patient develops the viral&#xD;
      disease. Extended use of anti-viral drugs may, in fact, may lead to the development of&#xD;
      resistant virus. We hypothesize that extended use (12 months) of valganciclovir&#xD;
      (Valcyte™)will not only be efficacious but will not be associated with the development of&#xD;
      resistant CMV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 100 patients at 3 sites have been enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection: Adult (&gt;18 years) recipients of cadaveric or living donor kidneys,&#xD;
      pancreas, or combine kidney-pancreas transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunosuppression: To be determined according to each center's standard protocol (s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug: Valcyte™ Days 0 - 90: All Patients, 900 mg QD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 91 - 365:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: 900 mg QD Group 2: 450 mg QD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Valgancicovir (Valcyte™)Resistant CMV : Serial serum samples (at transplant, 6&#xD;
      weeks, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-transplant) for PCR amplification and DNA sequence&#xD;
      analysis from detectable CMV to identify the presence of mutations within the UL97 and UL54&#xD;
      genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional information will be evaluated relating to the development of CMV disease,&#xD;
      development of ganciclovir toxicity, graft rejection or graft loss and patient death.&#xD;
      Preliminary information regarding the predictive value of DNA assays for the development of&#xD;
      CMV disease will be evaluated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CMV infection occurs most frequently in the first three months following transplantation and&#xD;
      following treatment for acute rejection; both instances can be related to relatively high&#xD;
      levels of immunosuppression relative to stable long-term allograft recipients. Disease then&#xD;
      can occur and is manifest as fever, low white blood cell count, pneumonitis, gastroenteritis,&#xD;
      hepatitis, retinitis, and a multitude of other symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ganciclovir, a potent inhibitor of the herpesviridae DNA polymerase encoded for on the unique&#xD;
      long (UL54) region of the CMV genome, has had a significant impact on both the prophylaxis&#xD;
      and treatment of CMV infection in transplant patients. CMV-infected cells produce a&#xD;
      phosphotransferase, or kinase (UL97 region) that phosphorylates ganciclovir to&#xD;
      ganciclovir-triphosphate. The triphosphate product inhibits CMV replication by competitively&#xD;
      inhibiting the incorporation of deoxyguanine triphosphate (dGTP) into the DNA region encoding&#xD;
      the polymerase (UL54 region), thus resulting in the premature termination of viral DNA&#xD;
      synthesis. Resistance to ganciclovir is conferred when mutations occur on the UL97 region of&#xD;
      the CMV genome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ganciclovir is available in either an oral or an intravenous formulation. The obvious&#xD;
      advantages of the oral formulation are somewhat offset by the fact that its bioavailability&#xD;
      is only 8 to 10%. The product has been reformulated with the addition of an L-valyl ester;&#xD;
      the resulting compound, valganciclovir (Valcyte™) is metabolized to ganciclovir and has a 3&#xD;
      to 7 fold increase in bioavailability and is able to maintain serum concentrations equivalent&#xD;
      to the intravenous formulation. This provides a convenient method for obtaining therapeutic&#xD;
      concentrations of ganciclovir for extended periods of time without the need for in-dwelling&#xD;
      intravenous lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal length of treatment has not been established and relapse rates as high as 25% are&#xD;
      common upon cessation of the antiviral agent.6 Patients with CMV disease are initially&#xD;
      treated with intravenous ganciclovir for two or more weeks, and then with an oral agent for&#xD;
      many weeks thereafter. Current laboratory technology allows detection of active viral&#xD;
      replication, either through the detection of the pp65 antigen on the surface of infected&#xD;
      leukocytes or through the use PCR amplification for the detection of viral DNA. It is&#xD;
      however, still unclear whether the best therapeutic option is to treat until symptoms&#xD;
      disappear or to treat until evidence of active viral replication ceases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question of whether or not prolonged exposure to ganciclovir will result in an increase&#xD;
      in the incidence of resistant CMV strains has not been answered. There is also a theoretical&#xD;
      increase in the risk of selection pressure for resistant CMV when the lower dose of&#xD;
      valganciclovir (450 mg) is used. This proposal will document the emergence of&#xD;
      ganciclovir-resistant strains of CMV in high-risk kidney, pancreas, or combined&#xD;
      kidney/pancreas transplant patients receiving long-term suppressive therapy with Valcyte™ and&#xD;
      will also address the issue of selection pressure by randomizing for low and high dose&#xD;
      valganciclovir prophylaxis. Emergence of resistance will be defined as detection of a&#xD;
      resistance-conferring mutation in the UL97 (phosphotransferase) or UL54 (DNA polymerase) open&#xD;
      reading frame of detectable CMV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      To document:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The emergence of ganciclovir-resistant CMV by PCR amplification and DNA sequence&#xD;
           analysis for detecting resistance-conferring mutations of UL97 and/or UL54 open reading&#xD;
           frames.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The development and time-to-onset of CMV disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
      To document:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The development of ganciclovir toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Loss of kidney and/or pancreas graft function&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient death&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary&#xD;
&#xD;
      To attempt to determine the predictive value of DNA assays for the development of CMV&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a phase 4, 4 center, and randomized pilot study. Kidney, pancreas or combined&#xD;
      kidney/pancreas transplant patients that receive induction anti-thymocyte globulin or OKT3&#xD;
      and/or are either seropositive for CMV or receive a graft from a CMV seropositive donor will&#xD;
      receive Valcyte™ 900 mg daily for 90 days. Patients will then be randomized to either 450 mg&#xD;
      or 900 mg Valcyte™ each day for days 91 to 365. Patients will be serially monitored for the&#xD;
      development of ganciclovir-resistant CMV. Patients will receive standard immunosuppression,&#xD;
      antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis, and other necessary medications as determined by&#xD;
      their physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints: Time to development of any CMV disease or emergence of&#xD;
      ganciclovir-resistant CMV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates for median time to CMV disease for both&#xD;
      treatment groups will be used, and a Kaplan-Meier survival curve will be plotted to compare&#xD;
      treatment difference. Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates for median time to CMV resistance&#xD;
      for both treatment groups will be used, and a Kaplan-Meier survival curve will be plotted to&#xD;
      compare treatment difference. In addition, the Cox regression will be performed to compare&#xD;
      treatment groups using treatment as a covariate in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: Incidence of ganciclovir toxicity, loss of kidney and/or pancreas, and&#xD;
      patient death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Cox regression will be performed to compare treatment groups using treatment and&#xD;
      incidence of resistance as covariates in the model. Fisher's exact test will be used to&#xD;
      analyze the loss of kidney and/or pancreas allograft function, and patient mortality.&#xD;
      Toxicity within the two prophylaxis cohorts will be compared using Fisher's exact test, also.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary Endpoint: Efficacy of DNA assay to predict CMV disease. Method: A two-tailed t test&#xD;
      comparison will be used to test the hypothesis that high copy numbers of CMV DNA correlate&#xD;
      with the development of CMV disease. Additionally, a test based on a Cox proportional hazard&#xD;
      model will be used to assess other variables and their impact on the development of CMV&#xD;
      resistance and their relationship to copy numbers of DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above parameters will be assessed at three time points…6 months from the initiation of&#xD;
      the trial, at 12 months post enrollment for each patient, and again at 24 months&#xD;
      post-enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions of CMV CMV Infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV infection is defined as the isolation or identification of CMV from any site (blood,&#xD;
      urine, sputum, stool), positive seroconversion (presence of positive CMV IgM or a four-fold&#xD;
      increase in the titer of CMV IgG), or evidence of CMV viral replication (pp65 antigenemia or&#xD;
      positive CMV by PCR amplification techniques) in the absence of clinical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV Syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV syndrome is defined as a virologically confirmed illness with any of the following:&#xD;
      fever, pneumonia, leukopenia, lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia, serum alanine aminotranferase&#xD;
      levels &gt; 2.5 x normal, with or without &quot;flu-like&quot; manifestations of viral immunity (malaise,&#xD;
      myalgias, arthralgias, anorexia, nausea, vomiting). Any patient presenting with any of these&#xD;
      signs or symptoms at any time during this study will have blood, body fluid, and/or biopsy&#xD;
      specimen sent for viral confirmation which may include any of the following studies:&#xD;
      histology for the presence of inclusion bodies, immunofluorescence of antibody to pp65&#xD;
      antigen or qualitative presence of CMV genome by PCR amplification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV disease will be defined as CMV infection and syndrome with any of the following: evidence&#xD;
      of host cellular viral inclusions on biopsy or body fluid for cytology, a positive&#xD;
      conventional viral culture for CMV, a positive &quot;rapid antigen&quot; test for the presence of pp65&#xD;
      antigen on the cell surface of buffy coat leukocytes, or the qualitative presence of CMV DNA&#xD;
      as analyzed by PCR amplified virus. Specimens used for the above diagnostic procedures may&#xD;
      include blood, liver or lung biopsy, endoscopic mucosal biopsy or brushing, bronchoalveolar&#xD;
      lavage, or cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe CMV Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe CMV disease is defined as CMV disease in two or more organs or one or more of the&#xD;
      following: CMV pneumonia, CMV retinitis, CMV CNS involvement, and invasive fungal or&#xD;
      parasitic disease in association with CMV infection of any sort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV Mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV mortality is defined as any death due to symptomatic CMV disease or death from any&#xD;
      opportunistic infection while there is evidence of CMV disease or ongoing CMV viral&#xD;
      replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ganciclovir Resistant CMV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ganciclovir resistant CMV is defined as the detection of a resistance-conferring mutation of&#xD;
      the UL97 and/or the UL54 open reading frame by DNA sequence analysis of PCR amplified CMV&#xD;
      genome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valganciclovir (Valcyte™)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valcyte™ is a product of Roche Laboratories, Nutley, New Jersey. Patients will receive 450 or&#xD;
      900 mg per day depending on the stage of the study and the individual's randomization. Dosage&#xD;
      will be adjusted for renal insufficiency as per package insert. If creatinine clearance&#xD;
      (crcl) is &gt;60 (ml/min), no adjustment is needed. If crcl is 40-59, patients can only receive&#xD;
      up to 450 mg once daily. Therefore, those randomized to the 900mg/day cohort will receive 450&#xD;
      mg and those randomized to receive 450 mg/day will receive 450 mg every other day (QOD). If&#xD;
      creatinine clearance is less than 40 and will never improve, patients will be excluded or&#xD;
      terminated from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunosuppression&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunosuppressive medications will be administered according to the protocols in place at&#xD;
      each participating center. The choice of maintenance immunosuppression and treatment for&#xD;
      rejection will be at the discretion of the center's principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Anti-infectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study will receive anti-bacterial and anti-fungal prophylaxis as&#xD;
      determined by the protocol in place for their transplanted organ at their transplant center.&#xD;
      The use of antibiotics and anti-fungals for the treatment of disease will be at the&#xD;
      discretion of the individual patient's physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematopoietic Growth Factors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regrastim (GM-CSF) (Prokine® Hoechst-Roussel, and Leukine®, Immunex) and filgrastim (G-CSF)&#xD;
      (Neupogen®, Amgen) may be used at the discretion of the physician for the treatment of&#xD;
      leukopenia, including ganciclovir-related leukopenia.&#xD;
