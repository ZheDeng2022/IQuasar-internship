    <textblock>
      The purpose is to find out if Icleen IQAir, HEPA-filter air cleaners with high capacity and&#xD;
      pre-set speed functions, have a beneficial effect on patients with asthma and allergy to&#xD;
      dogs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Air cleaners will be installed in the bedrooms and living rooms in the homes of children and&#xD;
      adolescents aged 8-17 years at the study entry, with allergy to dogs, but not to house dust&#xD;
      mites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will look upon the significance of this study, and of a previous study with&#xD;
      a similar design and the same main parameters to find out if this trial supports the results&#xD;
      of the first trial by the same project leader, or makes it likely that the seemingly&#xD;
      beneficial effects of the first study occurred by chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hyperventilation cold air challenge test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supportive parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  serum ECP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  symptom scores&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be a parallel, double blind placebo controlled one.&#xD;

&#xD;
      AIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine if powerful air cleaners with HEPA-filters and a pre-set speed function making it&#xD;
      possible to run the air cleaners at a high, but noisy speed at acceptable times, and , if&#xD;
      wanted, at a lower, but less noisy speed at other times, (Icleen IQAir®) , have a favourable&#xD;
      effect on asthma in children and adolescents aged 8-17 years, who are allergic to dogs, but&#xD;
      not to house dust mite. To look at this study separately, but also look upon the total&#xD;
      results of this study and a previous study performed by the project leader.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first study is not yet published. We found signs of clinically significant effects of&#xD;
      active air cleaners by the parameters ECP in serum and bronchial hyperreactivity by a cold&#xD;
      air hyperventilation test, but the results gave p-values at the border of statistical&#xD;
      significance, p=0.104 for FEV1 reduction, and significant results, p=0.018 for differences in&#xD;
      the change of ECP. The number of patients included in the study was 49, a lower number than&#xD;
      wanted in the first place. We did not find significant effects on Liz Juniper's Life Quality&#xD;
      Scale scores. Yet, there are reasons to believe that the results of the first study may have&#xD;
      clinical significance. A cold air hyperventilation test reflects a real life situation in&#xD;
      interior parts of Norway, resembling outdoor winter conditions strongly. In the first study&#xD;
      Allergy Control encasing over pillows, eiderdowns and mattresses were applied compared to&#xD;
      placebo, but no signs of effects were found on these children aged 7 to 17 with allergy to&#xD;
      dog or cat, but not to house dust mites. The reason to exclude house dust mite allergic&#xD;
      patients in the first trial was to examine if encasings could have any effect on patients&#xD;
      without house dust mite allergy, and the fact that house dust mite allergy is less common in&#xD;
      Northern interior areas, where the trial took place. Other studies indicate, however, that&#xD;
      air cleaners can reduce allergens from dogs and cats, but not most other indoor allergens&#xD;
      (3). We want to perform a new trial, and publish the results from each trial in one&#xD;
      publication, but also look upon the results of a meta-analysis of both studies. Our hope is&#xD;
      that the two trials can give more reliable information about the effects of the air cleaners.&#xD;
      This time, no dust analyses will be taken, because dust analyses from the first trial, sent&#xD;
      to dr. Susanne Lau at the Charité-Virchow Clinic in Berlin, showed that the air cleaners&#xD;
      removed considerable amounts of dust (personal message from dr. Lau). The results have been&#xD;
      summarised in an article by Groth C et al. in Allergy in 2002, and a manuscript for an&#xD;
      article is now sent to Allergy for publication. The efficiency of IQAir air cleaners has also&#xD;
      been documented by Stiftung Warentest in Germany. Due to limited resources and the signs of&#xD;
      low sensitivity in such a trial, Liz Juniper's Life Quality Scale will not be applied this&#xD;
      time. For economic reasons, hair samples for nicotine analysis will not be taken this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the first trial was completed, an important improvement of the air cleaners has arisen.&#xD;
      A new panel makes it possible to pre-set the air cleaners at different speeds or on and off&#xD;
      at different times of the day, at different days of the week. Once a day, the speed can be&#xD;
      changed to another speed or turned off, and once a day, it can be turned back to the original&#xD;
      speed in advance. In addition, the pre-set function can be overridden manually at any time.&#xD;
      In the first trial, the timer on and off function could turn the air cleaners off once a day&#xD;
      and on once a day, with no active cleaning during the timer off intervals, and no weekday&#xD;
      differentiation of the timer. This improvement increases the likelihood that the air cleaners&#xD;
      will be used at higher (and more noisy) speeds at times when nobody is at home, resulting in&#xD;
      lower levels of flying allergen dust levels even at times when people are at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first trial, we did not find significantly stronger effects in homes with animals than&#xD;
      in homes without animals. Only a fourth of the homes had animals through the whole trial&#xD;
      period. For this reason, we will only include homes without pets this time, in order to get a&#xD;
      more homogenous population. In the first trial, we had a lower age limit of 7. This time, the&#xD;
      lower age limit is 8, to make it easier for patients to co-operate, avoiding frustration for&#xD;
      seven-year-olds who may be excluded due to co-operation difficulties. The reason that we&#xD;
      require dog allergy this time, not dog or cat allergy as in the first trial, is that one&#xD;
      trial indicates that air cleaners only reduce the amount of airborne cat allergens marginally&#xD;
      if no cat is in the room. This trial was performed in homes with cats (5). On the other hand,&#xD;
      a trial of effects of air cleaners in homes with dogs showed a significant reduction of dog&#xD;
      allergens even in rooms where dogs were not present (1). The studies are difficult to&#xD;
      compare, however, because different dust sampling methods were applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients from Hedmark county in south-eastern Norway will be examined for the study at the&#xD;
      start. The patients will be selected from journals of patients having visited the hospital&#xD;
      for asthma during the previous three years, having had verified allergy against dog, but not&#xD;
      house dust mite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Active group: IQAir® air cleaners, one in the patient's bedroom, and one in the room&#xD;
           mostly used by the patient outside the bedroom; with real pre- and main filters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Placebo group: As above, but the main filter substituted by a placebo filter. If the&#xD;
           parents of the child do not live together, and the child visits the other parent at&#xD;
           least every second weekend, both parents will be supplied with air cleaners of the same&#xD;
           type, with equivalent placing of the cleaners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The air cleaners are labelled either A or B, indicating if they are real or fake. Until&#xD;
      closing of the trial, only the manufacturer will know the code. The patients will be&#xD;
      randomised either to A or B, with no stratification. The air cleaners are sealed. Hence, it&#xD;
      is not possible to open them to see what kind of filters they have, without breaking the&#xD;
      seal. Even the placebo filters will seem real, for people not accustomed to looking inside&#xD;
      air cleaners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol attachments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin prick tests and specific IgE will only be performed at visit 1. Other examinations and&#xD;
      questions applied at both visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATTACHMENT 1: Clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Height, weight, inspection of thorax, any stridor must be recorded, respiration frequency,&#xD;
      lung auscultation. The signs recorded after the Kjell Aas scale from P0 to P6:&#xD;
&#xD;
      P0: Normal. P1: No discomfort. Slightly weakened auscultatory ventilation sound. P2: No&#xD;
      discomfort. A few sibili (fine wheezing sounds) or rhonchi at auscultation. Prolonged audible&#xD;
      expirium. No retractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P3: No discomfort at rest. Abundant obstructive sounds. Slight jugular retraction, some use&#xD;
      of auxiliary ventilation muscles. Possibly elevated shoulders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P4: Some discomfort at rest. Abundant obstructive sounds. Fine wheezing heard without&#xD;
      stethoscope. Jugular/intercostal retractions. Use of auxiliary ventilation muscles. Worse&#xD;
      (P5) after cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P5: Considerable discomfort at rest. Abundant obstructive sounds. Wheezing expiration.&#xD;
      Wheezing without stethoscope. Energetic use of auxiliary ventilation muscles. Possibly slight&#xD;
      cyanosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P6: Alarming obstruction. Often even inspiratory obstruction. NB! Weak respiratory sounds,&#xD;
      but retractions and use of auxiliary muscles and tachypnoea are especially alarming. Possible&#xD;
      cyanosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATTACHMENT 2: Cold air provocation test - method Material&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rhes-pro® cold air unit delivering cold air, with a 5.2% CO2 content, to avoid&#xD;
           hypocapnia at hyperventilation. The apparatus must be calibrated to give a standardised&#xD;
           temperature, -15C of the inhaled air at lip level, and 5.2% CO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Flow volume spirometer with computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Before the test, one must make sure that there is enough air and CO2 for the unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs that can affect the results must be avoided at a certain interval. In our study, the&#xD;
      following drugs are withheld at the indicated intervals before the test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short acting beta-2-agonist: 12 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long acting beta-2-agonist: 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beta-2-agonist slow release oral drugs: Generally not used in our clinic. If yet taken :&#xD;
           3 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Theophylline slow release oral drugs: Generally not used in our clinic. If yet taken: 3&#xD;
           days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antihistamines: 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukotriene antagonists: 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atropine derivatives (ipratropium bromide): 8 hours. After the test, the patient can be&#xD;
           given the rest of his ordinary morning drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time of the day&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The test should be performed at the same time every time, preferably in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patient should rest for 15 minutes before the test, to avoid influence by physical&#xD;
           exercise (bicycling, running up stairs etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test method&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tests performed on Mondays must be avoided to prevent influence by casual contacts and&#xD;
           activities in the course of the weekend before the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Travels including staying overnight away from the home for more than a week should be&#xD;
           registered, and the test should be performed more than one week after arriving home from&#xD;
           holiday.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The patient must have normal clinical signs (P0) before the cold air provocation, or the&#xD;
           test must be postponed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Take flow volume test, best FEV1 out of 3 attempts. A printout of the best spirometry&#xD;
           attempt must be stored in the research archive. The flow volume tests shall be performed&#xD;
           in a sitting position. The patient must use a nose clip during spirometry and cold air&#xD;
           provocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Provided FEV1 is &gt;70% of predicted, the test is started. If &lt;70%, it is postponed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The air mixture flow is calculated by the pre-provocation best FEV1 value, by&#xD;
           multiplying FEV1 by 20 for children less than 13 years of age at the first visit, and by&#xD;
           26 for the adolescents more than 13 years of age at the first visit. The patient remains&#xD;
           sitting during the cold air provocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The patient is instructed to breathe rapidly and deeply through the mouthpiece during&#xD;
           the provocation, which lasts for 4 minutes. In practice, the test is performed by&#xD;
           letting the child breathe sufficiently to keep a connected balloon or ventilation bag&#xD;
           halfway filled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Spirometry with FEV1 must be performed straight before and 2 minutes after provocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. MEF50 (=FEF50) at each spirometry being recorded as the spirometry giving the best FEV1&#xD;
           will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Auscultation signs immediately before each series of three spirometry attempts, and&#xD;
           possible cough, will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. After the post-provocation spirometry (two minutes after the provocation), salbutamol,&#xD;
           Ventolin 0,1mg meter dose inhaler by Volumatic will be given for reversibility test; 2&#xD;
           puffs for patients weighing less than 45 kg, and 4 puffs for patients weighing 45 kg and&#xD;
           more; one puff at a time; 5 inhalations per puff. New spirometry will be performed 5&#xD;
           minutes after giving Ventolin, and FEV1 is registered again, in absolute value, and&#xD;
           percentage of the first value, before cold air provocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Even if the risk for acute severe asthmatic symptoms is low, a nebuliser for giving&#xD;
           salbutamol and adrenaline for subcutaneous injection and equipment for intravenous&#xD;
           administration of antiasthmatic drugs will be easily available.(The treatment scheme&#xD;
           from the Norwegian Paediatric Association's acute therapy book will be applied.)&#xD;
           Evaluation of the test results Percentage fall in FEV1 and FEF50 will be applied as a&#xD;
           parameter of bronchial reactivity. More than 10% fall in FEV1 after cold air or more&#xD;
           than 10% rise in FEV1 after inhalation of Ventolin, is considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Printouts of the spirometry results will be saved. Patient registration sheet cold air&#xD;
      hyperventilation test (Printouts from spirometry to be attached).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be noted:&#xD;
&#xD;

      skin around the weal, near the weal edge. A transparent tape strip is to be pressed over the&#xD;
      circumscription and transferred over to the registration sheet. The weal size is to be&#xD;
      recorded by assessment of the average weal diameter. Weals with an average diameter &gt;3 mm&#xD;
      will be considered positive.&#xD;

    <description>Two air cleaners are installed in the patient's room, one in his bedroom, and one in the living room. The cleaners can be run at 5 different speeds: Speed 1 filtrates 60m3 of air per hour, speed 2 filtrates 90 m3 per hour, speed 3 filtrates 130 m3 per hour, speed 4 filtrates 240 m3 per hour, and speed 5 filtrates 380 m3 per hour. A timer-on period can be pre-set for every day of the week, but the cleaner can be run even in the timer-off period, at a speed pre-set and different from the timer-on period. Different timer-on off periods cannot be selected for different days, but the different days of the week can be pre-set to apply timer-on periods or not.</description>
