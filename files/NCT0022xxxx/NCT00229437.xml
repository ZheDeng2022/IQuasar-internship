  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polyneuropathy is a frequent complication of diabetes; it affects most individuals after&#xD;
      prolonged hyperglycemia, and diabetic neuropathy is very common in the developed world.&#xD;
      Chronic, insidious, distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy with autonomic impairment is the most&#xD;
      typical form of diabetic neuropathy. Less common, but more florid presentations include&#xD;
      autonomic symptoms or painful neuropathy. Although many patients have no or relatively few&#xD;
      symptoms, the chronic polyneuropathy and autonomic dysfunction predispose to neurotrophic&#xD;
      foot ulceration; consequently, diabetes is the leading cause of amputation today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic neuropathy is a dying-back polyneuropathy with distal degeneration of the longest&#xD;
      nerve fibers advancing in a centripetal direction. Multiple histopathological changes are&#xD;
      observed, but progressive fiber loss is the hallmark of diabetic polyneuropathy. Other&#xD;
      important features include endothelial cell basement membrane thickening, segmental&#xD;
      demyelination and remyelination, and axonal atrophy. Similar pathological changes are&#xD;
      observed in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The severity of neuropathy as indicated by the stage&#xD;
      of nerve fiber loss determines the clinical, electrophysiological, and quantitative sensory&#xD;
      threshold features of this disorder. The functional measures of electrophysiological and&#xD;
      quantitative sensory thresholds reflect the morphological changes and the clinical features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic polyneuropathy is etiologically related to prolonged hyperglycemia with multiple&#xD;
      consequences. Although strict glycemic control prevents neuropathy in type 1 patients if&#xD;
      maintained for many years, similar interventions in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus are&#xD;
      less successful. Type 2 patients may have neuropathy with considerable nerve fiber loss at&#xD;
      the time of diagnosis because of unsuspected hyperglycemia in preceding years. Reversal of&#xD;
      established neuropathy with strict glycemic control is not certain to occur, even if&#xD;
      maintained for many years. Co-morbid disease often interferes with strict management of type&#xD;
      2 diabetes. Even among those with type 1 diabetes, a minority of patients are successful in&#xD;
      maintaining prolonged euglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAK-128 is a novel synthetic compound being developed as a treatment for diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;
