  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of an individual motivational interview for&#xD;
      reducing alcohol and marijuana-related harm as well as alcohol and marijuana use in&#xD;
      incarcerated teens.&#xD;

      The objective of this research is to investigate ways to enhance motivation for treatment and&#xD;
      effectively reduce substance abuse among juvenile offenders. Motivational intervention (MI)&#xD;
      as preparation for residential treatment and for persons (including teens) with little&#xD;
      motivation to change has been effective in reducing substance abuse. Thus, MI designed for&#xD;
      delinquent youths who are required to attend substance abuse treatment may prove efficacious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposed randomized trial, a one-way design (MI + Standard Care [SC] v. Attention&#xD;
      Control [AC] + SC) will be used to determine whether MI enhances subsequent treatment&#xD;
      participation and reduces substance-related problems post discharge in substance using,&#xD;
      delinquent youths. Teens will also receive a booster session of MI or AC prior to discharge.&#xD;
      Primary outcome variables include alcohol and marijuana use, as well as related behaviors&#xD;
      (illegal activity, sex or injuries while drunk or high). It is hypothesized that in&#xD;
      comparison to teens receiving AC, youths receiving MI will participate more (by therapist and&#xD;
      teen ratings) in SC and will show the lowest levels of heavy substance use and related&#xD;
      problems after discharge. It is hypothesized that these effects will be mediated by stage of&#xD;
      change, drug effect expectancies and self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will extend previous research by evaluating the use of MI with substance abusing&#xD;
      teens in a correctional facility, and by expanding outcome measures to include alcohol and&#xD;
      marijuana-related risk behavior (such as injuries and illegal activity when drunk or high) in&#xD;
      this population. The development of effective interventions for substance using juvenile&#xD;
      offenders has the potential to reduce substance abuse and crime in this population.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Teens will be included if they meet any of the following criteria: 1) in the year prior to&#xD;
        incarceration they used marijuana regularly (at least monthly); 2) in the year prior to&#xD;
        incarceration they drank regularly (at least monthly) or binged (&gt;=5 for boys; &gt;=4 for&#xD;
        girls) over any two week period or less; 3) they used marijuana or drank in the 4 weeks&#xD;
        before the offense for which they were incarcerated; or 4) they used marijuana or drank in&#xD;
        the 4 weeks before they were incarcerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Those teens sentenced for less than 4 months or greater than 12 months will be excluded&#xD;
        from participation. We estimate that during year 1 we will exclude an additional 25% of&#xD;
        youths because they will have previously participated in the study, and at year 2 we&#xD;
        anticipate excluding an additional 49% of youths based on prior participation in the study.&#xD;
