  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to develop an improved gait analysis system for the real&#xD;
      time acquisition, calculation and interpretation of joint kinematic and kinetic information&#xD;
      using linked segment body model animation to display and visually depict deviations from&#xD;
      normal motion and joint function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred to the laboratory for clinical gait analysis are invited to participate in&#xD;
      the project. If interested, subjects are informed by a study investigator of the study goals,&#xD;
      procedures, risks and any benefits. A study investigator is responsible for obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent. Data from normal subjects are used to establish a normative database. Data&#xD;
      from other subjects contributes to the relevant databases of different disorders.&#xD;

      The overall purpose of this study is to develop an improved gait analysis system for the real&#xD;
      time acquisition, calculation and interpretation of joint kinematic and kinetic information&#xD;
      using linked segment body model animation to display and visually depict deviations from&#xD;
      normal motion and joint function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be studied using the standard protocol used for patient evaluations in the&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Medicine Human Motion Laboratory (GBO13 V AH). The standard protocol includes&#xD;
      the routine collection of kinematic data, kinetic data, foot pressure data and, in selected&#xD;
      cases, electromyography information. All collected raw data will ultimately be processed for&#xD;
      relevant biomechanical parameters and utilized to build either a Normative Database or&#xD;
      Non-Normative Database from which selected cases maybe extracted for teaching purposes, pilot&#xD;
      data or software development. The project is not designed to test specific hypothesis and as&#xD;
      such statistical analysis are not planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To acquire kinematics data, infrared reflective markers are taped over the joints of the&#xD;
      lower extremities, trunk, and arms. The reflective markers are used in conjunction with the&#xD;
      optoelectronic kinematic motion analysis system (Vicon) to allow acquisition of 3D motion&#xD;
      data for the limb and trunk segments of subjects. Joint kinetics are determine from ground&#xD;
      reaction forces measured by force plates embedded into the floor of the gait laboratory and&#xD;
      requiring no specific subject setup. Foot pressure data is obtained by Fscan. Mylar pressure&#xD;
      sensitive strips are placed in the shoe or residual limb. The strip is connected to a&#xD;
      datalogger and battery pack that will be put on a belt and worn over the shoulder or on the&#xD;
      waist. When electromyographic data is required, surface electrodes are placed over the motor&#xD;
      point regions of selected muscles of the lower extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After placement of markers and recording electrodes, the subjects will be instructed to walk&#xD;
      down the gait lab runway over the force platform. Simultaneous kinematic, EMG and force plate&#xD;
      data is collected. Between 3 and 10 strides of data are collected depending on the degree of&#xD;
      variability in the gait pattern. When assistive devices ( canes etc.) or orthotic devices are&#xD;
      used, the subject may be asked to ambulate with and without the gait aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the patients recruited for this study will have abnormalities in their gait, the most&#xD;
      significant risk is falling. Therefore, subjects will be screened to ensure that they can&#xD;
      ambulate independently over level ground. During testing, standby assistance will be present&#xD;
      to help subjects in cases of balance loss. The risks for normal subjects are negligible.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Since it is desirable to include the spectrum of gait disorders that are typically&#xD;
             encountered in clinical practice, inclusion/exclusion criterion for patients are&#xD;
             limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to walk independently with or without assistive devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal subjects must have no history of neuromuscular or musculoskeletal disorders&#xD;
             that interfere with ambulation.&#xD;
