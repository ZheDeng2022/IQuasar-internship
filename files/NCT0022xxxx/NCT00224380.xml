      The goal of this pilot study is to learn about how well older people with serious mental&#xD;
      illness (including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, major&#xD;
      depression) follow prescribed medication regimens, and to evaluate a manualized intervention&#xD;
      designed to enhance medication management skills and adherence, the Using Medications&#xD;
      Effectively program. The following four hypotheses will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medication adherence will be associated with several variables including insight,&#xD;
           memory, medication management skill, knowledge about medications, attitudes about&#xD;
           medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. People who receive the program will have better medication adherence compared to those&#xD;
           who do not receive the program as measured by pill counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. People who receive the program will develop better medication management skills compared&#xD;
           to those who do not receive the program.&#xD;

      Individuals who are already participating in a study of a combined skills training and health&#xD;
      care management intervention for older people with serious mental illness are invited to join&#xD;
      this study. Half of the individuals have already been randomly assigned to receive the&#xD;
      intervention and half have already been randomly assigned to continue receiving their usual&#xD;
      care. The people receiving the intervention receive the skills training module, Using&#xD;
      Medications Effectively, in 8 group sessions over 8 weeks. The module includes information&#xD;
      about common medications used for psychiatric and medical illnesses; training on using&#xD;
      devices to help take medications properly; and instruction on strategies to help incorporate&#xD;
      medication taking into a daily routine. A trained research assistant conducts pill counts and&#xD;
      interview sessions with all participants after they sign an informed consent form, 8 weeks&#xD;
      later, and 3 months after the second interview.&#xD;
