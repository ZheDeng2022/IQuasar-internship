  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether quetiapine or risperidone are effective in&#xD;
      treating mood symptoms, drug cravings and use in bipolar disorder with concurrent cocaine or&#xD;
      methamphetamine dependence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder may be associated with the highest rates of substance abuse of any&#xD;
      psychiatric illness. Studies suggest that substance abuse in persons with bipolar disorder&#xD;
      have lifetime prevalence rates as high as 60% with reports of cocaine abuse as high as 30%.&#xD;
      Comorbid substance abuse in persons with bipolar disorder is associated with increased&#xD;
      hospitalization, poorer psychiatric recovery and treatment response than in patients with&#xD;
      bipolar disorder alone. Thus, therapeutic agents that may enhance prognosis by improving&#xD;
      psychiatric outcomes, reducing stimulant cravings, and increasing treatment retention are of&#xD;
      considerable interest. In a previous study conducted in this lab, we found that conventional&#xD;
      neuroleptic agents were associated with an increase in depressive symptoms and a significant&#xD;
      increase in stimulant cravings. These results mirror preclinical animal data that show&#xD;
      conventional neuroleptics (i.e.haloperidol) with high dopamine receptor binding affinities&#xD;
      actually increase cocaine self-administration in rats and monkeys. These results are&#xD;
      clinically relevant as persons with bipolar disorder who abuse cocaine and other drugs often&#xD;
      receive higher doses of conventional neuroleptics than those without cocaine or other drug&#xD;
      abuse. In contrast to conventional neuroleptic therapy, atypical antipsychotics (i.e.&#xD;
      quetiapine, risperidone), decrease self-administration of cocaine. The receptor binding&#xD;
      profile of the atypical antipsychotics broadly vary although all agents in this drug class&#xD;
      are known as serotonin-dopamine antagonists. Quetiapine has 'moderate' dopamine binding,&#xD;
      while risperidone has 'high' dopamine receptor binding properties similar to conventional&#xD;
      neuroleptic agents. Thus, our hypothesis is that quetiapine may be a more efficacious agent&#xD;
      than risperidone in treating bipolar mood symptoms while attenuating drug cravings and use.&#xD;
