      RATIONALE: Stop-smoking plans suggested by physicians may help patients quit smoking.&#xD;
      Studying how physicians give stop-smoking treatment as family doctors may increase the chance&#xD;
      of smokers receiving such treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying physicians' practice patterns to see if&#xD;
      regular feedback to the physician increases the chance of adult smokers receiving&#xD;
      stop-smoking treatment.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop an automated coding system using existing electronic medical records (EMRs) to&#xD;
           assess adherence to national tobacco-cessation treatment guidelines by individual&#xD;
           physicians in the primary care setting at 4 health maintenance organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the validity of the automated coding system with that of coding performed by&#xD;
           medical record abstractors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effect of performance feedback on tobacco treatment practice patterns over&#xD;
           2 years among primary care physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide recommendations for recording tobacco-cessation treatment services in EMR&#xD;
           systems and evaluating adherence to treatment guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Produce a set of computer programs that can be easily adopted in diverse health care&#xD;
           settings for assessing adherence to the national tobacco-cessation treatment guidelines&#xD;
           using data from EMRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Physicians from each&#xD;
      participating center are sorted into pairs according to their rate of providing advice to&#xD;
      quit smoking to identified adult smokers and the number of identified adult smokers seen in&#xD;
      the 3-month baseline observation period. Each physician in the pair is then randomized to 1&#xD;
      of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (automated coding system feedback): Physicians receive reports from an automated&#xD;
           coding system regarding their performance in administering tobacco-cessation services in&#xD;
           each of the five A's (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange) to identified smokers in&#xD;
           comparison with their past performance and in comparison with their anonymous colleagues&#xD;
           once every 3 months. One year after randomization, these physicians are further&#xD;
           randomized, using the same paired-group approach, to either continue receiving automated&#xD;
           coding system feedback for 1 additional year OR to stop receiving feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians receive a survey at the end of 2-year period regarding the usefulness of each&#xD;
      aspect of the feedback reports and the feedback program in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (control): Physicians do not receive any information regarding their performance&#xD;
           in administering tobacco-cessation services in each of the five A's to identified&#xD;
           smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire about tobacco-cessation services in primary care is sent to patients of all&#xD;
      physicians within two weeks of each patient's primary care visit and then at the end of the&#xD;
      first year of providing feedback to physicians to compare patient report of tobacco-cessation&#xD;
      services with what is documented in the electronic medical record for that primary care&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 40 primary care physicians per participating center and 1,000&#xD;
      patients (250 per participating center) will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
