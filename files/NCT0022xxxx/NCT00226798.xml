  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunochemotherapy consisting of IL-2, INF-A, and VBL and 5FU is regarded as the treatment of&#xD;
      choice in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. During the period 1996-2000, we evaluated the&#xD;
      efficacy and toxicity of this immunochemotherapy, combined with an aggressive surgical&#xD;
      approach: nephrectomy before treatment and resection of residual disease. The 3-year survival&#xD;
      rate for the entire group and complete responder patients was 30% and 88%, respectively. The&#xD;
      side effects were usually moderate and consisted mainly of a flu-like syndrome, headache,&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting and depression. Most importantly, there was no drug-related death. Good&#xD;
      performance status, absence of bone metastases and prior nephrectomy were associated with&#xD;
      higher response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine is a novel fluoropyrimidine carbamate, orally administered and selectively&#xD;
      activated to Fluorouracil by a sequential triple-enzyme pathway in liver and tumor cells.&#xD;
      Capecitabine at dose of 2,500mg/m2/d divided equally into two daily doses for 14 days in&#xD;
      patients who failed to respond to &quot;standard&quot; immunotherapy achieved a 30% objective response.&#xD;
      Toxicity consisted of hand-foot syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate efficacy and toxicity of the combination of IL-2, INF-A, VBL and Capecitabine in&#xD;
      MRCC&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study, non-randomized in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
      The treatment will include: Proleukin (produced by Chiron and supplied by Megapharm Israel&#xD;
      Ltd), Roferon A and Xeloda (produced by Roche) and VBL. The treatment will be given in 8-week&#xD;
      courses with an interval of two weeks of rest in which the response (on D63) and toxicity&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      45 patients with MRCC will be entered into this study during a 18-month period. All patients&#xD;
      must meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria. All data of each participating patient,&#xD;
      including medical history, disease characteristics, laboratory and imaging tests, response&#xD;
      and toxicity to treatment will be entered into the specific form before, during, after each&#xD;
      treatment course and during follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for survival status and disease status every 6 months until last&#xD;
      visit or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proleukin S.C. 10X106 IU/m2 three times a week (Sun, Tue, Thu), weeks 1 - 4 Roferon A S.C. 6&#xD;
      X 106 IU/m2 once a week (Wed), weeks 1 - 4 Roferon A S.C. 3 X 106 IU/m2 three times a week,&#xD;
      weeks 5 - 8 Xeloda Oral 1,000 mg/m2 twice a day, weeks 5, 6 Vinblastine I.V. 4mg/m2, Day 1,&#xD;
      weeks 5 &amp;&#xD;
