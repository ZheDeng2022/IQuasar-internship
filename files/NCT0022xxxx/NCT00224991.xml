  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of systematic education&#xD;
      (osteoporosis school) on fall frequency, compliance and quality of life of a group of&#xD;
      patients more than fifty years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothetically, systematic information can increase compliance to the medical treatment,&#xD;
      decrease the frequency of falls and increase the quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In most randomized trials compliance to medical treatment in osteoporosis is very high, but&#xD;
      compliance tends to be considerably inferior in routine treatment compared to scientific&#xD;
      trials. This fact is caused by a narrow selection of motivated patients in the randomized&#xD;
      trials. Perhaps, the information given to the patients in scientific trials is more thorough&#xD;
      than information given in a routine setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no trials available that document that compliance to medical treatment of patients&#xD;
      with osteoporosis can be increased by intensive systematic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change of lifestyle is an important part in the treatment of these patients. The patients are&#xD;
      encouraged to eat more healthy food combined with an intake of calcium and vitamins,&#xD;
      reduction of alcohol and tobacco consumption if needed and prevention of fall incidence&#xD;
      through changes in the house.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of life is often reduced, partly due to chronic pain, altered social status,&#xD;
      physical handicap and partly due to the heavy knowledge of having a chronic decease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaption to the last-mentioned factors can possibly lead to a considerably better quality of&#xD;
      life in spite of the unchanged physical handicap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized trials on efficacy of systematic patient education has in general been positive in&#xD;
      other contexts. Young patients with diabetes offered coping skills training have therefore a&#xD;
      better metabolic control and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No similar randomized trials are available on the efficacy of a systematic education program&#xD;
      in osteoporosis.&#xD;
