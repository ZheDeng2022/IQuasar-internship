    <textblock>
      This is a research study looking at the effect of 5-Hydroxy Tryptophan (5-HTP) on urine&#xD;
      excretion of 5-Hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA). 5-HTP is a common over the counter product&#xD;
      that is sold in natural food stores and via the Internet. Increased levels of 5-HIAA in the&#xD;
      urine can be found in a specific type of cancer, called carcinoid tumor. This study will&#xD;
      examine the effect of oral 5-HTP intake on 5-HIAA excretion. Understanding this effect may&#xD;
      help to determine which tests should be done in a patient with increased 5-HIAA excretion&#xD;
      who's also taking 5-HTP.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      5-HTP is a common over the counter product that is sold in natural food stores and via the&#xD;
      Internet. It is claimed to improve sleep problems, depression, anxiety, compulsive disorders,&#xD;
      restless leg syndrome, migraines, fibromyalgia, and low pain threshold.Increased levels of&#xD;
      5-HIAA in the urine can be a of a specific type of cancer, called carcinoid tumor. Urinary&#xD;
      5-HIAA levels can also be increased by a number of food products and drugs. Oral 5-HTP is not&#xD;
      known as a cause of elevation of 5-HIAA in urine. However, recent information suggests that&#xD;
      5-HTP may cause an increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we examine the effect of oral 5-HTP intake (100 mg at bedtime for 10 days) on&#xD;
      5-HIAA excretion in the urine, following a prospective, double-blind placebo-controlled study&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding this effect may help to determine which tests should be done in a patient with&#xD;
      increased 5-HIAA excretion who's also taking 5-HTP.&#xD;
