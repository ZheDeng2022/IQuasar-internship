    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct semi-structured qualitative interviews to examine the&#xD;
      personal experiences of women living with fibromyalgia. The specific aims of this study are&#xD;
      to identify clinically relevant &quot;triggers&quot; of fibromyalgia symptoms and examine their impact&#xD;
      on activity limitations and participation restrictions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) may currently be the most common rheumatic diagnosis of rheumatologists&#xD;
      among their female patients, with 15-20% of all new rheumatology referrals meeting the 1990&#xD;
      American College of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnosis criteria for fibromyalgia. People with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia live through widespread musculoskeletal chronic pain, fatigue, psychological&#xD;
      distress, and exhibit diminished physical performance due in part to the cycle of pain that&#xD;
      adversely affect their activity participation and overall well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this prospective mixed methods study is to conduct semi-structured qualitative&#xD;
      interviews using ethnographic techniques to examine the personal experiences of women living&#xD;
      with fibromyalgia. The specific aims of this study are to identify clinically relevant&#xD;
      &quot;triggers&quot; of fibromyalgia symptoms and examine their impact on activity limitations and&#xD;
      participation restrictions.&#xD;
