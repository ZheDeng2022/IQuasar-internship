      This is a long-term evaluation follow-up study of neurocognitive performance and emotional&#xD;
      state in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection and a former (peg)interferon&#xD;
      alfa-2b-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      M.R. Kraus, G. Teuber, NN, NN (MPsych), M. Scheurlen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurocognitive and psychiatric changes induced by interferon alfa-2b therapy in patients&#xD;
           with chronic hepatitis C - are they fully reversible in long-term follow-up after the&#xD;
           end of antiviral treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 12 months after the end of antiviral treatment - are neurocognitive and&#xD;
           mood-related parameters even significantly improved as compared to pretreatment values?&#xD;
           Is this possibly only true of patients with successful virus eradication?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 12 months after the end of antiviral treatment, is there a significant&#xD;
           difference between patients with and without sustained virological response with respect&#xD;
           to neurocognitive performance, emotional state and quality of life?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the absence of clinically significant liver damage in patients with chronic hepatitis&#xD;
           C - does the mere presence of the hepatitis C virus have any significant influence on&#xD;
           neurocognitive or attentional performance?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the study data support an additional indication for antiviral therapy in chronic&#xD;
           hepatitis C? In the case of successful virus eradication, emotional state and - above&#xD;
           all - is neurocognitive performance significantly improved even in the absence of severe&#xD;
           liver damage?&#xD;

           to neurocognitive performance, emotional state and quality of life?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can the results of the current and previous studies be confirmed by alternative /&#xD;
           additional psychometric instruments in specified subsample? (Fatigue Impact Scale;&#xD;
           FIS-D, SF-36)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the absence of clinically significant liver damage in patients with chronic hepatitis&#xD;
           C - does the mere presence of the hepatitis C virus have any significant influence on&#xD;
           neurocognitive or attentional performance?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the study data support an additional indication for antiviral therapy in chronic&#xD;
           hepatitis C? In the case of successful virus eradication, is emotional state and - above&#xD;
           all - neurocognitive performance significantly improved even in the absence of severe&#xD;
           liver damage?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multifactorial analysis of test results: pre- vs. post-therapy; sustained virological&#xD;
           response vs. nonresponse/relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychometric evaluation instruments / psychometric questionnaires (HADS-D, SCL-90-R,&#xD;
           Subsample : SF-36, FIS-D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of neurocognitive performance by the Test battery of Attentional Performance&#xD;
           (TAP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation in a prospective, longitudinal study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned sample size / sample size considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  N = 150 patients (hepatitis C patients in a longitudinal study design: t1[before onset&#xD;
           of interferon therapy] … t5[at least 12 months after the end of antiviral treatment]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations / power considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Given: 2-factorial design (time course x SVR); type I error = 0.050; type II error =&#xD;
           0.20 (power = 0.80) - as usually assumed in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With respect to the independent factor SVR (&quot;sustained virological response&quot;, 2 factor&#xD;
           levels), optimum / optimal sample sizes range from 42 (large effect size d = 0.8) to 102&#xD;
           (medium effect size d = 0.5). Smaller effect sizes - according to previous work in this&#xD;
           field - do not appear to bear any clinical relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (Pairwise comparisons of dependent samples [e.g. pre- vs. post-therapy or pre-therapy&#xD;
           vs. long-term follow-up] require even smaller optimal sample sizes ranging from 16 to 43&#xD;
           for large or medium effect sizes.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with chronic hepatitis C infection and therapy with (peg)interferon alfa-2b.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with informed written consent (with respect) to a long-term follow-up of&#xD;
           psychiatric side effects and neurocognitive performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with baseline monitoring of neuropsychiatric symptoms and neurocognitive&#xD;
           performance.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with chronic hepatitis C and indication for interferon-based antiviral&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent to study participation, especially to long-term follow-up&#xD;
             monitoring of psychiatric and neurocognitive side effects of combination therapy with&#xD;
             (peg)interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of study participants: between 18 and 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients need to have documented antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and&#xD;
             circulating HCV-RNA as measured by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
             (Cobas Amplicor HCV Monitor™ test, Roche Diagnostics)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Insufficient knowledge of the German language or cognitive impairment (due to the&#xD;
             indispensable application of questionnaires and the TAP, test battery of attentional&#xD;
             performance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Further Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age under 18 years or over 65 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Coinfections such as hepatitis B virus or human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe internal diseases (e.g., cancer, ischemic heart disease, autoimmune disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major depressive disorder (according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of&#xD;
             Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition [DSM-IV] criteria), psychosis, active intravenous&#xD;
             drug use or alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        These additional exclusion criteria are important in order to avoid interfering or&#xD;
        confounding effects by other variables that are not linked to the hepatitis C infection.&#xD;
