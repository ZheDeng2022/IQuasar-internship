    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal of this multicenter, phase II study is to increase blood pressure until&#xD;
      either a neurologic response is seen or a target mean arterial pressure of 30% above baseline&#xD;
      is achieved. IV fluids, IV phenylephrine and/or IV norepinephrine are used to rapidly raise&#xD;
      mean arterial pressure in a controlled manner as serial assessments of neurologic function&#xD;
      are performed.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, pilot clinical trial. The primary outcome variables will be the&#xD;
      presence or absence of improvement in NIHSS during treatment with induced hypertension and&#xD;
      the number of adverse events. The secondary outcome variables will be final infarct size on&#xD;
      MRI at 1 month and Barthel Index and Modified Rankin Scale at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria and who are willing to&#xD;
      participate will receive intervention to induce hypertension, including intravenous saline,&#xD;
      phenylephrine (neosynephrine) or levophed, and possibly oral midodrine. Blood pressure will&#xD;
      be increased to a maximum mean arterial pressure (MAP) that is 30% above the baseline MAP as&#xD;
      measured in the emergency department. The acute phase of the study will last for 3-5 days&#xD;
      (for responders) and all patients will be followed up at 1 and 3 months post stroke onset.&#xD;
      All patients will undergo neurologic, cognitive, and physical examinations as well as serial&#xD;
      MRI studies with diffusion and perfusion-weighted imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypotheses will be measured using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale&#xD;
      (NIHSS) and MRI. Improvement following induced hypertension will be measured by comparing&#xD;
      NIHSS performed at multiple time points throughout the study. The ability to predict&#xD;
      diffusion-perfusion mismatch will be determined by comparing MRI #1 and MRI #2. NIHSS and MRI&#xD;
      will also be compared to determine if NIHSS correlates with reperfusion area on MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hypothesis of improved long-term outcome will be measured using the Barthel&#xD;
      Index, the modified Rankin Scale, and MRI/Flair at 1 and 3 months post stroke symptom onset.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with acute ischemic stroke in whom treatment can be initiated within 12 hours&#xD;
             of a clearly defined symptom onset. (If the patient awakens with a deficit, time of&#xD;
             onset is considered the time the patient was last seen functioning normally.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age older then 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable neurologic deficit other than isolated facial weakness, sensory loss or&#xD;
             ataxia. NIHSS must be &gt; 4 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Head CT showing no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass lesion which might&#xD;
             increase the risk of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of ischemic changes on EKG (i.e. &gt; than 1mm ST segment elevation or depression&#xD;
             in at least two contiguous leads, new T waves inversion in two leads).&#xD;
