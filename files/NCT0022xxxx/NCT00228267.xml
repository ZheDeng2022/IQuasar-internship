      Hypothesis A single subanesthetic dose of propofol will result in improved pain and quality&#xD;
      of life for the next 30 days in persons with chronic daily headache (CDH)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives To measure the effect of a single infusion of propofol at 40 mcg / kg /&#xD;
      minute over 60 mins on headache-related quality of life (measured by the Headache Disability&#xD;
      Index) and on headache severity (measured by the Headache Index) in subjects with chronic&#xD;
      daily headache over 30 days45-47&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic daily headache (CDH) is a common and extremely disabling pain syndrome with a recent&#xD;
      estimated point prevalence of 2.98% of the general population1 Other studies estimate a&#xD;
      prevalence of 4.1% and 4.7% with a higher prevalence in women of 9%.2,3 The condition is&#xD;
      disabling and is a major cause of loss of function and work capacity resulting in significant&#xD;
      personal and national economic loss4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic options for treating chronic headache disorders are legion and diverse and there&#xD;
      is a steady stream of publications advocating novel therapies. Pharmacological options that&#xD;
      have been advocated include: sodium valproate, olanzapine, tricyclic and Selective Serotonin&#xD;
      Reuptake Inhibitor antidepressants, tizanidine, butalbital, nefazodone, baclofen,&#xD;
      prochlorperazine, intravenous lignocaine, dihydroergotamine, opioids, monoamine oxidase&#xD;
      inhibitors, triptans, botulinum toxin, cryotherapy and analgesic withdrawal5-20 There is much&#xD;
      debate as to why headache treatments fail and it is proposed that the choice of an&#xD;
      inappropriate agent is a significant reason in some patients21&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of a small number of studies intravenous propofol has now been advocated for the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic daily headache22-24 It seems fair to conclude that the existing strife&#xD;
      to promote propofol as an effective intervention for treating CDH in the absence of a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial merely reflects the lack of a single good treatment option for&#xD;
      this condition. It is, furthermore, reasonable to speculate that the beneficial effect seen&#xD;
      with propofol is a placebo response. Krusz et al reports the effects of subanesthetic doses&#xD;
      of intravenous propofol on chronic migraine in a cohort of 77 subjects in an open-label&#xD;
      study22 Propofol was administered by intermittent boluses; the average dose used was 110mg.&#xD;
      It is reported that 63 out of 77 patients reported complete abolition of their headache with&#xD;
      an average time of 20 - 30 minutes of propofol treatment. The range of propofol doses used is&#xD;
      however not clearly stated and there was no assessment of the intervention beyond 24 hours.&#xD;
      In this study lidocaine was mixed with propofol to reduce the pain of injection but it could&#xD;
      not be said with any certainty that lidocaine itself has no effect on headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mendes et al retrospectively reports 21 independent treatments of propofol in 18 patients&#xD;
      suffering primary and secondary chronic daily headache over a 1 year period 23 Subanesthetic&#xD;
      doses of propofol were administered by intermittent intravenous boluses 20 - 30mg every 3 to&#xD;
      5 minutes (range 60 - 380 mg). 6 patients reported complete relief of pain with the&#xD;
      treatment, 1 patient had no pain relief; on average patients reported a 58.92% decrease in&#xD;
      pain using a 0 - 10 scale. It is reported that 8 patients' headache cycles were broken when&#xD;
      followed up several days later but no information is available on the longer term impact of&#xD;
      these interventions. In these two studies there appears to have been good tolerance of&#xD;
      propofol and no significant adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drummond - Lewis reports 2 hospitalized patients with refractory migraine who were treated&#xD;
      with anesthetic bolus doses of propofol (0.5 - 1mg / kg) with reported success 24. The&#xD;
      authors comment there is uncertainty as to the most effective dose of propofol for this&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propofol is a safe modern, non-barbiturate intravenous anesthetic induction agent that was&#xD;
      introduced into clinical anesthesia in 1977. It has established its place in practice because&#xD;
      of its many ideal characteristics; it causes rapid and smooth loss of consciousness and rapid&#xD;
      recovery, making it an ideal agent for day-case procedures25,26 There is extensive use of&#xD;
      propofol as an intravenous sedative for procedures such as endoscopy, electroconvulsive&#xD;
      therapy, cardioversion and for longer term sedation in the intensive care unit.27,28 Propofol&#xD;
      has useful antiemetic properties and is known to be anti-epileptic and antipruritic.29&#xD;
      Although propofol can cause pain on intravenous injection there are several strategies to&#xD;
      reduce this problem.30 There are reports of rare fatalities associated with high doses of&#xD;
      propofol and reports of pancreatitis after single doses.31,32&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propofol (2,6 di-isopropylphenol) is available as an emulsion of 1 % propofol in 10% soyabean&#xD;
      oil, 2% glycerol and 1.2% egg phosphatide. Doses up to 2.5mg / kg are used for induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia and doses up to 200ug / kg /min are used for sedation purposes.33 It remains&#xD;
      uncertain how propofol might exert its action in relieving headache. Propofol is known to&#xD;
      stimulate gamma - aminobutyric acid- A (GABA-A) receptors by enhancing channel opening34 It&#xD;
      has been shown that other GABA ergic drugs including sodium valproate, gabapentin and&#xD;
      topiramate have a place in the treatment of migraine and it is speculated that propofol might&#xD;
      be work in a similar way.35 Nonetheless, it is known that propofol has other important&#xD;
      pharmacological activity including N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonism, sympathetic&#xD;
      inhibition, stimulation of nitric oxide production, calcium channel inhibition and modulation&#xD;
      of prostaglandin E2 hyperalgesia.36-39 We propose that it is premature to speculate on the&#xD;
      action of propofol in headache without clear evidence of efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is ongoing discussion as to what is a good definition of chronic daily headache; this&#xD;
      is a term that is not defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders&#xD;
      (ICHD)40 This is a potential impediment to research. It has been proposed that chronic daily&#xD;
      headache can be subclassified into primary headache that includes transformed migraine (TM),&#xD;
      chronic tension-type headache (CTTH), hemicrania continua (HC) and new daily persistent&#xD;
      headache (NDPH)41 Secondary CDH has an identifiable underlying cause e.g. post traumatic,&#xD;
      cervical spine disorders, vascular disorders, chronic meningitis, idiopathic intracranial&#xD;
      hypertension, temporamandibular joint dysfunction and sinus disorders. Silberstein et al&#xD;
      highlighted that not all chronic daily headaches can be classified according to the ICHD;&#xD;
      however, in 1996 they managed to completely sub-classified a population of CDH sufferers into&#xD;
      those with transformed migraine (TM) 78%, chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) 15.3% and&#xD;
      &quot;other&quot; 6.7%.42 Silberstein defined chronic daily headache as headaches that last for more&#xD;
      than 4 hours a day for more than 15 days a month and this definition is used in their later&#xD;
      study of propofol and headache. This definition becomes perhaps less crucial when dealing&#xD;
      with a population of patients who suffer intractable continuous headache; this tends to be&#xD;
      the characteristic of patients who are already known to us at the University of Alberta&#xD;
      Hospital Pain Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance and importance Although it is reasonably argued that propofol sedation can be&#xD;
      administered safely by non-anesthetists, there is still the possibility of serious airway&#xD;
      complications and cardiorespiratory depression.43 The administration of propofol should not&#xD;
      be undertaken lightly and certainly not used for an indication that has not been subject to&#xD;
      rigorous trial. Previous studies of propofol and headache have only examined the short- term&#xD;
      impact of this intervention on pain scores. The study proposed here looks at the effect of&#xD;
      this treatment on pain and quality of life over a longer period - 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subanesthetic doses of propofol are found to be effective in reducing chronic daily&#xD;
      headache we become armed with a relatively safe non- narcotic intervention for this extremely&#xD;
      disabling disorder that could be provided at a variety of centres e.g., emergency rooms, pain&#xD;
      clinics, neurological facilities. In view of the reluctance by some emergency departments to&#xD;
      administer narcotics for chronic headache we speculate that emergency departments may be more&#xD;
      willing to provide this treatment than narcotics.44&#xD;
&#xD;

      of life for the next 30 days in persons with chronic daily headache (CDH)&#xD;

&#xD;
      Obtaining Consent Each subject will be given an information sheet describing the study&#xD;
      procedures, offered the opportunity to ask any questions and must sign that they have&#xD;
      understood the contents. A separate consent form will be signed by the participant. Any&#xD;
      questions will be dealt with by an investigator. The headache diary and all information to be&#xD;
      read by subjects will be designed to have a Flesch Kincaid reading age of less than or equal&#xD;
      to grade 8. Subjects will be free to withdraw from the trial at any stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-randomization - baseline data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data to include: age, gender, education level (years), and socioeconomic&#xD;
           status.48&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The features of the subject's headache will be recorded and the headache disorder will&#xD;
           be classified according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders.40 The&#xD;
           date of chronic headache onset will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A standard medical history will be recorded which will include details of current&#xD;
           medication, (specifically headache medication) and stage of menstrual cycle.49&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A physical examination will be performed. Pulse, non-invasive blood pressure,&#xD;
           respiratory rate, oxygen saturation from pulse oximetry, weight, height and temperature&#xD;
           will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will then complete the Headache Disability Inventory (HDI).45&#xD;
&#xD;
      Headache Diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Participants will then be instructed in the completion of the daily headache diary (this is&#xD;
      estimated to take 10 - 20 minutes). This diary will keep track of daily pain scores,&#xD;
      activity, headache medication use and visits to the emergency room. Headache severity is&#xD;
      recorded four times daily on an 11 point numerical rating scale (NRS) anchored at zero for no&#xD;
      pain and 10 for the worst imaginable pain. Participants will be asked to keep this diary for&#xD;
      7 days pre-randomization and for 30 days commencing the day after the treatment / infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding Subjects that still meet the inclusion criteria will proceed to&#xD;
      the treatment phase. Subjects will be assigned to either the propofol group or placebo group.&#xD;
      Sealed envelopes containing a randomized assignment to either propofol or placebo group will&#xD;
      be prepared by an individual unconnected with the study using a web-based random number&#xD;
      generator, and balanced to ensure equal allocation to each group. The propofol group will&#xD;
      receive propofol and a concurrent normal saline bolus. The placebo group will receive&#xD;
      intralipid and an identical concurrent normal saline bolus that contains low dose midazolam.&#xD;
      There is evidence that low dose midazolam (35 mcg / kg) is sufficient to produce adequate&#xD;
      sedation but no evidence to support the use of single dose midazolam as a treatment for CDH;&#xD;
      this makes midazolam a suitable choice as an active placebo.50 The use of an active placebo&#xD;
      is to minimize treatment recognition and bias by patient and investigator. Identical,&#xD;
      sequentially numbered syringes containing either propofol or intralipid will be prepared by&#xD;
      the hospital pharmacy and these will be appropriately coupled with identical numbered&#xD;
      minibags of saline containing either no drug or midazolam. Subjects will be randomized after&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria have been applied. Investigators will use these syringes /&#xD;
      minibags in numeric order. (The named contents of each syringe and minibag will be available&#xD;
      to the investigators in a second sealed envelope to be opened only in case of emergency&#xD;
      during the infusion). Subject data will be grouped by treatment allocation for analysis into&#xD;
      'Group A' and 'Group B', but the blind will not be fully broken until data analysis is&#xD;
      complete. The subject's daily pain diaries will be coded with the corresponding syringe code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infusion procedure On the day of participation the participant will be required to be fasted&#xD;
      from the previous midnight. The groups will receive the following treatments by electronic&#xD;
      infusor. The dose of propofol selected is comparable with that of the previous studies.22-24&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Propofol infusion 40 mcg / kg / minute over 60 minutes coupled with a&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  concurrent infusion of saline in a minibag to be delivered at 1ml / kg over first 10&#xD;
           mins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intralipid by infusion, calculated to be delivered at the same rate as if it were&#xD;
           propofol coupled with a&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  concurrent infusion of saline in a minibag containing 35mcg / ml of midazolam to be&#xD;
           delivered at 1ml / kg over the first 10 mins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To minimize pain on infusion (that may occur with either treatment) a large vein&#xD;
           (preferably antecubital) will be cannulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environment and Treatment The location of the study will be the treatment suite of the&#xD;
      University of Alberta Hospital Pain Centre. At least one anesthesiologist will be on site and&#xD;
      a post anesthesia recovery nurse. A peripheral intravenous cannula will be inserted into each&#xD;
      participant and intravenous normal saline 250 cc will be commenced to run over one hour in&#xD;
      conjunction with the treatments to flush the intravenous line. The patient will be placed on&#xD;
      a stretcher and made comfortable within the privacy of the suite. The lighting may be dimmed&#xD;
      but not to a level that would compromise monitoring and safety. Noise will be kept to a&#xD;
      minimum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and Safety Non-invasive blood pressure will be recorded pre-infusion and then at 5&#xD;
      minute intervals in conjunction with continuous pulse oximetry and respiratory rate. Oxygen&#xD;
      via nasal cannulae to keep oxygen saturations at or above 94% will be commenced. Basic and&#xD;
      advanced life support equipment will be available in the suite. An investigator, a trained&#xD;
      anesthesiologist with extensive experience in the administration of propofol and qualified in&#xD;
      resuscitation, will be in constant attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infusion will be discontinued if the patient develops signs of respiratory depression (&lt;&#xD;
      8 breaths / min), requires more than simple maneuvers to maintain the airway, develops&#xD;
      oversedation or delerium - where a patient is not easily roused by verbal command, sustained&#xD;
      hypotension, oxygen desaturation (below 94%), cardiac dysrhythmia or new medical symptoms. In&#xD;
      the event of the development of any adverse reaction a referral to the relevant specialist&#xD;
      service within the University of Alberta Hospital will be available. Patients will be&#xD;
      observed for a period of two hours post infusion and will be free to leave the suite when&#xD;
      their vital signs are stable, there are no concerns about level of consciousness and the&#xD;
      patient meets the University of Alberta Hospital criteria for discharge form day- surgery.&#xD;
      Full recovery from either infusion is anticipated to take less than two hours.51 The patient&#xD;
      must be escorted home and must be in the company of a carer for 24 hours. The patient will be&#xD;
      instructed not drive or operate heavy machinery for 24 hours post infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection. Baseline data will be recorded as above (including HDI and Headache Diary).&#xD;
      Pain, nausea and sedation scores will be recorded pre-infusion and then immediately post&#xD;
      infusion Each subject will be given a daily headache diary to keep for the 30 days following&#xD;
      the infusion. Subjects will be contacted by telephone at 24 and 72 hours post infusion and&#xD;
      weekly thereafter to remind them to complete their headache diaries. At 30 days post-infusion&#xD;
      the patients will complete a follow-up HDI by telephone or mail and their diaries collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures. The primary study outcome will be Headache Disability Index and the&#xD;
      Headache Index45-47 The baseline Headache Index is the mean of all 28 NRS pain scores (four&#xD;
      measures daily for seven days) and the post-treatment Headache Index is the mean of all 120&#xD;
      NRS pain scores (four measures daily for thirty days) and provides a valid summary measure of&#xD;
      overall headache activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of days with a headache of at least moderate severity defined as pain at least 5&#xD;
           on the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).52&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peak daily headache severity according to the NRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analgesic medication consumption will be measured in terms of morphine equivalents of&#xD;
           narcotic medication and number of tablets /doses of acetaminophen / non-steroidal&#xD;
           anti-inflammatory (NSAID) containing analgesics.53&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits to the Emergency Room for headache treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sedation and nausea scores in the treatment and placebo groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ability of participants in each of the groups to correctly guess their treatment&#xD;
           assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse effects related to the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean HDI measurements of 60 (+/- 20) for severe CDH (the population toward which our clinic&#xD;
      population is biased) would be expected. A clinically significant outcome would be a 29 point&#xD;
      reduction of HDI. A sample size of 20 subjects will give 80% power to detect this difference&#xD;
      with an alpha error rate of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Between group demographic factors that will be examined and controlled for will&#xD;
      include age, gender, education level (years), and socioeconomic status using independent&#xD;
      samples t-tests.48 All analyses will be conducted on an intention to treat basis. The average&#xD;
      absolute difference between the baseline and post-treatment HDI scores for the two infusion&#xD;
      groups will be compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA). We will compare the changes in&#xD;
      NRS scores between the two infusions groups over time using repeated measures ANOVA. Any&#xD;
      demographic factors found to be significantly different between groups will be included as&#xD;
      covariates in this analysis. All t-tests will use Bonferroni corrections to control for the&#xD;
      inflation of alpha.&#xD;
