  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Study is designed to determine whether treatment of CFRD with glargine insulin will&#xD;
      improve hemoglobin A1c, weight and muscle mass compared to the traditional regimen of bedtime&#xD;
      NPH insulin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients now survive beyond childhood, and CF related&#xD;
      diabetes (CFRD), due to insulin deficiency, is common. CFRD with fasting hyperglycemia occurs&#xD;
      in about 15% of adult CF patients. Standard insulin therapy has relied primarily on meal&#xD;
      coverage with rapid-acting insulin. Usually, basal insulin coverage is only provided&#xD;
      overnight, with modest doses of NPH insulin. The practice of providing minimal basal insulin&#xD;
      in CFRD is based on the fact that most of these patients, unless they are acutely ill, are&#xD;
      able to maintain relatively normal blood glucose levels during the day without it. In&#xD;
      addition, anecdotal experience has suggested that daytime NPH insulin or once to twice daily&#xD;
      ultralente insulin frequently lead to hypoglycemia in the CFRD patient. This practice, which&#xD;
      is based on practical clinical considerations, ignores the established relationship between&#xD;
      insulin deficiency and clinical deterioration in CFRD. BMI and pulmonary function deteriorate&#xD;
      much more rapidly in CF patients with diabetes than in CF patients with normal glucose&#xD;
      tolerance. Insulin deficiency leads to increased protein catabolism and fatty acid turnover.&#xD;
      The resulting loss of weight and lean body mass contributes to pulmonary disease and clinical&#xD;
      decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Basal insulin coverage with insulin glargine will improve hemoglobin A1c, weight, and&#xD;
           muscle mass in patients with CFRD with fasting hyperglycemia, compared to traditional&#xD;
           regimens with less basal insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Because of the peakless action of insulin glargine, this will be accomplished without&#xD;
           serious hypoglycemia.&#xD;

        1. Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. CFRD with fasting hyperglycemia (fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dl)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. . The diagnosis must be made at a time when the patient is in his/her basal&#xD;
                       state of health with no evidence of acute exacerbation in the preceding two&#xD;
                       months.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       a). Acute exacerbation is defined on page 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. . For patients with onset of diabetes in the preceding 6 months, the&#xD;
                       hemoglobin A1c must be stable for 3 months prior to study entrance within 5%&#xD;
                       (0.3% A1c increment).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Age ≥18, post-pubertal (done growing, since change in weight is a study endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Weight stable within 5% during the previous 3 months as measured in CF clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Willingness to attend all study visits and to engage in regular phone or e-mail&#xD;
                  contact with the study diabetes nurse&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Glucocorticoids can have a profound effect on weight, and thus we wish to&#xD;
                  minimize the occurrence of changing steroid doses during the study period.&#xD;
                  Patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy will be included in the protocol only&#xD;
                  if:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. . They have been on the same steroid dose for the preceding six months,&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. . There are no plans to change their steroid dose in the next eight months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Pregnancy or plans to become pregnant in the next eight months (because of the&#xD;
                  changes pregnancy would cause in our study endpoints),&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Unwillingness / inability to take multiple injections or to count carbohydrates,&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. A history of hypoglycemia unawareness (rare in CF),&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Plans to start any medication in the next 8 months that might affect weight, such&#xD;
                  as testosterone or Megace. Patients chronically taking these medications may be&#xD;
                  included if:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. . They have been on the same dose for the preceding six months&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. . There are no plans to change their dose in the next eight months&#xD;
