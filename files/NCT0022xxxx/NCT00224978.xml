      Chloroquine is a strong lysosomotropic and DNA-intercalating agent in experimental studies&#xD;
      (Neurosurgical Focus 14(2): February, 2003) and an open-label clinical trial the&#xD;
      investigators have demonstrated a strong adjuvant effect of chloroquine on the therapy of&#xD;
      malignant gliomas. This study will assess in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind&#xD;
      study the effects of chloroquine as adjuvant to the conventional therapy of Glioblastoma&#xD;
      Multiforme.&#xD;

      ANTECEDENTS: We have shown experimentally a significant adjuvant effect of quinacrine (an&#xD;
      analog of chloroquine) on cultured malignant glial cells and C6 implanted malignant glioma in&#xD;
      Wistar rats. When quinacrine was added to the standard therapy with carmustine cell&#xD;
      destruction and tumor diminution were higher than therapy with carmustine alone. Those&#xD;
      results were published in Neurosurgery 2001; 49:969-973 (at that time the manuscript was &quot;in&#xD;
      press&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present protocol started with a controlled, open-label clinical trial on 7 patients with&#xD;
      GBM and 7 contemporary control patients. All patients received the same treatment of&#xD;
      extensive surgery, carmustine therapy and irradiation at the standard doses as (as described&#xD;
      in our previous report Surgical Neurology 2000; 53:157-162). Once selected to enter the study&#xD;
      the patients were allocated alternatively in the chloroquine or the control group. Endpoint&#xD;
      evaluation was settled as surviving time after the beginning of therapy and the end point&#xD;
      follow-up was settled in survivors at two years after the beginning of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18 months after the beginning of the open trial it was observed that chloroquine treated&#xD;
      patients had a longer survival and no adverse effects to chloroquine therapy were seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At that time it was decided to start the second part of the protocol designed as a&#xD;
      double-blind placebo-controlled trial, ideal number of patients to be included was settled in&#xD;
      15 patients on each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the 1st. phase of the study by the open-label trial were published in&#xD;
      Neurosurgical Focus (http://www.aans.org/education/journal/neurosurgical/feb03/14-2-3.pdf) on&#xD;
      February, 2003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to corroborate the observations (at that time with a short follow-up) of the open&#xD;
      trial the double-blind, a placebo-controlled study was initiated in October, 2000; the dose&#xD;
      of chloroquine for the blind study was decided to be maintained in 150 mg daily for one year&#xD;
      after the beginning of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research Committee was notified on the beginning and the design of this trial: 6,000&#xD;
      tablets of chloroquine 150 mg (Aralen) and 6,000 identical tablets of placebo were&#xD;
      commercially purchased and sent to the laboratory of Dr. Roberto Medina at the National&#xD;
      Polytechnic Institute (selected as monitor). 30 sets of 375 tablets each were separated (15&#xD;
      contained chloroquine and 15 placebo) in identical flasks, the assignment of treatments was&#xD;
      randomly allocated; the codified treatments numbered 1-30 were then sent back to our&#xD;
      Institute. The code was sealed and kept by the monitor until the end of the study. Patients&#xD;
      included in the study were given the corresponding treatment in sequential order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for inclusion of patients in the trial is detailed in methods of the manuscript&#xD;
      submitted to the Annals of Internal Medicine Ms. # M0-1087 (pages 6-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and statistical analysis: End-point evaluation was settled as time of death after&#xD;
      the beginning of therapy. Follow-up for survivors was settled at 2 years after the beginning&#xD;
      of treatment. Survival distributions were analyzed as a Kaplan-Meier plot and compared by the&#xD;
      log rank test. Statistical analysis of demographic, clinical and imaging characteristics of&#xD;
      patients was made by the t test for independent values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After more than four years from the beginning of the study 26 patients from the originally&#xD;
      decided goal number of 30 patients had completed at least two years of follow-up. At this&#xD;
      time (January 2005) it was decided to open the code and proceed with the analysis of those&#xD;
      patients, which turned out to be 13 chloroquine-treated and 13 placebo-treated patients. The&#xD;
      last 4 patients (who were not included in the analysis) are currently under treatment but&#xD;
      their follow-up will end next year (2 patients are received chloroquine and the other 2&#xD;
      placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No patient initially selected refuse to enter the study, nor any patient included was lost at&#xD;
      follow-up. All 26 patients included in the study have been followed until the time of death&#xD;
      or up to July 2005 in survivors.&#xD;
