      The Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) Surgical Treatment of Ischemic Heart Failure&#xD;
      (STICH) ancillary study will define the mechanism(s) of functional mitral regurgitation (MR)&#xD;
      by TEE in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, and the impact of therapy (medical, coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass grafting [CABG], or CABG plus surgical ventricular restoration [SVR]) on&#xD;
      mechanism and severity of MR. Severity of the effect of functional MR on clinical outcomes&#xD;
      will also be examined. The TEE STICH study will address four specific aims that will focus on&#xD;
      defining the following: 1) the mechanism(s) of functional MR in ischemic cardiomyopathy; 2)&#xD;
      the effect of therapy on the mechanism and severity of functional MR; 3) myocardial viability&#xD;
      on functional MR and its response to treatment; and 4) the effect of MR on prognosis in&#xD;
      ischemic cardiomyopathy.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional MR is a common complication of ischemic heart disease. Two large studies have&#xD;
      confirmed an adverse effect of functional MR on survival after a heart attack. However,&#xD;
      studies in heart failure (HF) are small and mainly limited to patients with non-ischemic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. Recent animal studies have challenged the traditional concept that functional&#xD;
      MR is a consequence of mitral annular dilation, instead suggesting that functional MR is due&#xD;
      to leaflet tethering by outward expansion of the left ventricular wall (LV remodeling). This&#xD;
      has critical implications regarding the correct surgical approach to correcting functional&#xD;
      MR. To date, no large prospective study has examined the mechanism(s) of functional MR in&#xD;
      ischemic cardiomyopathy, nor has the interaction between mechanism and prognosis been&#xD;
      explored. This is a crucial knowledge gap because: 1) 70% of HF cases are caused by ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease; and 2) functional MR occurs in around 60% of patients with ischemic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. This study aims to fill these gaps by defining the mechanism(s) of functional&#xD;
      MR by TEE in a large clinical trial of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy participating in&#xD;
      the STICH study. The STICH study will address the following two key hypotheses of therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy in the management of patients with symptomatic HF, LV dysfunction, and coronary&#xD;
      artery disease (CAD) amenable to CABG: 1) surgical coronary revascularization, in addition to&#xD;
      aggressive medical HF management, will have long-term mortality, morbidity, quality of life,&#xD;
      or cost benefits beyond aggressive medical management alone; and 2) early surgical&#xD;
      ventricular shape restoration (SVR) in combination with CABG will improve outcome compared to&#xD;
      coronary revascularization alone and medical therapy alone. The study will also address the&#xD;
      role of LV size and function, including myocardial viability as a predictor of subsequent&#xD;
      events over 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The STICH study affords a unique opportunity to specifically evaluate the mechanism and&#xD;
      prognosis of functional MR in a large group of patients with HF due to ischemic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. The study design of STICH allows exploring the interactions between the&#xD;
      mechanism of functional MR, therapy, and prognosis. For example, it is not known whether all&#xD;
      patients with functional MR have an adverse prognosis or whether their prognosis is related&#xD;
      to specific mechanisms or severity. In patients undergoing CABG, it is not known which&#xD;
      patients with functional MR will require valve repair or which ones will do well without it.&#xD;
      It is also not known whether SVR reduces MR severity more than medical therapy and by what&#xD;
      mechanism. It is possible that improvement in functional MR is a consequence of reversed LV&#xD;
      remodeling, which is known to be related to myocardial viability, independent of specific&#xD;
      therapy. These important questions are addressed by the TEE STICH study, an ancillary study&#xD;
      to the STICH study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following four specific aims will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: This study will define the mechanism of functional MR in ischemic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in measurements of the mitral valve&#xD;
      apparatus known to be associated with functional MR in ischemic cardiomyopathy among patients&#xD;
      with different degrees of functional MR. To test this hypothesis, this study will compare&#xD;
      measurements of annulus size and leaflet tethering in three groups of patients, those without&#xD;
      MR, those with mild MR (effective regurgitant orifice area [EROA] less than 0.2 cm²), and&#xD;
      those with at least moderate MR (EROA less than 0.2 cm²). The six specific measurements of MR&#xD;
      mechanism include the following: 1) diastolic mitral annulus area; 2) percent of systolic&#xD;
      annular contraction; 3) leaflet tenting area; 4) papillary muscle tethering distance; 5)&#xD;
      papillary muscle separation distance; and 6) the primary chordal separation angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: This study will define the effect of therapy on mechanism and severity of&#xD;
      functional MR. Null Hypothesis: There will be no difference in measurements of the mechanism&#xD;
      and severity of moderate functional MR before and after treatment in the three treatment&#xD;
      groups (medicine, CABG, and CABG plus SVR). To test this hypothesis, this study will compare&#xD;
      the change in measurements of MR mechanism (see above list) and severity (EROA and volume of&#xD;
      the chest wall [VCW]) before and at a 2-year follow-up in the three treatment groups. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint for this analysis will be long-term survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: This study will evaluate the effect of functional MR on prognosis. Null&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The presence and severity of functional MR does not predict the following: 1)&#xD;
      long-term survival; and 2) the combined endpoint of death, cardiac transplantation, automatic&#xD;
      implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) countershock, hospitalization due to heart&#xD;
      failure, or subsequent mitral valve repair or replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: This study will evaluate the effect of myocardial viability on mechanism of&#xD;
      functional MR. Null Hypothesis: The mechanism of moderate MR will be no different in patients&#xD;
      with or without myocardial viability by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)&#xD;
      imaging. All patients who have undergone SPECT imaging done as part of the parent study will&#xD;
      be studied. The grouping variables will be the presence or absence of myocardial viability as&#xD;
      determined by the SPECT core lab.&#xD;
