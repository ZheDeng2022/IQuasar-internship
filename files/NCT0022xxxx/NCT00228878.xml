      The purpose of this study is to determine if restoring normal metabolic function in patients&#xD;
      with either type I or type II diabetes can improve the impact of the consequences of diabetic&#xD;
      complications on the overall quality of life of diabetic patients. Patients are treated once&#xD;
      a week with pulsatile intravenous insulin therapy mimicking normal insulin secretion. A 44&#xD;
      item questionnaire is completed prior to the start of the treatment and quarterly thereafter&#xD;
      with detailed analysis performed to measure progress and outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that the glucose metabolic pathway (glycolysis) is the primary fuel generator in&#xD;
      the brain and nerve tissue, the heart and vascular tissue, the eye, the kidney and the liver&#xD;
      Deficient metabolic states such as seen in the glucose metabolism of diabetics can lead to&#xD;
      sequelae. These damaging effects are exacerbated by altered cellular metabolites,&#xD;
      specifically the increase in catabolic and decrease in anabolic factors. It has been shown&#xD;
      over the past twenty years that normalization of metabolism in diabetic patients can be&#xD;
      accomplished by mimicking the normal endogenous insulin pattern (ie., in pulses). Pulsatile&#xD;
      insulin infusion has been demonstrated to reverse the diabetic metabolic state from primary&#xD;
      fat utilization to carbohydrate utilization. This has been correlated with a stabilization of&#xD;
      kidney function in patients with overt diabetic nephropathy, stabilization of blood glucoses,&#xD;
      stabilization of blood pressure patterns, and reversal of hypoglycemic unawareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Diabetes Impact Measurement Scale was originally developed to assess quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with types 1 and 2 Diabetes Mellitus. This study measures whether the reversal of&#xD;
      abnormal metabolism in patients with diabetes is correlated with an improvement in their&#xD;
      quality of life.The respiratory quotient (RQ) is a measurement of CO2 exhaled and O2 inhaled&#xD;
      and is proportionate to the fuel sources being used by the body, primarily the liver over&#xD;
      short periods of time. The higher the RQ, the more glucose and less alternative fuel sources&#xD;
      are being utilized. Following the RQ change helps determine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      physiological insulin administration in increasing anabolic functions in diabetic&#xD;
      individuals. By improving the body's glucose metabolism and thereby causing beneficial&#xD;
      effects of anabolic factors, the possibility of serious complications can be decreased. In&#xD;
      addition the use of oral carbohydrate at the same time along with the physiologic insulin&#xD;
      administration stimulates the appropriate gut hormones which augment this effect, a response&#xD;
      which cannot be duplicated with intravenous glucose. The purpose of our studies is to&#xD;
      determine whether the physiologic administration of insulin along with the augmenting effect&#xD;
      of oral carbohydrates will normalize metabolism in diabetic patients and improve their&#xD;
      quality of life indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RQ is determined by the use of a metabolic cart. Individuals breathe into a mask for 3-5&#xD;
      minutes after a rest period of 30 or more minutes. The ratio of exhaled volume of CO2 to the&#xD;
      inhaled volume of O2 is determined as the RQ. The physiologic range is 0.7 to1.3. Individuals&#xD;
      using fat as a primary fuel have a ratio of 0.7, protein or mixed fuels is 0.8-0.9 and&#xD;
      carbohydrate is 0.9-1.0. Those taking excessive calories will have RQ's higher than 1.05. The&#xD;
      RQ can be followed serially and this is done before and after each pulsatile IV insulin&#xD;
      treatment, during the 3 successive sessions on a single treatment day. The amount of&#xD;
      intravenous insulin and oral glucose given is determined by the RQ changes during the&#xD;
      previous session.pulsatile IV insulin therapy encourages the glucose metabolism in diabetics&#xD;
      to normalize in multiple organs, especially muscle, retina, liver, kidney and nerve endings.&#xD;
      The process fundamentally requires the administration of high dose insulin pulses similar to&#xD;
      those found in non diabetic humans by their pancreas into the surrounding portal circulation.&#xD;
      Oral carbohydrates are given simultaneously to augment the process and prevent hypoglycemia.&#xD;
      The process is monitored by frequent glucose levels and respiratory quotients (RQ). RQ is&#xD;
      measured by a metabolic cart which determines the ratio VCO2/ VO2. This ratio is specific for&#xD;
      the fuel used at any one time by the body. The glucose levels are monitored to keep glucose&#xD;
      levels appropriate and the RQ determines the need to readjust the infusion protocol in each&#xD;
      patient for subsequent insulin infusion sessions.Patient is evaluated post session and&#xD;
      discharged when stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequent monitoring of RQ is necessary as these levels change rapidly, depending on the fuel&#xD;
      being utilized by the body. Pulsatile IV insulin therapy shifts metabolism from primarily&#xD;
      fatty acid metabolism to primarily glucose metabolism. This shift is reflected by the&#xD;
      increase in respiratory quotient. However during rest periods the RQ may fall back to lower&#xD;
      levels. Therefore RQ's are done at the beginning and at the end of each insulin infusion&#xD;
      session of 1 hour in order to appropriately monitor and adjust insulin and carbohydrate loads&#xD;
      to reach optimal activation in each session.&#xD;
