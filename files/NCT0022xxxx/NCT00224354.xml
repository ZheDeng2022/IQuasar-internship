  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the laboratory, we will put a special gene into cancer cells that have been taken from the&#xD;
      subject. This gene will make the cells produce interleukin 2 (IL-2), which may help the&#xD;
      patient's immune system kill cancer cells. Also, we will use CD40 ligand (CD40L) with the&#xD;
      IL-2. Studies of cancers in animals and in cancer cells that are grown in laboratories have&#xD;
      suggested adding the CD40L helps the IL-2 work better. Some of these new cells will then be&#xD;
      given back to the subject as a vaccine shot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that a part of the subject's immune system (cells called T-reg cells) might try to&#xD;
      kill off these special cells. If the T-reg cells do that, the vaccine would not work as well&#xD;
      or last as long. To try to avoid this, before the special cells are put back into the&#xD;
      subject's body, we will give them an intravenous (IV) dose of IL-2 immunotoxin (called&#xD;
      denileuk diftitox or ONTAK). ONTAK should get rid of some of the T-reg cells in the subject's&#xD;
      body which should help the special cells work better and longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to learn the safety and cancer-fighting effects of using IL-2&#xD;
      with the vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial to assess the safety of depleting regulatory T (Treg) cells using 1-3&#xD;
      doses of an interleukin-2 immunotoxin directed to the CD25 antigen (denileukin diftitox,&#xD;
      ONTAK) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients, followed by six subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      injections of autologous leukemic cells modified ex vivo to secrete human interleukin-2&#xD;
      (hIL-2) and to express human CD40 ligand (hCD40L). Patients will receive a fixed dose (2 x&#xD;
      10e7) of IL-2 secreting B-cells together with 2 x 10e7 hCD40L expressing B-cells,&#xD;
      representing a safe, well tolerated and immunogenic dose in our previous dose escalation&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients will be treated with six injections. Any patient whose disease&#xD;
      regresses after the administration of 6 injections may be offered further injections of tumor&#xD;
      vaccine if sufficient vaccine is available. There will be no use of placebo or control&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
