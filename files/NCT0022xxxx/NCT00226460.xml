        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has idiopathic Parkinson's disease. a) with bradykinesia and either rest&#xD;
             tremor or rigidity, b) history of asymmetry of Parkinson's disease signs, c) history&#xD;
             of progression of Parkinson's disease signs, d) no other suspected cause of&#xD;
             Parkinson's disease, e) the patient is L-DOPA responsive (based on the Treating&#xD;
             Investigator's clinical judgment, the patient demonstrates a predictable ON response&#xD;
             after the first daily dose of L-DOPA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has had Parkinson's disease for at least 5 years (from onset of symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient demonstrates unequivocal Clinical Off periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has been on a stable regimen of L-DOPA and any other anti-Parkinsonian&#xD;
             medications for at least one month prior to start of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient demonstrates L-DOPA-or dopamine agonist-induced dyskinesias.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient's age is 40-70.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is currently under &quot;optimal medical therapy&quot;, as determined by the&#xD;
             Treating Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has had a UPDRS assessment as per a modified CAPIT protocol at screening&#xD;
             and the total UPDRS score in the defined OFF state was at least 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the patient is a woman of child bearing potential, she must not be nursing and an&#xD;
             adequate form of birth control must be used for the duration of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a normal chest x-ray and does not exhibit any signs or symptoms of&#xD;
             coronary artery disease (on exam or on EKG) dysrhythmia (in order for surgery to be&#xD;
             safely performed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is able to understand and is willing to comply with study requirements;&#xD;
             this may include travel within or outside the United States for neuroimaging testing&#xD;
             and surgery. It will be necessary for a companion to travel with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient understands that the Sponsor recommends that all patients in this trial&#xD;
             avoid pregnancy and minimize the sharing of secretions with sexual partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is willing to participate in the life-long xenotransplantation registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a likely alternative diagnosis for Parkinsonism based on history,&#xD;
             physical examination or laboratory testing. Atypical Parkinsonian variants (such as&#xD;
             Shy-Drager, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and&#xD;
             striatonigral degeneration) and secondary Parkinsonism (e.g., secondary to trauma or&#xD;
             metabolic abnormalities; history of encephalitis, oculogyric crises or use of&#xD;
             dopaminergic antagonists/depleting drugs) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has had a prior cranial neurosurgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has MRI or CT evidence of abnormalities which could lead to Parkinsonism&#xD;
             or make the patient an unsuitable neurosurgical candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a history of intracranial pathology (e.g., tumor, vascular&#xD;
             malformation) that might make the patient an unsuitable neurosurgical candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a pre-existing medical condition that may interfere with the&#xD;
             evaluation of the safety and/or effectiveness of the study agent or prevent study&#xD;
             completion (e.g.:, symptomatic cardiac disease, impaired renal function or seizure&#xD;
             disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a known sensitivity to products of porcine origin (e.g. pork).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a known steroid or cyclosporine intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has significant cognitive impairment; specifically, a MMSE score of &lt; 25,&#xD;
             and, in the investigators judgment, the patient is demented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a Hamilton Depression score of &gt; 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has hallucinations, delusions, psychosis or chronic psychiatric illness,&#xD;
             with the exception of mild, L-DOPA induced hallucinations, or those caused by&#xD;
             concomitant medications, which resolve with dose adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a positive response to a tuberculin skin test (with the exception of&#xD;
             patients who have either been inoculated for TB, or treated for the disease in the&#xD;
             past).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has been treated during the 6 months prior to Screening with dopaminergic&#xD;
             antagonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (Females only) The patient is nursing or pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has taken tolcapone within 6 weeks of the Screening UPDRS exam.&#xD;
