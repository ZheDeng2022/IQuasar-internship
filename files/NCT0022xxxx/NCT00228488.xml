  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two different patient populations will be targeted for this study. The first population (SP1)&#xD;
      will include patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancers, excluding salivary&#xD;
      gland carcinomas. The second population (SP2) will include treatment-naïve patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced squamous cell head and neck cancer (SCHNC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SP1 will be treated with palliative intent and the patients can be treatment-naïve or have&#xD;
      received prior chemotherapy. Study treatment will consist of Iressa (gefitinib) alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SP2 will be treated with radical intent. The patients must be treatment-naïve and study&#xD;
      treatment will consist of induction Iressa for 3 weeks followed by a combination of Iressa&#xD;
      plus cisplatin and concurrent irradiation.&#xD;
