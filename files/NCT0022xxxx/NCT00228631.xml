      In this study, patient blood samples from NMA transplants will be provided by Pittsburgh, and&#xD;
      samples from myeloablative transplants will be provided by Atlanta (comparative controls).&#xD;
      Samples would be obtained pre- and post-BMT from the recipient at a total of 7 timepoints,&#xD;
      and from the donor at one timepoint.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a serious inherited disorder of red blood cells that shortens&#xD;
      life and causes life-long problems. One of the most common genetic diseases in America, SCD&#xD;
      affects 1 of every 375 African-American live births, and can be identified by routine newborn&#xD;
      screening. SCD manifests with vaso-occlusive events, the most common of which is the &quot;sickle&#xD;
      pain crisis,&quot; which causes severe and unrelenting pain, typically in the back, chest, or long&#xD;
      bones. Other types of vaso-occlusive events involve the spleen, brain (stoke), retina, bones,&#xD;
      kidney and lungs. Patients are at increased risk for death due to bacterial infections,&#xD;
      damage to vital organs, or aplastic crisis (failure to produce any red cells), and often&#xD;
      suffer chronic organ damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with frequent and severe complications in early childhood are typically felt to be&#xD;
      at highest risk for continued debilitating problems and early death. These severely affected&#xD;
      children have been the subject of efforts to cure SCD through bone marrow transplantation&#xD;
      (BMT) from a healthy donor. BMT is curative for SCD because it provides a source of normal&#xD;
      hemoglobin production. BMT is performed by giving the patient high doses of chemotherapy,&#xD;
      then infusing bone marrow from a healthy donor into a large vein in the recipient, followed&#xD;
      by an intensive period of supportive care and immune suppression. Over 200 patients with SCD&#xD;
      have been transplanted world-wide, primarily from sibling donors who are HLA (tissue or&#xD;
      transplantation type) matched. Of those transplanted in a North American cooperative study,&#xD;
      about 95% of these patients survived the transplant, and about 85% are free of sickle cell&#xD;
      disease. The Atlanta program was the largest contributor to this study. Through 2004, Atlanta&#xD;
      has transplanted 18 children with SCD from matched siblings; all are free of sickle cell&#xD;
      disease and none have died.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because conventional (myeloablative) BMT carries significant risks of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      ant thus limits its use, researchers have recently been investigating less risky methods of&#xD;
      BMT for SCD, called reduced intensity or non-myeloablative (NMA) transplant. Dr. Catherine Wu&#xD;
      of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Dr. Laksmannan Krishnamurti of the Children's&#xD;
      Hospital of Pittsburgh are both performing NMA transplant for adults (Wu) and children&#xD;
      (Krishnamurti) with severe SCD. In Atlanta (Haight), patients continue to be offered&#xD;
      transplant using the conventional myeloablative approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Important questions remain about the functional and long-term status of transplanted SCD&#xD;
      patients in a variety of areas; this study will focus upon immune function. Because little is&#xD;
      know about the functional immune status of patients after non-myeloablative transplants, and&#xD;
      certainly not those who undergo transplantation for the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia,&#xD;
      patient blood samples will be analyzed for extent of immune reconstitution following&#xD;
      transplant through immunophenotyping of various immune cell subsets, molecular analysis of&#xD;
      reconstitution of T cell neogenesis (TREC analysis) and T cell receptor complexity (TCR Vbeta&#xD;
      spectratyping).&#xD;
