      Hypothesis - This study is designed to evaluate the results of using the Orthotrac Pneumatic&#xD;
      Vest versus an EZ form brace in patients with radiating leg pain from disc bulge / protrusion&#xD;
      / herniation. Specifically, our hypothesis is that patients given the Orthotrac Pneumatic&#xD;
      Vest (OPV) will have greater pain relief and increased self-reported functionality and fewer&#xD;
      progressions to surgery than those using the EZ form brace.&#xD;

      Patient Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's who present with low back and unilateral leg pain are potential candidates for&#xD;
      recruitment in this study. For purposes of the research, leg pain will constitute symptoms&#xD;
      extending down the leg beyond the knee. The contralateral side may have pain in the buttock&#xD;
      and down the posterior thigh but not below the knee. The criteria are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion / Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age 21 - 55&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preferred no prior surgery or no spine surgery in previous 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No neurological deficit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VAS &gt; 4.0&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms unresolved after 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimal antalgic lean of the trunk when initially weight bearing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain aggravated by weight bearing standing / walking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced leg pain on recumbency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI Confirmed disc bulge / protrusion / herniation (HNP) site consistent with symptoms -&#xD;
           preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 150 subjects, 75 per group, are being sought for this study. The best time to&#xD;
      capture the list of potential patients is at the inception of their diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
      The TBI practice is equipped with electronic scheduling, medical record and billing systems.&#xD;
      This poses significant advantages for patient recruitment to this project. On a daily basis,&#xD;
      the project coordinator/patient recruiters (PC/PR) can access daily schedules for new&#xD;
      patients entering the system for all 17 TBI physicians. This can be cross-correlated later&#xD;
      with exiting diagnosis of leg pain to ensure maximum capture of potential candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon obtaining permission to solicit the patient, the project will be explained and signed&#xD;
      informed consent obtained from patients who agree to participate. Non-participants will be&#xD;
      solicited for signature to permit us to monitor their progress during the course of their&#xD;
      treatment by administering the outcome questionnaires. Those whom do not sign consent to&#xD;
      participate or consent to be monitored will continue with their care and be purged from the&#xD;
      project records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Randomization and Blinding of Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the inception of the project and prior to beginning patient recruitment, assignments for&#xD;
      180 participants will be blocked randomized to obtain equal numbers in each treatment group;&#xD;
      Orthotrac (OPV) and EZ form brace (EZF). An additional 30 randomizations over the study&#xD;
      sample size of 150 will be completed to allow for 10% drop-out rate in each group in case of&#xD;
      patient voluntary withdrawal from participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random assignments will be sealed in sequentially numbered envelopes and will be kept under&#xD;
      lock in the office of the surgeon co-investigator . Upon patient signing of informed consent&#xD;
      to participate, the project coordinator (PC / PR) will obtain the next consecutive sealed&#xD;
      randomization envelope, assign the patient to the random group and deliver group assignment&#xD;
      identification to the principal investigator (PI) for warehousing of recruitment data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will then be scheduled with the PC who will obtain appropriate demographic&#xD;
      information and administer the outcome measures. Measures will be obtained at the same time&#xD;
      as recruitment when ever possible. Results from the outcome measures will be sealed in an&#xD;
      envelope, unscored, and delivered to the surgeon co-investigator for warehousing and later&#xD;
      analysis. In order to maintain blinding of the PC / PR, she will measure the patient and fit&#xD;
      him/her for both devices on the initial visit. The PI will have the proper device ordered&#xD;
      according to randomization and will check fitting on its delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Maneuver&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who qualify for this study will have persistent leg pain attributed to lumbar HNP&#xD;
      and be under typical medical / chiropractic care. At the stage of their entry into this&#xD;
      project, the question of surgical intervention may be a realistic alternative. The&#xD;
      experimental maneuver will contrast the ability of the OPV vs the EZF to improve symptoms and&#xD;
      function. Patients assigned to the OPV group will be measured by the PC / PR and fit for the&#xD;
      device. They will receive instructions in its use QID for a minimum of 30 minutes. Patients&#xD;
      assigned to the EZF orthotic will be fit for the device and instructed to wear it during&#xD;
      weight bearing hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Assessment and Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the inception of the patient into the project, either as a participant or non-participant,&#xD;
      a baseline assessment will be performed by the PC. Reassessment will be completed at 6, 12,&#xD;
      26 and 52 weeks. The PC will monitor patient status and compliance with typical treatment on&#xD;
      a weekly basis through the computerized scheduling and medical record. Telephone contact will&#xD;
      be made on a biweekly basis to evaluate self-reported compliance with wear and determine any&#xD;
      intervening health care service utilization or medication use using standardized phone&#xD;
      interview methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment measures will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inception baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Demographic b. Diagnostic c. Pre-episode work status d. Rang of Motion (ROM) i.&#xD;
           Flexion / Extension ii. Straight leg raise e. Pain evaluation i. Pain levels (Visual&#xD;
           analogue scale) ii. Quantitative pain drawing iii. Medication use f. Functional&#xD;
           evaluation i. Oswestry Back Disability index ii. SF - 36&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Follow-up evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Work status&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Rang of Motion (ROM)&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Flexion / Extension ii. Straight leg raise c. Pain evaluation i. Pain levels (Visual&#xD;
           analogue scale) ii. Quantitative pain drawing iii. Medication use d. Functional&#xD;
           evaluation i. Oswestry Back Disability index ii. SF - 36&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bi-weekly telephone contacts&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Work status&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Medication use&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Wear compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Other health care utilization&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. TBI treatment sessions (PT, DC, MD, injections, surgical scheduling)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome for this project will be quantitative pain levels, using the VAS. Monitoring&#xD;
      of medication use is expected to support this outcome. Further primary outcome centering on&#xD;
      functionality scores will focus on the Oswestry and SF 36. The SF36 results can be expected&#xD;
      to be a useful adjunct in the assessment of patients with low back pain when combined with&#xD;
      disease-specific questionnaires (3). All other measures will be used descriptively and as&#xD;
      explanatory variables.&#xD;
