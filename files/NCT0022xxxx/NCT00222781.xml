  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to use a recently developed triple-tracer positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) method to study skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Insulin is the hormone&#xD;
      made by your body to control the blood sugar level. &quot;Resistance' to insulin could cause poor&#xD;
      blood glucose control (blood sugar levels that are higher than normal). We want to use this&#xD;
      new method to image (look at) the following three things: 1) how insulin affects blood flow&#xD;
      in skeletal muscle 2) how insulin affects glucose (sugar) transport (movement) into muscle,&#xD;
      and 3) how insulin affects glucose metabolism (breakdown) in skeletal muscle of healthy&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET imaging is a relatively non-invasive way to obtain a &quot;metabolic picture&quot; of body organs&#xD;
      and has been used successfully to study brain, heart and more recently skeletal muscle. In&#xD;
      this research study, we will use PET, with three radioactive tracers (markers), to study&#xD;
      skeletal muscle glucose transport in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM)&#xD;
      and in non-diabetic individuals who are either normal weight or overweight/obese&#xD;

      The goal of this proposal is to use a recently developed triple-tracer positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) method to study skeletal muscle insulin resistance (IR) in research&#xD;
      volunteers with type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM) and in comparison to age and&#xD;
      gender-matched, normal weight non-diabetic volunteers, and in comparison to age, gender, and&#xD;
      weight-matched overweight or obese non-diabetic volunteers. We will use the three tracers to&#xD;
      obtain data on the respective insulin actions upon tissue perfusion, glucose transport and&#xD;
      glucose phosphorylation in order to test the hypothesis that insulin resistance (IR) in type&#xD;
      2 DM is caused by an aggregation of impairments at these steps, thus challenging the&#xD;
      prevalent concept that IR derives from a solitary impairment in trans-membrane transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proximal steps of glucose transport and phosphorylation are considered to contribute strongly&#xD;
      to the pathogenesis of IR in obesity and type 2 DM (1-5). These scientific considerations&#xD;
      might have potential therapeutic implications. The overall goal of this project is to provide&#xD;
      clarity in separating the respective roles of these proximal steps of glucose metabolism.&#xD;
      Glucose transport will be assessed using 11C-3-O-methyl glucose (half-life ~ 20 min; also&#xD;
      referred to as 3-0-MG), an analog that is transported but not phosphorylated.&#xD;
      18F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose (half-life ~ 109 min; also referred to as FDG), will be used to&#xD;
      assess glucose transport and glucose phosphorylation. The third tracer that will be used,&#xD;
      15O-H2O, will provide information on tissue perfusion. The challenge with the use of FDG to&#xD;
      study insulin action in muscle has been to derive data on two biochemical steps from the&#xD;
      tissue activity pattern of a single tracer; this has placed a higher reliance upon the&#xD;
      modeling of the data. However, in this project, because of the use of three tracers and the&#xD;
      differences in the metabolism of the two glucose analogs, we will be able to address with&#xD;
      clear resolution the respective roles of transport and phosphorylation in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      IR in obesity and type 2 DM.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will recruit eight normal weight (BMI 19 to 25 kg/m2), and eight overweight or&#xD;
             obese (BMI 27 to 38 kg/m2), non-diabetic, healthy volunteers, who are between the ages&#xD;
             of 30 to 55 years old. For scientific reasons it is crucial that the groups are age&#xD;
             matched. Limiting the age range to a period of 25 years will help achieve this goal.&#xD;
             Volunteers for these two groups must have a fasting glucose &lt; 110 mg/dl; HbA1c &lt; 6.0%;&#xD;
             Hct &gt; 34; ALT &lt; 60; AST &lt; 60; Alk phos &lt; 150; sTSH &lt; 8; Trig &lt; 300; Chol &lt; 250;&#xD;
             systolic BP &lt; 150; diastolic BP &lt; 95; and be in good health. A medical history and&#xD;
             physical exam will be conducted by a nurse practitioner or a medical doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will also recruit eight volunteers with type 2 DM; as the large majority of this patient&#xD;
        population is overweight or obese, inclusion criteria will include BMI 27 to 38 kg/m2, and&#xD;
        otherwise age- and gender-matched to the non-diabetic volunteers. At screening, HbA1c must&#xD;
        be less than 8.5%. For scientific purposes we would like to study the volunteers with type&#xD;
        2 DM without the confounding effects of anti-diabetic medications, therefore, we propose to&#xD;
        restrict recruitment to those who are either treated by diet and exercise alone, or to&#xD;
        those who are on oral agents in the sulfonylurea class, metformin, or acarbose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will exclude volunteers taking thiazolidinediones as the washout period for this&#xD;
             class is uncertain, and exclude those taking insulin as withdrawal likely would cause&#xD;
             unacceptable levels of hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Research volunteers with type 2 DM who are enrolled in the study and who are receiving oral&#xD;
        diabetic agents (sulfonylureas, metformin or acarbose), will be instructed to withhold&#xD;
        these medications for five days preceding both PET studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous difficulty with lidocaine (xylocaine) will be an exclusion. To be eligible for&#xD;
        these studies, volunteers must be free of clinical evidence of cardiac, renal, hepatic, and&#xD;
        vascular disease, or other major medical problems that would endanger the volunteers or&#xD;
        compromise the scientific validity of the studies. Subjects with a history of myocardial&#xD;
        infarction, proteinuria (defined as 1+ protein), alcohol or drug abuse, malignancy or&#xD;
        neuromuscular disease will be excluded. Subjects who have gained or lost more than 3 kg&#xD;
        during the past 3 months will be excluded. Because of the PET, MR, and DEXA scanning, all&#xD;
        premenopausal women must have a negative pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to these&#xD;
        procedures. To avoid radiation exposure of the infant, women who are currently&#xD;
        breastfeeding will not be permitted to participate in this research study. Subjects will be&#xD;
        excluded if they have a contraindication to MRI such as surgical or vascular implants,&#xD;
        pregnancy, pacemaker, or claustrophobia. In subjects with a questionable history of&#xD;
        metallic fragments, an X-ray of the suspected area of the body will be performed to rule&#xD;
        such out.&#xD;
