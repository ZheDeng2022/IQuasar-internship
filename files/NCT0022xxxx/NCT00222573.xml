  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COMMIT/CCS2 is a large randomised trial of the effects of clopidogrel plus Aspirin versus&#xD;
      Aspirin alone in acute heart disease. Patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of&#xD;
      suspected acute MI were potentially eligible provided they were thought to have ST elevation&#xD;
      or other ischaemic ECG abnormality with no clear indication for, or contraindication to,&#xD;
      trial treatment. All patients were to be given 162 mg ASA daily and, in addition, 75 mg&#xD;
      clopidogrel daily or matching placebo for 4 weeks or until prior discharge or death.&#xD;
      (Patients were also randomised separately in a 2 X 2 factorial design between metoprolol&#xD;
      versus placebo.) The two main study endpoints are death and the composite outcome of death,&#xD;
      non-fatal reinfarction or stroke during the scheduled treatment period in hospital.&#xD;

      Clopidogrel&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite considerable improvements in the emergency treatment of acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (MI), including the use of aspirin, early mortality and morbidity remain high. The&#xD;
      antiplatelet agent clopidogrel adds to the benefit of aspirin in acute coronary syndromes&#xD;
      without ST-segment elevation, but its effects on mortality and morbidity in patients with&#xD;
      ST-elevation MI were unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      45,852 patients admitted to 1250 hospitals within 24 hours of the onset of suspected acute MI&#xD;
      were randomly allocated to receive clopidogrel 75 mg daily or matching placebo (both in&#xD;
      addition to aspirin 162 mg daily). 93% had ST-segment elevation or bundle branch block, and&#xD;
      7% had ST-segment depression. Treatment was to continue until discharge or up to a maximum of&#xD;
      4 weeks in hospital (mean 15 days in survivors), and 93% completed it. The two pre-specified&#xD;
      co-primary outcomes were: (i) the composite of death, reinfarction or stroke; and (ii) death&#xD;
      from any cause during the scheduled treatment period. Comparisons were between all&#xD;
      clopidogrel-allocated and all placebo-allocated patients (ie, &quot;intention-to-treat&quot;), and used&#xD;
      the log-rank method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation to clopidogrel produced a highly significant 9% (95% CI 3-14) proportional&#xD;
      reduction in the primary composite outcome of death, reinfarction or stroke (2121 [9.2%]&#xD;
      clopidogrel vs 2310 [10.1%] placebo; p=0.002), corresponding to 9 (SE 3) fewer events per&#xD;
      1000 patients treated for about 2 weeks. There was also a significant 7% (95% CI 1-13)&#xD;
      proportional reduction in the co-primary outcome of any death (1726 [7.5%] vs 1845 [8.1%];&#xD;
      p=0.03). These effects on death, reinfarction and stroke appeared to be consistent across a&#xD;
      wide range of patients and independent of other treatments being used. Considering all&#xD;
      transfused, fatal or cerebral bleeds together, no significant excess risk was observed with&#xD;
      clopidogrel, either overall (134 [0.58%] vs 125 [0.55%]; p=0.59), or among patients aged 70&#xD;
      years or older (50 [0.84%] vs 43 [0.72%]; p=0.48) or among those given fibrinolytic therapy&#xD;
      (74 [0.65%] vs 72 [0.63%]; p=0.88).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a wide range of patients with acute MI, adding clopidogrel 75 mg daily to aspirin and&#xD;
      other standard treatments (such as fibrinolytic therapy) reduces mortality and major vascular&#xD;
      events in hospital, without any material increase in major bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metoprolol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite previous randomised trials of early beta-blocker therapy in the emergency treatment&#xD;
      of suspected acute myocardial infarction (MI), substantial uncertainty has persisted about&#xD;
      the value of adding it to currently standard interventions (eg, aspirin and fibrinolytic&#xD;
      therapy), and the balance of potential benefits and hazards was unclear even in high-risk&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      45852 patients admitted to 1250 hospitals within 24 hours of the onset of suspected acute MI&#xD;
      were randomly allocated to receive metoprolol (up to 15 mg intravenous followed by 200 mg&#xD;
      oral daily) or matching placebo. 93% had ST-segment elevation or bundle branch block, and 7%&#xD;
      had ST-segment depression. Treatment was to continue until discharge or up to a maximum of 4&#xD;
      weeks in hospital (mean 15 days in survivors), and 89% completed it. The two pre-specified&#xD;
      co-primary outcomes were: (i) the composite of death, reinfarction or cardiac arrest; and&#xD;
      (ii) death from any cause during the scheduled treatment period. Comparisons were between all&#xD;
      metoprolol-allocated and all placebo-allocated patients (ie, &quot;intention-to-treat&quot;), and used&#xD;
      the log-rank method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither of the co-primary outcomes was significantly reduced by allocation to metoprolol. For&#xD;
      the primary composite outcome of death, reinfarction, or cardiac arrest, 2166 (9.4%) patients&#xD;
      had at least one such event among the 22 929 allocated metoprolol compared with 2261 (9.9%)&#xD;
      among the 22 923 allocated matching placebo (odds ratio [OR] 0.96 [95% CI 0.90-1.01]; p=0.1).&#xD;
      For the co-primary outcome of death alone, there were 1774 (7.7%) in the metoprolol group&#xD;
      versus 1797 (7.8%) in the placebo group (OR 0.99 [0.92-1.05]; p=0.69). Allocation to&#xD;
      metoprolol was associated with 5 fewer people having reinfarction (464 [2.0%] metoprolol vs&#xD;
      568 [2.5%] placebo; OR 0.82 [0.72-0.92]; p=0.001) and 5 fewer having ventricular fibrillation&#xD;
      (581 [2.5%] vs 698 [3.0%]; OR 0.83 [0.75-0.93]; p=0.001) per 1000 treated. Overall, these&#xD;
      reductions were counter-balanced by 11 more per 1000 allocated metoprolol developing&#xD;
      cardiogenic shock (1141 [5.0%] vs 885 [3.9%]; OR 1.30 [1.19-1.41]; p&lt;0.00001). The excess of&#xD;
      cardiogenic shock was chiefly during days 0-1 after hospitalisation, whereas the reductions&#xD;
      in reinfarction and ventricular fibrillation emerged more gradually. Consequently, the&#xD;
      overall effect on death, reinfarction, arrest or shock was significantly adverse during days&#xD;
      0-1 and significantly beneficial thereafter. There was substantial net hazard among&#xD;
      haemodynamically unstable patients and moderate net benefit among those who were relatively&#xD;
      stable, particularly after days 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of early beta-blocker therapy in acute MI reduces the risks of reinfarction and&#xD;
      ventricular fibrillation, but increases the risk of cardiogenic shock, especially during the&#xD;
      first day or so after hospitalisation. Consequently, it may generally be prudent to consider&#xD;
      starting beta-blocker therapy in hospital only when the haemodynamic condition following MI&#xD;
      has stabilized (and then, based on previous evidence, to continue such therapy long-term&#xD;
      following discharge).&#xD;
