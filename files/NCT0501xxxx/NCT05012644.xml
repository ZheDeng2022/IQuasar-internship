      This study aims to assess real-world tumor response in pre/perimenopausal HR+/HER2-&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients initiating palbociclib + aromatase inhibitor (AI) or&#xD;
      AI alone as first-line therapy during the period on or after 01 January 2010 to on or before&#xD;
      30 June 2020. Data will be obtained from structured data fields within an electronic health&#xD;
      record (EHR) database and will be supplemented by additional unstructured data collected&#xD;
      through a targeted chart review.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pre or perimenopausal at MBC diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of MBC in patient history&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Confirmed HR+/HER2- status as defined as: a. HR+: ER+ or PR+ test; b. HER2-: any HER2&#xD;
             negative test and the absence of a positive test (IHC positive 3+, fluorescence in&#xD;
             situ hybridization [FISH] positive/amplified, positive not otherwise specified [NOS]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Received one of the following regimens as first-line treatment for MBC during the&#xD;
             period from 01 January 2010 through index period 30 June 2020 until the data cutoff&#xD;
             date of 31 December 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Palbociclib + AI as first-line treatment for MBC or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Monotherapy AI as first-line treatment for MBC&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Received care at a US Oncology Network (USON) site(s) utilizing the full EHR&#xD;
             capacities of iKnowMed (iKM) at the time of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. EHR data available from the USON site(s) where the patient received treatment are&#xD;
             accessible for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence of prior treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors&#xD;
             (palbociclib, ribociclib or abemaciclib) in the early breast cancer (BC) or MBC&#xD;
             setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. First structured activity (clinical visit) greater than 120 days after MBC diagnostic&#xD;
             date with chart review to confirm no initial MBC treatment outside USON.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Receipt of treatment indicated for another primary cancer during the study observation&#xD;
             period (after initiation of Palbociclib + AI or AI monotherapy and before 31 December&#xD;
             2020) or history of another primary cancer within USON.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Enrolled in any interventional clinical trial after initiation of Palbociclib + AI or&#xD;
             AI monotherapy AND before 31 December 2020.&#xD;
