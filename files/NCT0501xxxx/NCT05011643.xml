    <textblock>
      Rationale: Combining statin treatment and physical activity is very effective for the&#xD;
      prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Statins are well-tolerated by most patients, but may&#xD;
      cause statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) and elevated markers of skeletal muscle damage&#xD;
      in some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that statins augment increases in serum creatine kinase after&#xD;
      eccentric or vigorous exercise. If statins also increase muscle damage markers after&#xD;
      exercises of moderate intensity is unclear. Symptomatic statin users may be more susceptible&#xD;
      to exercise-induced skeletal muscle injury, however, previous studies did not differentiate&#xD;
      between symptomatic and asymptomatic statin users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare the impact of moderate-intensity exercise on muscle damage markers&#xD;
      between symptomatic and asymptomatic statin users, and non-statin using controls. A secondary&#xD;
      objective is to examine the association between leukocytes coenzyme Q10 levels and&#xD;
      exercise-induced muscle damage and muscle complaints.&#xD;

      Combining statin treatment and physical activity is very effective for the prevention of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases. Statins are well-tolerated by most patients, but may cause&#xD;
      statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) and elevated markers of skeletal muscle damage in&#xD;
      some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that statins augment increases in serum creatine kinase after&#xD;
      eccentric or vigorous exercise. However. if statins also increase muscle damage markers after&#xD;
      exercises of moderate intensity is unclear. Impaired mitochondrial oxidative function might&#xD;
      contribute to SAMS and exercise-induced muscle damage. Several studies showed that statins&#xD;
      decrease serum coenzyme Q10 levels, an essential component of the mitochondrial transport&#xD;
      chain, but effects on intramuscular coenzyme Q10 levels are inconsistent. The investigators&#xD;
      have observed that mitochondrial dysfunction is more pronounced in statin users with SAMS&#xD;
      compared to asymptomatic statin users. This suggests that symptomatic statin users may be&#xD;
      more susceptible to exercise-induced skeletal muscle injury. However, previous studies&#xD;
      examining creatine kinase response to exercise did not differentiate between symptomatic and&#xD;
      asymptomatic statin users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this cross-sectional observational study the investigators will study the impact of&#xD;
      moderate-intensity exercise on muscle damage markers between symptomatic and asymptomatic&#xD;
      statin users, and non-statin using controls. A secondary objective is to examine the&#xD;
      association between leukocytes coenzyme Q10 levels and exercise-induced muscle damage and&#xD;
      muscle complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that statins will not increase muscle damage markers after&#xD;
      moderate-intensity exercise and that higher CoQ10 levels are associated with less&#xD;
      exercise-induced muscle damage and muscle complaints.&#xD;
