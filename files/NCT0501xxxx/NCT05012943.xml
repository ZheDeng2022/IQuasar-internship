  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of ARCT-154 in adult participants to be&#xD;
      enrolled in Vietnam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of four parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 (Phase 1) will evaluate the safety of the study vaccines in 100 healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 (Phase 2) will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the study vaccines in 300&#xD;
      healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3 (Phase 3a) will evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the study&#xD;
      vaccines in 600 individuals with and without underlying medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 4 (Phase 3b) will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the study vaccines in 20,000&#xD;
      individuals with and without underlying medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, individuals 18 to &lt; 60 years of age will be enrolled. In Phase 2, 3a, and 3b,&#xD;
      individuals 18 years of age and older will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3a and Phase 3b participants will be randomly assigned to a study&#xD;
      group that will receive up to 2 vaccination series. Each vaccination series comprises two&#xD;
      vaccinations at 28-day intervals: an initial vaccination series with vaccinations on Day 1&#xD;
      and Day 29 and an additional vaccination series with the opposite vaccine at the 6-month&#xD;
      timepoint on Day 209 and 237.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 will enroll 100 healthy participants that are randomly assigned 3:1 to receive&#xD;
      ARCT-154 or placebo (75:25) for the initial series of vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, 300 participants will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive ARCT-154 or placebo for&#xD;
      the initial series of vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 3a, 600 participants will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive ARCT-154 or placebo&#xD;
      for the initial series of vaccinations. In Phase 3b, 20,000 participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned 1:1 to receive ARCT-154 or placebo for the initial series of vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 participants must be &lt;60 years of age. It is anticipated that approximately 20% of&#xD;
      the Phase 2, 3a and 3b participants will be elderly (≥60 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase 2, 3a and 3b, after a 10-day Screening period, prior to randomization, participants&#xD;
      will be stratified by age (&lt; 60 or ≥ 60 years of age) and for participants &lt; 60 years of age&#xD;
      by risk of severe COVID 19. Participants will be followed up for 1 year after completion of&#xD;
      the initial vaccination series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will perform ongoing review of blinded&#xD;
      and unblinded data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent blinded adjudication committee will adjudicate all suspected COVID-19 cases to&#xD;
      determine if they meet the primary endpoint requirements.&#xD;

             systemic corticosteroids, eg, for cancer or an autoimmune disease, within 6 months&#xD;
             prior to Screening, or planned receipt throughout the study. If systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids have been administered short term (&lt;14 days) for treatment of an acute&#xD;
             illness, participants should not be enrolled into the study until corticosteroid&#xD;
             therapy has been discontinued for at least 28 days prior to first study vaccine&#xD;
             administration. Inhaled/nebulized, intra-articular, intrabursal, or topical (skin or&#xD;
             eyes) corticosteroids are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
