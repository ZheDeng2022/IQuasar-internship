  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing knowledge on rectal motility and bladder-rectum cross-talk has been published in&#xD;
      recent years. However, whether bladder filling factors during multichannel urodynamic studies&#xD;
      affect rectal contraction (RC) parameters has not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the impact of bladder filling and desire to void&#xD;
      on rectal contraction amplitude or frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to determine any significant change in rectal parameters depending&#xD;
      on clinical and urodynamic factors or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients referred for urodynamic assessment and with studies positive for rectal&#xD;
      contractions as defined by the international continence society (ICS) will be included.&#xD;
      Abdominal pressure will be measured using a T-doc air charged abdominal catheter inserted 10&#xD;
      cm from the anal margin. Standardized urodynamic evaluation will be conducted following ICS&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean amplitude, maximal amplitude (cmH20) and mean frequency of rectal contractions on all&#xD;
      urodynamic studies will be visually measured on the recording software and compared depending&#xD;
      on bladder sensation (First Desire to void (FDV), Strong Desire to Void (SDV) and filling&#xD;
      volume (200ml, 400ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data (age, sex, BMI), underlying neurological disease, clinical symptoms, and&#xD;
      scores (Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score, Bristol Score, Cleveland Score), urodynamic&#xD;
      parameters and treatments will be collected. Time since last defecation and meal will also be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective observational study will be conducted in a Neuro-Urology department of a&#xD;
      French university hospital. All the patients included are referred for multichannel&#xD;
      urodynamic assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have suggested multiple types of colonic motor patterns including rectal motor&#xD;
      activity. This rectal activity has been described in conventional multichannel urodynamic&#xD;
      studies and has been determined not be an artefact. Some studies have related this rectal&#xD;
      activity to bladder dysfunction, an underlying neurological affection or old ageing. However,&#xD;
      the significance of this rectal activity observed during urodynamic studies remains unclear.&#xD;
      It has been suggested that rectal activity may be a marker for underlying conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, rectal phasic contractions using conventional manometry have been&#xD;
      described for decades and consecutively coined rectal motor activity, periodic rectal motor&#xD;
      activity and rectal motor complex. Recent data using High Resolution Manometry reports&#xD;
      retrograde propagating cyclic motor patterns occurring with a frequency of 2 to 6 events per&#xD;
      minute. In this study 59% of retrograde CMPs initiated in the sigmoid colon and rectum in the&#xD;
      postprandial period suggesting a mechanism to limit rectal filling. This supports Rao and&#xD;
      al.'s theory of a rectosigmoid brake. Modifications of CMP have also been shown in pathology&#xD;
      such as slow transit constipation and fecal incontinence although results are conflicting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, rectum and bladder share a common embryological origin and innervation which has&#xD;
      led in recent years to the development of the concept of a cross talk between rectum and&#xD;
      bladder. Animal and human studies have assessed the effect of rectal distension on bladder&#xD;
      sensation and motility. However, whether bladder filling factors affect rectal contraction&#xD;
      parameters has not been specifically studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to assess if bladder sensation and filling volume have any&#xD;
      significant effect on rectal contraction parameters such as amplitude or frequency. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to determine any significant change in rectal parameters depending on clinical&#xD;
      and urodynamic factors or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective observational study will be conducted in a Neuro-Urology department of a&#xD;
      French university hospital. All the patients included are referred for multichannel&#xD;
      urodynamic assessment to explore urinary disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients referred for urodynamic assessment will be screened. All patients with a&#xD;
      recording of rectal contractions as defined by the international continence society (ICS)&#xD;
      during the urodynamic study will be included. Rectal contraction identified by a first&#xD;
      investigator will have to be confirmed by a second investigator to be included for further&#xD;
      analysis. The ICS defines rectal contractions as: temporary phasic increases in abdominal&#xD;
      pressure without synchronous change in vesical pressure resulting in negative deflections of&#xD;
      detrusor pressure. Based on previously published studies, rectal contractions resulting in a&#xD;
      more than 5 cmH20 change of abdominal pressure will be included for analysis. Abdominal&#xD;
      pressure will be measured using a T-doc air charged abdominal catheter inserted 10 cm from&#xD;
      the anal margin. Patients will be informed on the procedure prior to the exam. Filling of the&#xD;
      bladder will be carried out in a semi-seated position. Patients will be asked to report need&#xD;
      to void; FSF, First Desire to Void (FDV) and SDV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected: age, sex, body mass index, etiology of urinary&#xD;
      disorders, type of urinary or bowel symptoms, use of treatment for urinary or bowel&#xD;
      dysfunction, time of last meal, detrusor overactivity on urodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amplitude and frequency of rectal contractions will be measured individually on the software&#xD;
      used for the urodynamic study. The amplitude of each contraction will be measured as the&#xD;
      difference between the peak of the contraction wave and the baseline preceding each&#xD;
      contraction. Mean and maximum amplitude will be compared between time samples depending on&#xD;
      bladder sensation and filling volume. The frequency will be calculate as (number of&#xD;
      contraction on the studied period)/(time of the studied period). Absence of contraction on a&#xD;
      sample will be counted as a frequency of 0. The occurrence of at least 2 contractions over a&#xD;
      time sample will be necessary in order for an average frequency to be calculated. Frequency&#xD;
      of contractions will be compared between beginning of cystometry to first desire to void&#xD;
      (FDV) and FDV to end of bladder filling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analysis to assess the impact of clinical and urodynamic data on rectal contraction&#xD;
      parameters will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be collected and analyzed without any identifying information.&#xD;
