  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The idea that osteopathic manipulative treatments (OMTs) should have an impact on the human&#xD;
      visual system is not new. Nevertheless, there is a lack of scientific, objective, and&#xD;
      experimental evidence. Our goal is to conduct a randomized, double-blind, controlled study to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of OMT on ocular pursuit. Eye movements will be measured by an infra-red&#xD;
      video-based eye tracking system with a high spatial and temporal resolution. OMTs will be&#xD;
      similar to regular treatments given by osteopaths in their daily practice. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that OMT will improve the quality of ocular pursuit.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is based on the implication of the fascial system (i.e., connective tissues)&#xD;
      in the structural continuity that gives form and function to every tissue and organ. Fascial&#xD;
      tissue, on which osteopathic manipulations are acting by restoring its elasticity, is also&#xD;
      present in the eye cavity. The connection between fascia might explain how osteopathic&#xD;
      manipulations, applied on structures which can be far from the original dysfunctional point,&#xD;
      might improve oculomotricity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after OMT, practitioners will estimate the lateral and medial oculomotor muscles'&#xD;
      and the fascia's tissue elasticity with a manual test. They will softly mobilize the eyeballs&#xD;
      in medial and lateral directions (the amplitude of these passive mobilizations will always be&#xD;
      lower than active eye rotations) and give an elasticity score. Before and after these tests,&#xD;
      pursuit eye movements will be recorded by an independent technician. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to track a target that will be displaced horizontally on a computer screen. The target&#xD;
      will move 30 times from left to right and 30 times from right to left with a constant speed&#xD;
      of 20 degrees of visual angle per second.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve three independent groups (experimental, sham, test-retest) of healthy&#xD;
      participants. We expect that pursuit improvement will be larger in the experimental group&#xD;
      than in the two other groups. Moreover, as secondary goals, we will evaluate the correlation&#xD;
      between pursuit eye movement data (obtained with a technical device, in a standardized&#xD;
      situation) and subjective assessments of oculomotor muscles' elasticity made by the&#xD;
      practitioners providing OMTs. We will also examine the possible practitioner effect (two&#xD;
      exclusive osteopaths will provide OMTs).&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be positioned on an exam table supine, seated, or decubitus. Osteopathic manipulations will consist in corrective micro-movements applied on synovial joints, on the skull, the teeth and/or visceral structures of the abdomen or the thorax. Local pressures won't exceed a few tens of grams/cm². Practitioners will realize between 15 and 25 technical gestures per participant. Treatment will last 30 minutes (plus or minus 5 minutes) on average. The technical gestures are referenced in the Glossary of Osteopathic Terminology published by the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (2017).</description>
