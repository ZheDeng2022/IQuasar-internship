  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) has become an adjuvant therapeutic possibility&#xD;
      in body remodeling procedures. Although this modality emerged in 1960, there are still few&#xD;
      studies that demonstrate the real mechanism of action and possible interaction with&#xD;
      subcutaneous fatty tissue. Given this scenario, this study was proposed with the aim of&#xD;
      evaluating the effects of PBMT to Light Emitting Diode (LED) associating the red (630 nm) and&#xD;
      infrared (850 nm) wavelengths in the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Methods: This is a&#xD;
      non-randomized controlled study of comparative intervention that evaluated a sample of&#xD;
      subcutaneous fatty tissue from women with grade II obesity. The participants received the LED&#xD;
      PBMT treatment with associated red and infrared wavelengths sequentially on the left side of&#xD;
      the abdomen and the right side was considered as control, with the collection of biological&#xD;
      material performed at the time of bariatric surgery. For histological and immunohistochemical&#xD;
      evaluation, Caspase 3, Cleaved Caspase 3, CD68+, HSL and adipophilin markers were used.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Localized adiposity or localized obesity is the hyperplasia or hypertrophy of adipocytes in&#xD;
      specific areas such as the abdomen and flanks, its development is associated with the risk of&#xD;
      metabolic diseases and psychosocial changes related to low self-esteem, since aesthetic&#xD;
      appearance is considered an imposed standard of beauty nowadays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of obese individuals has increased at alarming levels around the world and to&#xD;
      combat it, several therapeutic approaches are needed, such as personalized diets and physical&#xD;
      activity plans, in order to balance consumption and energy expenditure, but despite these&#xD;
      controls, several adjuvant features such as non-invasive modalities are also being proposed&#xD;
      to reduce subcutaneous fatty tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among these modalities are the technologies of shock waves, cryolipolysis, focused&#xD;
      ultrasound, radiofrequency and the use of light sources with photobiomodulation therapy. The&#xD;
      latter, in turn, has shown relevant results in the possible reduction of subcutaneous fatty&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a light source as a therapeutic form is already millenary and nowadays it is&#xD;
      widely used as a modality to promote wound healing, reduce pain and possible damage and&#xD;
      inflammation of tissues with the characteristic of not presenting photothermal or&#xD;
      photoacoustic effects, thus termed as photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT). It can be used by&#xD;
      using non-ionizing light sources such as Low Intensity Laser Therapy (LLLT) or Light Emitting&#xD;
      Diode Therapy (LED).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The landmark of the use of PBMT in the possible reduction of subcutaneous fatty tissue&#xD;
      emerged with the double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study by Jackson et al. in 2012.&#xD;
      A total of 689 individuals participated in the study, subdivided into a placebo group and an&#xD;
      LLLT group, all of whom were evaluated during the treatment, in order to verify the possible&#xD;
      reduction in the circumference of the waist, hips and thighs. Participants received a total&#xD;
      of six LLLT treatments over 2 weeks with baseline and post-procedure circumferential&#xD;
      measurements recorded. The results showed a significant reduction (p&lt;0.0001) in circumference&#xD;
      at the waist, hips and thighs one week after treatment with LLLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the same line of research Jankowski et al., and Elnaggar, also carried out&#xD;
      photobiomodulation studies to reduce fatty tissue and show partially significant results. The&#xD;
      justification for the result was the smaller sample of participants compared to the study by&#xD;
      Jackson et al., , however these studies were not able to elucidate which form of therapeutic&#xD;
      action on fatty tissue to promote its reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms by which PBMT can affect fatty tissue are still controversial, and it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that PBMT could induce micropores in the adipocyte membrane, which allow the&#xD;
      release of intracellular lipids and place them outside the interstitial space or an&#xD;
      alternative hypothesis is that PBMT stimulates mitochondria in adipocytes, which, in turn,&#xD;
      increases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis with subsequent activation of cyclic&#xD;
      adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), promoting lipolysis, and the third hypothesis is that it&#xD;
      depends on of the dose applied in PBMT, this can even stimulate adipocyte cell apoptosis,&#xD;
      that is, there is still no clear physiological basis for its mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another important PBMT fact for the reduction of fatty tissue observed in articles already&#xD;
      published is the difference in the wavelengths used, and in some articles the&#xD;
      photobiomodulation was carried out with the red wavelength 630nm and in others the infrared&#xD;
      808 or 850nm. It is believed that each of them must reach different depths of the fatty&#xD;
      tissue and thus favor its reduction, however, there is no standardization of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given this scenario, this study aimed to verify the real mechanism of action of PBMT when&#xD;
      used in association of the wavelengths, red (630nm) and infrared (850nm) in the subcutaneous&#xD;
      fatty tissue, through a clinical study with histological and immunohistochemistry analysis&#xD;
      with markers of lipolysis and apoptosis in the subcutaneous fatty tissue of obese&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
