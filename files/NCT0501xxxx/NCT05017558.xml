  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to evaluate the operationality of introducing the measurement of viral&#xD;
      load in HIV-1 infected mothers at delivery by POC to optimise post-natal prophylaxis and&#xD;
      neonatal diagnosis of children according to the estimated risk of MTCT (high risk: HIV viral&#xD;
      load (VL) at delivery ≥ 1000 copies/mL, low risk: VL at delivery &lt; 1000 copies/mL) in&#xD;
      Conakry, Guinea.&#xD;

      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women screened for HIV-1 infection in the delivery room, whether or not the infection was&#xD;
      previously known, whether or not they are treated, will be eligible to participate in this&#xD;
      study and will be offered inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women will benefit from a viral load measurement by POC (Cepheid GenXpert HIV-1 viral&#xD;
      load) at the time of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newborns will benefit :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the provision of antiretroviral (ARV) preventive treatment differentiated according to&#xD;
           their risk of infection in accordance with national recommendations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  High risk (maternal VL ≥1000 cp/ml): zidovudine (AZT)/ nevirapine (NVP) for 12&#xD;
                weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Low risk (maternal VL &lt;1000 cp/ml): NVP for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. early and regular virological screening for HIV by qualitative POC (Cepheid GenXpert&#xD;
           HIV-1 qual) from birth (for high-risk newborns) at 6 weeks, at 9 months and at any time&#xD;
           in the event of clinical manifestations suggestive of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In the event of a positive HIV test, the child will initiate immediate antiretroviral&#xD;
           treatment combining zidovudine (AZT)/ lamivudine (3TC)/ Lopinavir-retonivir (LPV/r) and&#xD;
           a confirmatory test will be done by POC (Cepheid GenXpert HIV-1 viral load) according to&#xD;
           World Health Organisation (WHO) and national recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. support from the project team and peers, volunteers from the association Fédération&#xD;
           Espoir Guinée (FEG), to improve retention in care and compliance of mother and child,&#xD;
           promotion of exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months and family nutritional support,&#xD;
           Cotrimoxazole (CTX) prophylaxis and the Expanded Programme on Immunization will be&#xD;
           provided by the national programme.&#xD;
