  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if a pillow sleep aid improves sleep quality in&#xD;
      the short term for patients who have shoulder pain from a rotator cuff injury and are being&#xD;
      managed non-operatively.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have shoulder pain from a rotator cuff injury will be identified in the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic and offered the chance to enroll in the study. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained. There will be two groups of patients in this study; those that receive the pillow&#xD;
      sleep aid (the intervention group) and those that do not (the control group). The pillow&#xD;
      sleep aid that will be investigated in this project is the &quot;MedCline Shoulder Relief System,&quot;&#xD;
      a product of Amenity Health Inc.. The pillow will be delivered to the intervention group at&#xD;
      no cost. Patients in both groups will be prescribed the same physical therapy protocols. At&#xD;
      the end of the trial period, patients in the control group will be offered the option to&#xD;
      receive a pillow. Those that accept will be surveyed at similar intervals as the original&#xD;
      intervention group.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Pain Scores on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, two weeks, six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS utilizes a scale from 0-10 where a high score indicates more pain</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life as Assessed Using the Euroqol (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, two weeks, six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D assesses quality of life with one question for each of the five dimensions that include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Shoulder Function as Assessed Using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Score (ASES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, two weeks, six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ASES is a 100-point scale that consists of two dimensions: pain and activities of daily living. There is a pain scale worth 50 points and ten activities of daily living questions worth 50 points</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Shoulder Function as Assessed Using the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, two weeks, six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SANE assesses shoulder function via 1 question as a percentage of normal (0-100 scale with 100 being normal)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Shoulder Function as Assessed Using the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, two weeks, six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>WORC utilizes 21 questions where each question uses a visual analog scale, a line with a 0-100 scale where 0 represents no difficulty. It asks about shoulder pain in 5 different domains, physical symptoms, sports, work, social, and emotions</description>
