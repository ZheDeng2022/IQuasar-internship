  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the effectiveness of technology-enhanced collaborative care management&#xD;
      (t-CoCM) to usual collaborative care management (u-CoCM) in achieving fidelity to processes&#xD;
      of care and reducing depression symptoms in patients currently receiving cancer treatment.&#xD;
      CoCM is a population-based, integrated care approach, where care managers, who are clinicians&#xD;
      (typically clinical social workers), deliver behavioral treatments, coordinate psychosocial&#xD;
      care, monitor outcomes, and adjust treatment with the input of a psychiatric consultant. The&#xD;
      use of t-CoCM may improve the treatment of depression and increase patient outcomes and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (t-CoCM): Patients use the t-CoCM digital app platform and clinic care managers use the&#xD;
      t-CoCM web-based patient registry platform to support delivery of collaborative care.&#xD;
      Patients complete surveys at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months. Some patients also participate in&#xD;
      an interview about their user experience with the t-CoCM digital platform. Care managers also&#xD;
      participate in interviews regarding their experience with CoCM and the newly developed&#xD;
      web-based platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (u-CoCM): Patients receive usual care and clinic care managers deliver usual CoCM.&#xD;
      Patients complete surveys at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months.&#xD;
