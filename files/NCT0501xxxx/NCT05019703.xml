  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of atezolizumab and cabozantinib in treating&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults with osteosarcoma that has come back (recurrent) or has spread&#xD;
      to other places in the body (metastatic). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving atezolizumab and cabozantinib may&#xD;
      help to control the osteosarcoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab in&#xD;
      recurrent/metastatic osteosarcoma as determined by the progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      defined as the time from treatment onset to either disease progression as defined by Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1 criteria, immune-based&#xD;
      (i)RECIST, and immune-modified (im)RECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) rates at 4 months and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the overall survival (OS) in patients with recurrent/metastatic osteosarcoma&#xD;
      receiving cabozantinib + atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination as assessed by toxicity rates&#xD;
      according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the expression of selected biomarkers including PD-1/PD-L1, MET, and VEGFR in&#xD;
      pre-treatment and on-treatment tumor biopsy specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the immunologic response by change in immune infiltrate in tumors from baseline&#xD;
      and on-treatment biopsy specimens and correlate findings with clinical benefit/response to&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize and quantify immunologic changes in peripheral blood and correlate with&#xD;
      clinical benefit/treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 and cabozantinib&#xD;
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days, then every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years.&#xD;

             bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy) or documented postmenopausal&#xD;
             status (defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman &gt; 45 years-of-age in the absence&#xD;
             of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, females &lt; 55 years-of-age&#xD;

             Note: documentation may include review of medical records, medical examinations, or&#xD;
             medical history interview by study site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt;&#xD;
                  1% per year during the treatment period and for 5 months after the final dose of&#xD;
                  study treatment with either atezolizumab or cabozantinib&#xD;
&#xD;

                  bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that&#xD;
                  inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper&#xD;
                  intrauterine devices&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormonal contraceptive methods must be supplemented by a barrier method&#xD;
                  (including male condom, female condom, or diaphragm with spermicidal gel)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
             a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With a female partner of childbearing potential or pregnant female partner, men&#xD;
                  must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 5&#xD;
                  months after the final dose of cabozantinib to avoid exposing the embryo. Men&#xD;
                  must refrain from donating sperm during this same period&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of preventing drug&#xD;
                  exposure&#xD;

               -  Note: If a single ECG shows a QTcF with an absolute value &gt; 500 ms, two&#xD;
                  additional ECGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30&#xD;
                  min after the initial ECG, and the average of these three consecutive results for&#xD;
                  QTcF will be used to determine eligibility&#xD;
