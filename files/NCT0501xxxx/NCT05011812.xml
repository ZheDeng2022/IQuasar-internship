  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, placebo-controlled, blinded, randomized, dose escalation study of PBI-0451&#xD;
      in healthy subjects. PBI-0451 is a new chemical entity and inhibitor of the main protease of&#xD;
      coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 disease. The study is designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of PBI-0451 after single and&#xD;
      multiple ascending doses and also to explore drug-drug interaction potential of PBI-0451.&#xD;
