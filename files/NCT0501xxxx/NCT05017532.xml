      This study will investigate whether the remote administration of the cognitive remediation&#xD;
      program RC2S+ acceptable and feasible in people with schizophrenia and related disorders.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders are associated with major functioning&#xD;
      difficulties encompassing various areas of everyday life such as social interactions or&#xD;
      school and work performance. Cognition, and more particularly social cognition, defined as&#xD;
      the mental processes underlying social interactions, is considered as one of the best&#xD;
      predictors of functioning in schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. Social cognitive&#xD;
      deficits thus represent a promising treatment target to promote functional recovery.&#xD;
      Cognitive remediation (CR) is a behavioural intervention that can improve social cognitive&#xD;
      deficits and clinical symptoms and moderate to large effect sizes have been reported. While&#xD;
      there is great excitement that such interventions can also improve functioning, very few CR&#xD;
      program for social cognition have used a personalized approach to tailor treatment to&#xD;
      individual difficulties despite the benefit of personalizing CR treatment in schizophrenia.&#xD;
      The program Remédiation Cognitive de la Cognition Sociale en Schizophrénie (RC2S+) is a&#xD;
      personalized CR treatment targeting social cognition using virtual reality to emulate daily&#xD;
      social interactions. Two case studies conducted in France with people with schizophrenia have&#xD;
      demonstrated acceptability and feasibility of in-person RC2S+ while providing preliminary&#xD;
      evidence for efficacy with the report of significant improvement of social cognitive and&#xD;
      functional difficulties. While these preliminary results are encouraging, the program has&#xD;
      never been used in Canada. Psychosocial intervention, and particularly those targeting social&#xD;
      cognition, need to be culturally adapted. Thus, a preliminary study is necessary to assess if&#xD;
      RC2S+ is culturally adapted to the social norms and rules of French and English-speaking&#xD;
      Canadians. Further, this study needs to consider the actual context of the COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      which has highlighted the important vulnerability of people with psychotic disorders and the&#xD;
      need to adapt evidence-based interventions such as CR to increase access to mental healthcare&#xD;
      services. Online interventions have rapidly developed in the last year in response to&#xD;
      COVID-19 and these interventions address important factors that are known to limit access to&#xD;
      psychiatric care in people with psychotic disorders. A remote version will however require an&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main objective is to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effect of the&#xD;
      remoted RC2S+. To reach this goal, we will, 1) Translate the RC2S+ program in English and&#xD;
      adapt the program for French Canadians and 2) Determine the acceptability, the feasibility&#xD;
      and the preliminary effect of the remoted RC2S+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-six participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorder aged&#xD;
      18 years or older and who present with at least one social cognitive impairment will be&#xD;
      recruited. They will be initially assessed for social cognition as well as clinical outcomes&#xD;
      (e.g. symptoms, recovery, functioning). Then, participants will receive 24 biweekly&#xD;
      individual sessions of RC2S+ of 1 hour with a therapist. Intra-session questionnaires will be&#xD;
      administered at different timepoints to the participants and the therapists to assess&#xD;
      therapeutic alliance, motivation toward treatment as well as the satisfaction regarding&#xD;
      treatment. At the end of treatment, participants will be reassessed with the similar measures&#xD;
      as baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide the first insight of the preliminary effect of RC2S+ administered&#xD;
      remotely, in addition to providing French-Canadian and English version of this novel program.&#xD;
      The results of the current study will provide relevant information to improve the program and&#xD;
      its delivery for a future efficacy study.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence of an organic cause for cognitive difficulties (e.g. neurological disease,&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. History of mental retardation or autism spectrum disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
