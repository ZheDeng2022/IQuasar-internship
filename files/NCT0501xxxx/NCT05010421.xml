  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a common autoimmune disease of the genital skin. It affects 1/900&#xD;
      women with an age peak in the sixth decade of life and is manifested by chronic inflammation&#xD;
      of the genital, perineal, and perianal areas associated with itching, burning, pain, and&#xD;
      soreness. In addition, LS is associated with an increased risk of vulvar cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options for LS include topical steroids such as clobetasol, immunomodulators such&#xD;
      as tacrolimus, and non-ablative laser treatment. Although both treatments are well documented&#xD;
      and used in clinical practice, direct comparative studies of the efficacy of topical&#xD;
      corticosteroids versus laser treatment in women with LS are rare. For example, a PubMed&#xD;
      literature search (search date 2021-03-14; search terms: lichen sclerosus, laser,&#xD;
      corticosteroids, steroids, clobetasol, randomized) identified only a single randomized trial&#xD;
      with limited power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the available evidence, further high-quality studies are needed to define the&#xD;
      superiority/inferiority of the different available treatment options such as nonablative&#xD;
      lasers and topical corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this prospective, randomized, open-label, comparative study, treatment success&#xD;
      after 3 courses of non-ablative treatment with CO2 laser every 14 days will be compared with&#xD;
      treatment success after topical application of clobetasol 0.05% over 3 months (daily in the&#xD;
      first month, every other day in month 2, and 3 times/week during month 3) at the time point 3&#xD;
      months after treatment initiation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a common autoimmune disorder of the genital skin. It affects 1/900&#xD;
      women with an age peak in the sixth decade of life. LS is a chronic inflammatory condition&#xD;
      affecting the genital, perineal, and perianal areas and causes itching, burning, pain, and&#xD;
      soreness. Histologically, LS is characterized by epidermal atrophy, hyperkeratosis,&#xD;
      follicular plugging, degeneration of the basal layer, and subepidermal hyalinization of&#xD;
      collagen in the papillary dermis with a lymphocytic infiltrate. Affected women typically&#xD;
      suffer significant long-term genital damage including scarring, fusion of the vulval labia,&#xD;
      narrowing of the vaginal opening, dyspareunia, and burying of the clitoris. In addition, LS&#xD;
      is associated with an increased risk of vulvar cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options of LS include topical steroids such as clobetasol, topical immunomodulators&#xD;
      such as tacrolimus, and non-ablative laser treatment. In a systematic review of the&#xD;
      literature with 7 studies and 249 participants, clobetasol achieved improvement rates and&#xD;
      remission rates of 70% to 89% and 20% to 35%, respectively. In comparison, non-ablative laser&#xD;
      treatment leads to significant improvements in vulvar itching, dryness, pain, and dyspareunia&#xD;
      in 50% to 85% of women with remission rates of up to 80% after 14 years of follow-up.&#xD;
      Although both treatments are well documented and used in clinical practice, direct&#xD;
      comparative studies assessing the efficacy of topical corticosteroids versus laser treatment&#xD;
      in women with LS are rare. For example, in a PubMed literature search (search date&#xD;
      2021-03-14; search terms: lichen sclerosus, laser, corticosteroids, steroids, clobetasol,&#xD;
      randomized) only one randomized trial was identified. In this study, the authors included 40&#xD;
      women with LS and compared 3 applications of non-ablative laser 2 weeks apart with 4 weeks of&#xD;
      twice daily (2 weeks), once daily (1 week), and every other day (1 week) of topical&#xD;
      clobetasol 0.05% cream. After 3 months of treatment laser-treated women had a significantly&#xD;
      higher sum score (including burning, itching, and pain) measured on an 11-step visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS). Both treatments demonstrated histological improvement with reductions&#xD;
      of inflammatory hallmarks in skin biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given this body of evidence, more high-quality studies are needed to define the&#xD;
      superiority/inferiority of the different available treatment options such as non-ablative&#xD;
      laser and topical corticosteroids. Therefore, a prospective, randomized trial comparing&#xD;
      non-ablative CO2 laser treatment and topical clobetasol 0.05% will be conducted. The aim of&#xD;
      this prospective, randomized, open-label, comparative trial is to establish or refute the&#xD;
      superiority of 3 courses of non-ablative treatment by CO2 laser every 14 days compared to&#xD;
      topical clobetasol 0.05% (daily in month 1, every other day in month 2, and 3 times/week in&#xD;
      month 3) for 3 months. The primary endpoint of this study is a sum score including the&#xD;
      pathognomonic symptoms of LS, namely vulvar burning, itching, and pain, each measured on an&#xD;
      11-step VAS. Secondary endpoints will include the physician-scored rate of visual improvement&#xD;
      (measured on an 11-item VAS), side effects, and patient-reported outcomes such as subjective&#xD;
      overall improvement, general satisfaction, and quality of life (measured by a validated&#xD;
      questionnaire for vulval disorders; i.e. the VDQI (Vulval Disease Quality of Life Index).&#xD;
