      To gain healthcare workers' perception of the current observations practices used in patient&#xD;
      care and explore the benefits of using technology to enhance observations in inpatient mental&#xD;
      health setting in the United Kingdom.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodic intermittent clinical observations are commonly used in mental health services at&#xD;
      admission for risk assessment and then for the clinical management of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses follow these practices as routine care to ensure patient well-being. However, being&#xD;
      observed may make patients feel uncomfortable and anxious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Department of Health (2006) stipulated for the practice of observation to be implemented&#xD;
      in a manner that would enable patients to experience it as a healing and compassionate&#xD;
      practice. This is apparently not always realised as there are reported differences on how&#xD;
      patients are observed, and clinical data obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst this may be attributed in part to lack of or limited training on the use of&#xD;
      observations, it can also in part be attributed to lack of a standardised approach to&#xD;
      implementation and documentation of the outcomes of observations (Stewart &amp; Bowers 2012).This&#xD;
      contributes to variability among healthcare workers in their interpretation of the&#xD;
      outcomes/data of observations. Given that patients' care pathways are influenced by the&#xD;
      outcomes/data of observations, it is critical to reduce the variability in the use of this&#xD;
      practice. Doing so would lead to obtaining consistent and dependable data that reflect&#xD;
      patients' mental state to guide their individual care pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of this qualitative study is to document how clinicians perform routine patient&#xD;
      observations, the essential aspects of observations through a clinician's point of view and&#xD;
      how can application of modern technology aid this process. This systematic documentation will&#xD;
      capture the strengths and limitations of current practice creating a service provide based&#xD;
      dataset to inform focused improvements.&#xD;
