  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is critical for health and quality of life; however, little is known about the&#xD;
      prevalence or impact of non obstructive sleep apnea (non-OSA) sleep disorders in people with&#xD;
      stroke. The proposed study aims to characterize the proportion of people with stroke that&#xD;
      have non-OSA sleep disorders and their impact on recovery of activities of daily living,&#xD;
      functional mobility, and participation along the continuum of recovery in people with stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal in this project is to develop an in-depth understanding of the complex&#xD;
      interplay between non-obstructive sleep apnea (non OSA) sleep disorders and recovery after&#xD;
      stroke. Sleep is vital to overall health and quality of life. Abnormal or insufficient sleep&#xD;
      is both a risk factor and consequence of stroke. Sleep also plays a critical role in motor&#xD;
      learning, which is the foundation of rehabilitation strategies after stroke. Although there&#xD;
      is a growing understanding of the interplay between sleep, stroke, and recovery in people&#xD;
      with OSA these complex relationships in individuals post stroke with non OSA sleep disorders&#xD;
      are not well understood. In order to develop targeted sleep interventions to support&#xD;
      rehabilitation after stroke and promote optimal recovery, it is critical to gain a fuller&#xD;
      understanding of the prevalence and impact of non OSA sleep disorders in people with stroke&#xD;
      across the continuum of recovery. The specific objectives of this proposal will lay the&#xD;
      necessary groundwork for this as investigators will characterize the proportion of people&#xD;
      with stroke that have insomnia disorders, restless legs syndrome, and insufficient sleep; and&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of these non OSA sleep disorders on recovery of activities of daily&#xD;
      living, mobility/activity, and participation across the continuum of recovery after stroke.&#xD;
      The study will take an innovative approach to measuring sleep, mobility/activity, and&#xD;
      participation using a combination of techniques across the measurement spectrum that will&#xD;
      include self-report questionnaires, clinic-based measures of capacity, and body worn sensors.&#xD;
      The body worn sensors will include actigraphy to measure sleep parameters, activity monitors&#xD;
      to measure mobility/activity levels, and Global Positioning System (GPS) units to measure&#xD;
      participation. Additionally, investigators will apply innovative, big data tools from&#xD;
      topological data analysis for a data driven approach to discover complex, structural,&#xD;
      non-linear interdependent relationships among stroke, sleep, and recovery of&#xD;
      mobility/activity, and participation. Upon completion of this study there will be an&#xD;
      understanding of the prevalence and impact of non-OSA sleep disorders on recovery of&#xD;
      function, mobility/activity, and participation across the continuum of recovery post stroke.&#xD;
      This is an important, necessary step to develop appropriate sleep-based interventions to&#xD;
      complement targeted rehabilitation strategies to enhance the health and quality of life in&#xD;
      people with stroke.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Final research data along with meta-data and descriptors will be shared to the maximum extent possible while protecting patient privacy. Data will be for individual subjects. No aggregate data will be provided apart from what is published in the literature. Data will be formatted for SPSS and/or as csv files.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_info_type>Study Protocol</ipd_info_type>
    <ipd_time_frame>Anticipated availability of the dataset will be announced during the final year of the project, with notification of how to apply for access to the data. Data will be deposited into the institutional repository as soon as possible, after key manuscripts have been accepted for publication. Should manuscripts be delayed due to unforeseen circumstances, data will be available through the repository within a year of project closure. Data will remain available by request from the PI during time of employment at SUNY Upstate, after which time the SUNY Upstate library will manage and grant access according to guidelines set forth by the IRB.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>An online data request form will be available so that others can indicate their interest in the data through a publicly available website. A data sharing agreement will be signed by all parties.&#xD;
Because detailed pattern of life information may contain information that may allow subject identity to be recovered, we intend to provide two levels of data sharing with three classes of data.&#xD;
Controlled share: data (to include pattern-of-life data) that contains information for which identity could be recovered if analyzed with malicious intent. These data will only be released to vetted researchers under conditions that provide assurance of protected privacy.&#xD;
Public share: a subset of the variables that are not expected to provide privacy risk; and Geo-summarized or modified data - consistent with state-of-the-art methodologies for differential privacy, the collected participation (geolocation) data will be made available after the data has been modified to preserve privacy.</ipd_access_criteria>
