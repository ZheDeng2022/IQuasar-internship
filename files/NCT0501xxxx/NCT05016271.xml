  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore changes in cardiopulmonary function and other health indicators in&#xD;
      primary school students with the intervention of air purifiers on a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial among 110 healthy children in&#xD;
      Jiaozuo city, Henan, China. The eligible children will be divided into two groups according&#xD;
      to their classes and randomly receive interventions of either true or sham air purifiers. The&#xD;
      air purifiers devices in classroom [air purifiers and fresh air ventilation systems] will&#xD;
      operate during the school time and the devices in bedrooms (air purifiers) operate during the&#xD;
      home time in the intervention period. All the participants and investigators will be blinded&#xD;
      to the group assignment. Epidemiological questionnaires (i.e., basic characteristics, eating&#xD;
      habits, daily schedule, etc.) will be conducted and health indicators (i.e., blood pressure,&#xD;
      pulmonary function indicators, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and fractional exhaled carbon&#xD;
      monoxide) and biological specimens (i.e., morning urine, venous blood, exhaled breath&#xD;
      condensate, and feces) will be evaluated and collected at baseline and after the completion&#xD;
      of intervention period (4 months anticipated).&#xD;

    <description>Nihon Kohden Electrocardiograph and Carepatch Electrocardiogram are used to measure heart rate variability, including standard deviation of all normal-to-normal R-R intervals (SDNN), standard deviation of sequential five-minute R-R interval means (SDANN), root-mean-square difference of successive normal R-R intervals (RMSSD), low frequency (LF), and high frequency (HF) in intervention and control groups. To eliminate possible errors, measurements are conducted by the same trained staff using the same instrument.</description>
