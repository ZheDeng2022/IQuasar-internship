    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of leflunomide in treating African-American and&#xD;
      European-American patients with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma. Leflunomide is used to&#xD;
      decrease the body's immune response and may delay the symptoms of multiple myeloma in&#xD;
      patients of African-American and European decent.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the anti-myeloma activity of leflunomide, when given as a single agent, as&#xD;
      assessed by freedom from progression at 2-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single agent leflunomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To summarize and assess toxicities by type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course&#xD;
      and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate overall and progression-free survival probabilities. III. To estimate&#xD;
      response rate and duration of response. IV. To describe the impact of treatment on quality of&#xD;
      life, as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality&#xD;
      of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Score version (v)3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the molecular evolution of the tumor cells. II. To evaluate whether&#xD;
      specific genetic subtypes respond differently to leflunomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the role of immune cells in the progression of smoldering multiple myeloma&#xD;
      (SMM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the role of leflunomide in modulating the immune system. V. To examine the&#xD;
      relationship between immunological changes and disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive leflunomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up yearly.&#xD;

               -  Clonal bone marrow plasma cell percentage &gt;= 60%&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Involved:uninvolved serum free light chain ratio &gt;= 100 (Involved free light&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Carcinoma in situ of the cervix&#xD;

             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women and women who are lactating. Leflunomide has potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is a potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;

             unable to swallow medication, social/ psychological issues, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to&#xD;
             comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to&#xD;
             feasibility/logistics)&#xD;
