  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric diseases，including congenital cataract,，corneal injury，corneal ulcer, usually need&#xD;
      suture removal and ophthalmic examination after Surgery for several days. Unfortunately, it&#xD;
      remains a great challenge to achieve successful sedationdue to children's noncooperation.&#xD;
      Sevoflurane is one of the most often used anesthesia agents to provide deep sedation.&#xD;
      Although sevoflurane has been used for pediatric anestheisas with successful keep spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing without intubation, it should be noted that sevoflurane often results in air&#xD;
      pollution under the open airway background and postopertive agitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esketamine is the S (+) isomer of ketamine, which produces a dissociated state with minimal&#xD;
      risk of airway compromise or apnea. It has enhanced analgesic potency and faster elimination&#xD;
      compared to ketamine. However, it may also cause delirium during the recovery time. Based on&#xD;
      these experiences on ketamine, we compared the effectiveness of esketamine and sevoflurane&#xD;
      for short ophthalmological procedure in pediatric patients.&#xD;

      Pediatric diseases，including congenital cataract,，corneal injury，corneal ulcer, usually need&#xD;
      suture removal and ophthalmic examination after Surgery for several days. Unfortunately, it&#xD;
      remains a great challenge to achieve successful sedation to advoid body movement and keep&#xD;
      perfect eye position due to children's noncooperation. Thus, appropriate sedative agents&#xD;
      therefore need to be administrated to perform this minor surgery. Sevoflurane is used&#xD;
      frequently inhalational anaesthetic agent to provide pediatric anaesthesia because of the&#xD;
      nonirritant nature. It has been used for successful keeping spontaneous breathing without&#xD;
      tracheal intubation. It should be noted that sevoflurane often results in air pollution under&#xD;
      the open airway background and emergence agitation. High concentrations of sevoflurane may&#xD;
      causes respiratory depression due to the decrease in tidal volume during spontaneous&#xD;
      ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine is widely used for procedural sedation, which produces a dissociated state with&#xD;
      minimal risk of airway compromise or apnea. Esketamine is the S (+) isomer of ketamine, It&#xD;
      has enhanced analgesic potency and faster elimination compared to ketamine. However, it may&#xD;
      also cause agitation during the recovery time. Based on these experiences on ketamine, we&#xD;
      compared the effectiveness of esketamine and sevoflurane for short ophthalmological procedure&#xD;
      in pediatric patients.&#xD;
