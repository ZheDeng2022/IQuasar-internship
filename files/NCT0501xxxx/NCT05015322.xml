    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain, which is the third most common cause of musculoskeletal pain, has different&#xD;
      etiologies. Muscle, bone structures and connective tissue pathologies can cause shoulder&#xD;
      pain. Impingement syndrome (IS), which can cover many terms such as rotator cuff disorders,&#xD;
      tendinitis and tears, is one of the most common pathologies of shoulder pain.&#xD;

      The hypothesis of this study was that injection types including ACJ would increase treatment&#xD;
      efficacy.Therefore, this study investigated the six-month follow-up results of patients&#xD;
      undergoing SA injection and SSNB and those receiving SA and ACJ injection.&#xD;
