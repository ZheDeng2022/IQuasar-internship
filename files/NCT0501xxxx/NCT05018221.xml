  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BEAT-Calci is a randomized, adaptive, multi-center, platform trial that will evaluate&#xD;
      multiple interventions, across several domains of therapeutic care. The objective of the&#xD;
      study is to establish high-quality evidence on the effect of a range of interventions in&#xD;
      patients with kidney failure and newly diagnosed calciphylaxis. Calciphylaxis is a rare&#xD;
      disease affecting 1-2 people in 10,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will commence with a Dialysis Membrane Domain and Pharmacotherapy Domain. The&#xD;
      Pharmacotherapy Domain of BEAT-Calci is a placebo-controlled, double blind, response&#xD;
      adaptive, randomised controlled trial that will investigate whether any of the&#xD;
      pharmacotherapeutic agents is superior to placebo in improving outcomes. The Dialysis&#xD;
      Membrane Domain of BEAT-Calci is an open-label, randomised controlled two-way comparison&#xD;
      between two different dialysis technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BEAT-Calci Wound Assessment Scale (BCWAS) is the primary endpoint for the trial. It is an&#xD;
      8-point ordinal categorical scale of disease outcomes and will be used to determine each&#xD;
      participant's outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will utilise a Bayesian adaptive sample size re-estimation approach for sample size&#xD;
      calculations. The trial will continue to recruit until predefined superiority or futility&#xD;
      rules are met. As the trial progresses, in response to information accumulating during the&#xD;
      trial, there are various adaptations that can occur, including addition or removal of an&#xD;
      intervention arm, response adaptive randomisation and addition of new therapeutic domains.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Blinding of all parties will not be possible for all domains. The default position of the BEAT-Calci platform is that treatments determined by randomization will be blinded to as high a level is feasible.&#xD;
Within practical domains, a blind will be adopted, whereby participants, site personnel, trial investigators and outcome assessors will remain blinded to the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock of the comparisons to which that participant is contributing data. In blinded domains, randomization data will not be accessible by anyone else involved in the trial with the following exceptions: (1) data managers who work on the randomization and drug management system, (2) unblinded statistician(s) involved with the response adaptive randomization, and (3) the unblinded biostatistician who prepares reports for the IDMC. Information on the blind, or lack thereof, per domain will be described in the respective Domain-Specific Appendix.</masking_description>
