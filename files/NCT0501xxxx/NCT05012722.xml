    <textblock>
      This observational study is assessing the effects that arterial stiffness may have on&#xD;
      patients with heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Arterial stiffness will be&#xD;
      measured by assessing pulse wave velocity (PWV). Carotid- Femoral PWV is the gold standard in&#xD;
      measuring arterial stiffness non- invasively. Many studies have shown increasing PWV is a&#xD;
      predictor of cardiovascular events, but the significance of increasing PWV as a surrogate&#xD;
      marker for the potential worsening (decompensation) of HF or CKD has not been explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate patients with HF and CKD by assessing PWV while in a&#xD;
      decompensated state and again when in a stable condition after 4 weeks of discharge to&#xD;
      investigate a link between decompensation and rise of arterial stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team aim to recruit 120 patients in this study with 40 patients in each of the 3&#xD;
      groups- heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), heart failure with preserved&#xD;
      ejection fraction (HFpEF) and acute kidney injury (AKI). All AKI patients would have had&#xD;
      known CKD (stages 3a, 3b or 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will be initially recruited in hospital while admitted in an acute&#xD;
      state and tests including bloods, ECG, echocardiography and PWV will be performed. The tests&#xD;
      (excluding echocardiography) will be repeated 4 weeks after discharge. There is no&#xD;
      intervention in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study seeks to improve the understanding of the role of the vasculature in the&#xD;
      development of acute HF in the two common types- HFrEF and HFpEF. As CKD is a common&#xD;
      comorbidity in heart failure patients we felt that a study of the behaviour of arterial&#xD;
      stiffness in this cohort will add to this understanding. If arterial stiffness is found to be&#xD;
      an important component of the HF syndrome therapeutic interest could be focused at managing&#xD;
      arterial stiffness with novel therapy.&#xD;

      Research Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to identify whether or not patients whom are admitted to&#xD;
      hospital with acute decompensated heart failure on a background of stable heart failure or&#xD;
      acute kidney injury on a background of stable chronic kidney disease stage 3a,3b or 4 show&#xD;
      high pulse wave velocity values when compared to being in a stable condition in the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will help improve the understanding in the pathophysiology of decompensated heart&#xD;
      failure and acute kidney injury in CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of arterial stiffness in the pathophysiology (in particular, the development) of&#xD;
      decompensated heart failure is poorly understood. It is suspected that in some types of heart&#xD;
      failure (HFpEF) arterial stiffness may be the driving factor for both acute and chronic types&#xD;
      but evidence on this is still incomplete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CKD is a common comorbidity in heart failure patients- an increase in arterial stiffness in&#xD;
      this group with AKI is likely to have an impact on the heart failure in those with both CKD&#xD;
      and heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to assess whether during the decompensated phases of HF or AKI there is an&#xD;
      acute increase in arterial stiffness measured by PWV. If this is indeed found, this study&#xD;
      will add to the knowledge on the contribution of arterial resistance to the mechanistic&#xD;
      pathophysiology in developing acute HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to improve the understanding of the contribution of the vasculature to&#xD;
      the HF syndrome as well as the contribution of CKD to this. If this study reveals that some&#xD;
      types of heart (cardiac) failure are more cardiovascular failure, efforts to develop novel&#xD;
      therapies can be then directed at the vascular component too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It may well reveal also that better risk stratification of heart failure may be possible if&#xD;
      vascular stiffness was included within the assessment for heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective non-randomised, observational, cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with decompensated HF or AKI, admitted to cardiac or renal wards at UHCW will be&#xD;
      introduced to the study by a member of the research or clinical team once they are deemed to&#xD;
      be clinically stable enough to consider this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be screened for eligibility criteria (provided later) and if they&#xD;
      meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria they will be approached by a member of the research&#xD;
      team to discuss the study, and if interested will be provided a participant information&#xD;
      sheet. Written consent will be gained at least 24 hours after the study information is&#xD;
      provided If the patient agrees to enrol in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participants are deemed due for discharge within 48 to 72 hours and are clinically&#xD;
      stable, a member of the research team will measure their pulse wave velocity using the&#xD;
      SphygmoCor CVMS machine (Atcor Medical, Sydney, Australia). Three recordings will be taken&#xD;
      for each value and averaged. During their in-patient stay if an up-to date echocardiogram has&#xD;
      not been performed in the last 6 months this will be undertaken by a qualified member of&#xD;
      staff trained in echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional tests such as electrocardiograms, baseline blood tests (Full blood count, urea and&#xD;
      electrolytes, NT pro BNP and eGFR) and clinical observations (Height, Weight, BMI, Blood&#xD;
      Pressure, Oxygen saturations, Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, Temperature) will be undertaken&#xD;
      as part of routine in-patient clinical care- these will be recorded. The time estimated for&#xD;
      pulse wave velocity measurements to be taken is estimated at around 15- 20minutes with the&#xD;
      patient lying flat on their bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participant is discharged they will be asked to attend a follow up visit around 4&#xD;
      weeks after discharge. This could be at either Cardiology Research Suite 4th Floor, UHCW or&#xD;
      the City of Coventry Health Centre located at Coventry city-centre. At the follow up visit&#xD;
      repeat tests will include routine bloods including NT pro BNP, repeat pulse wave velocity&#xD;
      assessment and clinical observations such as blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, height&#xD;
      and weight will be recorded. After this follow up visit there will be no further routine&#xD;
      follow up of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the hospital CRRS system (medical records) the research team can track if the patient&#xD;
      is admitted again with either decompensated heart failure or acute kidney injury and record&#xD;
      accurately morbidity or mortality data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohorts of patients will be sub-divided into groups. These groups are decompensated&#xD;
      HFrEF, decompensated HFpEF, acute kidney injury in CKD stage 3a,3b or 4, stable HFrEF, stable&#xD;
      HFpEF and stable CKD stage 3a, 3b or 4. The patients admitted to hospital will act as their&#xD;
      own controls during their follow up visit in a stable condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total the study is looking to recruit 40 participants for each of the 3 groups-&#xD;
      decompensated HFrEF, decompensated HFpEF and acute kidney injury on CKD (stage 3a, 3b or 4).&#xD;
      In total this means 120 participants during the hospitalisation phase who are then followed&#xD;
      up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of data collection in the study the case report forms will be audited to&#xD;
      ensure that the research protocol is being followed. An excel database will be created with&#xD;
      patient codes for analysis once data collection is complete.&#xD;

      Ethical issues&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study presents minimal risk to the participants involved. All procedures will have&#xD;
      informed patient consent. The assessment of arterial stiffness will be performed using a&#xD;
      probe placed on the neck and groin regions which will measure pulse wave velocity (measure of&#xD;
      arterial stiffness) by a non-invasive, painless and completely safe process known as&#xD;
      tonometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other tests include Electrocardiogram (ECG), transthoracic echocardiography (if not done&#xD;
      within 6 months) blood tests all of which pose minimal risk and discomfort (except for minor&#xD;
      discomfort during venepuncture for blood tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A meeting with patients (Patient &amp; Public Involvement -PPI-meeting) was conducted in December&#xD;
      2020 and valuable feedback was received. The PPI representatives were happy with the current&#xD;
      protocol of the study and felt that the tests and timing of the tests did not confer any risk&#xD;
      to participants. The lack of intervention would encourage patient participation. PPI feedback&#xD;
      was given in the design of the patient information sheet in May 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Covid pandemic patients will be asked to return for a second visit to the either&#xD;
      the hospital (University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW) Cardiology R&amp;D 4th floor&#xD;
      suite) or the Community Heart Failure Clinic on Stoney Staton road, in the Coventry city&#xD;
      centre to avoid potential exposure to Covid. Follow up appointments do pose additional strain&#xD;
      on existing services. This was discussed at the PPI meeting and the recommendations were that&#xD;
      the follow up appointments be kept brief. The research team anticipate that the follow up&#xD;
      appointment will last no more than 1 hour. If follow up appointments are missed the research&#xD;
      team will rearrange an appointment as soon as possible for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Legal issues There are no legal issues identified in the study. All of the study methods will&#xD;
      be in keeping with good clinical practice NIHR guidance and subjected to standards kept&#xD;
      within the Research and Development Department at UHCW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management Issues Data collection could be affected by problems with devices such as&#xD;
      computers at UHCW or problem with the PWV machine manufactured by SphygmoCor CVMS (Atcor&#xD;
      Medical, Sydney, Australia). IT device issues will be rectified by consulting the IT&#xD;
      department. For any problems with the Pulse Wave Velocity device, engineering staff at UHCW&#xD;
      will be consulted for support.&#xD;
