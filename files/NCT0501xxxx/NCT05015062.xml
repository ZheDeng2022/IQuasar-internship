  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be carried out in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan province,&#xD;
      China, using a single-blinded randomized controlled trial design to measure the effects of a&#xD;
      mobile-based HIV-related information intervention on group HIV/AIDS prevention. Village&#xD;
      doctors will be responsible for sending the HIV-related health education information to the&#xD;
      participants. The aim of this study is to develop a generalizable, effective, acceptable, and&#xD;
      convenient mobile-based information intervention model to improve HIV-related knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes, practices, and health outcomes in poverty-stricken areas in China and measure the&#xD;
      impact of incentive policies on the work of village doctors in Liangshan, China.&#xD;

    <measure>Behavioral changes: condom use</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the changes in participants' condom use via the Condoms Use Self-Efficacy Scale (CUSES), a 28-item self-reporting questionnaire using a 5-point scale scoring system in which 0 represents strongly disagree and 4 represents strongly agree.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral changes: substance use</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the severity, frequency and change of participants' substance use via the Drug and Abuse Screening Test (DAST), a 10-item questionnaire with scores range from 0 to 10; 0-2 representing low substance use and 9-10 representing severe substance use.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health outcomes: HIV prevalence</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health outcomes: mental health</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via the use of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) patient questionnaire, a self-reporting questionnaire consisting of 26 yes/no questions about the presence of various symptoms of different mental disorders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health outcomes: all-cause mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social factors: quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via the use of EQ-5D-3L, a questionnaire comprised of 5 questions and a visual analogue scale to assess the participants' health-related quality of life. Each question has three possible answers corresponding to three levels of perceived problems. Level 1 indicates no problem and level 3 indicates extreme problems. The visual analogue scale is numbered from 0 to 100, with 0 representing &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot; and 100 representing &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot;</description>
