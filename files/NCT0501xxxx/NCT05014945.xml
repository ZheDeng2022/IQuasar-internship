      &quot;In this study, the investigators plan to evaluate muscle mass and pain relief 4 weeks after&#xD;
      performing epidural nerve block and Type I porcine atelocollagen injection into multifidus&#xD;
      muscle in patients with chronic low back pain due to degenerative spinal disease for more&#xD;

    <description>After obtaining informed consent for the study, epidural nerve block was performed. The patient is asked to return to the outpatient clinic of the pain center after 2 weeks. At this time, when the NRS of back pain does not improve by more than 50% compared to before the epidural nerve block and the cross-sectional area of the multifidus muscle using ultrasound is 5 cm2 or less, final enrollment is decided. The evaluation of the cross-sectional area and thickness of the multifidus muscle using ultrasound is performed with the patient prone, and the cross-sectional area of the multifidus muscle is measured at the same position as the level of the lesion on MRI.</description>

    <description>Epidural nerve block and atelocollagen injection into the multifidus muscle were performed sequentially. The target level is determined by the clinician by combining the pre-MRI and the patient's symptoms. All procedures are performed under the guidance of fluroscopy. For epidural nerve block, use 10cc of 0.9% normal saline mixed with 3000IU of hyaluronidase to be injected. After the epidural nerve block, a solution of 1 mL of atelocollagen mixed with 1 mL of 1% lidocaine is injected into the multifidus muscle to complete the entire procedure.</description>

&#xD;
          2. Patients over 21 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Back pain lasting more than 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with ineffective or insignificant effects of conventional drugs and nerve&#xD;
             block for back pain&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with spinal stenosis or disc herniation at the lumbar 4-5 or lumbar 5-sacral&#xD;
             1 level on MRI, and the cross-sectional area of the multifidus muscle at the lesion&#xD;
             site is less than 5 cm2 when measured by ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. When the degree of low back pain is 3 points or less on the 11-scale numeric rating&#xD;
             scale (hereafter NRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. If lower back pain has rapidly worsened within the last week&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If you have other diseases that may cause low back pain: osteoarthritis of the hip&#xD;
             joint, cancer, inflammatory arthritis, spondylitis, fibromyalgia, complex regional&#xD;
             pain syndrome, herpes zoster, postherpetic neuralgia, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. When a diagnostic epidural nerve block is planned&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In the case of receiving conservative treatment, procedure, or surgery other than oral&#xD;
             drugs such as epidural nerve block or proliferation treatment for the treatment of&#xD;
             lower back pain within 4 weeks of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. When the low back pain assessed by NRS decreased by more than 50% after epidural nerve&#xD;
             block in screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. If back surgery is planned within 3 months of the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. When NRS and ODI measurements cannot be made&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. When collagen injection is contraindicated (eg when allergic to swine)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. If you cannot read or agree to the consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. If you are unable to sign the consent form yourself&#xD;
