  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Speech is a critical aspect of the human experience and usually develops in a &quot;seemingly&#xD;
      automatic process that continues from birth through adolescence and underlies many related&#xD;
      abilities&quot; (e.g., language and reading, see National Academy of Medicine Report on Speech and&#xD;
      Language Disorders, 2016). Many individuals with Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21, DS) struggle to&#xD;
      communicate and participate more fully in human communication and educational learning&#xD;
      experiences because their speech is difficult to understand. The purpose of the proposed&#xD;
      project is to measure speech-articulation accuracy and speech intelligibility, and their&#xD;
      proposed primary predictors at study entry in 20 children with DS age 6;0 to 13;11). A&#xD;
      validated treatment, speech recast intervention (see Yoder, Camarata &amp; Woynaroski, 2016) will&#xD;
      be used to drive growth in speech intelligibility as a means of evaluating changes in&#xD;
      potential sequelae of change. This integrated study will include measures of&#xD;
      speech-articulation accuracy, speech-prosody, general cognitive ability, receptive vocabulary&#xD;
      skills, and clinical assay of oral-motor ability as potential predictors of speech&#xD;
      intelligibility growth in DS. The Investigators will also be measuring suprasegmental and&#xD;
      rhythmic factors associated with growth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In most children, speech development progresses in a &quot;seemingly automatic manner that&#xD;
      continues from birth through adolescence&quot;1 and supports related communication and reading&#xD;
      abilities. But many individuals with Down Syndrome (DS, about 1 in 700 births in the US)&#xD;
      struggle to acquire speech and participate more fully in human communication and gain access&#xD;
      to learning experiences, in part, because their speech is often difficult to understand. This&#xD;
      persistent speech disorder arises because people with DS must acquire and produce speech&#xD;
      using structurally-different articulators and poor speech oral-motor abilities. Moreover,&#xD;
      there is considerable variability in the speech intelligibility of people with DS and it is&#xD;
      unclear why some people with DS communicate relatively proficiently whereas others are unable&#xD;
      to clearly communicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator's recent research provides a unique combination of findings that, when&#xD;
      integrated into a prospective project, can potentially provide new insights into how people&#xD;
      with DS improve speech intelligibility. This assertion is grounded in the long-standing and&#xD;
      replicated finding that speech intelligibility in DS is not strongly correlated with nor&#xD;
      solely attributable to measures of phoneme production, so that improvements in&#xD;
      intelligibility must rely not only improvements in speech accuracy (phoneme production) but&#xD;
      also upon changes in &quot;nonphonemic&quot; factors such as cognitive-linguistic parameters and&#xD;
      suprasegmental features such as prosody and speech rate that are currently poorly understood.&#xD;
      For example, in a recent paper (Wilson, Abedduto, Camarata &amp; Shriberg, 2019), the&#xD;
      Investigators describe cognitive/linguistic and speech-motor factors that relate to speech&#xD;
      intelligibility in DS and provide preliminary data on nonphonemic parameters that are&#xD;
      significantly correlated to intelligibility. In the cognitive linguistic domain, the&#xD;
      Investigators found that measures of cognitive ability and receptive language abilities were&#xD;
      directly related to speech intelligibility in people with DS. The Investigators also found&#xD;
      that measures of speech-motor ability related to speech intelligibility. Importantly, in&#xD;
      another series of studies, the Investigators demonstrated that individualized lexically based&#xD;
      phonological recast intervention resulted in improvements in speech intelligibility in school&#xD;
      age children with DS and that these gains were NOT uniquely attributable to changes in speech&#xD;
      accuracy (phoneme production).6,65 Thus, the Investigators propose to induce growth in speech&#xD;
      intelligibility in order to study cognitive-linguistic, suprasegmental and speech motor&#xD;
      sequelae of change and as an important step towards a) developing more effective speech&#xD;
      interventions, and b) gaining a better understanding of parameters that drive improved speech&#xD;
      intelligibility in DS in addition to phoneme production. This latter point is especially&#xD;
      important because the Investigator's previous research and the extant literature indicate&#xD;
      that traditional measures of speech accuracy (e.g., phoneme articulation) do not adequately&#xD;
      capture or predict improvements in speech intelligibility in DS. The proposed research would&#xD;
      thus test assumptions underlying current models of speech disorder (and intervention) in DS.&#xD;
      It is noteworthy that the Investigator's past work supports the hypothesis that nonphonemic&#xD;
      factors such as general cognitive level and vocabulary comprehension level are predictors of&#xD;
      later speech intelligibility in school age students with DS. The Investigator's previous&#xD;
      research has indicated that the Investigators can drive change in speech intelligibility&#xD;
      without directly targeting speech accuracy, providing an opportunity to study intelligibility&#xD;
      while controlling for speech accuracy as an untreated factor. Thus, an important first step&#xD;
      in identifying factors that influence variation in speech intelligibility in addition to&#xD;
      speech accuracy is to identify predictors of these speech abilities following intervention&#xD;
      induced gains. Therefore, in keeping with the goals of an exploratory/developmental research&#xD;
      project proposal (R21), the Investigators propose a mixed effects regression predictor design&#xD;
      that measures speech intelligibility, and it's posited sequelae within the context of a&#xD;
      controlled pre-post speech recast intervention study. Participants will be 20 school-age&#xD;
      children (6 to 14 years) with DS with varied cognitive ability levels (minimum of 60 with no&#xD;
      ceiling). The following specific aims will be pursued:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Estimate the relative contribution of (a) general cognitive level and (b) vocabulary&#xD;
      comprehension level, controlling for speech accuracy in accounting for variance in pre-post&#xD;
      levels of speech intelligibility growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Estimate the relative contribution of oral-motor skills in accounting for variance in&#xD;
      speech intelligibility growth while controlling for speech accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Estimate the relative contribution of suprasegmental prosodic parameters of (a)&#xD;
      acoustic prominence (frequency (F0), duration, and intensity) of pitch accented target words;&#xD;
      (b) metrical structure of rhythmic speech (rhythmic variability and accent structure) and (c)&#xD;
      speech rate in accounting for change overall pre-post growth in speech intelligibility while&#xD;
      controlling for speech accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: The results of this study within the context of a pre-post intervention design will&#xD;
      provide important preliminary information on factors that contribute to intelligible speech&#xD;
      in DS; thereby informing models of speech intelligibility and speech accuracy and future&#xD;
      larger scale clinical trials. The proposed project will provide preliminary data to guide&#xD;
      future longitudinal studies of value-added predictors of speech outcomes, and ultimately,&#xD;
      improve assessment and intervention for speech deficits in individuals with DS.&#xD;
