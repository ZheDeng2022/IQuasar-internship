  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some kidney transplant candidates have a very low chance of getting a kidney transplant&#xD;
      because their immune systems are &quot;highly sensitized&quot; to most kidney donors. Being &quot;highly&#xD;
      sensitized&quot; means that they will likely have to wait a long time (more than 5 years) before&#xD;
      an acceptable donor is found for them or, they never receive a compatible donor, and die&#xD;
      while on the kidney transplant waitlist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether two drugs, carfilzomib (Kyprolis®),and&#xD;
      belatacept (Nulojix®), can make these kidney transplant candidates less sensitized, and make&#xD;
      it easier and quicker to find a kidney donor for them.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 15 eligible participants, 18 to 65 years of age, with end stage renal&#xD;
      failure on dialysis who are on the waiting list for a deceased donor transplant with&#xD;
      calculated panel reactive antibodies (cPRA) ≥99.9% or &gt;98% (with &gt;5 years of waiting time)&#xD;
      or, those with cPRA &gt;98% and an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-incompatible approved living&#xD;
      donor who have not received a transplant after 1 year in a paired kidney exchange program.&#xD;
      The study will evaluate whether the study treatment is safe and can lower the participant's&#xD;
      immune system's sensitization to kidney donors, making it easier to find a well-matched&#xD;
      kidney for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study will be enrolled in two consecutive Cohorts of 5 and 10 patients&#xD;
      respectively. The total duration of participation in the study will be 76 weeks for Cohort 1&#xD;
      and 68 weeks for Cohort 2. Participants who undergo kidney transplantation while enrolled in&#xD;
      the study will undergo an additional 52 weeks of follow up post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of participation for living donors is one study visit. Their participation in&#xD;
      the study ends upon completion of this study visit.&#xD;
