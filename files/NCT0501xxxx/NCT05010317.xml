  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents represent a growing share of people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA),&#xD;
      yet show poor adherence to medication and viral suppression (VS) compared to adults.&#xD;
      Investigators postulate that to achieve optimal adherence, support interventions that&#xD;
      resonate with life-stages changes in adolescence need to be tested and promoted. Mindfulness&#xD;
      and acceptance based interventions are slowly gaining traction as appropriate for&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study proposes to explore acceptability of an adapted mindfulness and acceptance-based&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention (acceptance and commitment therapy: Discoverer, Noticer,&#xD;
      Advisor-values model-ACT-DNA-v), among providers (health care practitioners -HCPs) and users&#xD;
      (adolescents living with HIV/AIDS-ALWHA). Further, it endeavors to measure feasibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness of ACT-DNA-v in reducing psychological barriers to adherence among ALWHAs. The&#xD;
      study is to be conducted at two public health centers in Kampala-Uganda. The study design is&#xD;
      exploratory sequential mixed-methods; where qualitative data is to be used to explore&#xD;
      acceptance of ACT-DNA-v, while quantitative data will be used to measure feasibility of the&#xD;
      intervention and its effectiveness in reducing psychosocial barriers to adherence.&#xD;
      Qualitative exploratory methods will guide exploration of acceptability of ACT-DNA-v among&#xD;
      users and providers; collecting data with a semi-structured interview on domains of inquiry&#xD;
      including; understanding, satisfaction, intention to use and perceived appropriateness of&#xD;
      ACT-DNA-v. A randomized control trial with quantitative surveys at baseline,&#xD;
      post-intervention and follow-up will used to measure the effects of the intervention on&#xD;
      process and clinical outcomes among ALWHA. Thematic data analysis will be used to analyze&#xD;
      qualitative data, while T-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fisher's exact and Chi-square tests&#xD;
      respectively will be used to ascertain average mean differences between the ACT group and the&#xD;
      control group on the outcome parameters.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background The success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is highly dependent on adherence and&#xD;
      persistent care engagement. However, despite efforts to improve sustained ART use among&#xD;
      adolescents, non-adherence persists. Studies using medication possession ratios and clinical&#xD;
      counts have found adherence to ART among adults to be at 72% compared to 68% among young&#xD;
      people, furthermore, statistics on VL measures in 2017 show that 74.2% of adults above 50&#xD;
      years had achieved viral load suppression compared to 39.6% of adolescents. Additionally,&#xD;
      almost 50% of HIV cases in Uganda are among young people. Poor adherence among ALWHA&#xD;
      undermines the HIV care cascade and efforts to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. As a&#xD;
      consequence, young people are the only group in Uganda among whom HIV mortality is&#xD;
      increasing. The unique developmental changes at the onset of adolescence have been cited as&#xD;
      main factors influencing psychosocial pathways into health, resulting in psychopathological&#xD;
      barriers to medication adherence among ALWHA. Developmentally appropriate psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions need to be added into adolescents' HIV care. However, to date, psychosocial&#xD;
      support interventions targeted for the unique developmental changes in adolescence remain&#xD;
      limited. Most interventions in use with young people are developed for adult populations,&#xD;
      despite adult-focused interventions being shown to have limited effectiveness among young&#xD;
      people. Besides, some interventions like short message services are expensive and difficult&#xD;
      to sustain, while others lack a clear mechanism of change for replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness and acceptance based interventions, specifically ACT-DNA-v, are developmentally&#xD;
      appropriate for adolescents because they are designed to promote emotion regulation and&#xD;
      values consistent living, counteracting the imbalance created by developmental changes amidst&#xD;
      undeveloped executive functions such as judgment. Besides, ACT-DNA-v relies on use of art and&#xD;
      metaphors which serve as aids to symbolic reasoning (a change instigated by adolescence). The&#xD;
      intervention is also centered around values and adolescence is a stage of establishing&#xD;
      identity. Finally, ACT-DNA-V has a proper mechanism of change called psychological&#xD;
      flexibility, thus, it can easily be replicated. However, while mindfulness and acceptance&#xD;
      based interventions have been found to be effective in improving mental health of adolescents&#xD;
      in the developed world, they have not been tested in resource limited settings, with&#xD;
      adolescents living with HIV and for outcomes beyond mental health. Thus, this study set out&#xD;
      to adapt ACT-DNA-v for use in a resource limited setting, explore its acceptability among&#xD;
      users (ALWHAs) and providers (HCPs), measure its feasibility when used with adolescents and&#xD;
      evaluate its impact on reducing psychosocial barriers to adherence, improve self-reported&#xD;
      adherence and reducing viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives The study aims to achieve the following objectives;&#xD;
&#xD;
      .To adapt and explore acceptability of ACT-DNA-v among users (ALWHA) and providers (HCPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      .To measure feasibility of the adapted ACT-DNA-v for use with ALWHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .To examine the impact of ACT-DNA-v on reducing proximal psychosocial barriers to medication&#xD;
      adherence (depression, anxiety and stigma) among ALWHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .To measure effectiveness of a mindfulness based intervention (ACT-DNA-v) on self-reported&#xD;
      adherence among ALWHA in Kampala, and ascertain its impact on viral load reduction via&#xD;
      analysis of data from medical records&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis .Participants receiving the ACT-DNA-v intervention will report a significant&#xD;
      reduction in depression, anxiety &amp; stigma at four months' follow-up as compared to&#xD;
      participants in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .Participants receiving the ACT-DNA-v intervention will have significantly higher levels of&#xD;
      reported ART adherence and lowered viral load at four months' follow-up compared to&#xD;
      participants not receiving this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Overall design To achieve the study goals, a mixed methods design will be used,&#xD;
      specifically exploratory sequential. The mixing is intended for purposes of expansion (where&#xD;
      qualitative data will explore acceptability of the mindfulness based intervention and&#xD;
      quantitative data measures if the accepted intervention is effective). This will improve the&#xD;
      usefulness of the findings, (qualitative data evaluating the process while quantitative data&#xD;
      evaluate the outcomes). The study will involve two sub-studies; formative/qualitative study&#xD;
      and intervention/quantitative study.&#xD;
