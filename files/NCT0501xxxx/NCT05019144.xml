  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because burn patients and their caregivers often live long distances from regional burn&#xD;
      centers, access to expert burn care is limited, resulting in a negative effect on adherence&#xD;
      to treatment and a higher risk of wound complication. A novel smartphone application&#xD;
      synchronized with a web portal for providers, called the Telemedicine Optimized Burn&#xD;
      Intervention (TOBI), was recently developed to enable burn experts to direct burn wound care&#xD;
      while the patient and caregiver are home through text messaging, image transfer, and&#xD;
      video-conferencing. The goal of the present study is evaluate TOBI compared to face-to-face&#xD;
      care as usual for pediatric patients/caregivers visiting a burn center. This study will also&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of conducting a larger-scale clinical trial in several burn centers.&#xD;
      The app will allow the physician and patient to make instant decisions regarding treatment,&#xD;
      allowing for &quot;turn on a dime&quot; treatment decisions, rather than having the patients and&#xD;
      families wait for scheduled clinic appointments, often hours away from home. This &quot;on demand&quot;&#xD;
      medical care takes an innovative approach to increasing access to burn experts through&#xD;
      smartphone technology and addressing adherence to prescribed treatment by increasing&#xD;
      communication between provider and patients.&#xD;

    <description>A novel smartphone application for burn wound care, called the Telemedicine Optimized Burn Intervention (TOBI), was recently developed to enable burn experts to direct burn wound care while the patient and caregiver are home through text messaging and video-conferencing. The app was designed to bring expert wound care directly to the patient's home to address barriers to healthcare, including high cost burden and time commitment (e.g., geographic limitations, transportation to burn centers, parking, lodging, meals, time away from school and work), particularly for patients/families in rural and medically underserved communities. TOBI is synced with a portal used by providers, as an adjunct to standard therapy. This burn app provides education through frequently asked questions, instructional burn dressing change videos in addition to direct communication between patient and burn expert through store-and-forward pictures and videoconferencing.</description>

The participants will have scheduled video visits with the care provider at least weekly until the burn has healed. The participants will be able to use other features of the app, such as text-messaging and sending photos of the burn(s), as needed. The participants will be able to use standard FTF burn care as well. They will be given instructions how to contact the burn team through the hospital paging operator if TOBI is unavailable or there is an emergency.</description>
