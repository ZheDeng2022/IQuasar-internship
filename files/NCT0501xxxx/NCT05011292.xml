  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if incorporating videos on the importance of&#xD;
      minimizing infant sugar-containing beverage (SCB) consumption into well-child visit protocols&#xD;
      increases parents' SCB-related knowledge and their compliance with related early feeding&#xD;
      recommendations. The study also aims to determine whether these videos increase the frequency&#xD;
      and quality of the SCB-related reduction education and counseling provided to parents during&#xD;
      well-child visits.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine if incorporating videos on the importance of&#xD;
      minimizing infant sugar-containing beverage (SCB) consumption into well-child visit protocols&#xD;
      increases parents' SCB-related knowledge and their compliance with related early feeding&#xD;
      recommendations. The study also aims to determine whether these videos increase the frequency&#xD;
      and quality of the SCB-related reduction education and counseling provided to parents during&#xD;
      well-child visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The populations to be studied include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Parents of children attending a 4, 6, 9, 12 or 15-month well-child visit (Main study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A subsample of parents from above that agree to complete a baseline and follow-up&#xD;
           knowledge and practice survey 5 to 6 months after enrollment. (Long-Term follow-up&#xD;
           study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Members of the clinic team who participate in the project (Key informant interviews)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the main study will include parents attending a 4-month, 6-month, 9-month,&#xD;
      12-month or 15-month well-child visit at Hughes Spalding clinic, Atlanta GA. During their&#xD;
      4-month or 12-month clinic visit, parents will be offered to view a video (3 minutes) and&#xD;
      complete a short survey about it afterwards (2 minutes). Parents attending their child's 6, 9&#xD;
      or 15-month well-child visit will be asked to complete a short survey about infant feeding&#xD;
      practices (3-4 minutes). No identifying information will be collected. A waiver of consent is&#xD;
      being requested for this component of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subsample of the parents referenced above will be invited by co-investigators on the clinic&#xD;
      team to participate in a long-term follow-up survey to assess the extent to which viewing the&#xD;
      well-child visit videos has an impact of knowledge and/or behavior that is sustained. Those&#xD;
      who consent will be asked to provide their first name and email address in order to enable&#xD;
      the follow up survey to be completed on-line. No other PHI will be collected. A study ID will&#xD;
      be assigned and only the PI and the statistician will have access to the code that links&#xD;
      identifiers to subjects. Sub sample participants will be asked to view a video at the child's&#xD;
      4-month or 12-month well-child visit, to complete a survey assessing their response to the&#xD;
      video as well as their infant feeding practices. This survey will be repeated during their&#xD;
      6-month or 15-month well-child visit and again, by email, 2 to 3 months later. Total&#xD;
      participation time is expected to be &lt;20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key informant interviews will be completed by members of the clinic team involved in the&#xD;
      various aspects of the study. These will be done as time allows and will involved discussions&#xD;
      of 5 to 30 minutes depending on the availability of the staff members. No identifying&#xD;
      information will be collected as part of these interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general scope of topics covered in the surveys and key informant interviews will be&#xD;
      attitudes toward the sugar-containing beverage reduction (SCB) videos played at the clinic as&#xD;
      well as SCB knowledge and practices of parents and their children. Participant burden for&#xD;
      parents will range from about 6 minutes for those completing only the initial survey to an&#xD;
      estimated 20 minutes for the sub-sample of parents involved in the long-term follow-up.&#xD;
      Clinic staff that are involved in the key informant interviews will spend 5-30 minutes&#xD;
      participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Willingness to participate in the long-term follow-up study will be assessed by clinic&#xD;
      staff/study co-investigators who will complete an informed consent process (waiver of written&#xD;
      consent requested) for those interested. The only identifiable information collected will be&#xD;
      a participants name and phone number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHI will be forwarded in encrypted emails to the research team using a secure Children's&#xD;
      Healthcare of Atlanta email account and entered into a password protected RedCap database.&#xD;
      Survey data will also be collected and stored in that same database. Data confidentiality&#xD;
      will be assured by using ID numbers for those who provide identifiable contact information&#xD;
      (name and phone number). The code that links identifiers to subjects will be stored on locked&#xD;
      and password protected devices, with access only give to study staff who need the information&#xD;
      to perform the study.&#xD;

    <description>This will be assessed by asking parents if they are &quot;aware of any expert recommendations related to the age or amount of fruit juice given to infants and/or young children?&quot;. Those responding &quot;yes&quot; will be asked to specify the recommendation. If their response is correct, they will be recorded as knowledgeable.
