  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cryotherapy has been used to enhance recovery after orthopaedic surgery. Many devices are&#xD;
      available but few can guarantee a temperature regulation during a prolonged time and&#xD;
      therefore have been criticized. The arrival of new advanced cryotherapy devices made it&#xD;
      possible to test the effect of prolonged cooling on rehabilitation after arthroscopic&#xD;
      orthopaedic procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioids are most commonly administered for the treatment of pain and are among the most&#xD;
      prescribed drugs in the United States (US). Between 2003 and 2011, opioid prescriptions&#xD;
      increased from 149 million to 238 million [3,5,7,11]. In 2004, while constituting only 4.5%&#xD;
      of the world's population, the US consumed 99% of the global supply of hydrocodone [3,11].&#xD;
      These trends resulted in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognizing opioid&#xD;
      abuse as an epidemic [2,11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain management after orthopaedic arthroscopic procedures is mandatory regardless of the&#xD;
      surgical technique. Cold therapy (cryotherapy) has been widely used for many years in the&#xD;
      treatment of postoperative pain management in orthopaedic surgery and most studies have&#xD;
      reported better pain scores and reduced drug consumptions [1,6,8]. Cryotherapy involves&#xD;
      applying a cold device to the skin surrounding the injured soft tissues to reduce the&#xD;
      intraarticular temperature. It reduces local blood flow by vasoconstriction, which in turn&#xD;
      also reduces local inflammatory reaction, swelling, and heat experience. It also decreases&#xD;
      the conduction of nerve signals potentially reducing pain transmission [14,15]. Several&#xD;
      cryotherapy options are available: first generation cold therapy like crushed ice in a&#xD;
      plastic bag, cold or gel packs; second-generation cold therapy with circulating ice water&#xD;
      with or without compression; and third-generation advanced computer-assisted devices with&#xD;
      continuous controlled cold therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryotherapy is the standard of care in some countries and rarely is used in others [17].&#xD;
      Conflicting evidence regarding the value of this treatment from randomized trials may&#xD;
      contribute to that practice disparity [16]. Raynor et al [8] showed that cryotherapy has a&#xD;
      statistically significant benefit in postoperative pain control, while no improvement in&#xD;
      postoperative range of motion or drainage was found. Cryotherapy with compression units are&#xD;
      inexpensive, easy to use, have a high level of patient satisfaction, and are rarely&#xD;
      associated with adverse events. Raynor et al [8] concluded cryotherapy may be justified in&#xD;
      the postoperative management of knee surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative cryotherapy with compression was proposed as a method of reducing pain and the&#xD;
      inflammatory response in the early postoperative period after orthopaedic arthroscopic&#xD;
      procedures. Previous study results are equivocal. Kraeutler et al [12] reported that there&#xD;
      does not appear to be a significant benefit to use of cold compression over standard ice&#xD;
      wraps in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy for rotator cuff repair or subacromial&#xD;
      decompression. While Alfuth et al [13] concluded no recommendations can be made regarding the&#xD;
      question whether cold compression therapy or cold therapy should be preferred immediately&#xD;
      after arthroscopic surgery of the shoulder. Our goal is to analyze the analgesic efficacy of&#xD;
      cryotherapy after shoulder, knee, and hip arthroscopic procedures using the Game Ready ©&#xD;
      which is a second generation cryotherapy with compression system. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize this may decrease postoperative opioid usage as well as be more cost effective&#xD;
      when compared to first generation cryotherapy (ice packs without compression) for medical&#xD;
      healthcare systems.&#xD;
