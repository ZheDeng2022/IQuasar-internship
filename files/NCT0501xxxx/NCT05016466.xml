  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter observational prospective study in smokers or ex-smokers with&#xD;
      cumulative exposure ≥ 10 a / p (years / pack) with respiratory symptoms and presenting a&#xD;
      normal spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who sign the corresponding informed consent, will undergo a DLCO and will be&#xD;
      divided into two groups according to the result:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I. Patients with DLCO &lt;80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group II Patients with DLCO≥80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be followed for 5 years.&#xD;
