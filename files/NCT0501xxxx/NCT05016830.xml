  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective interventional study is expected to be conducted, to test a possible new&#xD;
      treatment for amblyopia (lazy eye syndrome). Bilateral transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) is a type of noninvasive brain stimulation, which may help in visual&#xD;
      function recovery of adult patients with amblyopia. This pilot study will test the&#xD;
      feasibility of said therapy, along with the short term effects of bilateral tDCS in visual&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

      Theoretical Framework: Ocular occlusion treatment has been used classically and with&#xD;
      excellent results for the treatment of amblyopia in those under 14 years of age, since in&#xD;
      this period it has been seen that there is greater neuroplasticity, leaving little to do in&#xD;
      the period of lower neuroplasticity, in young and adult patients with later diagnoses.&#xD;
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation therapy is an emergent technique used in neurological&#xD;
      diseases to increase neuroplasticity, by changing the resting potential of neurons. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the combination of tDCS and visual occlusion therapy is capable of&#xD;
      increasing visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and depth perception, in young people over 18&#xD;
      years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The application of a double-blind, randomized clinical trial is proposed to&#xD;
      evaluate the application of 2 different therapies: Occlusion with bilateral tDCS, and&#xD;
      Occlusion with tDCS sham (sham). The study subjects will be randomly assigned to a group, and&#xD;
      one session of stimulation will be performed. Data will be analyzed using Student's t test,&#xD;
      or Mann-Whitney test, according to the normal or non-normal distribution of the sample,&#xD;
      respectively. Also, the change over time of the variables will be measured using the&#xD;
      Conditional Change Model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results: The investigators expect that visual acuity, contrast vision, and dichoptic&#xD;
      vision in the Occlusion therapy group with bilateral tDCS will be significantly higher than&#xD;
      the Occlusion therapy group with tDCS sham (sham).&#xD;

    <masking_description>Both sham and bilateral transcranial direct current stimulation were applied with the same electrode configuration, but the functioning of the stimulation device was blinded to the patient, the care provider, and the researcher performing measurements. The operator of the stimulation device selected the stimulation protocol. Sham stimulation protocol consisted of current ramp and delivery of current for 30 seconds and 19 minutes and 30 seconds with no current delivery. Actual stimulation consisted of a current ramp and 20 minutes of current delivery. There were no visual cues allowing to differentiate sham and stimulation protocols.</masking_description>

    <description>Sham bilateral transcranial direct current stimulation consisted of 2 milliamperes (mA) of current from the anodal electrode in the amblyopic primary visual cortex to the cathodal electrode located in the fellow primary visual cortex, but the stimulation was turned off after 30 seconds. On Sham Stimulation onset, the participant's fellow eye was occluded and the participant performed a reading task for 20 minutes.</description>
