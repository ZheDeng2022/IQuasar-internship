  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare peri implant tissue stability following connective tissue graft&#xD;
      harvested fromLateral Palate or the Tuberosity Area. As far as we know, it remains&#xD;
      controversial whether peri-implant soft tissue stability could be achieved after soft tissue&#xD;
      augmentation with the connective tissue graft from the tuberosity or the lateral palate. Soft&#xD;
      tissue stability evaluated by intra oral scanner will be described as primary outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ridge resorption is a common finding after tooth extraction. Recently, there is an increasing&#xD;
      concern about this issue during implant-supported reconstruction in the esthetic zone.&#xD;
      Although the previous studies supports the guided bone regeneration procedures for&#xD;
      reconstruction of contour deficiencies, the replacement of the mineralized materials with the&#xD;
      bone has been questioned. Therefore, recently, using connective tissue grafts instead of&#xD;
      allogenic or xenogenic materials has been addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The palate is routinely used as the donor site for harvesting the connective tissue graft.&#xD;
      The graft can be harvested by de-epithelialized method or it can be harvested conventionally&#xD;
      from deep palate during flap elevation. Another choice for harvesting the connective tissue&#xD;
      graft is the tuberosity area, which can be used when you need small to moderate amount of&#xD;
      soft tissue (around 1-2 implants). The connective tissues harvested from these sites have&#xD;
      quite different characteristics, which might influence on the fate of the treatment in terms&#xD;
      of the stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      therefore, we decided to compare the stability of the grafts harvested from the deep palate&#xD;
      or tuberosity.&#xD;
