      The primary hypothesis to be tested is whether or not there is a difference in time to&#xD;
      sustained alleviation of all targeted COVID-19 signs and symptoms through Day 28 between&#xD;
      PF-07321332/ritonavir and placebo.&#xD;

      Throughout the study period, provision will be made to allow study visits to be conducted at&#xD;
      a participant's home or at another non-clinic location, if available. The total study&#xD;
      duration is up to 24 weeks.&#xD;
