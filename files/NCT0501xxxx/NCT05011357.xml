    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine how vasopressors affect a measure of how&#xD;
      intravenous fluid is administered in people undergoing surgery who have low blood pressure&#xD;
      called Pulse Pressure Variability (PPV). This study will recruit human subjects to undergo&#xD;
      simulated hypovolemia called Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP) and will receive&#xD;
      phenylephrine and placebo, while PPV will be measured in both conditions. This research will&#xD;
      help anesthesiologists learn more about how to use PPV in patients undergoing surgery and who&#xD;
      need vasopressors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative fluid administration is a very important issue in modern anesthesia practice.&#xD;
      Overzealous intraoperative administration of fluids can lead to cardiac overload thus&#xD;
      potentially causing significant morbidity. It has been demonstrated that over 50% of&#xD;
      perioperative complications are tied to intraoperative fluid administration and that changing&#xD;
      intraoperative fluid management alone has significant positive benefit. Pulse pressure&#xD;
      variation (PPV), which quantifies the respiratory variation in beat-to-beat arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure, is viewed as a reliable method to assess volume status. Increasing PPV indicates&#xD;
      hypovolemia, and a decreasing PPV indicates progression towards euvolemia. However, there are&#xD;
      many commonly encountered intraoperative conditions that may make these interpretations of&#xD;
      PPV problematic. For example it is commonly accepted in the perioperative community that PPV&#xD;
      is interpretable in patients without vasopressor infusion since there is little consensus to&#xD;
      the effects of vasopressor therapy on PPV. Hence the proposed study seeks to characterize the&#xD;
      PPV response during simulated hypovolemia with and without infusion of phenylephrine, which&#xD;
      acts on alpha-1 receptors to increase systemic vascular resistance, and hence blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a patient under general anesthesia, a PPV cut-off of 13% indicates a positive response to&#xD;
      fluid administration. However, this cut-off was based on studies that used a wide variety of&#xD;
      vasopressor agents with different mechanisms. Furthermore, it is unclear how effective the&#xD;
      current threshold is at predicting fluid responsiveness when vasopressors are added during&#xD;
      the same operation (i.e. a PPV of 13% without vasopressors likely represents different&#xD;
      physiologic conditions compared to a PPV of 13% with vasopressors in the same operation).&#xD;
      Hence, understanding how vasopressors such as phenylephrine change PPV and the PPV threshold&#xD;
      is very important and represents an important knowledge gap in the practice of anesthesia.&#xD;
