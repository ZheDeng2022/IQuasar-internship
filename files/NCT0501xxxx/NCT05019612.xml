  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a prevalent disease in women of procreative age. Most endometriosis patients&#xD;
      are affected in their daily life by complaints such as chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea,&#xD;
      infertility, or pain during sexual intercourse. Yet, its etiology is poorly understood.&#xD;
      Although laparoscopy is well known as the gold standard for treating endometriosis, 20-30% of&#xD;
      treated women still show persistent complaints following successful laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been widely recognized that expectations profoundly affect treatment courses and&#xD;
      outcomes in many different health conditions. Additionally, evidence suggests that optimizing&#xD;
      preoperative expectations can improve post-operative outcomes such as disability and return&#xD;
      to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate whether expectations also affect treatment&#xD;
      course and outcome in women after endometriosis surgery. For this purpose, the investigators&#xD;
      conduct a mixed-method observational cohort study to gather data on psychological factors,&#xD;
      particularly treatment and symptom-related expectations, as well as complaints and well-being&#xD;
      of patients after surgery. A sample of N = 300 women will be asked pre- and postoperatively&#xD;
      to evaluate these psychological factors and indicators of treatment course and outcome.&#xD;
      Overall, the study will last 12 months, including one assessment preoperatively (baseline),&#xD;
      seven monthly assessments postoperatively, and a follow-up assessment 12 months after&#xD;
      endometriosis surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to determine potential interactions between aforementioned psychological&#xD;
      factors, their influence on the postoperative health, and the long- and short-term symptom&#xD;
      course of patients with endometriosis. The study results will provide a better understanding&#xD;
      of the symptom- and treatment course in women with endometriosis and subsequently supply&#xD;
      clinical approaches to optimize treatment of endometriosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the evidence-based S2-treatment guidelines for endometriosis, laparoscopy is the&#xD;
      method of choice to remove endometriosis and is associated with considerable symptom&#xD;
      improvement. However, 20-30% of treated women (so-called non-responders) still report&#xD;
      symptoms and impairments after surgery; this is not explainable by laparoscopy itself or a&#xD;
      recurrence of endometriosis. Relevant psychosocial predictors are higher age and pain&#xD;
      catastrophization, though both only explain a small amount of persistent symptoms and&#xD;
      impairments. This indicates a potential role of other psychological factors influencing&#xD;
      treatment outcome, such as expectations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence for this assumption is provided by placebo-response rates of 30% in women who had a&#xD;
      sham endometriosis surgery and even reported symptom improvements after diagnostic (sham)&#xD;
      laparoscopy. Concerning other gynaecological settings, research already implies that&#xD;
      expectations have a remarkable impact on treatment outcome and quality of life in women with&#xD;
      breast cancer. Likewise, the role of expectations could be important for the optimal&#xD;
      treatment of endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is no study examining the role of expectations on treatment outcomes in women&#xD;
      with endometriosis to date. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of expectations&#xD;
      and other psychological factors on complaints and well-being of patients after surgery in&#xD;
      women with endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study, a sample of 300 women will report pre- and postoperatively about their&#xD;
      treatment and symptom expectations, health condition, and other psychological factors that&#xD;
      may influence treatment course and outcome after endometriosis surgery. Overall, this&#xD;
      monitoring will last 12 months, including one assessment preoperatively (baseline), seven&#xD;
      monthly assessments postoperatively, and a follow-up assessment 12 months after endometriosis&#xD;
      surgery. All assessments will be conducted online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the scope of an embedded qualitative study, a partial sample of 20 to 30 women will be&#xD;
      interviewed preoperatively and postoperatively about their treatment and symptom&#xD;
      expectations, fears, and concerns regarding the laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Above that, a second partial sample of 20 women will report on seven consecutive days about&#xD;
      their current health condition, and treatment and symptom expectations in their everyday life&#xD;
      using ambulatory assessment (smartphone-based measurements).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, the investigators are interested in the treatment course and outcome and its&#xD;
      possible changes over a period of six months after endometriosis surgery. Secondly, the role&#xD;
      of pre- and post-operative expectations for treatment course and outcome for women with&#xD;
      endometriosis should be determined. Besides expectations, the investigators will finally&#xD;
      examine further potential psychological and social predictors for treatment outcome, e.g.,&#xD;
      prior treatment experiences, state anxiety, depression, pain catastrophization and&#xD;
      demographics, in order to optimize endometriosis therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the embedded qualitative study, the investigators explore and categorize the&#xD;
      mentioned treatment- and symptom-related expectations concerning endometriosis surgery&#xD;
      (laparoscopy) and psychological factors that potentially improve or harm women's treatment&#xD;
      outcome and health condition. The ambulatory assessment offers a monitoring of patients'&#xD;
      symptom course in their daily lives and the determination of potential modulators&#xD;
