  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study evaluating the effects of early intensive vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation compared to standard of care vitamin D supplementation on bone health over an&#xD;
      18 month period.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label study designed to evaluate the effect of high dose vitamin D&#xD;
      versus standard of care vitamin D supplementation on bone health and arthralgias. The&#xD;
      randomization will be stratified by hormone receptor status (positive versus negative). The&#xD;
      primary objective is to compare the effect of high dose vitamin D to the current standard&#xD;
      vitamin D treatment administration algorithm on bone health, as measured by percent change&#xD;
      from baseline in bone mineral density (g/cm2), in young women with non-metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer who receive systemic therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject must meet all of the following applicable inclusion criteria to participate in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health&#xD;
             information. NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or&#xD;
             obtained separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age; 45 years at the time of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Histological or cytological confirmation of breast cancer clinical or pathologic&#xD;
             stages 0-III&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has been recommended to initiate systemic therapy for breast cancer. It is&#xD;
             preferable for patient to enroll prior to systemic therapy initiation. However,&#xD;
             enrollment will be allowed if systemic therapy has been initiated within 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to enrollment (randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Patients who undergo only surgery and/or radiotherapy alone would not qualify&#xD;
             for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Systemic therapy for breast cancer is planned&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. As determined by the enrolling physician, ability of the subject to understand and&#xD;
             comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Previous vitamin D supplementation allowed, as long as patient is agreeable to stop&#xD;
             previous dosing at the time of trial enrollment, to comply with trial procedures&#xD;
             including a baseline 25(OH)D level, and is otherwise determined to be appropriate for&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects meeting any of the criteria below may not participate in the study:&#xD;

             Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients will undergo breast surgery and/or radiotherapy alone without planned&#xD;
             neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant anti-cancer drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;

             function laboratories (estradiol, FSH) consistent with menopause (if any of two values&#xD;
             outside of menopausal range and subject had menses within 12 months, subject would be&#xD;
             considered perimenopausal or premenopausal and therefore eligible for enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnancy or lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of bone disease, including Paget's bone disease or osteomalacia&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Concurrent or prior treatment with bisphosphonates&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Use of oral corticosteroids within the last 30 days prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Concurrent treatment for thyroid deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. BMI &lt;18.5&#xD;

             tuberculosis during breast cancer treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. History of another primary cancer that required systemic treatment within the last 5&#xD;
             years&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any of the following kidney diseases at the time of randomization: active chronic&#xD;
             kidney disease &gt;/= stage 3, history of kidney stones, sarcoidosis&#xD;
