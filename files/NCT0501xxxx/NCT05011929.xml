  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep problem in children and adolescents and it has been&#xD;
      found to predict the development of mental health problems in young adulthood. Cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been found to be effective in both adults and&#xD;
      adolescents. However, limited accessibility and availability of the treatment has only&#xD;
      benefited a small proportion of insomnia patients. Therefore, digital CBT-I has been promoted&#xD;
      as an alternative way to manage individual's insomnia problems with adequate efficacy.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, one of the major limitations of the online self-help intervention is the&#xD;
      relatively high drop-out rate and lower compliance compared to the face-to-face modality&#xD;
      which the interactive component is less practical in the online intervention. Therefore, the&#xD;
      objectives of current study are 1) evaluate the efficacy of mobile-APP based CBT-I in&#xD;
      treating youth insomnia, 2) evaluate whether the provision of additional support could&#xD;
      further enhance the treatment outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>The mobile-APP based CBT-I consists of 6 weekly session. The treatment is structured and based on the well-established CBT elements for treating insomnia. The treatment components in the CBT-I aim to address the behavioural, cognitive and physiological perpetuating factor of insomnia and include: psycho-education about sleep and sleep hygiene, stimulus control, sleep restriction, relaxation training, structured worry time, cognitive restructuring (targeting sleep-related dysfunctional cognitions), and relapse prevention. reminders and individualized feedback regarding the behavioral strategies will be sent to the participant every week.</description>
