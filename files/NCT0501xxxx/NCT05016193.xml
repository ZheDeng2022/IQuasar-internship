    <textblock>
      The Axem Home study is a randomized open label trial analyzing the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      coupling the Axem Home prototype device with exercise to improve motor recovery following a&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Axem Home study is a randomized, open label, phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety&#xD;
      and feasibility of coupling feedback to participants on their levels of sensorimotor brain&#xD;
      activity (via the Axem Home prototype device) with exercise rehabilitation. 15 participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled in each arm of the study. Both groups will participate in an exercise&#xD;
      program, but only one group (the intervention group) will receive the Axem Home prototype&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be evaluated at baseline, after 3 weeks, and after 6 weeks (upon the&#xD;
      completion of their time in the Early Supported Discharge program). Evaluators will be&#xD;
      blinded as to which group participants are in. The study is constructed with randomization to&#xD;
      remove selection and allocation biases.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) of Motor Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 3, and post-intervention (after study completion, an average of week 6)</time_frame>
    <description>A stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index. The FMA is designed to assess motor functioning, sensation, balance, joint range of motion and joint pain in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. Sub-scales include: upper extremity (0-36), wrist (0-10), hand (0-14), coordination/speed (0-6) (which can be combined to form a total motor function score out of 66), and sensation (0-4). Higher scores indicate better performance.</description>

    <measure>Change in Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 3, and post-intervention (after study completion, an average of week 6)</time_frame>
    <description>The ARAT assesses arm function to determine the quality of the arm movement, and the limitation of activity. The ARAT consists of 4 sub-tests; that examines and individual's grip, grasp, pinch and gross motor movement in order to determine upper extremity function. Objects of varying size, shape, and weight must be either grasped, handled or moved in a specific task in order to evaluate function. Low scores mean worse function with the minimum possible score being 0 and the highest possible score being 57 (normal function).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 3, and post-intervention (after study completion, an average of week 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Stroke-specific, self-report, health status measure. Assesses multiple domains on a 5-point Likert scale.

An extra question asks that the patient rate on a scale from 0 - 100 how much they feel that he/she has recovered from his/her stroke. The 4 physical domains (strength, hand function, mobility and activities of daily living) can be summed together to create a single, physical dimension score (28-140) while all other domains should remain separate. Higher scores indicate better function.</description>
