  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emerging adult sexual minorities (EASM) are vulnerable to stressors that increase risk for&#xD;
      suicidal ideation and behaviors. The investigators will examine a mobile application that&#xD;
      leverages skills coaching and peer mentoring to reduce suicide risk for EASM. The online life&#xD;
      skills intervention (iREACH) was developed to reduce a variety of negative health outcomes&#xD;
      using telehealth with peer mentors. In Supporting Transitions to Adulthood and Reducing&#xD;
      Suicide (STARS), investigators' interdisciplinary team will adapt iREACH to reduce suicidal&#xD;
      ideation and behaviors among EASM. Then, investigators will pilot test STARS using in a&#xD;
      racially/ethnically diverse sample of EASM with suicidal ideation. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive an in-person brief, evidence-based safety planning protocol or to&#xD;
      receive safety planning plus access to STARS. This project will identify the potential&#xD;
      clinical utility of STARS for suicide prevention in a vulnerable, marginalized, population to&#xD;
      inform a future larger efficacy RCT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Investigators will use the ADAPT-ITT framework to adapt a life skills intervention to&#xD;
      increase the desire to live and reduce suicide ideation among at-risk emerging adult sexual&#xD;
      minorities. STARS will embed components of the Safety Plan Intervention as well as modules&#xD;
      focused on promoting coping with discrimination, social support, and positive affect.&#xD;
      Investigators will pilot test STARS using a Type 1 Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid Design&#xD;
      in a racially/ethnically diverse sample of 60 EASM who report past-month suicidal ideation.&#xD;
      Investigators will recruit EASM through social media advertising and invite them to an&#xD;
      in-person screening. Eligible participants will provide informed consent and complete a&#xD;
      Safety Planning Intervention with a licensed clinician, given the high-risk nature of the&#xD;
      sample. They then will be randomized to the control condition (&quot;CC&quot;, n = 30) or STARS (n =&#xD;
      30). Participants will be assessed at 2, 4, and 6 months. Primary outcomes will be&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy outcomes of suicidal ideation and behavior and hypothesized mechanisms&#xD;
      of change (improved coping with discrimination, social support, positive affect) to estimate&#xD;
      critical parameters for a future trial. Secondary outcomes will be RE-AIM framework&#xD;
      indicators (reach, adoption, implementation, maintenance). Our aims are: Aim 1: To conduct a&#xD;
      systematic suicide prevention adaptation of a life skills intervention (STARS) that&#xD;
      incorporates safety planning content and targets coping, social support, and positive affect&#xD;
      using the ADAPT-ITT framework. Aim 2: To examine preliminary efficacy (suicidal ideation and&#xD;
      behaviors) and mechanisms of action of STARS, relative to our control condition (safety&#xD;
      planning protocol alone), using a prospective RCT design. Aim 3: Using RE-AIM metrics, to&#xD;
      examine whether STARS has preliminary evidence for impacting intervention implementation&#xD;
      outcomes among EASM compared to the control arm.&#xD;

    <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale is an interview-rated measure that will be completed by a blind independent evaluator. The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale includes a measure of suicidal ideation (range 0-5: higher scores indicate more severe ideation) and intensity (range 0-4: higher scores greater ideation severity), and suicidal behavior (count of total number of actual, interrupted, and aborted attempts). The measure has strong psychometric properties, including inter-rater reliability and internal consistency. The suicidal behavior and the suicidal ideation subscales have been shown to predict future suicidal behavior.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Support from parents and friends, respectively, will be measured through the Procidano and Heller Perceived Social Support from Friends and from Family Scale. This five-item emotional support scale is rated on a 5-point scale (1=Not True; 5=Very True), where higher scores indicate greater social support. The measure has strong convergent and divergent validity, as well a strong test-retest reliability and internal consistency.</description>
