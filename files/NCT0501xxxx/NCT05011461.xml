  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this experiment is to analyze wrinkle severity, the skin barrier and facial&#xD;
      pigmentation level after topical almond oil application, compared to the use of topical&#xD;
      retinol. Both the almond oil and the 0.5% topical retinol studied is investigational.&#xD;

      The natural cosmetic market is a multi-billion-dollar industry. Nutraceuticals and foodbased&#xD;
      cosmetics are a growing trend within dermatology. Almonds are a rich dietary source of a&#xD;
      range of fatty acids, phytochemical polyphenols, and antioxidants [1]. The previous study&#xD;
      done by Dr. Raja Sivamani was a double blinded study that compared oral almond intake to a&#xD;
      calorie matched non-nut-based intake over 24 weeks.The study determined that that there was a&#xD;
      statistically significant improvement in wrinkle severity and pigment intensity in the women&#xD;
      that received almond supplementation. This proposal aims to now understand how the topical&#xD;
      application of almond oil may influence the appearance of wrinkles and facial tone in&#xD;
      post-menopausal women. Almond oil is rich in fatty acids and alpha-tocopherol [2]. Tocopherol&#xD;
      inhibits melanogenesis in melanocytes [3] and topical alpha tocopherol has been shown to&#xD;
      improve skin antioxidants and hyperpigmentation [4, 5].&#xD;

    <description>Facial wrinkles will be assessed with the use of a validated high resolution facial modeling system. The high-resolution facial modeling system will be performed with the 3D Clarity ProÂ® Facial Modeling and Analysis System (Brigh-Tex BioPhotonics, San Jose, CA) and will specifically assess for wrinkle severity and wrinkle length as was performed in the previous pilot study.</description>

    <measure>Appearance of facial color tone and evenness</measure>
    <time_frame>24-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The facial color tone and evenness will be measured with a SkinColor Catch from Delfin Technologies. This device shows the RGB Colors, CIE L*a*b* and L*c*h* color space coordinates when the devivce is applied to the skin. Included is the link to the device (http://www.truesystem.co.kr/product/pdf/SkinColorCatch%20Brochure%202016.pdf).</description>

    <measure>Appearance of facial redness</measure>
    <time_frame>24-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will quantify the presence of facial redness with a SkinColor Catch from Delfin Technologies. We will measure the RGB colors and average them from each participant for each of the visits. Skin pigment, including the presence of redness, will be measured using a SkinColorCatch from Delfin Technologies . This device shows the RGB Colors, CIE L*a*b* and L*c*h* color space coordinates when the devivce is applied to the skin. Included is the link to the device (http://www.truesystem.co.kr/product/pdf/SkinColorCatch%20Brochure%202016.pdf).</description>

    <measure>Subjective tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>24-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess tolerability, we are going to use a Tolerability Assessment Questionnaire. The patient fills out the questionnaire on whether they currently have or had any itching, burning, stining, scaling, erythema, hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation during application of the product. They measure any of the symptoms on a scale of 0-3, 0 being none, 3 being severe. They can also hand write any other effects that they noticed from the study.</description>

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those with a nut allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smoking is an independent risk factor and serves as a confounder for the development&#xD;
             of facial wrinkles and photoaging [14]. Therefore, current smokers, those that have&#xD;
             smoked within the past year, and former smokers with greater than a 20-pack year&#xD;
             history of smoking will be excluded.&#xD;

             deficiency in collagen production (such as Ehlers-Danlos syndromes) will be excluded&#xD;
             as this can be a confounder for facial wrinkles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those who have undergone any cosmetic procedures to the face in the 4 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment in the opinion of the investigator. People that have undergone deeper&#xD;
             chemical peels (TCA based peels) within 1 year prior to enrollment will also not be&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;

             known to modulate collagen and pigment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Retinoids such as tretinoin, adapalene, retinol, except as provided by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Antioxidant ingredients such as vitamin C or vitamin E.&#xD;
