  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The world-wide rising obesity rates are a major health problem. Therefore, people&#xD;
      should moderate food intake. A lower eating rate will decrease the energy intake. The eating&#xD;
      rate of foods can be modified by changing the texture without affecting their acceptability.&#xD;
      Harder, chunkier, more viscous, and more voluminous foods will decrease the eating rate and&#xD;
      thus energy intake. However, the impact of texture on oral processing has mostly been studied&#xD;
      as a model or single food system, whereas a diet consists of many different food products&#xD;
      often consumed in combination. Little has been researched on the effect of food texture on&#xD;
      eating rate within the context of realistic meals. It is not known if the eating rate of a&#xD;
      meal is determined by the eating rate component with the lowest eating rate or if there is an&#xD;
      additive effect of the eating rates of all components of the meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of the ESPA study is to determine how the eating rate of a pasta meal can&#xD;
      be changed by manipulating the hardness of the ingredients and to investigate if the eating&#xD;
      rate of a meal is determined by the eating rate of the component with the lowest eating rate&#xD;
      or if there is an additive effect of the eating rates of all components of the meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study is a randomized crossover trial. All participants receive all pasta&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy adults (n=50) between 18-55 years old with European nationality,&#xD;
      and a BMI between 18.5-30 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants will attend three test sessions during lunch in which in total&#xD;
      twelve pasta samples will be consumed. The pasta samples will consists of individual or&#xD;
      combined pasta noodles, vegetables, and sauce differing in hardness. The order of the samples&#xD;
      will be randomized. After the consumption of the test samples, the participants will rate&#xD;
      their appetite and the sensory characteristics of the samples. During the test sessions,&#xD;
      participants will be video recorded to determine their eating behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study outcome is the eating rate (g/min). Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are the oral processing characteristics assessed with the video recordings (meal&#xD;
      duration [min], bite duration [min], number of bites, number of chews, average bite size [g],&#xD;
      average amount of chews per bite, and oral sensory exposure time [min]) and sensory&#xD;
      characteristics rated on a visual analogue scale (liking [flavor, texture, and overall],&#xD;
      flavor intensity, sweetness, saltiness, sourness, hardness, and chewiness).&#xD;

      The study has a randomized crossover design with three test sessions. All participants&#xD;
      receive twelve pasta samples (four per test session) and are their own control (within&#xD;
      subject effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants attend three test sessions during which they eat four pasta samples. The pasta&#xD;
      samples will have a fixed amount and differ in pasta noodle and vegetable hardness. Eight&#xD;
      pasta samples will consist out of only penne or carrots with or without sauce. Four pasta&#xD;
      samples will consist out of penne, carrots, and sauce. The sample order will be randomized,&#xD;
      but in each test session only one or two of sample 9 to 12 will be served. The samples will&#xD;
      be served on a plate together with a fork.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout study period :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No use of drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication use + illness should be reported&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evening preceding test day:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Not allowed to eat or drink after 22.00 except for water&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morning of test day:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not perform intensive exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eat the same breakfast at the same time each test day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If wanted, eat the same morning snack at the same time each test day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not allowed to eat or drink two hours prior the study session except for water&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a negative corona test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lunch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give instructions (eat as you normally would do, eat the whole sample without taking&#xD;
           breaks or sips of water in between, you can take a new bite before you swallowed the&#xD;
           previous one)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seated at sensory booth with fork, knife, spoon, 200 mL of water and three pieces of a&#xD;
           plain cracker&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Question about food consumption that morning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Appetite questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eat the pasta sample (one of twelve conditions) while recording eating behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensory questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Appetite questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taste neutralization by waiting for two minutes, taking sip of water and bite of cracker&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat * ... * until four pasta samples are consumed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Appetite questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from Wageningen and surroundings using an e-mailing list,&#xD;
      social media, and flyers. Healthy (self-report), normal weight (18.5-30 kg/m2) men and women&#xD;
      between 18-55 years old will be included. Participants need to have European nationality, and&#xD;
      have to be able to understand and speak English (self-report), because of the sensory&#xD;
      questionnaire and appetite questionnaire which will be in English and have difficult direct&#xD;
      translations to Dutch. As 90% of the people that show interest in the study are university&#xD;
      students this should not be a problem. The BMI range is based on the average BMI in the&#xD;
      Netherlands, which is 25 kg/m2 but around 50% of the Dutch population is overweight. To be&#xD;
      able to include sufficient subjects it was therefore chosen to widen the BMI range and&#xD;
      include people up to a BMI of 30 kg/m2. Due to the within subject design this will not&#xD;
      influence the outcome of the study, but results will be more generalizable to people with an&#xD;
      average weight.&#xD;
