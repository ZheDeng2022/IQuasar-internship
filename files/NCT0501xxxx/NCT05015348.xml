  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hyperlipidemia will be allocated into intervention or control group randomly.&#xD;
      Participants of intervention group will be provided with Omega-3 PUFA, while participants of&#xD;
      control group will be provided with placebo which looked same as the drug of intervention&#xD;
      group. During the study, all participants can have nutritional counseling and education for&#xD;
      low-fat diet. The lipids, inflammatory factors, weight, and body composition will be assessed&#xD;
      and recorded before, at the middle, and end of the study.&#xD;
