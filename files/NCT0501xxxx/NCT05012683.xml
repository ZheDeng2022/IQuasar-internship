  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will allow us to assess whether the Point Partial confers functional and&#xD;
      psychological benefit to persons with partial finger amputations in an unconstrained&#xD;
      environment. The use of the Point Partial outside of the laboratory will allow for a wider&#xD;
      variety of uses and for a more realistic simulation of the product being used in the field.&#xD;
      This well-controlled trial (without randomization of subjects) will produce the first Level&#xD;
      II-1 medical evidence in our field of partial hand prosthetic design as described by the 1989&#xD;
      U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Furthermore, this study will provide important data to&#xD;
      support providers who are requesting reimbursement from payers.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 0: no prosthesis (pre-fitting)</time_frame>
    <description>Capacity Assessment of Prosthetic Performance for the Upper Limb (CAPPFUL) provides a comprehensive, performance based measure for upper limb prosthetic use with any upper-limb functional prosthesis at any amputation level through assessment of commonplace activities that take place in various planes of movement. Scale Title: Overall Performance. Scale Minimum: 0. Scale Maximum: 100. Higher score indicates better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 0: no prosthesis (pre-fitting)</time_frame>
    <description>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire is a 30-item questionnaire that looks at the ability of a patient to perform certain upper extremity activities. This questionnaire is a self-report questionnaire that patients can rate difficulty and interference with daily life on a 5 point Likert scale. Scale Title: DASH Score. Scale Minimum: 0.
