  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have moderate crowding will be treated in this study. The efficacy of showing&#xD;
      the predicted alignment of patient's teeth at the end of orthodontic treatment previously to&#xD;
      treatment on their expectations from orthodontic treatment and their satisfaction with their&#xD;
      teeth alignment will be assessed.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that most patients expect that orthodontic treatment will improve their&#xD;
      appearance which increases their confidence and self-esteem level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to approach patient's expectations to reality is crucial to making them&#xD;
      reasonable and to improve patient's satisfaction with treatment outcomes.&#xD;
