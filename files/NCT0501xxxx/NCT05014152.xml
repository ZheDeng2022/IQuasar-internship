  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the accuracy and safety of the &quot;QOCA Disposable Body&#xD;
      Temperature Patch&quot; (Q-temp-w1).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Q-temp-w1 is a contact type body temperature patch developed by Quanta Computer Co., Ltd. It&#xD;
      is mainly used to measure the body temperature of the human body. It can be used for general&#xD;
      body temperature measurement, home temperature measurement records and medical tracking. Both&#xD;
      the European Union and the US FDA state that the clinical test methods of the temperature&#xD;
      patch must comply with ISO 80601-2-56. Therefore, this test plan will follow the ISO&#xD;
      80601-2-56 criteria to evaluate the accuracy of the temperature patch and follow it. The&#xD;
      sampling age range and the fever/non-fever ratio are stratified, and clinical efficacy&#xD;
      analysis is performed based on the measurement results. The main evaluation indicators&#xD;
      include clinical bias, limits of agreement, and clinical repeatability.&#xD;

    <description>This study is specially designed according to its age range and customized/non-customized range, and meets the requirements of ISO 80601-2-56 test population (table). Comply with the age range and population requirements of ISO 80601-2-56, as well as clinical and subject trials, including news to the population over five years old, and hopefuls must account for at least 30% of the total and less than 50% of the total.&#xD;
Each subject uses Q-temp-w1 to measure axillary temperature and obtains 3 temperature values, and at the same time uses a reference body temperature patch (Omron thermometer MC-171W) to measure the other side axillary temperature, and 1 is measured Temperature value data. Perform clinical efficacy analysis based on the measurement results. The main evaluation indicators of the trial include clinical bias, limits of agreement, and clinical repeatability.</description>
