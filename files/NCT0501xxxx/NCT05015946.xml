  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm pilot study aims to investigate the feasibility of a handball-based&#xD;
      intervention to people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, including monitoring aerobic&#xD;
      intensities and movement strategies during the intervention, and monitoring recruitment,&#xD;
      adherence, and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the study aims to investigate the feasibility of a test battery including both&#xD;
      physiological and patient-reported outcomes, and to investigate preliminary exercise effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity and exercise are known to be beneficial for increasing insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      in skeletal muscle in healthy as well as in individuals with type 2 diabetes. But many&#xD;
      patients who recently have been diagnosed with type-2 diabetes is often living a sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle and have poor adherence to physical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High intensity interval training as well as team-based interventions has proven to be&#xD;
      effectful in regulation of physiological parameters related to type 2 diabetes. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate the feasibility of a handball-based intervention to people&#xD;
      diagnosed with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
