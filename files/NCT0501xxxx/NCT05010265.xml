      This study aims to develop an ethical approach to developing and deploying novel&#xD;
      neurotechnologies to aid in the detection of consciousness and prediction of recovery after&#xD;
      brain injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies of patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) have suggested that&#xD;
      conscious patients may be misdiagnosed as unconscious up to 40% of the time when traditional&#xD;
      qualitative bedside examination is used (Schnakers et al. 2009, Van Erp et al. 2015, Fins and&#xD;
      Bernat 2018). Given the well-established prognostic relevance of early behavioral recovery of&#xD;
      consciousness for long-term functional outcomes (Giacino and Kalmar 1997, Giacino 2004,&#xD;
      Portaccio et al. 2018, Faugeras et al. 2018, Pincherle et al. 2019), whether or not a patient&#xD;
      is considered to be conscious is often the primary determinant of whether life-sustaining&#xD;
      therapy is continued and neurorehabilitation is offered. Recent advances in neuroimaging and&#xD;
      electrophysiologic neurotechnologies, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
      and electroencephalography (EEG), have yielded novel methods to aid in detecting and&#xD;
      predicting emergence of consciousness in patients with brain injuries. Despite these&#xD;
      unprecedented research advances, little is known about ethical concerns surrounding these&#xD;
      novel neurotechnologies, about the phenomenological, ontological and ethical valence of&#xD;
      conscious states of being without behaving revealed through their lens, or about the&#xD;
      attitudes of clinicians, researchers, patients and caregivers regarding their responsible&#xD;
      implementation. This study aims to fill these crucial knowledge gaps and to support the&#xD;
      development of an evidence-based strategy for ensuring responsible research and translation&#xD;
      of novel neurotechnologies to aid in the detection of consciousness and prediction of&#xD;
      recovery after brain injury.&#xD;
