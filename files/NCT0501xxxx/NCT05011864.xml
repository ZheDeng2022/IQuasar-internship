  <brief_summary>

      This study will test clinical and cost effectiveness of an integrated tele- and&#xD;
      bachelor's-level counselor/coach delivered behavioral activation (BA) and fall prevention&#xD;
      (FP) for low-income homebound older adults. The long-term objective of the proposed study is&#xD;
      to improve access to depression treatment and fall prevention for growing numbers of&#xD;
      low-income homebound seniors. We plan to recruit 320 low-income, racially diverse homebound&#xD;
      seniors who are served by a home-delivered meal (HDM) program and other aging-service&#xD;
      agencies in Central Texas. In a 4-arm, pragmatic clinical trial with randomization prior to&#xD;
      consent, the participants in the integrated Tele-BA and FP (TBF hereafter) arm will receive 5&#xD;
      Tele-BA sessions and 4 in-home FP sessions. Those in the Tele-BA or FP alone arms will&#xD;
      receive the respective intervention and 4 bimonthly telephone check-in (booster) calls, and&#xD;
      those in the Attention Control (AC) arm will receive 5 weekly telephone check-in calls&#xD;
      followed by 4 bimonthly follow-up calls. Follow-up assessments will be at 12, 24, and 36&#xD;
      weeks after baseline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression and falls are significantly higher in low-income, racially diverse homebound&#xD;
      seniors than in the general older-adult population; however, the existing systems of care are&#xD;
      not equipped to address disparities in mental health and fall prevention services for these&#xD;
      vulnerable older adults. The long-term objective of the proposed study is to improve access&#xD;
      to depression treatment and fall prevention for growing numbers of low-income homebound&#xD;
      seniors. Specific aims are to compare clinical and cost effectiveness of integrated&#xD;
      tele-delivered behavioral activation (Tele-BA) and fall prevention (FP) by bachelor's-level&#xD;
      lay counselors/coaches to Tele-BA or FP alone and attention control (AC). The current and&#xD;
      projected shortages of licensed clinicians and the costs of deploying highly trained&#xD;
      professionals pose barriers to providing services to older adults in general and low-income&#xD;
      homebound seniors in particular. A more scalable option is to utilize lay counselors/coaches,&#xD;
      and our recent clinical trial (1R01MD009675) and a FP pilot study show that lay&#xD;
      counselors/coaches are as effective as licensed clinicians. The study participants will be&#xD;
      320 low-income, racially diverse homebound seniors who are served by a home-delivered meal&#xD;
      (HDM) program and other aging-service agencies in Central Texas. The lay counselors/coaches&#xD;
      will be co-located in the HDM program for seamless referral and care coordination. In a&#xD;
      4-arm, pragmatic clinical trial with randomization prior to consent (a preferred public&#xD;
      health approach), the participants in the integrated Tele-BA and FP (TBF hereafter) arm will&#xD;
      receive 5 Tele-BA sessions and 4 in-home FP sessions. Those in the Tele-BA or FP alone arms&#xD;
      will receive the respective intervention and 4 bimonthly telephone check-in (booster) calls,&#xD;
      and those in the AC arm will receive 5 weekly telephone check-in calls followed by 4&#xD;
      bimonthly follow-up calls. Study hypotheses are: At 12, 24, and 36 weeks after baseline, (1)&#xD;
      TBF will be more effective than Tele-BA or FP alone, and Tele-BA or FP alone will be more&#xD;
      effective than AC in reducing depression (the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression),&#xD;
      falls, and fall injuries; (2) TBF than Tele-BA alone or FP alone will be more effective in&#xD;
      reducing disability (WHODAS 2.0) and healthcare and social service use; and (3) TBF will be&#xD;
      more cost effective than Tele-BA alone or FP alone. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) will be&#xD;
      based on depression free days, prevented falls, and health-related quality adjusted life-year&#xD;
      measured by EuroQol-5 (EQ-5D). We will also conduct budget impact analysis (BIA) of TBF&#xD;
      relative to Tele-BA or FP. Both CEA and BIA will employ a hybrid public program perspective&#xD;
      of the Administration for Community Living and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Public&#xD;
      health significance of this study is that it will provide empirical data needed for&#xD;
      real-world adoption of an intervention delivery model that targets to intervene for the two&#xD;
      most frequent sources of disability acceleration and healthcare use among a rapidly growing,&#xD;
      underserved population. (We use the terms older adults and seniors interchangeably because&#xD;
      the latter term is frequently used in aging services.)&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In a pragmatic RCT design with randomization prior to consent rather than the traditional consent-to-randomization design, we will follow six steps in recruitment, enrollment, and intervention delivery: 1) identification of potential participants by case managers / social workers during in-home or telephone assessments and referral to the research team; 2) randomization into TBF (combined Tele-behavioral activation and fall prevention), Tele-BA, FP, and Attention Control (AC: telephone support calls) arms by the research team; 3) calling each person for consent for telephone eligibility screening; 4) conducting in-depth, in-home screening and baseline assessment for eligible, consenting seniors; 5) delivering TBF, Tele-BA alone, FP alone, or AC; and 6) conducting follow-up assessments.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In BA, depressive symptoms are viewed as depressive behaviors. Compared to those without depression, people with depression engage in fewer overt behaviors that provide positive reinforcement and pleasure/enjoyment and in more behaviors that function to escape or avoid aversive stimuli (e.g., staying in bed all day).55-59 Thus, BA is aimed at increasing and reinforcing meaningful, healthy, and enjoyable behaviors while decreasing depressive behaviors and is well-suited to help depressed, disabled older adults increase mood-enhancing activities, self-care management skills, and social connectedness.</description>
