  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In terms of the surgical treatment of the cartilage injury, various techniques and ways are&#xD;
      created to repair or regenerate articular surface of synovial joint following traumatic&#xD;
      damage or degeneration of the cartilage. The option for surgical treatments based on the size&#xD;
      and depth of the cartilage knee injury may include knee debridement, radiofrequency,&#xD;
      drilling, microfracture, mosaicplasty, allogenic osteochondral transplantation and autologous&#xD;
      chondrocyte transplantation. The first two techniques mentioned have been used in treating&#xD;
      the cartilage knee injury involving the partial defects meanwhile the latter techniques have&#xD;
      been used for Grade III and IV cartilage defects based on ICRS. However, most of the surgical&#xD;
      options up only provide more of Type I collagen rather than Type II collagen. The available&#xD;
      treatments are more symptomatic rather than preventive or regenerative. Stem cell has big&#xD;
      potential in this area where it has ability to differentiate to cartilage. As allogeneic&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood MSCs are readily available and can be administered immediately, this&#xD;
      study therefore aims to prove the efficacy of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells (UC-MSCs) for treating large defects knee injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective, randomized controlled, open label, phase IIb clinical trial,&#xD;
      involving 50 patients with large defects of cartilage injury for follow-up duration of 24&#xD;
      months. Patients will be assigned into 2 arms; Arm A - 25 subjects will receive&#xD;
      Chondrocell-EX (UC-MSCs) and Arm B - 25 subject will receive marrow cellution. All patients&#xD;
      will undergo debridement prior to receiving their assigned treatment. The patients will be&#xD;
      assessed on KOOS, IKDC, VAS and MRI.&#xD;
