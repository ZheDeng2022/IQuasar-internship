      Establish a clinical diagnosis and treatment and long-term follow-up database of preterm&#xD;
      infants, and analyze the effects of prenatal factors (including genetic characteristics,&#xD;
      maternal diseases, etc.), postnatal diagnosis and treatment measures and family maintenance&#xD;
      environment after discharge on preterm infant mortality and major diseases in the near and&#xD;
      long term.&#xD;

      As an increasing large group, the long-term quality of life and health status of preterm&#xD;
      infants have become a very important public health problem in China. This cohort study is a&#xD;
      single center clinical cohort study. By collecting the clinical diagnosis, treatment and&#xD;
      follow-up data of preterm infants admitted to the neonatal department of our hospital for 3&#xD;
      consecutive years (about 1200 cases), and following them for 18 years, a relatively complete&#xD;
      resource database for the long-term health and development of preterm infants is established.&#xD;
      The effects of perinatal factors, diagnosis and treatment methods and family rearing&#xD;
      environment on the survival rate, neurointelligence development, chronic metabolic diseases&#xD;
      and respiratory diseases of preterm infants were analyzed. It provides a basis for further&#xD;
      improving the diagnosis and treatment plan, exploring potential therapeutic targets and&#xD;
      establishing prediction models.&#xD;
