  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)&#xD;
      a global pandemic. Ontario has confirmed more than 547,000 cases of COVID-19 since testing&#xD;
      began. For many of these patients, symptoms resolve within 4 weeks of onset. However, it is&#xD;
      becoming apparent that a significant number of individuals are experiencing symptoms that&#xD;
      persist long after the acute infection, known as Long COVID. These individuals have a wide&#xD;
      constellation of presenting symptoms, often varying from initial presentation. For this&#xD;
      study, we will be enrolling individuals receiving care at The Ottawa Hospital for Long COVID.&#xD;
      This study aims to determine the following four things: 1) will adding electronic case&#xD;
      management improve quality of life three months after coming to hospital with Long COVID; 2)&#xD;
      is the electronic case management platform cost effective; 3) is there any factors that&#xD;
      predict outcomes at 3 months; 4) to determine how a personalized rehabilitation program&#xD;
      supported by a digital platform could be implemented for individuals with Long COVID. We will&#xD;
      enroll individuals from The Ottawa Hospital who will then be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      either usual care or usual care plus electronic case management, through a platform called&#xD;
      NexJ Connected Wellness. Participants will also complete questionnaires every 4 weeks for 3&#xD;
      months. We will be looking at quality of life, mental and physical health, cognitive&#xD;
      symptoms, fatigue and pain.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment. Participants randomized to the control arm will be offered assessment by a clinician, guided by the WHO Post COVID-19 case report form. This is a clinical tool developed by WHO to guide and document the sequelae of COVID-19 and to ensure that clinical and rehabilitation needs are identified.&#xD;
Investigation. Clinician judgement will be used to decide on further testing needed for clinical care.&#xD;
Management. Control participants will receive a rehabilitation plan developed with their health professional that will be implemented in the eight weeks after their initial consultation (baseline visit). The implementation will involve face to face or virtual care from a registered health professional provided by the clinic or research staff. This may be a combination of, but not limited to, occupational therapy, physical therapy and/or social work/counselling. The frequency of treatment visits will depend on the individual treatment plan after assessment.</description>
