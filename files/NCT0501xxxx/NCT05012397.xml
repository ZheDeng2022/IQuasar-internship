  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm, open-label basket study designed to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of milademetan in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors refractory or&#xD;
      intolerant to standard-of-care therapy that exhibit wild-type (WT) TP53 and MDM2 copy number&#xD;
      (CN) ≥ 12 using prespecified biomarker criteria.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 65 patients will be enrolled to receive milademetan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive the study drug until reaching unequivocal disease progression (per&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version [v]1.1), as determined by the&#xD;
      Investigator; experiencing unmanageable toxicity; or until other treatment discontinuation&#xD;
      criteria are met. Patients may be treated beyond tumor progression if they are experiencing&#xD;
      clinical benefit based on the assessment of the Investigator in discussion with the Medical&#xD;
      Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed for documentation of disease progression and survival&#xD;
      information (i.e., date and cause of death). Long-term follow-up will continue every 8 weeks&#xD;
      (± 7 days) until the endpoint of death, the patient is lost to follow-up, or for 24 months&#xD;
      following the final dose of the study drug, whichever comes first.&#xD;
