  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV2 is responsible for a pandemic that has been evolving for approximately 18 months.&#xD;
      The virus' capacity for dissemination and its virulence are responsible for significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. The initial lack of knowledge of the pathogen and of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology underlying the potential severity of the disease, particularly in the&#xD;
      respiratory tract, led to numerous therapeutic attempts in this emergency context, centered&#xD;
      on the control of an obviously exaggerated inflammatory response. A large number of studies&#xD;
      remained of insufficient quality to lead to relevant and applicable conclusions. Secondly,&#xD;
      the benefit of corticosteroid therapy has been demonstrated in two trials. Although&#xD;
      Dexamethasone remains the only corticosteroid to improve survival, these results have&#xD;
      reinforced the hypothesis of the interest of treatments reducing the inflammatory response,&#xD;
      particularly cytokine. The widespread use, in the absence of scientific data, of&#xD;
      interleukin-6 receptor inhibitors (Sarilumab and Tocilizumab) has been structured around&#xD;
      studies whose results remain uncertain to this day because of the heterogeneity of the&#xD;
      population treated and the results observed. A possible survival benefit seems to emerge for&#xD;
      resuscitation patients who have not yet required invasive ventilation, the other situations&#xD;
      being probably associated with the absence of effect or even the potential danger of this&#xD;
      treatment. Tocilizumab is notably associated in the literature with the risk of secondary&#xD;
      infections and mucosal healing abnormalities, favoring bleeding complications and digestive&#xD;
      perforations. The objective of this study is to evaluate the risk of digestive complications&#xD;
      (hemorrhage, perforation, diverticulitis) and infectious complications related to the use of&#xD;
      Tocilizumab according to the severity of the patients.&#xD;
