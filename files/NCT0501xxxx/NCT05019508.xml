      This is a prospective cohort study to assess the predictive value of fetal cardiac&#xD;
      parameters, the change in fetal cardiac parameters (CFP), HbA1c, and/or the change in HbA1c&#xD;
      (ΔHbA1c) for gestational diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the onset of carbohydrate intolerance that affects up&#xD;
      to 6-9% of pregnancies. A diagnosis of GDM conveys numerous implications for the health of&#xD;
      the mother and the fetus if not properly identified and/or treated. Maternal complications&#xD;
      include increased risk of preeclampsia and development of Type 2 diabetes mellitus later in&#xD;
      life. The risks to the fetus include increased risk of macrosomia, stillbirth, hypoglycemia,&#xD;
      shoulder dystocia as well as increased risk of childhood obesity and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per ACOG guidelines, women who are at an increased risk for undiagnosed pre-gestational&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus or developing GDM should receive early screening when they initially&#xD;
      present for prenatal care, most commonly in the late first or early second trimester.5 The&#xD;
      best test for this early assessment is not yet established. Practices patterns vary between&#xD;
      use of the two-step oral glucose tolerance screening and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Use of&#xD;
      the oral glucose tolerance tests for screening of GDM is well-established and the cut-offs&#xD;
      determined for 24-28 week routine screening are used when the oral tolerance tests are&#xD;
      administered in early pregnancy. An HbA1c level ≥6.5% is used to diagnose diabetes, however&#xD;
      there is evidence that there is a higher rate of GDM diagnosis and poor outcomes with a HbA1c&#xD;
      level as low as 5.6%. Women who are not diagnosed with GDM before 20 weeks, go on to routine&#xD;
      screening at 24-28 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the current protocols for early GDM screening, treatment of early glucose intolerance&#xD;
      has not shown to improve neonatal outcomes, however. The methods and timing of current early&#xD;
      GDM screening may not be identifying a population that is truly at risk of poor outcomes from&#xD;
      glucose intolerance in the way routine screening with the two-step process does. More&#xD;
      research into screening paradigms other than oral tolerance tests in early pregnancy is&#xD;
      needed. A HbA1c level assesses the amount glycation of hemoglobin molecules in red blood&#xD;
      cells, indirectly estimating the average blood glucose level over the past 8-12 weeks. HbA1c&#xD;
      independently has not been shown to be adequately predictive of a GDM diagnosis in pregnancy.&#xD;
      Many studies assessing the screening value of HbA1c obtain the value in the first trimester&#xD;
      when a large portion of the 12 weeks prior is before significant placentation. A change in&#xD;
      HbA1c in the first half of pregnancy, when combined with other clinical variables may be more&#xD;
      predictive. Novel clinical variables should also be considered. There is evidence that even&#xD;
      well-control pre-gestational and gestational diabetics show significant variation in fetal&#xD;
      cardiac functional parameters such as interventricular septum thickness (IVS), the E/A ratio,&#xD;
      and myocardial performance index (MPI). The predictive value of these changes for glucose&#xD;
      intolerance has not yet been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is be a prospective cohort study to assess the predictive value of fetal cardiac&#xD;
      parameters, the change in fetal cardiac parameters (CFP), HbA1c, and/or the change in HbA1c&#xD;
      (ΔHbA1c) for gestational diabetes.&#xD;

    <description>High risk women screened with HbA1c at initiation of prenatal care who were not diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus or Early GDM.&#xD;
These women will have Fetal Cardiac Function Parameters at their 20 week anatomy scan (E/A ratio, IVS, MPI). At their 24-28 week routine GDM screening, we will repeat the HbA1c and will repeat the E/A ratio, IVS, MPI. If women have a growth scan for any reason between 32 and 36 weeks, E/A ratio, IVS, and MPI will be repeated at those times.</description>
