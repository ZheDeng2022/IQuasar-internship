    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of a new combination of&#xD;
      drugs, ZEN003694, cisplatin, and etoposide in treating patients with NUT carcinoma (phase I),&#xD;
      and identifies whether this combination therapy works to shrink tumor in these patients&#xD;
      (phase II). Another purpose of this study is to see whether there are any changes in&#xD;
      patient's tumor or blood characteristics (e.g. genes, molecules, etc.) due to combination&#xD;
      therapy. ZEN003694 inhibits the production of certain growth-promoting proteins and may&#xD;
      prevent proliferation of tumor cells that use those proteins for their growth. Chemotherapy&#xD;
      drugs, such as etoposide and cisplatin, work by stopping or slowing the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells. Combination therapy with ZEN003694, etoposide and cisplatin may be effective in&#xD;
      treating patients with NUT carcinoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the&#xD;
      combination of BET bromodomain inhibitor ZEN-3694 (ZEN003694) with etoposide and cisplatin&#xD;
      (EP) in patients with NUT Carcinoma (NC). (Phase 1) II. Evaluate the overall objective&#xD;
      response rate (ORR) of the triplet combination in participants utilizing response evaluation&#xD;
      criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria. (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the preliminary progression-free survival (PFS) rate, ORR, duration of response&#xD;
      (DoR), and overall survival (OS) rate of the triplet combination in participants utilizing&#xD;
      RECIST version 1.1 criteria. (Phase 1) II. Determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of&#xD;
      ZEN003694 and etoposide when administered in the triplet combination. (Phase 1) III. Further&#xD;
      evaluate the PFS, DoR, and OS rates of the triplet in participants with NC using RECIST&#xD;
      version 1.1 criteria. (Phase 2) IV. Confirm the safety and tolerability of the regimen in&#xD;
      this patient population. (Phase 2) V. Evaluate the preliminary PFS rate, ORR, DoR, and the OS&#xD;
      rate of ZEN003694 monotherapy in a small exploratory cohort of patients with non-thoracic&#xD;
      origin, non-BRD4-NUT NC. (Phase 2) VI. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase 1,&#xD;
      phase 2, non-thoracic, non-BRD4 exploratory cohort) VII. Explore potential biomarker&#xD;
      indicators of response and resistance in tumor tissue samples. (Phase 1, phase 2,&#xD;
      non-thoracic, non-BRD4 exploratory cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To perform molecular profiling assays on malignant and normal tissues, including, but&#xD;
      not limited to, whole exome sequencing (WES) and messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing&#xD;
      (RNAseq), in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIIIa. identify potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers beyond any genomic alteration&#xD;
      by which treatment may be assigned (Phase 1, phase 2, non-thoracic, non-BRD4 exploratory&#xD;
      cohort), and VIIIb. identify resistance mechanisms using genomic DNA- and RNA-based&#xD;
      assessment platforms. (Phase 1, phase 2, non-thoracic, non-BRD4 exploratory cohort) IX. To&#xD;
      contribute genetic analysis data from de-identified biospecimens to Genomic Data Commons&#xD;
      (GDC), a well annotated cancer molecular and clinical data repository, for current and future&#xD;
      research; specimens will be annotated with key clinical data, including presentation,&#xD;
      diagnosis, staging, summary treatment, and if possible, outcome. (Phase 1, phase 2,&#xD;
      non-thoracic, non-BRD4 exploratory cohort) X. To bank formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded&#xD;
      (FFPE) tissue, blood (for cell-free DNA analysis), and nucleic acids obtained from patients&#xD;
      at the NCI Early-Phase and Experimental Clinical Trials Biospecimen Bank (EET Biobank) at&#xD;
      Nationwide Children's Hospital. (Phase 1, phase 2, non-thoracic, non-BRD4 exploratory cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose escalation study of ZEN003694 with fixed dose etoposide and&#xD;
      cisplatin followed by a phase 2 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ZEN003694 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14 during dose escalation&#xD;
      and dose expansion cohort or PO QD on days 1-21 for the non-thoracic, non-BRD4 exploratory&#xD;
      cohort. All patients may receive ZEN003694 PO QD on days 1-21 starting cycle 5 at the&#xD;
      discretion of treating investigator. Patients also receive etoposide intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      60 minutes on days 1-3 for cycles 1-4 or up to 8 cycles, and cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1 of cycles 1-4 or up to 8 cycles. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days after the last dose&#xD;
      and then for a maximum of 2 years.&#xD;

             potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational&#xD;
             regimen are eligible for treatment in the phase 1 portion, but not in the phase 2 or&#xD;
             non-thoracic, non-BRD4 exploratory cohort. Participants enrolling to the phase 2 or&#xD;
             non-thoracic, non-BRD4 exploratory cohort with a history of prior malignancy are&#xD;

             non-melanoma skin cancers that have been curatively treated; participants with&#xD;
             adequately treated carcinomas in situ of any type; or participants who were diagnosed&#xD;
             and curatively treated at least 3 years prior to the date of study entry and who are&#xD;
             considered by the treating investigator to be at low risk for recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE 1, PHASE 2, AND NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: The effects of&#xD;
             ZEN003694 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because the&#xD;
             chemotherapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier&#xD;
             method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of&#xD;
             study participation and for 4 months after completion of study therapy. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating&#xD;
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or&#xD;
             enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the&#xD;
             study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of study&#xD;
             therapy. For female subjects of child-bearing potentially receiving ZEN003694,&#xD;
             hormonal means of birth control alone, such as oral, injectable, dermal, subdermal or&#xD;
             topical contraceptives are NOT acceptable forms of birth control given that their&#xD;
             efficacy has not been evaluated when given in combination with the investigational&#xD;
             drugs. &quot;Adequate contraception&quot; is defined as the following: Contraceptive methods&#xD;
             with a failure rate of =&lt; 1% used in combination with the barrier method. The&#xD;
             following contraceptive methods are acceptable to use in combination with the barrier&#xD;
             method: intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine system (IUS), or oral contraceptive&#xD;
             pills (OCPs) that meet the &lt; 1% failure rate as stated in the product label. Note:&#xD;
             Hormonal IUDs/OCPs may only be used if the following criteria are met: male condoms&#xD;
             are required AND subjects are informed of the potential for reduced systemic hormone&#xD;
             levels from the IUD/OCP when taking ZEN003694. Alternatively, male partner&#xD;
             sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the female&#xD;
             subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject.&#xD;
             For this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the&#xD;
             investigator's/designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the&#xD;
             subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview&#xD;
             with the subject or from the subject's medical records. Male subjects with female&#xD;
             partners of child-bearing potential must use one of the following contraceptive&#xD;
             methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condom use PLUS partner use of a highly effective contraceptive (=&lt; 1% rate of&#xD;
                  failure per year) such as intrauterine device or system, or hormonal birth&#xD;
                  control such as contraceptive subdermal implant, combined estrogen and&#xD;
                  progestogen oral contraceptive, injectable progestogen, contraceptive vaginal&#xD;
                  ring, or percutaneous contraceptive patches.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE 1, PHASE 2, AND NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: Male subjects should&#xD;
             not donate sperm while on study and for 16 weeks after the last dose of study&#xD;
             medication. Male subjects whose partners are or become pregnant must continue to use&#xD;
             condoms for 16 weeks after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE 1, PHASE 2, AND NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: Ability to understand&#xD;
             and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document (or parent or legally&#xD;
             authorized representative if minor). Participants with impaired decision-making&#xD;
             capacity (IDMC) who have a legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family&#xD;
             member available may be eligible after discussion with the Principal Investigator of&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE 1, PHASE 2, AND NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: Women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE 1, PHASE 2, AND NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: Participants who have&#xD;
             not had cytotoxic chemotherapy, oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) or small molecule&#xD;
             therapy, or immunotherapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication&#xD;
             or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter. There is no required washout for previous EP&#xD;
             therapy. Patients may have had a maximum of 2 prior cycles of EP. There is no required&#xD;
             washout for previous ZEN003694 therapy for patients enrolling to the dose escalation&#xD;
             or phase 2 portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE 1, PHASE 2, AND NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: Participants who have&#xD;
             received prior radiation therapy can be enrolled at least 1 week after completing&#xD;
             radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE 1, PHASE 2, AND NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: Participants who have&#xD;
             had major surgery can be enrolled at least 3 weeks after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE 1, PHASE 2, AND NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: Any therapy-related&#xD;
             toxicities must have resolved to =&lt; grade 1 or baseline (with the exception of&#xD;
             alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, or rash that will be permitted at =&lt; grade 2). Other&#xD;
             grade 2 toxicities attributed to prior treatment may be permitted with agreement from&#xD;
             the overall principal investigator if they are toxicities not commonly attributed to&#xD;
             ZEN003694. Toxicities attributed to current EP therapy are excluded from this&#xD;
             requirement for participants enrolling to the dose escalation or phase 2 portion of&#xD;
             the study, as long as the participant meets all other eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: Participants must lack BRD4-NUT&#xD;
             rearrangement as identified via FISH testing performed at the BWH CAMD or by&#xD;
             confirmation of a specific non-BRD4-NUT rearrangement by a next-generation sequencing&#xD;
             (NGS) assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: Patients who have had a bone-targeted&#xD;

             than diagnostic surgery, dental surgery or stenting more than 3 weeks prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of ZEN003694.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE 1, PHASE 2, AND NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: Participants with&#xD;
             known untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with a history of&#xD;
             treated CNS metastases are eligible, provided they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiologically stable for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Disease outside the CNS is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recovery from acute toxicity associated with the treatment to =&lt; Common&#xD;
                  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 1 or baseline (with the&#xD;
                  exception of alopecia), with no requirement for escalating doses of&#xD;
                  corticosteroids over the past 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects currently taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (EIAC) must be&#xD;
                  transitioned to non-enzyme inducing anticonvulsants at least 14 days or 5&#xD;
                  half-lives prior to the first dose of study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No presence of symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal metastases or spinal cord&#xD;
                  compression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE 1, PHASE 2, AND NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: History of allergic&#xD;
             reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to&#xD;
             ZEN003694 or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE 1, PHASE 2, AND NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: Uncontrolled&#xD;
             intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: ongoing or active infection&#xD;
             requiring systemic treatment, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements. Patients with myocardial infarction or&#xD;
             unstable angina within 6 months prior to the first dose of ZEN003694 will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE 1, PHASE 2, AND NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: Any gastrointestinal&#xD;
             (GI) disorder that may affect absorption of ZEN003694 and other oral medications in&#xD;
             the opinion of the treating investigator, such as malabsorption syndrome or major&#xD;
             bowel or stomach resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE 1, PHASE 2, AND NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: Patients who are&#xD;
             receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE 1, PHASE 2, AND NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: Patients receiving&#xD;
             any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are&#xD;
             ineligible. Strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 must be discontinued at least 7&#xD;
             days prior to the first dose of ZEN003694. Because the lists of these agents are&#xD;
             constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical&#xD;
             reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be&#xD;
             counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE 1, PHASE 2, AND NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: Pregnant women are&#xD;
             excluded from this study because ZEN003694 is a BET inhibitor with the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             ZEN003694, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             ZEN003694. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE 1, PHASE 2, AND NON-THORACIC, NON-BRD4 EXPLORATORY COHORT: Patients receiving&#xD;
             therapeutic-dose anticoagulation (e.g., warfarin, low-molecular weight heparin [LMWH],&#xD;
             or novel oral anticoagulants) are not eligible. Use of oral Factor Xa inhibitors&#xD;
             (i.e., rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban otamixaban, letaxaban, eribaxaban)&#xD;
             and Factor IIa inhibitors (i.e., dabigatran) is not permitted. Prophylactic&#xD;
             anticoagulation, with low doses (per stan&#xD;
