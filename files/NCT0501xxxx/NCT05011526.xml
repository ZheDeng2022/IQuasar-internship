    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity and safety of MVC-COV1901 vaccine&#xD;
      compared to AZD1222 in heathy adults.&#xD;

      The primary objective of the study is to measure the anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody&#xD;
      titers in adult participants so as to demonstrate immunogenic superiority of MVC-COV1901 to&#xD;
      the active control, AZD1222 vaccine, in terms of the GMT ratio of neutralizing antibodies at&#xD;
      14 days after the second dose of study intervention. This study also assesses the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the study intervention and explores the immunogenicity in terms of anti-S IgG&#xD;
      as well as the potential efficacy of MVC-COV1901 in preventing COVID-19.&#xD;
