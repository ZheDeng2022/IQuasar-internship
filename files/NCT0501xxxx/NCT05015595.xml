    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric syndrome characterized by unwanted and&#xD;
      repetitive thoughts and repeated ritualistic compulsions aimed to decrease the distress.&#xD;
      Symptoms can cause severe distress and functional impairment. OCD affects 2-3% of the&#xD;
      population and is ranked within the ten leading neuropsychiatric causes of disability.&#xD;
      Dysfunction of the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuitry (CSTC) has been implicated in&#xD;
      OCD, including altered brain activation and connectivity. A complex dysregulation of&#xD;
      glutamatergic signaling within the cortico-striatal circuitry has been proposed in OCD. Data&#xD;
      obtained by several studies are suggesting of a reduced glutamatergic concentrations in the&#xD;
      anterior cingulate cortex, combined with overactivity of glutamatergic signaling in the&#xD;
      striatum and orbitofrontal cortex. A growing number of RCTs have assessed the utility of&#xD;
      different glutamate-modulating drugs as an augmentation or monotherapy in OCD, including&#xD;
      refractory patients. However, there are relevant variations in between studies in terms of&#xD;
      treatment-resistance, comorbidity, age and gender of the patients. At the present time four&#xD;
      RCTs are available on the efficacy of memantine as an augmentation medication for refractory&#xD;
      OCD patients. Investigators intend to conduce a double-blind, randomized, parallel group,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, monocentric trial to assess the efficacy and safety of memantine, a&#xD;
      low-to-moderate affinity noncompetitive NMDAR antagonist that is currently approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of Alzheimer disease, as an augmentative agent to a SSRI in treatment of patients&#xD;
      affected by severe refractory OCD. Study design consists of four distinct periods (52 weeks)&#xD;
      including memantine titration, neuropsychological assessment and follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severe and debilitating neuropsychiatric condition&#xD;
      that has an estimated lifetime prevalence of 2.5-3.0% of the general population.&#xD;
      Traditionally it is characterized by repetitive and intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and&#xD;
      repeated ritualistic behaviours (compulsions) performed from affected individual to decrease&#xD;
      the distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventionally OCD is driven by irrational beliefs (obsessions) considered as the product of&#xD;
      a cognitive bias (including overestimation of threat, increased personal responsibility and&#xD;
      thought-action fusion) and compulsions are rational avoidance response triggered by these&#xD;
      irrational beliefs, a coping mechanism which neutralize anxiety and reduce the likelihood&#xD;
      that fears will be realized. Recent data suggest that OCD is driven by a disruption in the&#xD;
      balance between habit learning system and goal directed system. The habit learning system&#xD;
      operates purely on the basis of historical information, whether or not actions were rewarded&#xD;
      in the past, it can lead to behavioural inflexibility and in isolation is not an optimal way&#xD;
      to make choices when faced with rapid changes in the environment; while goal directed system&#xD;
      exerts control over habits in light of new information, including changes in the desirability&#xD;
      of outcomes and changes to the contingency between actions and outcomes. Habits depend on&#xD;
      recurrent circuits that connect cerebral cortex to the basal ganglia, termed&#xD;
      cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuitry (CSTC) loops. In the CSTC model of OCD, these&#xD;
      loops become hyperactive or hyperconnected, self-exciting in a runaway positive feedback&#xD;
      loop. This leads to the urge to perform compulsions, which in turn consolidates/strengthens&#xD;
      the habit of performing compulsions, increasing the urge. Glutamate is the primary&#xD;
      neurotransmitter within the implicated in OCD CSTC. Glutamatergic neurotransmission has a&#xD;
      fundamental role for neuronal plasticity, learning, and memory. Excessive glutamate levels&#xD;
      could lead to glutamate receptor hyperactivity or even excitotoxicity in neurons. However, in&#xD;
      pathological conditions glutamate can act as a neuronal excitotoxin, leading to rapid or&#xD;
      delayed neurotoxicity. Dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling within the CSTC has been&#xD;
      proposed in OCD, with reduced glutamatergic concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex,&#xD;
      combined with overactivity of glutamatergic signaling in the striatum and orbitofrontal&#xD;
      cortex. Increased glutamate levels have been measured in cerebrospinal fluid of OCD patients&#xD;
      compared to healthy controls. Traditionally medications for OCD have targeted on serotonergic&#xD;
      pathways. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs); unfortunately, around 40% of patients with&#xD;
      OCD do not achieve remission of their symptoms with SRIs. Even when switching to another&#xD;
      selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor or clomipramine, or when an atypical antipsychotic is&#xD;
      added, the portion of refractory patients still remains around 30%. Refractoriness is defined&#xD;
      by the fail of almost three trials with different Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors&#xD;
      (SSRIs) at high dosages. In light of a possible role of glutamatergic signalling&#xD;
      dysregulation in the OCD it is possible found candidates for augmentation strategy of OCD's&#xD;
      therapy in glutamatergic drugs. This background has motivated interest in studying glutamate&#xD;
      modulators in patients who are unresponsive to standard pharmacotherapeutic approaches. In&#xD;
      particular, some studies using memantine and riluzole have been reported promising&#xD;
      suggestions of benefit. Other studies have explored the role of stimulants and nutritional&#xD;
      supplements such as inositol and N-acetylcysteine. Several clinical studies were conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of glutamate-modulating drugs in OCD, however they significant differ in&#xD;
      terms of treatment-resistance, comorbidity, age and gender of the patients. A recent review&#xD;
      on the argument conduced by Marinova et al concluded that memantine is the compound most&#xD;
      consistently showing a positive effect as an augmentation therapy in OCD. Moreover randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trials in clinical samples are necessary in order to draw definitive&#xD;
      conclusions on the utility of glutamate-modulating drugs in OCD. Identifying and confirming&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of new therapeutic approaches for the OCD could be very useful also&#xD;
      for improving disability and quality of life in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the present time four RCTs are available on the efficacy of memantine as an augmentation&#xD;
      medication for refractory OCD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to conduce a double-blind, randomized, parallel group,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, monocentric trial to assess the efficacy and safety of memantine, a&#xD;
      low-to-moderate affinity noncompetitive NMDAR antagonist that is currently approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of Alzheimer disease, as an augmentative agent to a SSRI in treatment of patients&#xD;
      affected by severe refractory OCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim of the study is to evaluate the minimum effective dose of memantine in this&#xD;
      patients and effects after drug withdrawal through follow up. The third aim is to&#xD;
      investigated the effect of memantine on patients without cognitive impairment an improvement&#xD;
      of cognitive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled, monocentric trial&#xD;
      will be conduce over 52 weeks at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Human&#xD;
      Neurosciences (Policlinico Umberto I, Rome). The study will be conducted in agreement with&#xD;
      the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent revisions. At the same time the study will be&#xD;
      subject to the ethics committee of Policlinic Umberto I of Rome. Written informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtain from all eligible participants following complete description of study&#xD;
      details. Participants will be informed regarding their freedom to withdraw from the trial&#xD;
      anytime without any negative effect on their therapy. The trial will be registered at the&#xD;
      Italian Registry of Clinical Trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutively the investigators will enroll patients who met the diagnostic criteria of&#xD;
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM 5) with criteria of&#xD;
      moderate to severe OCD and a Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score of &gt;21 were&#xD;
      selected to be in this study. Y-BOCS will be used to evaluate treatment efficacy. This is a&#xD;
      well-validated 10-item rating scale, which is widely used to measure the severity of OCD&#xD;
      symptoms. Participants were rated by Y-BOCS at baseline and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 months.&#xD;
      During the screening period, T4 and T6 follow-up visits all participants will undergo an&#xD;
      extensive neuropsychological evaluation. Speed processing by using the WAIS-IV Digit Symbol,&#xD;
      attention by means of the Trial Making Test and a computerized alertness and Go/no go task&#xD;
      memory by using the Digit and Corsi Span, a modified version of Corsi Block Tapping test, the&#xD;
      Story recall of Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test and a modified version of Babcock Story&#xD;
      recall test executive functions by means of Stroop Task, a modified version of Tower of&#xD;
      London and the Modified Five Point Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo controlled, monocentric trial in&#xD;
      subjects with OCD. The trial includes one active dose arm of Memantine and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of four distinct periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening: The screening period may last up to 4 weeks for each eligible patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thirty-two-week double-blind up-titration treatment period (from T0 to T4): After&#xD;
           screening, patients who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to one&#xD;
           of two arms (Memantine or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio. Following baseline assessments, each&#xD;
           patient will receive a daily administration of Memantine/placebo up to 20mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eight-week double-blind down-titration treatment period (from T4 to T5): At T4, the dose&#xD;
           of Memantine/placebo will be reduced at 10mg/day due to safety reasons before the end of&#xD;
           treatment (T5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up period (from T5 to T6): After the 40-week double-blind treatment period,&#xD;
           patients will be asked to come back for the follow-up visit (T6) 8 weeks after the end&#xD;
           of the treatment (T5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo and memantine tablets will be identical in shapes, colors, weight and scent. In&#xD;
      advance the investigators will prepared a random-number sequence that a computer-generated&#xD;
      for random group assignment. Treatment allocation will be concealed from patients and&#xD;
      physician will rated patients and from statistician. Separate individuals will be responsible&#xD;
      for randomization and rating patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators based the power calculation on previous study. Taking into account two&#xD;
      groups and seven measurement time points, the minimum sample size will be 20 (calculated with&#xD;
      G*Power 3.1).&#xD;
