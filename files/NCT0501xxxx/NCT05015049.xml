  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around one in ten women have high blood pressure in pregnancy. This is potentially serious,&#xD;
      with risks to the woman and her baby. Whilst maternal deaths from high blood pressure in&#xD;
      pregnancy are now rare in the UK, blood pressure problems in pregnancy still cause many&#xD;
      stillbirths and early births. Studies have shown that women of Black and Asian backgrounds&#xD;
      are more likely to have worse pregnancy outcomes when blood pressure problems in pregnancy&#xD;
      develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) describe the burden of disease of high blood pressure in pregnancy amongst babies admitted&#xD;
      to neonatal units on a national scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) investigate outcomes for babies born to women with high blood pressure in pregnancy&#xD;
      admitted to UK neonatal units across maternal ethnic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To complete this study, we will use the National Neonatal Research Database, which holds&#xD;
      population-level data for all babies admitted to neonatal units (where unwell babies receive&#xD;
      care) in the UK. We will look at records of babies admitted to neonatal units in England and&#xD;
      Wales between 2012 and 2020. The records will include information on over half a million&#xD;
      babies and their mothers. We will assess how many babies admitted to neonatal units were born&#xD;
      to women who had high blood pressure in pregnancy. We will report the outcomes of these&#xD;
      babies, and how they compare to babies born to women without high blood pressure in&#xD;
      pregnancy. We will analyse whether outcomes for babies born to women with high blood pressure&#xD;
      in pregnancy varies according to maternal ethnicity, and investigate what may be driving&#xD;
      differences we find.&#xD;

      Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quantify the proportion of all babies admitted to neonatal units born to women with a&#xD;
           hypertensive disorder of pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  describe the national neonatal morbidity, mortality and resource use of babies admitted&#xD;
           to neonatal units born to women with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  examine ethnic disparities in neonatal outcomes of babies admitted to neonatal units&#xD;
           born to women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NNRD is an approved research database constituting real-world prospective clinical data&#xD;
      extracted from point-of-care neonatal electronic health records with complete coverage of&#xD;
      infants admitted for neonatal care to National Health Service (NHS) neonatal units in England&#xD;
      and Wales (since 2012) and Scotland (since 2015). A defined data extract of approximately 450&#xD;
      items (the Neonatal Data Set) is transmitted quarterly to the Neonatal Data Analysis Unit at&#xD;
      Imperial College London for data linkage and cleaning prior to entry into the NNRD. To date,&#xD;
      the NNRD contains data for over a million babies (approximately 80,000 babies annually). High&#xD;
      completeness and accuracy (&gt;95%) of neonatal data held in the NNRD has been confirmed by&#xD;
      formal comparison with a multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a secondary analysis of an existing national electronic health record&#xD;
      population cohort using anonymised, routinely recorded clinical data from the National&#xD;
      Neonatal Research Database (NNRD). There will be no new patients recruited and there will be&#xD;
      no changes made to patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will work with NNRD data analysts to extract anonymised data from the NNRD.&#xD;
      A cohort of babies born to women with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP) will be&#xD;
      defined based on records of maternal medical problems prior to pregnancy, obstetrics problems&#xD;
      during pregnancy, medications given during labour and neonatal discharge diagnoses. The&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality and health resource use of this cohort will be described in depth. This&#xD;
      cohort will also be compared to a cohort of babies born to women without a hypertensive&#xD;
      disorder of pregnancy. The HDP cohort will also be stratified by maternal ethnicity to&#xD;
      investigate disparities in outcomes.&#xD;
