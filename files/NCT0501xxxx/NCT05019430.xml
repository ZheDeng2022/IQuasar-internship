  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine potently inhibits the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT). Increased synaptic 5-HT resulting&#xD;
      from this reuptake inhibition activates multiple 5-HT receptor subtypes. Some of these&#xD;
      receptor subtypes have been implicated in the abuse-related effects of cocaine, including its&#xD;
      primary reinforcing effects (i.e., cocaine taking behavior). 5-HT1b receptors, which are&#xD;
      autoreceptors on 5-HT nerve endings that regulate 5-HT release and heteroreceptors that also&#xD;
      mediate other neurotransmitter release, play a particularly important role in cocaine&#xD;
      effects, likely because they are highly expressed in the mesocorticolimbic system. The 5-HT1b&#xD;
      system displays profound dysregulation during both active cocaine use and abstinence. Initial&#xD;
      preclinical research showed that selective 5-HT1b agonists enhanced the reinforcing and&#xD;
      locomotor effects of cocaine during ongoing cocaine administration, but subsequent research&#xD;
      showed that these agents robustly attenuated reinstatement of cocaine- and cue-primed cocaine&#xD;
      seeking behavior. These findings have been replicated in rigorously conducted studies using&#xD;
      multiple schedules of reinforcement and negative sucrose reinforcement controls across&#xD;
      laboratories. Notably, though, these preclinical studies used compounds not approved for use&#xD;
      in humans, hindering translation. Recently published data show that zolmitriptan, a&#xD;
      commercially available selective 5-HT1b agonist migraine medication, also selectively&#xD;
      attenuates the reinforcing and other abuse-related effects of cocaine, regardless of stage of&#xD;
      use (i.e., ongoing or extinguished cocaine self-administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a robust preclinical literature supports the premise that 5-HT1b activation reduces&#xD;
      a number of cocaine-associated behaviors (e.g., self-administration, cocaine seeking), this&#xD;
      area remains unstudied in humans. The overarching goal of this project is to advance these&#xD;
      promising preclinical findings, specifically those with zolmitriptan, to a clinical&#xD;
      population, thereby demonstrating that the 5-HT1b system plays a key role in the effects of&#xD;
      cocaine in humans&#xD;
