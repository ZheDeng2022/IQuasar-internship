  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of the patient's experience is becoming increasingly important as a better&#xD;
      patient experience can improve the quality of the delivered health service. Patient-reported&#xD;
      experience measures (PREMs) are self-reported assessment tools provided by patients about&#xD;
      their experience during any health event. There are few PREMs's instruments in the field of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endoscopy, and none is specific for Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS). The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to develop a questionnaire to evaluate the experience of patients undergoing&#xD;
      EUS, identifying and prioritizing the factors related to the patient's experience. In order&#xD;
      of it, expected results are developing a valid tool of question to value patients experience&#xD;
      during EUS and, for ranking, it is iphotized that will be more correlation with patients's&#xD;
      and nurses's answer that clinicians's one. In literature is described that nurse's view and&#xD;
      patient's view are more similar especially in those aspects concerning empatics and&#xD;
      psychological aspects.&#xD;

      The study will consist of several phases: 1) Tool creation: a &quot;patient reported measure of&#xD;
      EUS&quot; (PREUS) questionnaire will be created based on literature review; 2) Face and Content&#xD;
      Validity: The PREUS tool will be submitted to 7 experts in the field (physicians, nurses,&#xD;
      psychologist, communication expert, patients' advocacy representative) for a two-round&#xD;
      evaluation and to &quot;expert&quot; patients who had already undergone EUS at least once. Content&#xD;
      Validity Index (CVI) will be calculated and questions with a CVI &lt; 0.70 will be excluded; 3)&#xD;
      Questionnaire Creation: Based on the results of phase 2, a modified &quot;PREUS&quot; tool will be then&#xD;
      evaluated by ranking the relevance of the identified questions in the previous phase (from 0&#xD;
      to 10) by 50 outpatients undergoing EUS and Cronbach's alpha will be calculated to determine&#xD;
      reliability; 4) Ranking: tool of phase 3 will be also evaluated by 6 physicians and 13 nurses&#xD;
      working in IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele endoscopy Unit to measure the agreement between&#xD;
      patients and health care professionals (HCPs) by the Spearman-Brown coefficients.&#xD;
