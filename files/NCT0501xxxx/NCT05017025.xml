      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of aurora A kinase inhibitor&#xD;
      LY3295668 when given together with osimertinib in patients with EGFR-mutant non-squamous&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic). Aurora A kinase inhibitor LY3295668 and osimertinib may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving aurora A kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor LY3295668 in combination with osimertinib may help control EGFR-mutant non-squamous&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and to establish the recommended phase II dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) of aurora A kinase inhibitor LY3295668 (LY3295668) given in combination with&#xD;
      osimertinib in patients with advanced EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To preliminarily assess efficacy of LY3295668 plus osimertinib in advanced EGFR-mutant&#xD;
      NSCLC who progressed on prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The co-primary endpoints&#xD;
      are progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months after treatment and best objective response&#xD;
      rate (BRR) within 6 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the objective response rate (ORR) with osimertinib LY3295668 combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the overall survival (OS) with osimertinib LY3295668 combination. III.&#xD;
      Determine the disease control rate (DCR) with osimertinib LY3295668 combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the safety and tolerability with osimertinib LY3295668 combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Explore the association of baseline genomic profiles (from tumor, germline&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA], and circulating tumor [ct]DNA) with clinical benefit in patients&#xD;
      treated with osimertinib LY3295668 combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore resistance mechanisms to osimertinib LY3295668 combination. III. Determine the&#xD;
      immunomodulatory effects of osimertinib LY3295668 combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and aurora A kinase inhibitor&#xD;
      LY3295668 PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 24 cycles (2&#xD;
      years) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 4&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;

             serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of starting of treatment. The patient must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception for a minimum of two weeks prior to receiving&#xD;
             study medication until 3 months after discontinuation of the study medication.&#xD;
             Acceptable methods of contraception include total and true sexual abstinence, hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives that are not prone to drug-drug interactions (IUS Levonorgestrel&#xD;
             Intra-Uterine System (Mirena), Medroxyprogesterone injections (Depo-Provera)),&#xD;
             copperbanded intra-uterine devices, and vasectomized partner. All hormonal methods of&#xD;
             contraception should be used in combination with the use of a condom by their sexual&#xD;
             male partner. Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not&#xD;
             surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or&#xD;
             complete hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without&#xD;
             an alternative medical cause). Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have&#xD;
             been amenorrheic for the past 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The&#xD;
             following age-specific requirements must also apply: Women &lt; 50 years old: they would&#xD;
             be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for the past 12 months or&#xD;
             more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments. The levels of luteinizing&#xD;
             hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) must also be in the postmenopausal&#xD;
             range (as per the institution). Women &gt;= 50 years old: they would be considered&#xD;
             post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for the past 12 months or more following&#xD;
             cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, or have had radiation-induced&#xD;
             oophorectomy with the last menses &gt; 1 year ago, or have had chemotherapy-induced&#xD;
             menopause with &gt; 1-year interval since last menses, or have had surgical sterilization&#xD;
             by either bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must use adequate contraception for the duration of the study and 3 months&#xD;
             after the last dose of study medication. Adequate contraception methods include: birth&#xD;
             control pills (e.g. combined oral contraceptive pill), barrier protection (e.g. condom&#xD;
             plus spermicide, cervical/vault cap or intrauterine device), and abstinence. Patients&#xD;
             should not father a child for 6 months after completion of the study medication.&#xD;
             Patients should refrain from donating sperm from the start of dosing until 6 months&#xD;
             after discontinuing the study medication. If male patients wish to father children&#xD;
             they should be advised to arrange for freezing of sperm samples prior to the start of&#xD;
             the study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants of childbearing potential who are sexually active and their partners must&#xD;
             agree to abstain from heterosexual activity or to use 2 forms of effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception. Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must use adequate contraception for the duration of the study&#xD;
             and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. Patients should not father a&#xD;
             child during the study or for 6 months after completion of study treatment. Patients&#xD;
             should refrain from donating sperm from the start of dosing until 6 months after&#xD;
             discontinuing the study treatment. Two contraception methods can be comprised of two&#xD;
             barrier methods, or a barrier method plus a hormonal method. See below for options:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acceptable non-hormonal birth control methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Total sexual abstinence ie, refrain from any form of sexual intercourse in&#xD;

                       for the total duration as described above. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar&#xD;
                       ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not&#xD;
                       acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Vasectomised sexual partner PLUS male condom. With participant assurance&#xD;
