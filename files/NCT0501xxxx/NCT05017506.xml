    <description>The Coronovirus Impact Scale was developed by Stoddard and Kaufman (2020) to assess the impact of Covid-19 on people. The scale consists of 12 questions. Questions 1-9 in the scale are in 4-point Likert type, 0. There is no change, 1. Mild, 2. Moderate and 3. Severe, and points are taken between 0-3 from these questions. The questions between 10 and 11 on the scale are in a 5-point Likert type and are scored between 0-4 (indicating that from mild symptoms to death). However, the number of first degree family members diagnosed with coronavirus in question 10 and the number of relatives or close friends diagnosed with coronavirus in question 11 are not taken into account in the scale. The 12th question of the scale is open-ended and determines the other aspects that the coronavirus epidemic affects life. A minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 35 are obtained from the scale, and as the score increases, the degree of exposure of people to the Corona virus increases.</description>
