    <textblock>
      A phase 1b, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, antigen-specific immune response and preliminary antitumor activity associated&#xD;
      with VB10.NEO administered in combination with atezolizumab, and to identify a RP2D for&#xD;
      VB10.NEO in combination with atezolizumab, in patients with locally advanced and metastatic&#xD;
      tumors that have progressed after at least 1 available standard therapy; or for whom standard&#xD;
      therapy has proven to be ineffective or intolerable, or is considered inappropriate; or for&#xD;
      whom a clinical trial of an investigational agent is a recognized standard of care (SOC).&#xD;
