  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will explore the reasons for the apparently lower proportion&#xD;
      of severe COVID-19 cases in many sub-Sahara African countries. Indeed, despite fragile health&#xD;
      care systems, the burden of COVID-19 on the African continent seems substantially lower than&#xD;
      initially feared. Many potential reasons for this discrepancy have been formulated: the&#xD;
      different population age structure, experience of African nations with previous pandemics,&#xD;
      warmer climate, and genetic preposition. However, another compelling hypothesis is that of&#xD;
      trained immunity by endemic pathogens, such as plasmodia. According to this hypothesis,&#xD;
      innate immune activation by endemic pathogens would prime a more robust initial innate immune&#xD;
      response to SARS-CoV-2 and could therefore protect against severe COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore this, the investigators propose conducting a case-control study in Kinshasa, in&#xD;
      the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Kinshasa is an area with mixed prevalence of&#xD;
      malaria and the area in DRC most affected by COVID-19. In this setting, the investigators&#xD;
      will compare cases of severe COVID-19 with controls that have non-severe COVID-19 and that&#xD;
      are matched for age, sex, and health zone. The aim is to compare pre-existing immunity&#xD;
      against malaria, both cellular and humoral between the two groups.&#xD;

        This case-control study will be conducted in the Republic of Congo in the city of Kinshasa,&#xD;
        the epicenter of COVID-19. Kinshasa is a malaria endemic area, the distribution of malaria&#xD;
        prevalence is lower in urban areas compared to peri-urban areas. Indeed, the city of&#xD;
        Kinshasa is structured in four health districts and sixteen hospitals, distributed in the&#xD;
        thirty-five Health Zones for the management of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study will consist of cases and controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cases will be severe COVID-19 cases that will consist of patients hospitalized and&#xD;
             recruited in COVID-19 Treatment Centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Controls will consist of asymptomatic or symptomatic cases without signs of severity.&#xD;
             For each case, two controls will be recruited after having been matched in terms of&#xD;
             age, gender and health zone of origin.&#xD;
