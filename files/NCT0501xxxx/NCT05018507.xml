  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe osteoarthritis of the knee is a condition associated with severe pain, disability and&#xD;
      a loss of independence. The most definitive method of surgical treatment for this condition&#xD;
      is total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Total knee arthroplasty aims to provide new metallic&#xD;
      bearing surfaces within the knee, in order to alleviate the major source of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although total knee arthroplasty is an established surgical treatment option, up to 20% of&#xD;
      patients may be dissatisfied with the outcome , and many prostheses fail over time, requiring&#xD;
      costly revision surgery. Current understanding suggests that soft tissue balancing has a&#xD;
      crucial role to play in the outcome of total knee arthroplasty. Instability after total knee&#xD;
      replacement is an important cause of failure. It is not clear what the normal collateral&#xD;
      ligament laxity should be. There is a paucity of current data on normal knee collateral&#xD;
      ligament laxity . Nevertheless, restoring this may improve patient satisfaction with TKA and&#xD;
      longevity. It appears that there is considerable variation between individuals, genders , and&#xD;
      ethnic groups , when it comes to &quot;normal&quot; laxity. However, much of the existing data relates&#xD;
      to healthy young volunteers , and it is not clear how this information should map against the&#xD;
      elderly osteoarthritic population who are most likely to be in need of TKA. Recent advances&#xD;
      in computer assisted navigation have provided surgeons with a more precise measure of knee&#xD;
      alignment , and knee laxity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthopaedic surgeons at New Cross Hospital have been utilising this technology to improve&#xD;
      intraoperative placement of total knee replacement implants since 2015. Computer navigation&#xD;
      is carried out using the Stryker Precision Navigation System. This system records kinematic&#xD;
      and static measurements of knee alignment and laxity in patients just prior to the&#xD;
      commencement of the total knee replacement procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By gathering and analysing data from this machine, on the degree of laxity in osteoarthritic&#xD;
      patients about to undergo TKA, I this study aims to gain a greater understanding of what can&#xD;
      be considered &quot;normal&quot; and whether there are significant differences between individuals, and&#xD;
      between ethnic populations in this regard. This will help future surgical decision making&#xD;
      about how tight or loose prosthetic knee replacements should be, based on individual&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
