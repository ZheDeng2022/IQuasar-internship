  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with disabilities often access rehabilitation services to improve their abilities to&#xD;
      participate in everyday activities. Goal-directed therapy is considered an important&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy to achieve outcomes that are meaningful to families. Not a lot is known&#xD;
      about the effects of goal setting on rehabilitation outcomes. Strategies to help children&#xD;
      participate in the goal-setting process are rarely used in clinical practice. The aim of this&#xD;
      project is to test the effects of a child-focussed goal-setting approach, Enhancing Child&#xD;
      Engagement in Goal Setting (ENGAGE), on therapy outcomes. The investigators are also&#xD;
      interested in service use and the cost vs. benefits of the ENGAGE approach compared to usual&#xD;
      practice. Children with neurodevelopmental disabilities aged 5-12 years old (n=96) who access&#xD;
      paediatric rehabilitation services at six rehabilitation sites will participate. Therapists&#xD;
      (n=24) at participating sites will be randomized into 1) the ENGAGE intervention group or 2)&#xD;
      the usual therapy practice control group. Children will participate in the ENGAGE approach to&#xD;
      goal setting or usual practice based on the allocation of their therapist. The investigators&#xD;
      will determine if the ENGAGE approach to goal setting affects child goal performance,&#xD;
      satisfaction with goal performance, functional abilities, participation, and parent and child&#xD;
      quality of life. The investigators will also evaluate differences in parent and child quality&#xD;
      of life in relation to parent costs (e.g., absenteeism, presenteeism, travel costs) and&#xD;
      compare amount of therapy time between the two groups to see which approach is more&#xD;
      cost-effective and efficient. The investigators will also ask children, parents, therapists,&#xD;
      and managers to discuss aspects that influenced effective implementation of the ENGAGE&#xD;
      approach. This study could provide evidence to improve meaningful child and family outcomes&#xD;
      in paediatric rehabilitation and improve the efficiency of paediatric rehabilitation&#xD;
      services.&#xD;

      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pragmatic trial aims to improve health outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      disabilities (NDD) using a novel therapist-targeted, theory-driven, evidence-based approach&#xD;
      to goal setting, the Enhancing Child Engagement in Goal Setting (ENGAGE) approach. This study&#xD;
      includes an economic analysis and service utilization component and an implementation process&#xD;
      analysis to evaluate cost-effectiveness and to support long-term sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary question: Does ENGAGE improve children's engagement in therapy, goal-related&#xD;
      performance (primary outcome), functional abilities, participation in home, school and/or&#xD;
      community, and child and caregiver quality of life compared to the current standard of care?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary questions: 1) What goal, child, family and therapist factors mediate and/or&#xD;
      moderate the effects of ENGAGE on the above intervention outcomes? and 2) Does ENGAGE improve&#xD;
      cost effectiveness from the perspectives of parents and service delivery efficiency compared&#xD;
      to the current standard of care?&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY/IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY AND EVALUATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This study will use a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      design with therapists randomized to one of two groups; the ENGAGE intervention group or the&#xD;
      usual care control group. The RCT will be a six-site trial with two groups (ENGAGE training&#xD;
      absent/present) with two periods of post-intervention assessment (immediate post-treatment&#xD;
      and 3-month follow-up). The trial will take place within established public paediatric&#xD;
      rehabilitation sites in Alberta. An economic analysis consisting of a cost-benefit analysis&#xD;
      from the perspectives of parents and a comparison of service utilization costs will be&#xD;
      conducted in conjunction with the RCT. To facilitate more widespread implementation, a&#xD;
      qualitative process evaluation will be conducted to delineate core versus peripheral&#xD;
      components of the intervention, and therapist, child and parent perspectives on the&#xD;
      contextual features that influenced implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: The sample size will be 96 children (12 therapists as clusters per group and 4&#xD;
      children per therapist) at six sites. Based on the pilot work, it is anticipated that child&#xD;
      dropout from the pre-post intervention period will be minimal (i.e., less than 5%). A target&#xD;
      change score of 2.0, a clinically significant change on the COPM (primary outcome), with a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 2.75 corresponds to an effect size of 0.723 for the comparison of&#xD;
      means. A sample size of 96 will enable us to detect an effect size of at least 0.682 in the&#xD;
      primary outcome (COPM performance rating) with alpha=0.05 and 80% power assuming an&#xD;
      intra-cluster correlation (ICC) of 0.1 using a two-sided, cluster adjusted, t-test for the&#xD;
      comparison of means. The investigators have selected an ICC of 0.1 based on results of a&#xD;
      previous cluster RCT with children with cerebral palsy (ICCs between 0.08 to 0.13). Since&#xD;
      therapist attrition is possible over the duration of the study, the investigators have&#xD;
      designed the sampling strategy so that a cluster size of 11 would still provide 80% power to&#xD;
      detect an effect size of 0.716, below our target effect size. Smaller effect sizes will be&#xD;
      detectable if the ICC is smaller than 0.1. The sample size has been adjusted from 88 to 96 to&#xD;
      allow for an 8% loss to follow-up (1 therapist, 4 children per group). The investigators do&#xD;
      not anticipate retention issues for the baseline and post-intervention assessments (primary&#xD;
      evaluation period). The probability of loss to follow-up may increase at the 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up assessment. Our estimate of loss to follow-up is based on our experience with&#xD;
      trials with children with disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Over 18 months, children (n=96) will be sequentially recruited by 24 therapists&#xD;
      from six paediatric Alberta rehabilitation sites (4 children per therapist). The&#xD;
      investigators have confirmed partner sites, who believe these numbers are feasible based on&#xD;
      the number of therapists and typical caseloads in their programs and our previous experience&#xD;
      collecting pilot data. Study therapists will identify potential participants who they are&#xD;
      about to see for regular therapy. Therapists will provide families with a tablet with a video&#xD;
      of the researchers introducing the study and inviting them to participate (see video script&#xD;
      in documentation section), or they will email the video link to families who are receiving&#xD;
      services virtually due to COVID 19 restrictions. Parents can either consent to participate&#xD;
      through an online form (REDCap) or request additional information by signing the contact&#xD;
      information form. Contact information will be provided to the researchers if parents sign&#xD;
      either of these two forms. If parents request additional information, they will be contacted&#xD;
      and if they are interested in participating after a discussion about the study, consent will&#xD;
      obtained (audio-recorded). Child assent will be obtained by the treatment therapist at the&#xD;
      next therapy visit or will be obtained over the phone as well. The investigators will use the&#xD;
      most feasible option as suggested by parents. Some children will not be able to verbalize&#xD;
      assent over the telephone. If parents do not wish to participate, treatment with their&#xD;
      therapists, will continue as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: A computer-generated, permuted-block randomization sequence using site as a&#xD;
      stratification variable will be used to allocate 24 OTs and PTs across 6 sites to the ENGAGE&#xD;
      or control group to ensure balanced groups. Blocked randomization by site will facilitate&#xD;
      consistency of therapy interventions and child characteristics between groups with the&#xD;
      exception of the ENGAGE in the intervention arm. If therapists within more than one program&#xD;
      at a site participate, therapists will also be randomized by program. The randomization&#xD;
      sequence will be uploaded to REDCap to allow for centralized, online randomization.&#xD;
      Randomization of therapists (and not children) will decrease contamination in the usual&#xD;
      practice group (i.e., so therapists are not asked to go between intervention and usual care&#xD;
      practices) and blocking by site will facilitate equal group distribution related to therapy&#xD;
      interventions (e.g., types of therapy) and child characteristics (e.g., age, diagnosis). Dr.&#xD;
      Rosychuk (co-applicant) will generate the randomization sequence and an independent research&#xD;
      assistant not associated with the trial will conduct blinded randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study groups: Intervention Group - Therapists will receive training on our principles-based&#xD;
      goal setting approach and strategies in the goal setting toolbox. Training will include an&#xD;
      overview of tools and strategies including the Perceived Efficacy and Goal Setting Tool&#xD;
      (PEGS) and the Pediatric Activity Card Sort (PACS), which are established goal setting tools&#xD;
      for children aged 5-9 and 5-14, respectively. In addition, training will be provided on Goal&#xD;
      Attainment Scaling and administration of the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure&#xD;
      (COPM), the most widely used goal setting tool in paediatric rehabilitation that has been&#xD;
      used with children as young as seven years. The investigators will introduce simple&#xD;
      strategies to assist children in identifying goals and to ensure ongoing focus on goals using&#xD;
      principles of motivational interviewing, strategies to assess and nurture perceived&#xD;
      competence (self-efficacy), and child-friendly feedback strategies on goal-related&#xD;
      performance. Therapists will consist of pairs within sites providing similar interventions to&#xD;
      similar children so that treatment and child characteristics other than the goal setting&#xD;
      intervention will be similar within each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group - The control group will comprise usual care. Research on goal setting in&#xD;
      paediatric rehabilitation in Alberta suggests that usual practice is highly variable, often&#xD;
      reflecting therapist preference and a lack of formalized goal setting processes. Research&#xD;
      conducted elsewhere also suggests that rehabilitation goals are inconsistently established&#xD;
      and documented and not based on theoretically informed principles. Recent findings from our&#xD;
      pilot work revealed that adherence to our four principles was a significant shift from&#xD;
      traditional practice that did not emphasize child engagement, attention to self-efficacy, or&#xD;
      strategies based on principles of behaviour change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment duration and intensity for both groups will differ based on nature of goals,&#xD;
      treatment strategies, and family preference. It is anticipated that treatment block lengths&#xD;
      will vary from 3-8 sessions over 2-8 weeks, representing typical clinical variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fidelity monitoring- Following the training, the investigators will track the strategies used&#xD;
      by ENGAGE therapists to evaluate treatment fidelity prior to recruiting participants.&#xD;
      Feedback will be provided as needed to therapists as part of the implementation plan to&#xD;
      facilitate ongoing and consistent use of the intervention strategies. This feedback will be&#xD;
      provided through email, phone or Zoom. Treatment frequency, intensity, intervention&#xD;
      strategies, and feedback frequency and mechanisms will be documented by therapists at each&#xD;
      treatment session. Co-interventions will be monitored for each participant. Recruitment and&#xD;
      formalized data collection will begin once intervention therapists at the site achieve an&#xD;
      acceptable level of fidelity defined as adherence to ENGAGE principles at least 90% of the&#xD;
      time. For example, the investigators will monitor the extent children are involved in&#xD;
      identifying their own goals and how often therapists use feedback on goal-related performance&#xD;
      at each treatment session. Practices will also be monitored in the control group using an&#xD;
      open-ended form to prevent contamination from exposure to ENGAGE principles. Ongoing&#xD;
      documentation of practices and monitoring will be used to evaluate the need for additional or&#xD;
      different implementation support in the intervention group and to enable comparison of group&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Identical assessments will be conducted at 1) baseline (pre-treatment), 2)&#xD;
      post-treatment (within 10 days), and 3) at 3-months post-treatment. Three months is a common&#xD;
      time period for follow-up for rehabilitation intervention studies reflecting retention within&#xD;
      a time frame reasonable to attribute to the intervention. Trained assessors, blinded to group&#xD;
      allocation, will complete the measures with families using Zoom to account for risks&#xD;
      associated with COVID-19. The investigators will email a copy of all tools to each family,&#xD;
      and screen share the same tools using Zoom to go through with the family and document&#xD;
      answers. Family members will be blinded to all initial responses on the measures. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized significant between group differences in favour of the intervention group on the&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that these differences will be&#xD;
      maintained at follow-up across measures. All outcome measures will be used at baseline,&#xD;
      post-intervention and at 3-month follow-up, administered by trained assessors blinded to&#xD;
      group allocation. All outcome measures are established tools, and have strong psychometric&#xD;
      properties with children with disabilities and/or their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An economic analysis consisting of a cost benefit analysis from the family perspective will&#xD;
      be conducted in conjunction with this trial. Costs related to ENGAGE relative to typical care&#xD;
      will be tracked using a therapy session questionnaire for both groups. In addition, total&#xD;
      costs incurred per child during the intervention will be determined by multiplying therapist&#xD;
      direct and indirect (e.g., documentation) time by a corresponding unit price. Mean cost per&#xD;
      child will then be calculated for each group. Costs from the family perspective will be&#xD;
      tracked using a parent questionnaire and outcomes will be parent and child quality of life&#xD;
      (CarerQol-7D and KIDSCREEN-27).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Data and demographic characteristics will be described (e.g., means, standard&#xD;
      deviations) for both groups. Change scores (post minus pre, follow-up minus post) will be&#xD;
      summarized for each outcome, with COPM changes post intervention as the primary analysis&#xD;
      (Question 1) and the other outcomes as secondary analyses. For each change score and outcome,&#xD;
      a cluster adjusted t-test74 will be used to compare mean change score between groups (ENGAGE,&#xD;
      control). A confidence interval will be reported for the difference between group mean&#xD;
      scores. Mixed effects linear regression models on all outcomes will include group and time&#xD;
      (fixed effects), a therapist random effect (to adjust for the clustering), and a child random&#xD;
      effect (to adjust for repeated measures on each child). Time will be a categorical variable&#xD;
      so that post and follow-up times can be compared with pre-treatment assessments. A time by&#xD;
      group interaction will also be considered to assess the effects of group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 2: Mixed effects multiple linear regression models similar to the above will also be&#xD;
      developed for each outcome with the additional variables of site, site by group as an&#xD;
      interaction (to assess site effect) and other theoretically important variables (e.g.,&#xD;
      cognitive abilities, age, parenting style) as covariates. Variables will be dropped from the&#xD;
      model one at a time if the p-value is &lt;0.05 and not needed for model fit. This modelling will&#xD;
      allow us to assess the effects of the interventions in the presence of important variables&#xD;
      that may not be balanced across groups by randomization. This approach will be used since&#xD;
      there may be some systematic differences in therapist caseload. All main analyses will be&#xD;
      based on 'as per protocol' analysis, as recommended for pragmatic trials.56 Analyses will be&#xD;
      performed by an analyst blinded to group assignment using R, directed by Dr. Rosychuk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 3: Mean cost per child and the mean effectiveness result per child for each group&#xD;
      will be represented in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) - the ratio of the&#xD;
      difference between groups in mean cost per patient to the difference in mean effectiveness&#xD;
      using the two quality of life measures (CarerQol and KIDSCREEN) as outcomes. Extensive&#xD;
      sensitivity analysis including probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be undertaken to test&#xD;
      robustness of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process evaluation: Data collection will occur pre-implementation, during and&#xD;
      post-implementation, as outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-implementation: Quantitative data: Therapists will complete the readiness for change&#xD;
      scale of the Organizational change questionnaire - Climate of Change, Processes, and&#xD;
      Readiness measure at the training session for ENGAGE. Therapists and managers will complete a&#xD;
      short demographic questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data: As part of their training, therapists in the ENGAGE group will discuss&#xD;
      anticipated barriers to this approach as well as potential strategies to optimize&#xD;
      implementation. This discussion will be very informal and facilitated by broad discussion&#xD;
      questions. Front-line managers will also participate in 45-minute interviews (either over the&#xD;
      phone or Zoom depending on what is most convenient). These interviews will be designed to&#xD;
      understand the managers' anticipated barriers to the ENGAGE approach. All interviews will be&#xD;
      audio-recorded and professionally transcribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During implementation: Bi-weekly meetings will be conducted over Zoom with the therapists at&#xD;
      each site. These interviews will be conducted by phone or Zoom, based on participant&#xD;
      preference. The purpose of these discussions will be to regularly assess and document&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators to implementation. The discussion will be very informal and&#xD;
      informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the Theoretical&#xD;
      Domains Framework (TDF). These discussion will be audio-recorded and transcribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-implementation: Qualitative data: Semi-structured interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      post-implementation with both the parent and child-participants (ENGAGE condition),&#xD;
      therapists (ENGAGE condition) and managers. Parent and child-participants will be interviewed&#xD;
      before or following their post-implementation assessment. Therapists allocated to the ENGAGE&#xD;
      group will be interviewed individually either over the phone/video following the completion&#xD;
      of therapy (within 14 days). Managers will be interviewed shortly after all of their&#xD;
      therapists have completed the study. CFIR framework was used in conjunction with the TDF to&#xD;
      develop the interview guides. Interviews (45-60 minutes) will be audio-recorded and&#xD;
      professionally transcribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using inductive thematic analysis following Braun &amp; Clarke's 6-phase&#xD;
      framework. Demographic data and the questionnaire data (readiness for change) from the&#xD;
      therapist will be will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Journaling will be used to&#xD;
      record preliminary themes/ideas about the data, experiences in the research process and&#xD;
      rationale for data collection and analysis decisions, and to facilitate researcher&#xD;
      reflexivity.&#xD;
