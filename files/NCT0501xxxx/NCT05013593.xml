    <measure>Change from baseline microbiota composition in women suffering from UUI and OAB at three months follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to three months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The microbiota composition is analyzed using sequencing of bacterial DNA. We are investigating the urinary, vaginal and gut microbiota. In women with urge urinary incontinence (UUI) and overactive bladder (OAB) receiving RCE (symptomatic RCE), a possible change in the urinary, vaginal and fecal microbiota composition from baseline to three month follow-up, compared to controls receiving placebo (symptomatic PL) are investigated.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The microbiota composition is analyzed using sequencing of bacterial DNA. Is there a difference in the urinary, vaginal and gut microbiota in women with and without urge urinary incontinence (UUI) and overactive bladder (OAB) at baseline?&#xD;

    <measure>Comparison of the urinary, vaginal, and fecal microbiota</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The microbiota composition is analyzed using sequencing of bacterial DNA. This composition is evaluated using alpha-diversity (measured based on number of unique bacteria as well as Shannon diversity and phylogenic diversity) and beta-diversity, as indicated by unifrac distance and bray-Curtis dissimilarity. Comparison of the urinary, vaginal, and fecal microbiota composition at baseline. All the different compartments are measured using the same Units of Measure.&#xD;
