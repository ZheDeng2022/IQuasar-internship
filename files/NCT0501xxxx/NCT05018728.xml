  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Voxelotor is a new drug for adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease that improves&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels and reduces the incidence of worsening anemia. However, it is unclear&#xD;
      whether this increase in hemoglobin is associated with a reduction in cerebral metabolic&#xD;
      stress. This study will measure the effects of voxelotor on cerebral hemodynamics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder that has profound effects on the brain.&#xD;
      In the presence of chronic anemia, the brain microvasculature dilates in order to maintain&#xD;
      adequate oxygen delivery to the tissue. As cerebral blood flow increases and the vasculature&#xD;
      becomes maximally dilated, oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) increases to keep up with&#xD;
      metabolic demand. Unfortunately, this state of maximized response leaves the brain vulnerable&#xD;
      and ill-equipped to adapt to increased metabolic demand; consequently, the tissue is&#xD;
      susceptible to infarction when blood flow/volume are insufficient to maintain sufficient&#xD;
      oxygen metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voxelotor is a first-in-class drug approved by the FDA for treatment of adults and&#xD;
      adolescents (aged &gt; 12 years) with SCD. This study will examine the effects of voxelotor on&#xD;
      cerebral hemodynamics. The researchers hypothesize that as hemoglobin increases due to&#xD;
      voxelotor, cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction fraction will decrease. To test this&#xD;
      hypothesis, measurements of brain blood flow, oxygen extraction, and oxygen metabolism will&#xD;
      be made using a customized diffuse correlation spectroscopy and frequency domain&#xD;
      near-infrared spectroscopy system (DCS/FDNIRS). This non-invasive, optical technique uses&#xD;
      light to estimate an average oxygen saturation of the microvasculature, i.e., capillaries,&#xD;
      arterioles, and venules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive voxelotor, administered orally once daily as tablets,&#xD;
      dispersible tablets or as powder for oral suspension at a dose based on their body weight,&#xD;
      for 12 weeks. Measurements of cerebral blood flow, oxygen extraction, and oxygen metabolism&#xD;
      will be made at baseline (before starting drug), and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the start of&#xD;
      voxelotor.&#xD;
