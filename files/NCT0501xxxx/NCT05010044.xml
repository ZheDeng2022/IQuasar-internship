    <textblock>
      An adapted MBCT intervention will be offered to people with psoriasis with depression and/or&#xD;
      anxiety. 8-week long MBCT therapy will be held between August 2021 and Jan 2022, based on the&#xD;
      adapted protocol. The MBCT intervention will consist of 30-minute weekly groups focused on&#xD;
      teaching mindfulness techniques and ways to recognize cognitive patterns that can increase&#xD;
      anxiety and/or depression. Participants will be recruited from the community, according to&#xD;
      the eligibility criteria detailed below. For all participants, anxiety and/or depressive&#xD;
      symptom severity(SAS/SDS), PASI,DLQI,(as measured with standardized, validated scales) will&#xD;
      be compared baseline and weeks 2;4;8;12;16;20;24. Itch intensity ,itch perception ,quality of&#xD;
      sleep, hours missing at work ,helpfulness of common itch therapies serve as the secondary&#xD;
      outcome, using a paired t-test.&#xD;
