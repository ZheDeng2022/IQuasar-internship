  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia Nervosa is a serious life-threatening illness with a typical age of onset in&#xD;
      adolescence; if not effectively treated, it has the potential to significantly impact&#xD;
      adolescent development and quality of life. Research on executive functioning in anorexia&#xD;
      nervosa indicates that it may be a viable target for intervention that could improve outcome.&#xD;
      The current project focuses on determining whether or not the investigators can improve&#xD;
      set-shifting in affected adolescents in the hopes that improvements in set-shifting will,&#xD;
      ultimately, improve outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the second phase (R33) of a two-phased project exploring the effect of adding&#xD;
      Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) to traditional Family Based Treatment (FBT) for&#xD;
      adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and their families. This phase (R33) follows a prior&#xD;
      2-year study (R61) which examined the impact of CRT on set-shifting abilities (a type of&#xD;
      executive functioning often referred to as cognitive flexibility). This second phase aims to&#xD;
      replicate findings from the first study as well as examine whether the addition of CRT to&#xD;
      traditional FBT will impact treatment outcomes (e.g., eating disorder symptoms, weight&#xD;
      outcomes). CRT is an adjunctive treatment approach where adolescents learn different ways of&#xD;
      thinking and problem solving to become more flexible thinkers. The investigators will recruit&#xD;
      and randomly assign 96 families of youth with AN to either an FBT group or FBT with&#xD;
      adolescent-focused CRT group. Parents and adolescents will complete questionnaires and&#xD;
      assessments to evaluate outcomes and predictors of outcome. Evidence supporting FBT+CRT to&#xD;
      increase set-shifting in adolescents will inform future efforts to leverage understanding of&#xD;
      neurobiology of AN in adolescents to improve outcome. Results will also inform how best to&#xD;
      augment current treatments, support parents, and increase positive outcomes for adolescents&#xD;
      with AN, and reduce relapse.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators will use the Delis Kaplan Executive Functioning System (D-KEFS ) Trails Number-Letter Sequencing subtest, a neurocognitive behavioral task, to assess ability to set-shift (a core component of executive functioning).

    <measure>Change in flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, during treatment, end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the Delis Kaplan Executive Functioning System Sorting subtest, neurocognitive behavioral task, to assess changes in flexibility.Investigators will compare change in scaled scores from pre, during, and post-treatment across groups.

    <measure>Change in self-reported inhibition control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, during treatment, end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning is a self and parent-report measure of executive functioning. The measure comprises 10 clinical scales, of which investigators will use the Inhibition subscale to assess self-reported inhibition control (ranged from 0-100, with higher reporting greater set-shifting ability). Investigators will compare change in T scores from pre, during, and post-treatment across groups.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, during treatment, end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will weigh participants during treatment to compare rate of change (slope) in weight gain from pre, during, and post-treatment across groups. Larger change in weight indicates greater recovery from the eating disorder.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in eating disorder symptomology</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, during treatment, end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Adolescents will complete the Eating Disorder Examination - Questionnaire (a 28-item self-report measure of eating disorders symptomatology), while parents will complete the Anorectic Behavior Observation Scale (a 30-item collateral report measure of eating and exercise behavior). Investigators will examine changes in these scores from baseline, during, and post-treatment. Scores range from 0-6 with higher scores suggesting more severe eating disorder symptomatology.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in behavioral flexibility (amount consumed)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, during treatment, end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Adolescents will complete a buffet meal during which investigators will record the amount of food they consume in grams. This task aims to assess changes in behavioral flexibility by objectively assessing food choice in individuals with an eating disorder. Investigators will examine changes from baseline, during, and at treatment completion. A larger amount of food eaten (in grams) represents greater behavioral flexibility.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in behavioral flexibility (eating disorder behaviors)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, during treatment, end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Adolescents will complete a buffet meal during which investigators will record eating behaviors using a novel checklist (a total score of eating disorder behaviors observed). These behaviors include staring, fidgeting, inappropriate napkin use, frequency of food tearing, frequency of dissecting food. Minimum score for this variable is 0, however, there is no maximum frequency. This task aims to assess changes in behavioral flexibility by objectively assessing eating-related behaviors in individuals with an eating disorder, with higher scores suggesting lower behavioral flexibility. Investigators will examine changes from baseline, during, and at treatment completion.</description>

    <description>Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) is an adjunctive treatment focused on increasing set-shifting ability and developing meta-cognition. CRT is a behavioral treatment that presents tasks to participants in a standardized order within each session. Each task has a number of levels. Participants stay at the same task-based level until mastered. They then move up a level on that task. participants can be at different levels on different tasks within each session. After completion of tasks, participants are asked to reflect on their thought processes in solving the tasks. Standard prompts are used to guide the discussion.</description>
