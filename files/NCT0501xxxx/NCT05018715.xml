    <textblock>
      Based on the clinical data of patients, a machine learning model for coronary heart disease&#xD;
      diagnosis was established to evaluate whether the model could improve the accuracy of&#xD;
      coronary heart disease diagnosis, and to evaluate its authenticity, reliability and benefits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 300 patients with CHD WHO were hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of&#xD;
      Xinjiang Medical University from August 2021 to February 2022 were selected, all of whom met&#xD;
      the DIAGNOSTIC criteria of CHD formulated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and excluded&#xD;
      diseases such as highly severe valvular disease and congenital heart disease.A total of 300&#xD;
      healthy subjects from the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University during the&#xD;
      same period were selected as controls.Observation indicators included: Clinical indicators&#xD;
      collected included: General conditions: gender, age, medical history;Blood biochemical&#xD;
      indexes, such as blood routine, liver function, kidney function, blood lipid, blood glucose,&#xD;
      myocardial markers, electrolyte, serum creatinine concentration, body mass index, BNP and&#xD;
      other indicators;Related tests such as ELECTROcardiogram, holter electrocardiogram, cardiac&#xD;
      ultrasound (left atrial diameter, ascending aorta, ventricular septal thickness, left&#xD;
      posterior wall thickness, right ventricular diameter, ejection fraction, abnormal ventricular&#xD;
      wall motion, evidence of infarction or ischemia, valve abnormality, congenital heart disease,&#xD;
      etc.);Signs include: audio data of heart sounds in nine parts of precardiac area;Medication&#xD;
      status.All blood biochemical indexes and examinations were completed in the laboratory&#xD;
      department and ultrasound department of our hospital, and the physical signs were completed&#xD;
      in the ward.The results of coronary angiography, pre-hospital and post-hospital&#xD;
      echocardiography and other related data were recorded.Machine learning model was constructed&#xD;
      based on clinical data to assist diagnosis of patients with coronary heart disease&#xD;

    <description>Based on the patient's typical angina pectoris symptoms, combined with the patient's age and coronary heart disease risk factors, and excluding other causes of angina pectoris, a preliminary diagnosis can be established. Coronary CTA, coronary angiography and other examinations find direct evidence of coronary artery stenosis, which can confirm the diagnosis</description>
