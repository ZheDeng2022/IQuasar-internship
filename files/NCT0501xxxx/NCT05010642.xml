      The purpose of this research is to prospectively test and validate the single-lead Low EF&#xD;
      algorithm in outpatients in order to test the performance of a single-lead ECG based&#xD;
      algorithm to identify people with decreased left ventricular EF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) is a relatively common&#xD;
      cardiac pathology with major clinical implications. People with reduced left ventricular EF&#xD;
      are at increased risk for sudden death, ventricular and atrial arrhythmias, and acute&#xD;
      hemodynamic decompensation due to heart failure. There are proven medical interventions that&#xD;
      prevent sudden cardiac death and complications in people with decreased left ventricular EF.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, some people with decreased left ventricular EF are asymptomatic, or have&#xD;
      non-specific symptoms like dyspnea, and would not receive those interventions in a timely&#xD;
      manner. Currently, there are no effective ways to screen for asymptomatic decreased left&#xD;
      ventricular EF in the population, because detection of low EF requires the use of&#xD;
      echocardiography. There is a significant need to identify novel technologies that can help to&#xD;
      detect people with decreased left ventricular EF in a simple, effective, and reliable manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eko Devices features a cloud-based platform of point-of-care cardiac screening devices and&#xD;
      machine learning algorithms that enables more effective detection and management of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. In this study, we will use the Eko DUO device to collect single-lead&#xD;
      ECG data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Eko DUO is an FDA-cleared and CE-marked electronic stethoscope that allows audio&#xD;
      recording of heart sound to produce a phonocardiogram (PCG) as well as recording a&#xD;
      single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). The DUO features 60x audio amplification, ambient noise&#xD;
      reduction, a 4000Hz sample rate, and 4 audio filters. The ECG component is made up of 2&#xD;
      stainless steel electrodes, 0.01Hz high-pass filter, selectable 50/60Hz mains filter, and a&#xD;
      500Hz sample rate. The de-identified auscultatory DUO recordings transmit wirelessly via&#xD;
      Bluetooth to the secure, HIPAA-compliant Eko application on a smartphone or tablet, which&#xD;
      allows the user to playback heart sound recordings, annotate notes on recorded audio, and&#xD;
      save recordings. This data is synced in real-time to a secure, HIPAA-compliant, cloud-based&#xD;
      Amazon Web Services (AWS) database server managed by Eko Devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been previously demonstrated that artificial intelligence processing information from&#xD;
      a 12-lead ECG can help to identify people with decreased left ventricular EF1. Using paired&#xD;
      12-lead ECG and echocardiogram data, including the left ventricular ejection fraction, from&#xD;
      44,959 patients at the Mayo Clinic, a convolutional neural was trained to identify patients&#xD;
      with low ejection fraction. When tested on an independent set of 52,870 patients, the model&#xD;
      showed an Area Under the Curve (&quot;AUC&quot;) of 0.93 and an accuracy of 86%. We have also developed&#xD;
      a single-lead version of the same algorithm, which will be more easily accessible in a&#xD;
      clinical setting since it can be used with a single-lead ECG device like the Eko DUO device.&#xD;
      We propose to validate performance of this new model using the current study.&#xD;

        Patients undergoing a transthoracic echocardiogram will be enrolled. Patients who are over&#xD;
        the age of 60 or who are at risk for heart failure (hypertension, murmur, etc.) will be&#xD;
        targeted for enrollment. We will also target patients with a referral diagnosis of dyspnea&#xD;
        on exertion, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, and possible heart failure.&#xD;
