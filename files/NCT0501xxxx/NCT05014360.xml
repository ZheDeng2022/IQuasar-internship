  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of JNJ-64251330 in participants with&#xD;
      Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) on colorectal polyp burden (sum of the polyp diameters).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is the most common polyposis syndrome. It is an&#xD;
      autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by the early onset of hundreds to&#xD;
      thousands of adenomatous polyps throughout the colon. JNJ-64251330 (lorpucitinib) is an oral,&#xD;
      small molecule, potent pan-janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that blocks phosphorylation of Signal&#xD;
      Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) proteins. pSTAT induces transcription of&#xD;
      multiple genes involved in the progression of inflammatory disease. JNJ-64251330 has chemical&#xD;
      properties that limits the amount of drug in the blood while delivering the drug to the&#xD;
      tissues of the gut. Local inhibition of JAK in the gut may present a promising method to&#xD;
      treat inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract, such as FAP. The study consists of 3&#xD;
      phases: screening phase (30 days) a treatment phase (24 weeks), and follow-up visit (up to 30&#xD;
      days after last dose of study drug). The total duration of the study will be up to 32 weeks.&#xD;
      Study evaluations will include efficacy via endoscopies, safety (monitoring of adverse events&#xD;
      (AE), serious adverse events (SAEs), events of infections including tuberculosis (TB),&#xD;
      clinical laboratory blood tests (complete blood count and serum chemistries), vital signs,&#xD;
      and concomitant medication review), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic and biomarkers&#xD;
      evaluations.&#xD;
