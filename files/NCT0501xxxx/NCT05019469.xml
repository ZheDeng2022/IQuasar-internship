  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot/feasibility study is to test if delivering rhythmic vibration cues to&#xD;
      the lower legs, specifically in response to gait defects (rather than continuously), can&#xD;
      improve walking quality and overcome gait freezing in Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, people with Parkinson's disease that suffer from regular (daily) gait&#xD;
      freezing will undertake a series of walking/activity circuits, receiving continuous cueing,&#xD;
      responsive cueing (delivered in response to gait freezing), no cueing and no device.&#xD;
      Vibration cueing is provided by a non-invasive wearable device prototyped at the University&#xD;
      of Oxford, worn on the lower legs during 3 circuits. A series of walking metrics will be&#xD;
      analysed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that impairs the&#xD;
      ability to control movement. Gait freezing is an inability to walk spontaneously and&#xD;
      continuously, and affects nearly half of PD patients, reducing quality of life and&#xD;
      contributing to increased fall risk. Cueing (with visual, auditory or somatosensory stimuli)&#xD;
      is an effective way to improve walking quality in people with PD. In this pilot study we aim&#xD;
      to test if delivering rhythmic vibration cues acutely, specifically in response to gait&#xD;
      defects, can improve walking quality and overcome gait freezing in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, people with PD that suffer from regular (daily) gait freezing, but who are&#xD;
      able to stand and walk with minimal assistance, undertake 4 walking/activity circuits. During&#xD;
      each of the circuits participants receive either continuous cueing, responsive cueing&#xD;
      (delivered in response to gait freezing), no cueing and no device. Cueing is provided by a&#xD;
      non-invasive wearable movement-tracking cueing device prototyped at the University of Oxford&#xD;
      (approximately the size of a smart phone), worn on the lower legs during 3 circuits. The&#xD;
      ordering of the interventions/circuits are systematically alternated for each participant.&#xD;
      The impact of responsive cueing on walking ability can be determined by analysis of walking&#xD;
      metrics across the circuits.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective is to test if gait-freeze initiated vibration cues, provided at the lower-leg, can improve gait/walking quality in PD patients. The primary outcome measure will be cadence (step frequency) with other gait measurements including frequency and duration of gait freeze events, continuous walking time, left/right rhythm and stride length. Measurements extracted from video data collected during 1 hour study sessions. Change in these measurements assessed between cued (intervention) and no-cue (no intervention) walking circuits for each participant.</description>
