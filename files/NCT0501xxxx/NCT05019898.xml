  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the difficulties encountered with subjective pain assessment tools, one of the ideas&#xD;
      for reducing the occurrence of insufficient analgesia administration in the emergency&#xD;
      department is to find a tool capable of measuring pain without requiring the patient's&#xD;
      participation, and which could be integrated into the systematic measurement of the 4 other&#xD;
      vitals. An interesting idea is the measurement of pupillary diameter and its reflex&#xD;
      variations by a portable pupillometer. Indeed, the diameter of the pupil (DP) reflects the&#xD;
      constant interactions between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems at the level of the&#xD;
      iris muscles. Pupillometry measures the change in pupillary diameter and allows the&#xD;
      performance of three dynamic tests useful in the assessment of pain.&#xD;

    <description>Step 1: The triage will be carried out by the nurse. The nurse will then perform a self-assessment of the patient's pain using a simple verbal scale.&#xD;
The nurse will then record the patient's self-assessment of his pain using the numeric scale for pain.&#xD;
Step 2: Immediately after this first assessment, eligible patients will be approached by the study investigator to be included in the study.&#xD;
Step 3: If the patient gives informed consent, the study investigator will perform&#xD;
The quantification of their anxiety&#xD;
An assessment of pain by a NeuroLight videopupillometer (iDmed, Marseille, France) using two dynamic tests, the Pupillary Unrest in Ambient Light (PUAL) and the pupillary light reflex.&#xD;
Step 4: One hour after the triage, a second pain assessment will be performed. Step 5: The same pupillometry measurements will be taken immediately after the nurse has assessed the pain.</description>
