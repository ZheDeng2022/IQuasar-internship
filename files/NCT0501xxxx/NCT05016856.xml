  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether among older adults an adaptive and personalized reminder&#xD;
      system can better support adherence to home-based cognitive training over typical reminder&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many cognitive training interventions are associated with poor adherence, and poor adherence&#xD;
      is associated with fewer benefits. Further, poor adherence in cognitive intervention studies&#xD;
      can interfere with answering fundamental questions regarding intervention efficacy. This&#xD;
      study will compare the effects of non-adaptive and smart adherence support systems.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to engage in frequent home-based cognitive training on a computer&#xD;
      tablet. In the smart adherence support condition, participants will receive adaptive and&#xD;
      tailored reminders based on dynamic algorithms that deploy reminders in a way that considers&#xD;
      participant preferences, days and times of previous successful engagement, the success of&#xD;
      previous reminder attempts, and answers to brief questions contained within reminder prompts.&#xD;
      Parameter weights for these variables will be adjusted dynamically over a 6-month assessment&#xD;
      period to ensure that reminders are deployed when they are most likely to be acted upon. This&#xD;
      study will investigate adherence to training sessions, multiple times each week for 6 months,&#xD;
      representing a large challenge to adherence. Participants will be randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      condition or another, and adherence at home will be monitored. This will be an Individually&#xD;
      Randomized Group-Treatment Trial (IRGT).&#xD;

    <masking_description>Measures of adherence will be automatically collected and thus assessors will be blind to this outcome. Data will be coded and analyzed with arbitrary condition markers to mask condition during analysis. Participants will not be explicitly told which condition they are in, but will be aware of the reminder messages they are receiving, and thus are not truly blind.</masking_description>
