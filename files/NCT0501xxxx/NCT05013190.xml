  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to check side effects and results in adults with multiple&#xD;
      myeloma after switching from a bortezomib-based to an Ixazomib-based treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with NINLARO® will strictly follow the product label.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, prospective study of participants with MM. Participants will be&#xD;
      treated with ixazomib based regimens until progression or unacceptable toxicity leading to a&#xD;
      discontinuation or change in regimen, for a maximum of 26 cycles (24 months) (as per NINLARO®&#xD;
      label) in real world clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 320 participants. The data will be collected&#xD;
      prospectively in medical charts and will be recorded into electronic case report forms&#xD;
      (eCRFs). All the participants will be assigned to a single observational cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Participants with MM&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in China. The overall time for data collection in&#xD;
      the study will be 24 months. Participants will be followed once every 3 months unless&#xD;
      withdraw of informed consent form, death or lost to follow-up, termination of the study by&#xD;
      the sponsor, whichever comes first.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-MY20 is self-administered patient-reported outcomes (PRO) used to assess quality of life during the last 7 days. It has 20 items evaluated on 4 point rating scale ranging from: 1 (not at all), 2 (a little), 3 (quite a bit), 4 (very much). Total score ranges from 20 to 80. Higher scores represent worsening.</description>

    <measure>HRQOL Based on EORTC QLQ-C30</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is self-administered PRO which contains 30 items across 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) and a global health status/quality of life (QOL) scale. EORTC QLQ-C30 contains 28 questions (4-point scale where 1=Not at all [best] to 4=Very Much [worst]) and 2 questions (7-point scale where 1=Very poor [worst] to 7= Excellent [best]). Raw scores are converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100. For the functional scales and the global health status/QOL scale, higher scores represent better QOL; for the symptom scales, lower scores represent better QOL.</description>

    <measure>HRQOL Based on EuroQoL Group 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is self-administered PRO. Its descriptive system assesses health in five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), each of which has five levels of response (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems/unable to). This part of the EQ-5D questionnaire provides a descriptive profile that can be used to generate a health state profile. Health state index scores generally range from less than 0 (where 0 is the value of a health state equivalent to dead; negative values representing values as worse than dead) to 1 (the value of full health), with higher scores indicating higher health utility. The second part of the questionnaire consists of a visual analogue scale (VAS) on which the participant rates his/her perceived health from 0 (the worst imaginable health) to 100 (the best imaginable health).</description>

    <description>TSQM-9 is self-administered PRO. It is a 9-item, validated, self-administered instrument used to assess participant's satisfaction or dissatisfaction with medication. The three domains assessed are effectiveness, convenience, and global satisfaction. The score of each of the 3 domains is based on an algorithm to create a score of 0 to 100. Higher score indicated greater satisfaction in that domain.</description>
