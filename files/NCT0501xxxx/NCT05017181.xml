  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For 50 years the diagnosis of prostate cancer has been with Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)&#xD;
      blood testing and prostate biopsy. However, this approach resulted in over-diagnosis,&#xD;
      over-treatment and missed clinical important cancers. Multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) has&#xD;
      provided a solution to some of these issues and the National Institute for health and Care&#xD;
      Excellence has advocated the use of mp-MRI before biopsy in men with a suspicion for prostate&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, important challenges remain and the current way we pick up and assess prostate&#xD;
      cancer can be improved. mp-MRI can miss significant cancer in around 11% of cases, 30% of&#xD;
      positive MRI scans turn out not to have significant cancer at biopsy. Lastly, 34% of mp-MRI&#xD;
      lesions are scored as in-determinant which sometimes makes decisions for further&#xD;
      investigation and treatment unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are also difficulties predicting patients who will have progression of their disease or&#xD;
      those who will not suffer harm from their cancer. Therefore the development of non-invasive&#xD;
      tests and markers that can tell apart aggressive and non-aggressive disease would be&#xD;
      extremely useful in deciding what treatment approach suits individual patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the use of three different novel MRI methods; Vascular,&#xD;
      extracellular and restricted diffusion for cytometry in tumours (VERDICT), Luminal Imaging&#xD;
      (LI) and hyperpolarised [1-13C]-pyruvate MRI (HYP-MRI). These scans help us to look at the&#xD;
      microstructure as well as the metabolism of prostate tissue and may offer ways to better&#xD;
      differentiate aggressive vs non-aggressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These scans will be performed in men with prostate cancer suitable for active surveillance at&#xD;
      baseline and 1 year later to assess for prognostic indicators for progression in early&#xD;
      prostate cancer.HYP-MRI will also be performed in men undergoing radical prostatectomy for&#xD;
      validation of image findings and pathology. Whilst some men will have repeat scanning to&#xD;
      asses for the repeatability of these techniques.&#xD;

      PURPOSE AND DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of novel MRI techniques and their derived&#xD;
      metrics in the diagnosis and prognostication of prostate cancer. Improving the diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy and investigating biomarkers with non- invasive MRI techniques have the promise of&#xD;
      reducing unnecessary biopsies or radical treatment, as well as detecting those likely to&#xD;
      progress at an earlier stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular, Extracellular and Restricted Cytometry in Tumours (VERDICT) MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is one of the most important sequences in mp-MRI of the&#xD;
      prostate which reflects the diffusivity of water in cells and differs in cancerous tumour due&#xD;
      to changes in cellular density, size, shape and arrangement. VERDICT is a novel framework&#xD;
      which uses a more complex 3-compartment tissue model for diffusion of water; 1. Water trapped&#xD;
      in cells, 2. Water in the vascular network and 3. Interstitial water. This allows us to make&#xD;
      estimates of specific tissue properties such as the size and packing density of the cells,&#xD;
      the vascular extracellular- extravascular space (EES) volume fractions. This methods is more&#xD;
      biologically specific compared to conventional DWI. Studies in tumour xenograft models of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer showed its ability to detect such known differences in the microstructure.&#xD;
      At UCL we have applied VERDICT to the prostates of 78 men and were able to successfully&#xD;
      differentiate between benign or clinically insignificant cancer and clinically significant&#xD;
      tumours. This technique can be applied on commercially available MRI scanners and requires no&#xD;
      additional contrast agents or requirements for the patient compared to conventional mp-MRI of&#xD;
      the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Luminal Index (LI) MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a multi-echo T2 sequence we can differentiate between the relatively long T2 values of&#xD;
      the luminal space and the short T2 values of the stromal and epithelial cells to estimate the&#xD;
      fractional volume of water in each MR voxel, the luminal water fraction (LWF). Studies have&#xD;
      shown a good correlation between LWF and histologically measure luminal fractional volume and&#xD;
      hence promise to detect prostate cancer and predict Gleason score. Our refined local LI MRI&#xD;
      sequence has been very good at differentiating clinically significant and non-significant&#xD;
      tumours. This technique also requires no additional contrast agents or patient requirements&#xD;
      to be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperpolarised [1-13C]-pyruvate MRI (HYP-MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer cell rely on enhanced glycolysis for their energy supply, a phenomenon known as the&#xD;
      Warburg effect. This is a key discriminator of malignancy and normal tissues and has been&#xD;
      successfully targeted with well-established imaging techniques such as Fluorodeoxyglucose&#xD;
      (FDG) - Positron Emission Tomography (PET). HYP-MRI is able to image a part of this metabolic&#xD;
      process in real-time. An injectable solution containing 13C labelled pyruvate which is&#xD;
      hyperpolarised onsite in order to increase the eventual detectable signal. The naturally&#xD;
      occurring metabolise pyruvate is converted to lactate with the attached 13C tag persisting&#xD;
      enabling us to track the presence and conversion of pyruvate to lactate after the injection.&#xD;
      It heralds the potential to differentiate tumours which are more likely to grow and&#xD;
      metastasise from those which won't. This sequence requires an additional injection compared&#xD;
      to standard mp-MRI and also uses an endorectal coil which is place inside the rectum for the&#xD;
      duration of the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this study are as follow and are addressed in three sub-studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To biologically validate HYP-MRI with correlation against biological measurements in men&#xD;
           undergoing radical prostatectomy (BioVal: 44 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical validation of novel MRI techniques (VERDICT/LI/HYP-MRI) derived measurements&#xD;
           for differentiating patients with aggressive (progressive) and indolent&#xD;
           (non-progressive) prostate cancer in men entering active surveillance (ProVal: 120&#xD;
           patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technical validation of novel MRI techniques (VERDICT/LI/HYP-MRI) through assessment of&#xD;
           repeatability metrics from derived parameters (TecVal: 20 patients)&#xD;
