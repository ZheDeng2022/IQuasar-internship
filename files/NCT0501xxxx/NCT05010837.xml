      This study is aimed at determining the effect of kinesio taping on waist to hip ratio,&#xD;
      abdominal muscle strength and body image concerns in postpartum females.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Post Caesarian section there is abdominal weakness and an increase in fat ratio. There is a&#xD;
      significant decrease in strength of abdominal muscles and an increase in fat ratio after the&#xD;
      C section. Common increase in abdominal circumference in postpartum females and its long term&#xD;
      outcomes like women health orders change in body shape and dissatisfaction is arising very&#xD;
      commonly in society. Body Image Concern Inventory scale is used to assess dysmorphic concern&#xD;
      of body. This study will work on the effects of Kinesiotaping which will be easily applicable&#xD;
      and increase muscle activation along with abdominal exercises to regain lost muscle strength&#xD;
      and tightening of loose skin. This tapping technique has a therapeutic effect on muscles and&#xD;
      easily available in the rehabilitation department. Nowadays it is becoming very common,&#xD;
      easily available, and regarded by physiotherapists as a method to support, rehabilitate and&#xD;
      stimulate some physiological processes. This study aims at determining rehabilitative&#xD;
      treatment to reduce waist circumference in post partum females.&#xD;

    <measure>waist to hip ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>8th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline waist circumference was measured using a non-elastic measuring tape was used perpendicular to the long axis of the body and horizontal to the floor at end of normal expiration at anatomic landmarks including midpoint between the lowest rib (below) and iliac crest (above). Hip Circumference was also measured around the largest parts of the hips. The waist-to-hip ratio was calculated by dividing the waist circumference by hip circumference. The scores were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Image concerns Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>8th week</time_frame>
    <description>changes from baseline Body image concerns were measured using body image concerns inventory. A brief questionnaire for assessment of dysmorphic concerns consisting of 19 points based on 5 points scale interpreting 1 never and 5 always. This scale indicates concerns relating to appearance, behavior, and social attitude. A highly useful, precise, and less time taking assessment regarding body concerns. Scores range from 19 to 95. where higher scores represent higher level of dysmorphic concerns.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Double leg lowering test</measure>
    <time_frame>8th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline double leg lowering test was used to assess abdominal strength. Participant lies supine with arms across chest, examiner raises patients lower leg vertically, procedure will be explained. Blood pressure cuff placed at pelvis level inflated at 40 mmHg. Participants instructed to lower both legs with the extended knee from the vertical position down while keeping the pelvis in the posterior tilting position, and the pressure cuff used as feedback to try to maintain the starting inflated pressure. During the test if the pressure on the cuff reduces the test is stopped and the angle is measured using goniometer from table. the strength is graded as poor for 75-90 degree from table, fair (3) for 46-75 degree from the table, Good (4) 16-45 degrees from the table and Normal (5/5) 0-15 degrees from the table</description>

    <description>Experimental group was given kinesio taping along with abdominal exercises. Kinesio taping was applied in I-band technique. the first band is applied on rectus abdominis from origin to insertion starting from pubic symphysis till the xiphoid process. the second band is applied bilaterally on the left and right side external oblique muscles.&#xD;
Abdominal exercises consist of 2-3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions of head lift with bracing, head lift with pelvic tilt, pelvic clock, bridging, knee rolling and deep breathing exercises for 1 to 4 weeks.&#xD;
From 5 to 8 weeks Same abdominal exercises with 5 sets and 15 to 20 repetitions were performed along with kinesio taping.</description>
