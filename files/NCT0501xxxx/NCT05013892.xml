  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to compare quality of life and symptom burden in participants who&#xD;
      receive two different types of radiation therapy (normal tissue sparing whole brain radiation&#xD;
      therapy (NTS-WBRT) or standard of care hippocampal avoidance whole brain radiation Therapy&#xD;
      (HA-WBRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NTS-WBRT (normal tissue sparing whole brain radiation therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HA-WBRT (hippocampal avoidance whole brain radiation Therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Memantine standard of care drug&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 randomized trial testing the safety and effectiveness of NTS-WBRT (normal&#xD;
      tissue sparing whole brain radiation therapy) as compared to HA-WBRT (hippocampal avoidance&#xD;
      whole brain radiation Therapy) in treating brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTS-WBRT is a targeted radiation therapy that further reduces radiation dose to tissue that&#xD;
      does not need radiation therapy treatment. HA-WBRT is a targeted radiation therapy that&#xD;
      avoids the hippocampus (part of the brain that controls learning and memory) tissue during&#xD;
      radiation therapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 100 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in pure tone average (PTA) from baseline to each subsequent assessment will be compared between treatment arms using Wilcox rank-sum test. Pure tone thresholds are found by presenting tones using standard headphones and methods in a sound treated booth. Pure tone thresholds will be tested by both bone (500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz) and air conduction (250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, 8000, 10000, 12000, and 14000 Hz). Masking will be applied sufficient to determine the ear responsible for each value. The results of this testing will be used to determine the sensorineural hearing level. If significant conductive loss is found, bone conduction threshold will be used to report sensory ototoxicity. Threshold effects across frequency will be combined into a Pure Tone Average (PTA), defined as the average of audiometric thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000. A significant decrease in Pure Tone Average is defined as an increase &gt; 10 dB in relation to baseline threshold.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in word recognition score (WRS) from baseline to each subsequent assessment will be compared between treatment arms using Wilcox rank-sum test. Word recognition is defined as the percent correct on a standard, 50-item word list of English monosyllables: CID W-22, NU#6 or CNC. A significant decrease in word recognition is defined as a score exceeding the 95% critical difference from the table of Thornton and Raffin.</description>

    <measure>Change in Hearing between NTS-WBRT+SIB and HA-WBRT Assessed by Otoacoustic Emissions</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The rates of absent otoacoustic emissions (OAE) will be compared between treatment arms using Fisher's exact test. The OAE (Otoacoustic Emissions) test checks part of the inner ear's response to sound. Otoacoustic emissions are sounds given off by one small part of the cochlea when it is stimulated by soft clicking sounds. When the sound stimulates the cochlea, the outer hair cells vibrate. The vibration produces a nearly inaudible sound that echoes back into the middle ear. The results are either present or absent. Present OAEs are consistent with normal to near normal hearing. Absent OAEs may be a sign of a problem related to study treatment.</description>
