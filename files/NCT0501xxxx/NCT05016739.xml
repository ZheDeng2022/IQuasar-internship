  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CADISS® System, Chemically Assisted mechanical DISSection, is intended for the selective&#xD;
      detachment of pathological tissue layers and/or fibrotic tissues in various surgical&#xD;
      procedures without using cutting instruments. It is based on the property of the drug mesna&#xD;
      (Sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate) to cleave the disulfide bonds responsible for the&#xD;
      adherence of pathological tissues and for the strength of fibrosis. Revision spine surgery is&#xD;
      more difficult than primary surgery because of the development of fibrosis and scar tissues&#xD;
      since the first operation. Fibrosis may develop in the spinal canal and will adhere strongly&#xD;
      to the dura mater and to the nerve roots. This study is a prospective, multi-sites, open&#xD;
      label, single cohort clinical trial evaluating the use of CADISS medical devices to&#xD;
      facilitate dissection of epidural fibrosis in patients who undergo a revision in spine&#xD;
      surgery after at least one year.&#xD;

    <description>The CADISS® device was procured from AuXin Surgery. It consists in three elements:&#xD;
A single use disposable Remote Kit, containing a sterile cartridge, which prepares the Drug Product immediately before use, and the sterile tubing for fluid connexion. The Drug Product is a 30 ml sterile 5% mesna solution of pH 7.3+/-0.5&#xD;
Reusable stainless steel non-cutting mechanical instruments similar to those used in the normal practice, except for the provision of an internal irrigation channel bringing the Drug Product at the working edge.&#xD;
A pedal controlled electric motor driving the peristaltic cassette included in the disposable tubing in order to control the dispensing of the Drug Product during the procedure.</description>
