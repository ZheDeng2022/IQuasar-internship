  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1,open label,safety,and efficacy study in subjects with non-β0/β0 TDT&#xD;
      β-thalassemia Major by transplanting BD211 drug product which is for autologous use only,via&#xD;
      a single IV administration.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After collection of mobilised peripheral blood samples, the patient's autologous&#xD;
      cells,enriched for CD34+ HSCs, undergo ex vivo transduction with lentiviral vector encoding&#xD;
      βA-T87Q-globin to BD211 finished product,which is then infused intravenously into the patient&#xD;
      after myeloablative busulfan conditioning to prepare bone marrow &quot;niches&quot; for engraftment of&#xD;
      the HSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge, subjects will be followed monthly, at a minimum, for 6 months and thereafter&#xD;
      every 3 months for the remainder of the 24 months post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation will include Routine and special biological testing at regular intervals,&#xD;
      collection of AEs and concomitant medications, and evaluation of disease specific biological&#xD;
      and clinical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then be enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol with annual evaluations for&#xD;
      an additional 13 years post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term follow-up study will focus on long-term safety, with an emphasis on integration&#xD;
      site analysis, and long-term efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will end when the last subject completes the Month 24 visit or discontinues from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
