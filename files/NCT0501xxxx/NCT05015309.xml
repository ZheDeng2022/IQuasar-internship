  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of SH3765 in subjects with&#xD;
      advanced malignant tumor by determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The second objective is to evaluate the PK profile and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of SH3765 in subjects with advanced malignant tumor.&#xD;
