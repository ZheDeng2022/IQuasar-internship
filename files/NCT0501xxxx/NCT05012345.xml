    <textblock>
      A single-blinded randomized controlled trial is initiated. Four weeks of plaster cast&#xD;
      immobilization is compared with six weeks of plaster cast immobilization in adult patients&#xD;
      with adequately reduced distal radius fracture. Primary outcome parameters are functional&#xD;
      outcomes measured with the Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation after 6 months of follow-up (FU).&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score after 6 months and one&#xD;
      year, 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey after 6 months and one year, functional outcome&#xD;
      earlier in Follow up (6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and one year), range of motion, pain&#xD;
      level, and complications: number of re-interventions, secondary displacement, delayed and&#xD;
      non-union.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as a prospective single-blinded randomized clinical trial in a&#xD;
      level one trauma center serving the southeast of Ireland. In this study, 4 weeks of plaster&#xD;
      immobilization will be compared with 6 weeks of plaster immobilization. The methods of this&#xD;
      study protocol are comparable to a previously published article comparing 3 weeks of cast&#xD;
      immobilization to 5 weeks of cast immobilization in adult patients with non-displaced distal&#xD;
      radius fractures. Patients will be treated in a lower arm cast in a neutral position.&#xD;
      Following immobilization, treatment will be the same for both groups, in which additional&#xD;
      physiotherapy after removal of the cast is advised, and exercises to train wrist function&#xD;
      will be given. As extra structured advice programs may cause no extra benefit for the&#xD;
      patient, this was not generally prescribed. However, during follow-up visits, patients will&#xD;
      be asked if they were treated by a physiotherapist. If this is the case, details on the&#xD;
      number of sessions per week and the total number of weeks the patient received physiotherapy,&#xD;
      will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will only be able to participate if closed reduction of the DRF is adequate. The&#xD;
      indication for reduction will be set, using the Lidström criteria for misalignment. Patients&#xD;
      will only be able to participate in this study if reduction is performed successfully.&#xD;
      Successful reduction will be classified as radial shortening &lt;3 mm, dorsal tilt &lt;10° or&#xD;
      intra-articular step-off &lt;2 mm, according to the guidelines of the American Academy of&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing informed consent, eligible patients will be randomised after 2 weeks when the&#xD;
      fracture has proven to be stable. An independent research assistant will perform concealed&#xD;
      permuted block randomisation using a computer-generated randomisation schedule after&#xD;
      stratification for fracture type, gender, and age. Allocation will be at random in four&#xD;
      blocks. To prevent bias, stratification by age (younger and older than 60 years) and gender&#xD;
      will be performed . Randomisation between another 2 or 4 weeks cast immobilisation will be&#xD;
      performed to complete a total of 4 and 6 weeks of cast immobilisation, respectively.&#xD;
      Randomisation will occur after informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      cast removal, number of re-interventions, delayed and non-unions and Complex regional Pain&#xD;
      Syndrome (CRPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each FU visit, the research coordinator or research assistant will ascertain patient&#xD;
      status (ie, secondary interventions, adverse events/complications, deaths) and will verify&#xD;
      the information within medical records. All adverse events will be addressed to the principal&#xD;
      investigator. At each FU visit, the patients will be asked to indicate the actual pain level&#xD;
      on a VAS. Patients will also be asked if they have any complaints of their treatment and will&#xD;
      be asked if they are currently treated by a physical therapist. At each visit from 8 weeks&#xD;
      onwards, the range of motion of the wrist will be measured using a goniometer, according to&#xD;
      the reference values for joint range of motion published by the American Academy of&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Surgeons. In addition, patients will be asked to complete the questionnaires&#xD;
      relating to disability. Plain X-rays of the wrist will be made at the time of presentation in&#xD;
      the hospital (ED), after 1 and 2 weeks, 4 or 6 weeks, and at the follow-up visit after 8&#xD;
      weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and one year. The X-ray at 6 months will be taken in order to&#xD;
      determine the grade of degenerative joint changes. The time to define the presence of a&#xD;
      delayed- or non-union will be at 3 or 6 months. The sample size of 44 patients per treatment&#xD;
      group is calculated with a power (1-β) of 80% and a type I error (α) of 5%, allowing for 10%&#xD;
      dropout. In this study, we decided to include 50 patients per treatment group. To allow a 10%&#xD;
      dropout in this study, in total 100 patients will be included.&#xD;
