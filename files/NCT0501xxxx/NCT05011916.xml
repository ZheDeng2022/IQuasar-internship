  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      KDR2-2, as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has a strong inhibitory effect on VEGFR2 and a&#xD;
      moderate inhibitory effect on PDGFR-β. It can be used for the treatment of corneal&#xD;
      neovascularization. The main purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      KDR2-2 suspension eye drops in the treatment of corneal neovascularization. This study is a&#xD;
      single-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical study. A total of 60 patients with&#xD;
      corneal neovascularization were enrolled in this study, and they were randomly divided into 4&#xD;
      groups, including the control group, the KDR2-2 low-concentration (4mg/ml) group, the&#xD;
      medium-concentration (10mg/ml) group, and the high-concentration (20mg/ml) group, with 15&#xD;
      subjects in each group. The control group applied 0.1% fluorometholone eye drops, and the&#xD;
      test groups applied KDR2-2 suspension eye drops with 0.1% fluorometholone eye drops. Patients&#xD;
      applied KDR2-2 eye drops four times daily for 6 weeks and were followed up to 10 weeks. The&#xD;
      follow-up time points were baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks after medication, and&#xD;
      4 weeks after drug withdrawal. Relevant ophthalmological examinations (including visual&#xD;
      acuity, intraocular pressure, slit lamp microscopy, central corneal thickness measurement,&#xD;
      corneal fluorescein staining assessment, corneal sensitivity measurement, corneal confocal&#xD;
      microscope examination, and anterior segment and fundus photography) are performed at each&#xD;
      time. And the ocular tolerability score and adverse events of each patient were recorded. By&#xD;
      comparative analysis, the efficacy and safety of KDR2-2 eye drops in the treatment of corneal&#xD;
      neovascularization were evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>The efﬁcacy of KDR2-2 eye drops treatment on corneal neovascularization was evaluated by comparing corneal anterior segment photographs acquired at baseline with photographs acquired on the follow-up visits. Size and extent of CNV was investigated by four primary metrics: (1) neovascular area ratio, the ration of the area of the neovascularization to the area of the cornea, (2) vessel length (VL), the total length of the vessels projected into the cornea, (3) vessel caliber, the mean diameter of the corneal vessels, and (4) Corneal neovascularization progression/stabilization/regression rate</description>

    <description>The corneal fluorescein staining score was assessed by NEI grading system by the clinician at baseline and all the follow-up visits.The NEI grading system divides the cornea into 5 zones: central, superior, temporal, nasal, and inferior. For each zone, the amount of corneal ﬂuorescein staining is graded on a scale of 0 to 3: 0=normal or negative slit-lamp ﬁndings; 1=milder superfacial stippling; 2=moderate or punctate staining, including superfacial abrasion of the cornea; and 3=severe abrasion or corneal erosion, deep corneal abrasion, or recurrent erosion. The alterations in corneal fluorescein staining score were evaluated.</description>
