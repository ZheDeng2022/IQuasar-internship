      This study is aimed at determining the effect of high intensity interval training VS yoga on&#xD;
      pain, catastrophizing and quality of life among young females with dysmenorrhea.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysmenorrhea is defined as a pain experienced by females before or during menstruation and it&#xD;
      is a common and important gynecological condition found in females of reproductive age that&#xD;
      adversely affects their quality of life. The cause of PD is believed to be the excess release&#xD;
      of prostaglandins during normal ovulation cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health care costs were altogether higher among females with dysmenorrhea compared with&#xD;
      females who didn't experience the ill effects of this condition, and excess costs were&#xD;
      essentially determined by outpatient care, so poses greater burden of disease than any other&#xD;
      gynecological complaint. Females having more pain catastrophizing scores leads to increases&#xD;
      chances of disability. Proper evidence behind HIIT training among females with primary&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea is sparse and is based on different clinical experiences and a less number of&#xD;
      studies with limited methodological design.&#xD;

    <description>changes from baseline The numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) is a 10 points scale on which, zero represent no pain, 1 to 3 represent mild pain, 4 to 7 represent moderate and pain score between 7 and 10 were considered to be a severe form of pain.[</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>8th week</time_frame>
    <description>The 13-item scale measures the extent to which participants worry, amplify, and feel helpless about the experience of pain on a five-point (0-4) scale. Total scores range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating greater pain catastrophizing.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D for quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>8th week</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is an acceptable, reliable and valid measure of quality of life. The EQ-5D, a standardized questionnaire consists of two parts: the first is the 'EQ-5D descriptive system' with five questions about several dimensions of HrQoL (mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). Each dimension can be rated at three levels: 'no problems', 'some problems' and 'major problems'. The responses to the five dimensions together lead to an aggregated index, the 'EQ-5D index', which corresponds to a health state. The second part of the scale is the 'EQ Visual Analogic Scale' (EQVAS) which is the respondent's own assessment of her overall health status on a thermometer-like visual scale.</description>
