  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      the acute administration of 3.2 µg of PH94B to relieve symptoms of anxiety in adult subjects&#xD;
      with social anxiety disorder (SAD) during an induced public speaking challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject participation in the Study will last a total of 3 to 7 weeks, depending on the&#xD;
      duration of the screening period and intervals between visits. Upon signing an informed&#xD;
      consent, all subjects will complete Visit 1 (Screening) and enter a screening period lasting&#xD;
      between 3 and 35 days. If subjects meet all eligibility criteria at the end of the screening&#xD;
      period, subjects will return for Visit 2 and self-administer the nasal spray and then&#xD;
      participate in a 5 minute public speaking challenge. During the public speaking challenge,&#xD;
      the subject will be asked for their anxiety score, which will be recorded by a trained&#xD;
      observer. At Visit 3, the subjects will undergo the same public speaking procedure once again&#xD;
      as they did in Visit 2. One week after the completion of the Visit 3 public speaking&#xD;
      challenge, the subject will come back for Visit 4 (Follow-up) that will involve a repeat of&#xD;
      the safety and psychiatric assessments conducted at Screening.&#xD;
