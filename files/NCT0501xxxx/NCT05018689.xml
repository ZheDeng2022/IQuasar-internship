  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Aevidum curriculum (plus/minus&#xD;
      club) to improve adolescent mental health knowledge, help-seeking intentions, and school&#xD;
      culture. Investigators will partner with 12 high schools for this study. Prior to the start&#xD;
      of the 2021-2022 academic year, schools will be recruited and randomly assigned to implement&#xD;
      the Aevidum curriculum (n=6) or the curriculum and club (n=6).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aevidum was established in 2009 as a student-led initiative to raise awareness and reduce the&#xD;
      stigma surrounding mental illness. Their mental health curriculum and club activities are&#xD;
      currently used in over 300 schools in Pennsylvania and surrounding states. In comparison to&#xD;
      current interventions, Aevidum is unique in that it provides students the opportunity to&#xD;
      build a strong support system among peers. Aevidum's curriculum and club activities provide&#xD;
      an opportunity for schools and students to engage with mental health and suicide prevention&#xD;
      materials with a student-directed method. Youth voice is a powerful tool that schools and&#xD;
      communities can utilize to make mental health and suicide prevention programming more&#xD;
      impactful. Allowing youth the chance to lead and let their voices be heard can create greater&#xD;
      buy-in for activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there is not a strong evidence-base for the efficacy of student-led initiatives&#xD;
      that aid in reaching mandated Act 71 curriculum standards for mental health and suicide&#xD;
      prevention. Aevidum lacks an evidence-base for its curriculum and club programming, which is&#xD;
      freely available to schools. To continue offering free resources, while also maintaining and&#xD;
      updating these resources to ensure they are innovative and best reflect student needs,&#xD;
      Aevidum needs to establish an evidence-base to support future funding. This project plans to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts in supporting adolescent mental health. Results&#xD;
      will be used to inform school-based mental health programming and to establish an&#xD;
      evidence-base for the Aevidum program, furthering mental health awareness and education,&#xD;
      while also reducing mental health stigma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While set up as a randomized clinical trial, this portion of the study is largely exploratory&#xD;
      and has not be formally powered. Knowledge, help-seeking, school environment/stigma and&#xD;
      program visibility will be assessed both in a pre/post assessment and compared between study&#xD;
      arms as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Assess Aevidum's curriculum in improving students' mental health knowledge and&#xD;
      help-seeking intentions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Exposure to Aevidum's five module mental health curriculum will result in&#xD;
      significant improvements in knowledge and help seeking intentions between pre- and&#xD;
      post-survey measures using the published University of Michigan Depression Center (UMDC)&#xD;
      Peer-to-Peer Depression Awareness Assessment among the 6 schools assigned to curriculum only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess the combination of Aevidum's curriculum AND club activities to improve student&#xD;
      perceptions of school culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Exposure to both curriculum and club activities will have the added benefit of&#xD;
      improving school environment/stigma and program visibility in addition to knowledge and&#xD;
      help-seeking on the Peer-to-Peer Depression Awareness Assessment among the 6 schools assigned&#xD;
      to curriculum + club.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In secondary statistical analysis, the curriculum-only schools will be compared to the&#xD;
      curriculum plus club activities schools directly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically: 1) Compare students from schools in Aim 1 (curriculum only) to those in Aim 2&#xD;
      (curriculum plus club) regarding changes in knowledge, help-seeking behavior, school&#xD;
      environment/stigma and program visibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Compare the impact on 9th graders in curriculum schools versus 9th graders in curriculum&#xD;
      plus club schools (curriculum will specifically be delivered to 9th grade students at all&#xD;
      participating high schools).&#xD;

Club basic processes and ideas for events are housed on the Aevidum website. Schools will select faculty and student leaders who will participate in a kickoff web-based training at the start of the academic year. The training is led by current Aevidum student leaders at schools with successful clubs. This is a standard orientation process that Aevidum has run for many years in-person, but has been adapted to a virtual format with the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>
