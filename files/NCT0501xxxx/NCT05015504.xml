    <textblock>
      In this 3-week interventional study, the investigators hypothesize that therapeutic&#xD;
      Time-Restricted Feeding in patients with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)&#xD;
      can improve their mean glucose or estimated glycated hemoglobin levels with the same dose, or&#xD;
      even reduced dose, of antidiabetics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Time-restricted feeding (TRF) has recently gained popularity as a means of reducing body&#xD;
      weight and improving glycemia. A recent clinical trial in men who had prediabetes showed that&#xD;
      TRF for five weeks significantly reduced fasting insulin concentration and improved the&#xD;
      derived oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT) indexes of beta-cell responsiveness and insulin&#xD;
      resistance. However, the effects of TRF have not been studied in patients with poorly&#xD;
      controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this 3-week interventional self-controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial, the investigators hypothesize that TRF in patients with poorly-controlled&#xD;
      T2DM can improve their mean glucose with the same dose/reduced dose of antidiabetics.&#xD;
      Potential study subjects will be identified from Endocrinology clinic patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of poorly controlled type 2 DM (A1c &gt;= 8.0 in the 3 months before enrollment) based&#xD;
      on inclusion and exclusion criteria. All study subjects will be in the ad libitum feeding&#xD;
      phase for one week, and then will be placed on time-restricted fasting (feeding between 4 AM&#xD;
      - 4 PM, fasting in the rest of the day) for the second week. For the third and final week,&#xD;
      patients will be returned to the ad libitum feeding phase. The first and third weeks will&#xD;
      serve as the control phases, and the second week will be the experimental phase. The mean&#xD;
      glucose, serum triglyceride levels, insulin resistance, and body weights will be compared&#xD;
      between the two phases. Results of this clinical study may demonstrate a low-cost and&#xD;
      practical way of diabetic control.&#xD;

    <description>The study will consist of three phases. In phase I all study subjects will be in the ad libitum feeding phase for one week followed by Phase II. In Phase II the subjects will be placed on time-restricted fasting (feeding between 4 AM - 4 PM, fasting in the rest of the day) for one week. For phase III (final week), patients will be returned to an ad libitum feeding. The first and third phases will serve as control phases, and the second phase will be the experimental phase</description>
