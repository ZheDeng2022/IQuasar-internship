  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies have revealed that 60-80% of women with breast cancer (BC) develop&#xD;
      metabolic disorders that are similar to those observed in conditions like type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      These metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and&#xD;
      glucose intolerance, are associated with increased BC recurrence and mortality. Skeletal&#xD;
      muscle is the major site of glucose uptake in humans. The aims of the present project are to&#xD;
      1) determine the involvement of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle in the metabolic&#xD;
      disorders prevalent in BC survivors, 2) identify BC-and/or treatment-induced molecular&#xD;
      changes in skeletal muscle from BC survivors .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 80% of women with breast cancer (BC) develop metabolic disorders, such as insulin&#xD;
      resistance, obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance, during or after their&#xD;
      treatment. Such disorders increase BC mortality and the likelihood of relapse 2- and 3-fold,&#xD;
      respectively. However, it is not known why BC and/or the treatment hereof causes metabolic&#xD;
      disorders and very few studies have investigated the underlying biological causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. determine the involvement of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle in the metabolic&#xD;
           disorders prevalent in BC survivors&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. identify BC-and/or treatment-induced molecular changes in skeletal muscle&#xD;
&#xD;
      BC is a common cancer with 2.1 million new cases each year, and BC also causes the largest&#xD;
      number of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Fortunately, more people are now&#xD;
      surviving their cancer. In Denmark, the majority of the 300.000 cancer survivors, constitute&#xD;
      a group of ~ 70,000 women who have survived BC. However, there is a severe lack of research&#xD;
      into the physiological sequelae of cancer and/or treatment, including the metabolic health&#xD;
      consequences of BC. Recent epidemiological studies have revealed that 60-80% of women with BC&#xD;
      develop metabolic disorders that are similar to those observed in conditions such as type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2D) during or following their treatment. However, unlike T2D, the underlying&#xD;
      biological causes for the development of metabolic disorders with BC and/or the treatment are&#xD;
      poorly investigated. It is important to address this knowledge gap, as metabolic disorders&#xD;
      increase mortality among women with BC 2-fold and increase the likelihood of BC recurrence up&#xD;
      to 3-fold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that metabolic disorders in BC survivors are due to cancer&#xD;
      and/or treatment-mediated molecular rewiring of skeletal muscle, which causes insulin&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific breakthroughs in obesity and diabetes research have shown that hyperinsulinemia&#xD;
      and hyperglycemia are most often caused by insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, fat, and&#xD;
      liver. In particular, skeletal muscle is essential for maintaining a normal metabolism as it&#xD;
      is responsible for up to 75% of the uptake of glucose from the blood in response to insulin.&#xD;
      It is thus likely that skeletal muscle insulin resistance causes metabolic perturbations in&#xD;
      BC survivors but this has not been investigated directly. Insulin-resistant skeletal muscle&#xD;
      does not respond normally to insulin, causing severe metabolic disorders. These include&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension; all conditions that are&#xD;
      increasingly being documented in women with BC and BC survivors It is likely that insulin&#xD;
      resistance in skeletal muscle is causing the metabolic disorders often present in BC&#xD;
      survivors. Since muscle plays key roles in metabolic regulation by keeping blood glucose and&#xD;
      insulin levels normal, it is extremely relevant to clarify the precise involvement of&#xD;
      skeletal muscle in BC-related metabolic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 premenopausal women (Body Mass Index = 25-30) who were operated for BC (stage I-III) will&#xD;
      be included. Especially overweight premenopausal women develop markedly metabolic dysfunction&#xD;
      as determined by an oral glucose tolerance test. The subjects will be studied 3-10 weeks&#xD;
      after completing adjuvant chemotherapy. Twelve healthy weight-, activity- and age-matched&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited as controls (matched by bicycle exercise test, grip strength, dual&#xD;
      x-ray absorptiometry, and using the international physical activity questionnaire). Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are as follows: Post-menopause at the time of BC diagnosis, metastatic cancer, &lt; 4&#xD;
      or &gt; 5 series of paclitaxel treatment, alcohol intake of &gt; 7 items/week, smoking, known T2D&#xD;
      or metabolic syndrome, known cardiovascular disease and medical treatment thereof, or&#xD;
      impaired mobility. Insulin sensitivity will be measured via the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic&#xD;
      clamp method. In short, basal muscle (from the vastus lateralus muscle) biopsies are taken&#xD;
      after 1 hour rest after which insulin (1.4 mU/kg/min) is administered while maintaining&#xD;
      euglycemia by continuous glucose infusion. Insulin-stimulated biopsies are taken after 1.5&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
