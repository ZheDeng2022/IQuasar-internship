      This is a phase III randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled multi-center study to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy and safety of aerosolized Novaferon for the treatment of asymptomatic or&#xD;
      mildly patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the outbreak of New Coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) in late 2019, epidemics around the&#xD;
      world are still developing. There are about 200 million confirmed cases in the world,&#xD;
      including about 4.26 million deaths until August 5, 2021, which has become a major disaster&#xD;
      for human being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic or mild cases, which is the main factor causing&#xD;
      viral transmission. Although COVID-19 patients have immune protection after cured or&#xD;
      vaccinated, there still be a percentage of people vaccinated who still get sick,&#xD;
      hospitalized, or die caused by COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough and reinfection cases&#xD;
      became one of key problems for COVID-19 prevention and control. In addition, SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      variants circulated in the world. However, some variants were associated with disease&#xD;
      severity, the performance of vaccines, therapeutic medicines, diagnostic tools, or other&#xD;
      public health and social measures. Variants (e.g., Delta variant) caused some vaccine&#xD;
      breakthrough cases. There is an urgent need for effective antiviral drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novaferon is a marketed antiviral drug in China and proved to have more than ten-fold&#xD;
      antiviral potency than that of similar interferon Î±-2b. Novaferon exerts antiviral activity&#xD;
      by three ways: blocking virus entry into cells, inducing expression of antiviral genes and&#xD;
      proteins (e.g., MX1 and OAS), and promoting apoptosis of infected cells. In vitro&#xD;
      experimental study showed Novaferon exhibited anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects at the cellular level.&#xD;
      A randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial demonstrated that aerosolized Novaferon&#xD;
      expedited clearance and negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2, which provide the rational for&#xD;
      large-scale clinical studies to verify the efficacy of Novaferon as a potential antiviral&#xD;
      drug for COVID-19. Inhalation administration has advantages over systemic administration in&#xD;
      reducing adverse drug reactions, promoting the distribution of drugs in respiratory tract,&#xD;
      and thus enhancing the mucosal immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase III randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled multi-center study to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy, and safety of aerosolized Novaferon for the treatment of asymptomatic&#xD;
      patients or patients with mild COVID-19.&#xD;
