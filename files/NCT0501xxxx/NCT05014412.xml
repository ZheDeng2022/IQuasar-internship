  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a step-up dosing approach (starting&#xD;
      with low doses followed by higher doses) of the study medicine (elranatamab) in participants&#xD;
      with multiple myeloma that has come back after responding to treatment or has not responded&#xD;
      to treatment (relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma). This study will also look at the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of different doses of elranatamab, as well as different intervals between doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study will receive elranatamab as an injection under the skin at the&#xD;
      study clinic. After the initial step-up doses, participants will start receiving one dose&#xD;
      every week. The frequency of clinic visits for injections may then decrease over time.&#xD;
      Participation will be at least two years.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety (in particular the rate of Grade ≥ 2 CRS)&#xD;
      of a step-up priming dose regimen of elranatamab in participants with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      multiple myeloma. In addition, this study will assess the safety of different dosing regimens&#xD;
      of elranatamab and if it can provide a clinical benefit in those participants. Elranatamab is&#xD;
      a bispecific antibody: binding of elranatamab to CD3-expressing T-cells and BCMA-expressing&#xD;
      multiple myeloma cells causes targeted T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity.&#xD;
