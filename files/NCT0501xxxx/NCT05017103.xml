  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates the effects of sintilimab in treating patients with&#xD;
      undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally&#xD;
      advanced), spread to other places in the body (metastatic), come back (recurrent), or cannot&#xD;
      be removed by surgery (unresectable). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      sintilimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of sintilimab in subjects with undifferentiated pleomorphic&#xD;
      sarcoma (UPS) (overall response rate [ORR] at 12 weeks [12W] by Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the ORR (RECIST 1.1) and disease control rate (DCR), PFS, overall survival&#xD;
      (OS), safety and duration of response (DOR) of sintilimab in subjects with UPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the correlation between biomarkers in tumor tissue and efficacy, including but&#xD;
      not restricted to PD-L1 expression level, tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) transcriptome&#xD;
      sequencing, single-cell sequencing, and multicolor immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the correlation between biomarkers in peripheral blood and efficacy,&#xD;
      including but not restricted to soluble PD-L1, circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#xD;
      (ctDNA), identification/quantification of immunologic changes, and cytokine analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sintilimab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 60&#xD;
      days for 3 years.&#xD;

    <description>95% confidence interval will be estimated via the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival curves will be plotted. Log-rank test will be performed to test the difference in survival between groups. Regression analyses of survival data based on the Cox proportional hazards model will be conducted. The proportional hazards assumption will be evaluated graphically and analytically, and regression diagnostics (e.g., martingale and Shoenfeld residuals) will be examined to ensure that the models are appropriate. For repeated measures, linear mixed model will be used for continuous outcomes and generalized estimating equation model will be fit for binary outcomes. Appropriate methods will be applied to analyze correlative data. Other statistical analyses may be performed as appropriate.</description>
