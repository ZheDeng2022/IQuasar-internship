  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study investigates the reaction of the skin upon exposure to house dust mite&#xD;
      (HDM) in patients with atopic dermatitis who have antibodies against HDM in the blood. A&#xD;
      further aim is to assess nasal symptoms after exposure to HDM in an allergen challenge&#xD;
      chamber and compare the results with data from previous studies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin disease characterized by a relapsing course and&#xD;
      typical clinical manifestation with itchy, eczematous lesions. The majority of AD patients&#xD;
      reveals elevated IgE serum levels (&gt; 100kU / L), which classifies the disease as extrinsic&#xD;
      AD. Mostly, the IgE is directed against aeroallergens like pollen and house dust mite (HDM).&#xD;
      These allergens may contribute pronouncedly to the relapsing character of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of note, it was already shown in the 1920s that avoiding aeroallergens by sleeping in an&#xD;
      allergen-free chamber has a positive influence not only on the symptoms of asthma but also on&#xD;
      the skin condition in AD patients. However, a recent study was the first showing that&#xD;
      challenge chamber exposure to airborne grass pollen allergens can cause a clinical worsening&#xD;
      of the skin condition in sensitized AD patients. These standardized settings in the&#xD;
      Fraunhofer Allergen Challenge Chamber can conduce as a model for the investigation of the&#xD;
      impact on other allergens on AD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the perennial allergen HDM, Sager et al. investigated the epicutaneous application of HDM&#xD;
      allergens in sensitized AD patients. It led to an aggravation of the eczematous lesions&#xD;
      through a T-cell-mediated reaction. The binding of the HDM allergen to specific IgE-Fc&#xD;
      receptors on Langerhans cells leads to the proliferation of specific T cells in the skin and&#xD;
      a proinflammatory signaling. Until now, however, airborne HDM allergen exposure has not been&#xD;
      shown to cause aggravation of AD in any controlled setting. This study aims to answer the&#xD;
      question of the extent to which standardized exposure of AD patients with HDM has an impact&#xD;
      on objective, subjective and in vitro disease parameters.&#xD;
