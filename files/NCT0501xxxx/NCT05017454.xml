      the aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of sodium valproate-loaded&#xD;
      nanospanlastic in the treatment of patchy AA, in comparison to conventional therapy with&#xD;
      topical steroids&#xD;

      Alpopecia Areata (AA) is the second common cause of non-scarring hair loss, the disease has&#xD;
      huge negative impact on patients' quality of life, social and psychological status. The&#xD;
      underlying pathogenesis of AA is not fully characterized, Yet the collapse of immune&#xD;
      privilege and generation of autoimmune attack against unknown follicular antigens are the&#xD;
      most agreed-upon theories behind the disease. In spite of various therapeutic armamentariums&#xD;
      available for AA, no single agent has been proven efficacious regarding reversing hair loss&#xD;
      and establishing long-term response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      keeping in mind the burden of the disease together with lacking effective treatments, a need&#xD;
      for further therapies is colossal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wnt-b catenin pathway is one of the crucial signalling pathways that regulate hair cycling.&#xD;
      An increasing body of evidence is supporting the fact that wnt-b catenin pathway is inhibited&#xD;
      in AA, and therefore contributing to the hair loss that characteize the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium valproate (SV), a well-known anti-epileptic drug, was found to inhibit Glycogen&#xD;
      synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3β) in neuronal cells as one of the possible antiepileptic&#xD;
      mechanisms of SV. GSK3B is a well-known inhibitor of β-catenin activity in dermal papilla&#xD;
      cells (DPCs), and thus induces catagen-like changes in these cells. So the idea of using&#xD;
      topical SV to promote hair regrowth via activation of b catenin came up and attracted the&#xD;
      interests of investigators. recently an optimized sodium valproate-loaded nanospanlastics&#xD;
      topical formula promisingly achieved clinical equivalence with 5% minoxidil lotion in AGA,&#xD;
      with a superior safety profile to minoxidil&#xD;

    <description>treatment success is defined by achieving 50% or more reduction in baseline SALT score. The range in score is 0% (no hair loss) to 100% (complete hair loss).</description>

    <description>Assessment of expression of both beta-catenin and Axin2 in lesional scalp of patients with patchy AA before and after treatment with sodium valproate-loaded nanospanlastics, in comparison to conventional therapy with topical steroids</description>

    <measure>Dermoscopic evaluation of hair regrowth</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This evaluation will determine the number of dystrophic hairs in the patch area at baseline to be compared after the end of treatment. Markers for dystrophic hairs include exclamation-mark hairs, black dots, yellow dots and pigtail regrowing hair. The percentage of dystrophic hairs will be evaluated on a four-point scale: 3, &gt; 50%; 2, 30-50%; 1, 1-29%; 0, no dystrophic hairs</description>

    <measure>Patient global assessment of improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient global assessment of improvement will be evaluated at the end of study, and will be scored as the following; (0 =no regrowth; 1 = &lt;25% of regrowth; 2 = 25%-49% of regrowth; 3 = 50%-74% of regrowth; 4 = 75%-99% of re- growth; 5 = 100% of regrowth)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical satisfaction of each patient</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical satisfaction of each patient will be made using a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-10; the 0 level was defined as &quot;Not satisfied at all,&quot; while a level of 10 was defined as &quot;completely satisfied&quot;)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective assessment of any encountered adverse effects</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective assessment of any encountered adverse effects (burning, itching) will also be performed. This will be determined on a four-point scale: 3, strong sensation; 2, moderate sensation; 1, mild sensation; 0, no itching or burning sensation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction regarding characteristics of the used topical treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction regarding characteristics of the used topical treatment, for example (texture, spreadability, hair matting, odour). This will be evaluated on a 3-point scale; 0=unsatisfied, 1=moderately satisfied, 2=extremely satisfied</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
