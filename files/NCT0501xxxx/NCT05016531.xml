  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out the optimal intensity and frequency of Low&#xD;
      Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LIFU) that is safe and tolerable in people who have had a&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1 is to determine the optimal intensity of Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound stimulation&#xD;
      (LIFUS) in stroke patients in terms of safety. We will investigate the optimal spatial-peak&#xD;
      temporal-average intensity/ISPTA in the range of 0(or sham) W/cm2 to 8 W/cm2. Safety will be&#xD;
      investigated by assessing clinically detectable signs and symptoms by monitoring vital signs&#xD;
      and surveying subjects with a questionnaire before and after each stimulation session, and&#xD;
      additionally by detecting subclinical neuronal injury using MRI/DWI. Aim 1 requires up to 72&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 is to determine the optimal frequency of LIFU stimulation in stroke patients in terms&#xD;
      of cortical excitability. Stroke subjects undergo each of the 5 frequency levels (0.35 MHz;&#xD;
      0.5 MHz; 0.75 MHz, 1.0 MHz and 1.5 MHz) on 5 different days with at least one day washout.&#xD;
      The intensity (ISPTA) will set up at the level that is determined from Aim 1. Cortical&#xD;
      excitability is measured by the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) from the Abductor Pollicis Brevis (ABP) muscle of the&#xD;
      affected side. MEPs will be recorded pre- and post-stimulation to determine the optimal&#xD;
      intensity for maximal cortical excitability from the hemisphere where the lesion is located.&#xD;
      Aim 2 requires 18 subjects.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At any point during or immediately following intervention on day of LIFUS application</time_frame>
    <description>Safety outcomes are measured by &quot;major response&quot; which is pre-defined by any of the following event&#xD;
Second degree skin injury;&#xD;
Clinical seizure;&#xD;
New lesion on DWI sequence of MRI scan and the lesion not explained by any other cause(s) or decreased ADC under the transducer stimulating motor cortex area;&#xD;
Patient discontinues from the study due to any reason&#xD;
This is a 6+6 study design. Basically, 6 subjects are recruited at a given intensity level. Trial is stopped if ≥3/6 subjects at a given intensity level show major response. If ≤ 2 subjects shows major response, 6 more subjects are recruited to further test safety at the same intensity level; if ≤ 2/12 major response occurs, the intensity will be escalated to next higher level; if major response occurs ≥ 3/12 subjects, then the trial will terminate. The sequence for intensity escalation is sham &gt; 1 W/cm2 &gt; 2 W/cm2 &gt; 4W/cm2 &gt; 6W/cm2 &gt; 8W/cm2.</description>
