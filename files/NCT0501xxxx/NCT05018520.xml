      The Safety and Effectiveness of Four Courses of R-CHOP Plus Four Courses of Rituximab Versus&#xD;
      Six Courses of R-CHOP Plus Two Courses of Rituximab in the Treatment of Naive, Low-risk,&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the subtype with the highest incidence, accounting&#xD;
      for 35.8% of B cell lymphoma. 6 to 8 cycles of R-CHOP regimen is currently the standard&#xD;
      first-line regimen for DLBCL, however, the side effects including nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      neutropenia, hair loss, and heart failure can decrease the life quality and are sometimes&#xD;
      life threatening. Recently, domestic and foreign scholars have been committed to reduce the&#xD;
      dose of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life in low-risk patients. This study uses 4&#xD;
      courses of R-CHOP plus 4 courses of R (4+4 plan) versus 6 courses of R-CHOP plus 2 courses of&#xD;
      R (6+2 plan) for the treatment of newly treated, low-risk, non-mass DLBCL patients. The&#xD;
      promising result will create a new model for the treatment and improve the life quality of&#xD;
      low-risk DLBCL.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events</description>
