  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to current IBS management guidelines, probiotic administration reduces&#xD;
      IBS-associated symptoms and improves the quality of life. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the effects of the combined formulation comprising microencapsulated sodium butyrate&#xD;
      and a probiotic mixture of two Lactobacillus strains (L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus) and&#xD;
      three Bifidobacterium strains (B. longum, B. bifidum, and B. lactis) on the incidence and&#xD;
      severity of clinical symptoms in patients diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) based&#xD;
      on the Rome IV criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microencapsulated sodium butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) with biological effects&#xD;
      on the gastrointestinal mucosa; it constitutes a key source of energy for enterocytes.&#xD;
      Butyrate was shown to have a trophic effect on the colon epithelium and to help restore the&#xD;
      disrupted structural and functional integrity of the gastrointestinal tract. These unique&#xD;
      properties of sodium butyrate result in its beneficial effects on the abdominal symptoms&#xD;
      (such as diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain) in patients with IBS. This study will assess&#xD;
      the effects of the mixture of sodium butyrate and multi-strain probiotic on the rate and&#xD;
      severity of clinical symptoms in IBS patients, by taking into account their nutritional&#xD;
      status and body composition.&#xD;

      The study schedule includes five visits:the screening/baseline visit, whose purpose is to&#xD;
      qualify patients to be included in the study, the randomization visit (visit 0), at which&#xD;
      patients will be given a probiotic/butyric acid or placebo, and three follow-up visits (at&#xD;
      weeks 4, 8, and 12 after randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A physical examination - at each visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nutritional status assessment - at visit 0 and at weeks 4 and 12 of treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Anthropometric measurements - at visit 0 and at weeks 4 and 12 of treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Body composition analysis via bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) with the use of a&#xD;
           Bodystat machine - at visit 0 and at 4 and 12 weeks of treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Laboratory tests (including complete blood count; liver function tests; bilirubin,&#xD;
           amylase, creatinine, CRP, and glucose levels; electrolytes; and an SARS-CoV2 antigen&#xD;
           cassette test conducted by a doctor) at the screening visit; and cytokines (IL-6 and&#xD;
           macrophage inflammatory protein 1β (MIP-1ß)) at visit 0 and at weeks 4 and 12 of&#xD;
           treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Disease severity will be rated with the IBS symptom severity score (IBS-SSS) developed&#xD;
           by Francis, Morris, and Whorwell, with mild, moderate, and severe cases indicated by&#xD;
           scores of &lt;175, 175-300, and &gt;300, respectively. In addition, the following scales will&#xD;
           be used to assess IBS treatment efficacy: IBS-Quality of Life (IBS-QOL), IBS-Global&#xD;
           Improvement Scale (IBS-GIS), and IBS - Adequate Relief (IBS-AR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The number and type of bowel movements will be assessed with the Bristol Stool Formation&#xD;
           scale.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in severity of IBS symptoms using IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Severity of symptoms from baseline at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>IBS-SSS is a 5-question survey that asks: 1. the severity of abdominal pain, 2. frequency of abdominal pain, 3. severity of abdominal distention, 4.dissatisfaction with bowel habit, and 5. interference with quality of life over the past 10 days. Subjects respond to each question on a 100-point visual analogue scale. Each of the five question generates a maximum score of 100 point, and total scores can range from 0-500 with higher scores indicating severe symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Improvement/worsening assessed after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>IBS-Global Improvement Scale asseses IBS symptoms using a patient-defined 7 point Linkert scale ranging from symptoms substantially worse to substantially improved.&#xD;
Patients answer the question &quot;Have you felt any change in the severity of your symptoms over the past 7 days compared to how you felt before the medicine was given?&#xD;
The answers are recorded based on the 7-point scale:&#xD;
= I feel that the symptoms have worsened significantly&#xD;
= I feel that the symptoms have moderately worsened&#xD;
= I feel that the symptoms have slightly worsened&#xD;
= I feel no change&#xD;
= I feel a slight improvement&#xD;
= I feel moderate improvement&#xD;
= I feel significant improvement IBS-GIS score indicates: improvement if is &gt;4 or worsening if is&lt;4, no change if is 4.</description>
