  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma (skin cancer) frequently develops from existing moles on the skin. Current practice&#xD;
      relies on expert dermatologists being able to successfully identify new/changing moles in&#xD;
      individuals with multiple moles. Total body photography (TBP-high-quality images of the&#xD;
      entire skin) can track and monitor moles over time to detect melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, TBP is currently used as a visual guide when diagnosing melanoma, requiring visual&#xD;
      inspection of each mole sequentially. This process is challenging, time-consuming and&#xD;
      inefficient. Artificial intelligence (AI) is ideally suited to automate this process.&#xD;
      Comparing baseline TBP images to newly acquired photographs, AI techniques can be used to&#xD;
      accurately identify and highlight changing moles, and potentially distinguish harmless moles&#xD;
      from cancerous changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Astrophysicists face a similar problem when they map the night sky to detect new events, such&#xD;
      as exploding stars. Using AI, based on two or more images, astrophysicists detect new events&#xD;
      and accurately predict how they will appear subsequently. This project, called MoleGazer, is&#xD;
      a collaboration with astrophysicists aiming to apply AI methods that are currently used for&#xD;
      astronomical sky surveys, to TBP images. The MoleGazer algorithm, developed at Oxford&#xD;
      University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, will automatically identify the appearance of new&#xD;
      moles and characterise changes in existing ones, when new TBP images are taken. To optimise&#xD;
      this MoleGazer algorithm TBP images will be taken at multiple time-points, as there are no&#xD;
      existing datasets of TBP images that are publicly available. The investigators invite a)&#xD;
      high-risk patients attending skin cancer screening clinics to attend sequential three-monthly&#xD;
      TBP imaging and clinical assessment and b) any patient who undergoes TBP as standard care to&#xD;
      share images so that the investigators can develop the MoleGazer algorithm. The ultimate goal&#xD;
      is for the MoleGazer algorithm to 'map moles' over a patient's lifetime to detect changes,&#xD;
      with the eventual aim to detect melanoma as early as possible.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melanoma incidence is rapidly increasing with 15,906 new United Kingdom (UK) cases in 2015&#xD;
      resulting in 2,285 deaths. Diagnosing melanoma early is essential as early stage disease has&#xD;
      &gt; 95% 5-year relative survival rate compared with 8-25% for advanced melanoma. In the UK,&#xD;
      skin cancer costs are predicted to exceed Â£180 million by 2020 and pose significant morbidity&#xD;
      (and mortality) to individuals affected. Up to 60% of melanoma arise from pre-existing naevi&#xD;
      (moles). Early melanoma detection relies on individuals recognising changes in naevi and for&#xD;
      those individuals with multiple naevi expert assessment of these naevi by trained&#xD;
      dermatologists using diagnostic aids such as dermoscopy (x10 magnification). Furthermore&#xD;
      there is evidence that sequential surveillance of naevi also increases melanoma detection&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total body photography (TBP) is a diagnostic aid for monitoring of multiple naevi&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients at high-risk of developing melanoma with multiple naevi (&gt;60), total body&#xD;
      photography (TBP) (standardised body-part images taken using high-resolution camera), is used&#xD;
      as an aid to track, compare and monitor naevi over time and has been demonstrated to improve&#xD;
      melanoma diagnosis. Recommended short-term surveillance monitoring of naevi is 3-months but&#xD;
      is largely confined to single lesions. In a resource-constrained National Health Service&#xD;
      (NHS), frequent surveillance for multiple naevi by a dermatologist is impractical and&#xD;
      inefficient such that early diagnosis of melanoma effectively relies on patient&#xD;
      self-surveillance. A potential solution is automated analysis of TBP images using artificial&#xD;
      intelligence (AI) to track and monitor naevi over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artificial intelligence applied to TBP could improve efficiency of 'mole-mapping'&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous AI evaluation of skin lesions has demonstrated equivalent accuracy to trained&#xD;
      dermatologists in skin cancer diagnosis, however this relied on single-lesion analysis at&#xD;
      static time-points (with biopsy-proven diagnoses). The use of lesions scheduled for excision&#xD;
      (i.e., high clinical suspicion of melanoma) severely limits clinical applicability and a&#xD;
      Cochrane review concluded that utility of computer-aided detection for melanoma diagnosis in&#xD;
      secondary care remains unknown.The more clinically-relevant question is whether automated&#xD;
      detection of changes in naevi using sequential TBP images, referred to clinically as 'mole&#xD;
      mapping', can indeed improve early diagnosis of melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, TBP systems in the NHS have limited automation, restricted to storing and retrieving&#xD;
      images. Although one automated total body scanning system exists, and in the future may&#xD;
      incorporate AI-based diagnosis in addition to current image acquisition and lesion matching&#xD;
      algorithms, a full clinical validation and any subsequent implementation in the NHS will be&#xD;
      costly due to the investment required in the scanning system (current cost US $1 million).&#xD;
      Whether the same or better results can be achieved using more conventional image acquisition&#xD;
      equipment and sophisticated AI techniques is unknown. The investigators propose a novel&#xD;
      application of astronomical AI methods for early melanoma detection using standard TBP-based&#xD;
      surveillance of naevi which is currently employed in the NHS and can be used as an adjunct to&#xD;
      clinical review of individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of astronomical AI techniques to TBP monitoring of multiple naevi&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transient science in astronomy aims to detect and track evolution of new astronomical sources&#xD;
      such as exploding stars. Exhibiting both long- and short-term evolution, individual events&#xD;
      are detected by comparing new images with archival data and classified based on a feature&#xD;
      set, including transient brightness, colour, proper motion and extent. Cutting-edge&#xD;
      astronomical surveys monitor the sky every night over multi-year timescales to identify&#xD;
      subtle changes. AI techniques (such as random forests and recurrent neural networks; RNN)&#xD;
      which use the full time-series history and contextual information are routinely used to&#xD;
      identify and classify events probabilistically. With each new observation providing&#xD;
      additional information, astronomical transient surveys can routinely detect and characterise&#xD;
      new sources, such that the evolution of new sources can be predicted with 99.5% accuracy&#xD;
      based on only three time-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This challenge faced in astronomy is analogous to 'mole mapping' for individuals at high-risk&#xD;
      of developing melanoma; both naevi and astronomical sources can be characterised as distinct&#xD;
      sources against a homogeneous background which are tracked across multiple images to detect&#xD;
      change. The investigators therefore hypothesise that astronomical AI techniques are ideally&#xD;
      suited to address this clinical problem and are developing the MoleGazer project to test&#xD;
      this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop the MoleGazer algorithm, the investigators require a baseline dataset to apply&#xD;
      astronomical AI algorithms to TBP images to detect and track naevi across sequential images.&#xD;
      There are currently no publicly available databases of TBP images for the investigators to&#xD;
      test this feasibility and therefore in this study the aim is to collect:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a time-series cohort of TBP images taken at fixed sequential time-points over 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a baseline cohort of TBP images with sequential images taken at any time-points By&#xD;
           collecting TBP images it will allow the investigators to study the sensitivity of naevi&#xD;
           detection and characterisation on skin tone, lighting levels, image registration and&#xD;
           background subtraction techniques, enabling the investigators to also automate detection&#xD;
           of naevi and track their evolution in any sequential image that the study team has. The&#xD;
           development of this database will allow the investigators to demonstrate feasibility of&#xD;
           the application of astronomical AI methods to TBP images.&#xD;
