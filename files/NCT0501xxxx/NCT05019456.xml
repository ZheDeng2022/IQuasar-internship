  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viruses are a major health problem for the general public and at risk populations. Normally,&#xD;
      detection of antibody titers is the gold standard for determining the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      immune system following natural or vaccine caused immunization. However, determining the&#xD;
      effectiveness of other parts of the immune system are less common due to the difficulties&#xD;
      with testing. Furthermore, there is a critical need to address other therapies in case&#xD;
      vaccination is not successful in immuncompromised populations. Exercise has been shown to&#xD;
      increase the strength of the immune system against many types of viruses and therefore could&#xD;
      be simple way to improve immunity against the COVID-19 virus. The aim of this research is to&#xD;
      determine the effects of exercise on anti-viral immunity against many types of common viruses&#xD;
      before and after vaccination. We hypothesize that exercise will enhance the anti-viral&#xD;
      immunity before and after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 healthy volunteers (age 18-44 years) will be recruited to participate in this study.&#xD;
      For completion of Aim 1, three visits are needed totaling around 7 hours of the patient's&#xD;
      time and for Aim 2, three visits are needed totaling around 4.5 hours of the patient's time.&#xD;
      The initial visit will be for pre-screening and if deemed healthy enough to participate, an&#xD;
      exercise test to determine the VO2 max of the participant will be conducted. The following&#xD;
      visits will require a trained phlebotomist to insert an in-dwelling catheter and participants&#xD;
      will undergo a 20-minute incremental exercise trial. Approximately 50mL of blood will be&#xD;
      collected at four different timepoints: at rest, 60% VO2 max, 80% VO2 max, and 1-hr&#xD;
      post-exercise. All four collected blood samples will be used to expand viral specific T-cells&#xD;
      and compare IFN-γ rele&#xD;

      Acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections (RTI) due to respiratory viruses, such as,&#xD;
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza virus (PIV) and human&#xD;
      metapneumovirus (hMPV) are a major public health problem. During the 2019-2020 influenza&#xD;
      season, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) determined that influenza accounted for 38&#xD;
      million illnesses, 18 million medical visits, 405,000 hospitalizations, and 22,00 deaths, and&#xD;
      annual costs of approximately 87.1 billion in disease management in the United States.&#xD;
      Simultaneously, the COVID 19 pandemic is currently a major health crisis across of the United&#xD;
      States and worldwide with the number of cases surpassing 50 million and deaths totaling more&#xD;
      than 1.3 million. Latent herpesviruses (cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV), and&#xD;
      Varicella Zoster virus (VZV)) are other types of viral infections that are easily controlled&#xD;
      in healthy people but in immunocompromised people, such as elderly or cancer patients, these&#xD;
      latent viruses can become deadly. People receiving allogenic hematopoietic cell&#xD;
      transplantation (allo-HCT) are at high risk of CMV infection and can lead to significant&#xD;
      morbidity in transplant patients. Due to these populations. An acute bout of exercise, as&#xD;
      well as, chronic exercise training, have been shown to enhance anti-viral immunity against&#xD;
      many of these respiratory viruses and latent herpesviruses. However, the immune response to&#xD;
      viral infections is usually limited to the detection of humoral responses and the ability to&#xD;
      produce antibodies titers is the gold standard for determining the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      immune system in response to vaccination. However, monitoring the cellular immune response&#xD;
      following natural or vaccine induced immunization less standardized. Numerous laboratory&#xD;
      techniques have been developed to test the cellular immune response including, phenotyping&#xD;
      antigen specific T-cells, intracellular staining of cytokines, ELISPOT or ELISA for antigen&#xD;
      derived cytokine production, and antigen specific cytotoxicity assays. However, theses assays&#xD;
      are laborious and typically require highly specialized lab equipment and techniques.&#xD;
      Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) release assays have been developed to focus on cellular immunity and&#xD;
      could complement or replace these other laborious procedures. Thus we propose that a single&#xD;
      bout of exercise in humans will enhance the total antiviral immunity to numerous respiratory&#xD;
      viruses and latent herpesviruses, using a whole blood IFN-γ assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, there is a critical need to develop new therapeutics that can be used both&#xD;
      prophylactically and in the treatment of SARS CoV-2 infections. Adoptive cell therapy with&#xD;
      viral specific T-cells (VST) has been used effectively to treat viral infections in&#xD;
      immunocompromised patients, particularly in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. This procedure has been used for &gt;25 years with evidence of safety and&#xD;
      efficacy. No group to our knowledge has attempted to manufacture SARS CoV-2 VSTs as a&#xD;
      potential therapeutic to prevent and/or treat refractory SARS Co-V-2 infections during the&#xD;
      current COVID-19 pandemic. Having a personalized or 'third-party' T-cell product that is&#xD;
      'banked' and readily available could offer a life-saving intervention for many 'at-risk'&#xD;
      individuals (e.g. the elderly, cancer patients, diabetics, transplant recipients) should they&#xD;
      develop COVID-19. Current COVID-19 vaccination strategies are focused on inducing&#xD;
      neutralizing antibodies. This strain-specific approach is limited because immunity against&#xD;
      drifted strains that emerge from one season to the next, or even during a single season, is&#xD;
      often lost. Given that T-cells offer protection against multiple viral strains, there is&#xD;
      strong rationale to develop a vaccine that targets T-cells capable of providing coronavirus&#xD;
      heterotypic immunity. Dendritic Cell (DC) vaccines pulsed with viral antigen peptides have&#xD;
      been used successfully to elicit immune responses against influenza, hepatitis C and HIV and&#xD;
      could, therefore, serve as a personalized vaccine solution to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the&#xD;
      present study, we plan to demonstrate preclinical proof of concept for a DC based vaccine by&#xD;
      attempting to immunize &quot;humanized&quot; mice in vivo. Our proposed NOD-scid-IL2Rγnull (NSG) mouse&#xD;
      model has been used successfully to generate preclinical data for human DC and VST based&#xD;
      vaccines.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  'low risk' for submaximal exercise testing in accordance with the risk stratification&#xD;
             guidelines published by the American Heart Association and the American College of&#xD;
             Sports Medicine (AHA/ACSM criteria). We will also determine the participant's current&#xD;
             vaccine status (influenza, chickenpox, etc) and COVID-19 infection status. Infection&#xD;
             status will be determined via self-report and Spike protein IgG titer levels We will&#xD;
             simply ask the participant (self-report) when they received the vaccine and, if they&#xD;
             know, which vaccine they received (e.g. Moderna or Pfizer for the COVID-19 vaccine).&#xD;
             However, only participants that have been vaccinated (1-3 weeks after second dose) or&#xD;
             tested positive (greater than 2-months symptom free) for COVID-19 by either PCR,&#xD;
             antigen, or antibody testing will be eligible for Aim 2. After providing informed&#xD;
             consent, all participants will undergo a comprehensive screening procedure to ensure&#xD;
