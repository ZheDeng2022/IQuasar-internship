  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib&#xD;
      combination with capecitabine in maintenance treatment after first-line chemotherapy combined&#xD;
      with cetuximab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, most studies use chemotherapy combined with cetuximab or cetuximab alone as the&#xD;
      maintenance treatment scheme after the first-line regimen containing cetuximab. However, the&#xD;
      skin reaction caused by cetuximab and frequent infusion treatment will bring inconvenience to&#xD;
      patients. MACBETH study compared the maintenance of bevacizumab with cetuximab, although&#xD;
      there was no significant difference in PFS between them, the Bev group seemed to convey a&#xD;
      longer median OS. Fruquintinib is a highly selective anti angiogenesis TKI. This study aims&#xD;
      to explore the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib combined with capecitabine in maintenance&#xD;
      treatment after first-line chemotherapy combined with cetuximab. Both fruquintinib and&#xD;
      capecitabine are orally given, so this regimen may provide a maintenance treatment option&#xD;
      that is more manageable for patients in clinical practice.&#xD;
