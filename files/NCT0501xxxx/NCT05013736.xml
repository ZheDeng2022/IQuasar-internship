  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a longitudinal multiple-visit observational study, done to identify&#xD;
      possible bioindicators of recovery and repair of motor corticospinal pathways which may be&#xD;
      targeted by future interventions in infants with perinatal stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 participants will be recruited and complete 1 visit at time point 1 (0-2 months), and 2&#xD;
      visits at each timepoints 2-5 with windows of +- 4 weeks (3-6 months, 12 months, 18 months&#xD;
      and 24 months). Visits will consist of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) assessment during the&#xD;
      child's natural sleep and motor behavior assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perinatal stroke has disabling consequences; 50-75% of individuals will develop life-long&#xD;
      motor impairment, and 10-60% will also have cognitive deficits. These deficits lead to&#xD;
      challenges in the school and home environments, with decreased likelihood of employment and&#xD;
      independence and increased caregiver burden. Additionally, perinatal stroke is one of the&#xD;
      primary causes of cerebral palsy (CP), a chronic and disabling neurological condition&#xD;
      affecting motor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first two years of life constitute a critical period of brain development and heightened&#xD;
      neuroplasticity. There is now a consensus that, due to brain plasticity and rapid&#xD;
      development, providing an early intervention may result in optimal recovery and lower costs&#xD;
      of care. Unfortunately, researchers still have only limited understanding of how the brain&#xD;
      develops after perinatal stroke and as a result CP diagnoses are typically not made until two&#xD;
      years of age. There is an urgent need for very early diagnosis, prognosis and understanding&#xD;
      of mechanisms in order to develop novel early interventions to improve outcomes in perinatal&#xD;
      stroke with resultant CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrating study team's experience in studying and caring for this vulnerable infant stroke&#xD;
      population, they propose to use neuroimaging and behavioral assessments to analyze&#xD;
      associations between development patterns, especially in the CST, and potential diagnosis of&#xD;
      CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1. Map the structural integrity and connectivity of corticospinal pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2. Compare motor outcomes from clinical behavioral assessments against corticospinal&#xD;
           tract integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3. Identify the association between brain white-matter connectivity and general&#xD;
           movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Amendment approved on 10/22/2021 removes TMS intervention and outcomes, adds a study&#xD;
      time point at 0-2 months, and lowers the eligibility age to term.&#xD;

    <description>The HINE includes three sections, the Neurological Examination, the Development of Motor Functions and the State of Behaviour. The first section evaluates cranial nerve, posture, movements, tone and reflexes. These items are not age-dependent. The second section evaluates head control, sitting, voluntary grasping, rolling, crawling and walking. The third section evaluates state of consciousness, emotional state and social orientation.&#xD;
The maximum score for any one item is a score of 3 and the minimum is a score of 0. A subscore can be given for each section and the overall global score can be calculated by summing up all 26 items (range: 0-78), with higher scores indicating better neurological performance.</description>
