      This was a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 3-way crossover study&#xD;
      of SEP-363856 that was conducted in adult subjects with narcolepsy-cataplexy. Two oral doses&#xD;
      of SEP-363856 (25 and 50 mg QD for 14 days) were administered and compared with matching&#xD;
      placebo using a 6-treatment sequence, 3-period, 3-treatment, crossover design.&#xD;
