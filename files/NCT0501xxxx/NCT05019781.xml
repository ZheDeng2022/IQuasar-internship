  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Kinesio taping (KT) on playing-related&#xD;
      pain, upper extremity and hand function, grip and pinch strength in violin players. One&#xD;
      hundred seventeen participants who were professional violinists for at least two years were&#xD;
      randomized to receive either therapeutic tape application (KT group), a sham tape application&#xD;
      (placebo group) or no application (control group) for one week. The primary outcome was the&#xD;
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) in one week. The secondary outcomes were&#xD;
      the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Purdue Pegboard Test, grip and pinch strength. Outcome&#xD;
      measures were performed at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and one week later&#xD;
      (follow-up). Participants were asked to play the &quot;Violin Concerto No.2, Op.35&quot;, and pre-and&#xD;
      post-performance pain and grip and pinch strength were assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kinesio tape (KT), an alternative taping technique, is a method consisting of a tape with&#xD;
      elastic properties and stretching capabilities used to treat pain or prevent injuries in&#xD;
      conjunction with exercise.It has been concluded that KT intervention might not be helpful to&#xD;
      reduce dystonic patterns or improve playing ability in musicians with focal hand dystonia.&#xD;
      However, there is no enough study to conclude the effectiveness of KT application in&#xD;
      Playing-related musculoskeletal disorders. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of KT on playing-related pain, upper extremity and hand function, grip and pinch&#xD;
      strength in violin players compared to placebo KT application and control. As a secondary&#xD;
      outcome, the investigators explored whether the pre-and post-performance effect of the KT on&#xD;
      playing-related pain and grip and pinch strength.&#xD;

    <description>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score is a self-administered questionnaire designed to evaluate single or multiple disorders and impairment levels in the upper limbs. It comprises 30 core questions and optional eight questions, which are scored on a 5-point Likert scale (no difficulty - unable). The cumulative score is ranged from 0 to 100, where the higher scores indicate an increased degree of disability.</description>

Participants were asked to place a pin in a vertical array of holes first with the right hand, then with the left hand, and following with both hands as quickly as possible in 30 s. In the final subtest, participants were asked to assemble a metal pin, washer, collar, and the second washer with both hands with the highest speed possible during 60 s.</description>

    <description>A hydraulic hand dynamometer (Baseline Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer) is a practical tool to assess the hand's grip strength and pinch strength. For assessment of grip strength, the handle of the meter was adjusted at the second position. Each participant was instructed to squeeze the dynamometer's handle as hard as possible while positioning with the trunk upright; elbow flexed to 90°, forearm, and wrist in a neutral position. For assessment of pinch strength, the examiner held the distal end of the pinch gauge while the participant was instructed to squeeze the thumb pad according to different types of pinch grips (tip pinch, palmar pinch, key pinch). Assessments were repeated for the dominant and non-dominant hands. The mean values of the three grip strength and pinch strength measurements (kilogram-force) were calculated.</description>

    <description>Tape was applied to sternocleidomastoid, upper trapezius, deltoid, flexor palmaris longus muscles as suggested by Kase et al. (Kase, Wallis, Kase, &amp; Association, 2003). The tape was applied to the left side of the participants while sitting position because the violin is traditionally played by placing it on the left shoulder, balancing the neck using the left hand, and bowing with the right arm.</description>
