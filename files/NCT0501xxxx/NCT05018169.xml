      In this study, the investigators will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of a novel, behavior-based approach for treatment of depression symptoms in&#xD;
      adolescents with autism spectrum disorder or ASD (i.e., Behavioral Activation for Adolescents&#xD;
      with ASD, BA-A).&#xD;

      In this study, the investigators will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of a novel, behavior-based approach for treatment of depression symptoms in&#xD;
      adolescents with ASD (i.e., Behavioral Activation for Adolescents with ASD, BA-A). BA-A is a&#xD;
      12-session manualized treatment that utilizes established behavioral activation strategies&#xD;
      and incorporates common mental health treatment adaptations for young people with ASD. For&#xD;
      this project, the investigators will pilot BA-A with 23 adolescents (12-17 years of age) with&#xD;
      ASD and clinically significant depression symptoms. To investigate BA-A feasibility, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine treatment session attendance and therapist treatment fidelity. To&#xD;
      investigate BA-A acceptability, the investigators will utilize a mixed methods approach,&#xD;
      inclusive of surveys and qualitative interviews, to inform BA-A protocol refinement. To&#xD;
      investigate BA-A preliminary efficacy, the investigators will examine depression symptoms, as&#xD;
      well as secondary outcome measures, at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and one-month&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Session 1 focuses on the treatment rationale, structure, and expectations, and includes psychoeducation on depression. Session 2 focuses on working with parent(s) to help them support their teen through treatment. Session 3 focuses on the (situation)/behavior/feeling cycle and how teens individuals can get trapped in a cycle of depression and inactivity. Session 4 focuses on the assessment of values and choosing preferred activities to target. Session 5 focuses on teaching skills for in-person and electronic communication. Session 6 focuses on identifying barriers to treatment success. Session 7 focuses on teaching teens to handle disagreements. Session 8 focuses on the utilization of adaptive coping skills. Sessions 9-11 are meant to be used flexibly and should include review of any challenging concepts. Session 12 is the termination session and focuses on maintaining treatment gains. Between every session, teens will track their activity for homework.</description>
