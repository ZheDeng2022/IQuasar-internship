  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will define the postoperative analgesic effect of ultrasound-guided bilateral&#xD;
      modified-thoracoabdominal nerves block through perichondrial approach (M-TAPA) and compare&#xD;
      the control group in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the most common laparoscopic procedure and causes moderate to&#xD;
      severe postoperative pain. The M-TAPA block was described by Tulgar et al. for postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia of abdominal surgeries. However, studies showing the analgesic efficacy of this&#xD;
      block are lacking. In this prospective interventional trial, the investigators aim to define&#xD;
      the efficacy of M-TAPA block for laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgeries under general&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted as a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blinded&#xD;
      trial in a university hospital. Patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy&#xD;
      will be screened for enrollment in the study. After randomization, the patients in the Group&#xD;
      M-TAPA will receive bilateral M-TAPA block at the beginning of the operation defined by&#xD;
      Tulgar et al or no intervention (Group N). An anesthesiologist who performed M-TAPA block&#xD;
      will not involve in the data collection. Other health care workers who will involve in the&#xD;
      evaluation of postoperative pain scores, vital parameters, nausea and vomiting, anti-emetic&#xD;
      and opioid consumption will be blinded to group assignment.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Numerical Rating Scale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome variable is Numerical Rating Scale scores both at rest and motion. A blinded anesthesiologist will assess postoperative pain during rest and motion at the postoperative 15th,30th and 60th minute, second,6th, 12th and 24th hour by using 11-point Numerical Rating Scale which ranges from '0' (means no pain) to '10' (means worst pain imaginable).</description>

    <measure>Opioid consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>If NRS score of the patient is equal or over 4, IV 50 mg tramadol will be applied as a rescue analgesic.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Metoclopromide consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of the nausea will be assessed on a 4 -point scale (0=none 1=mild, 2=moderate 3=severe). If the patients nausea score is â‰¥2 the patient will receive 10 mg metoclopromide.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sedation score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Sedation level of the patients will be assessed on a 4-point scale (0=alert, 1=sleepy, easy to arouse verbally, 2= drowsy, 3=does not open eyes to verbal commands) at postoperative 15th,30th and 60th minute, second,6th, 12th and 24th hour.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of recovery levels between groups by using QoR-40 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative 24th hour</time_frame>
    <description>QoR-40, a 40-item questionnaire that provides a global score and sub-scores across five dimensions: patient support, comfort, emotions, physical independence, and pain. Each item is rated on a scale of 1-5, providing a minimum score of 40 and maximum of 200.Global QoR-40 scores range from 40 to 200 representing, respectively, very poor to outstanding quality of recovery. QoR-40 score will be recorded on the morning of operation and at the postoperative 24th hour.</description>

    <description>The patients in Group N will not receive any intervention. In the intervention and control groups, block sites will be covered with dressings, and patients and other health care workers will be blinded to treatment allocation. The pain intensity during rest and motion will be evaluated with the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Patients will receive standard multimodal analgesia comprising paracetamol, tenoxicam, and tramadol.</description>

    <description>After tracheal intubation, a high-frequency linear probe will be placed in the sagittal direction at the 10th costal margin, and transversus abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique muscles will be identified. A block needle will be inserted with in-plane technique and 25 ml 0.25 bupivacaine will be applied to the lower aspect of the chondrium. The same procedure will be repeated on the contralateral side. The pain intensity during rest and motion will be evaluated with the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Patients will receive standard multimodal analgesia comprising paracetamol, tenoxicam, and tramadol.</description>
