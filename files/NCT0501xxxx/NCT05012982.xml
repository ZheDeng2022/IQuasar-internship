  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a crossover phase 4 study to evaluate the impact of blood flow restriction on&#xD;
      immunometabolism and gene expression in immune cells in individuals undergoing rehabilitation&#xD;
      from anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind crossover phase 4 study in which participants will be randomized as to&#xD;
      the order in which each of two sessions are completed. Although all analyses will be&#xD;
      performed by a blinded investigator and participants will wear an uninflated AirBand as the&#xD;
      control intervention during the session in which BFR is not performed, participants will&#xD;
      likely know which of the two interventions is being performed on which study day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AirBands will be placed at each of the two training sessions and inflated while an&#xD;
      ultrasound probe is placed over the femoral artery. The cuff will be inflated until the&#xD;
      artery reaches 60% occlusion. The force will be applied using a wireless Bluetooth signal;&#xD;
      participants will not be asked to adjust the device. Participants will be observed by a&#xD;
      certified Personal Therapist throughout the training session in order to determine compliance&#xD;
      and ensure safety as is standard protocol for a physical therapy session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team hypothesizes that the BFR will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Promote an anabolic immunometabolic signature, reflected in the composition of serum&#xD;
           amino acid concentrations and anabolic hormone content&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enhance anaerobic glycolysis in leukocytes (which has been associated with increased&#xD;
           activation in other settings (Marelli-Berg and Jangani, 2018; Pearce and Pearce, 2013))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase leukocyte glucose and pyruvate concentrations, which corresponds to acute&#xD;
           energy provision to promote repair&#xD;
