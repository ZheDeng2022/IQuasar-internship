  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the different treatment methods efficacy in adult&#xD;
      individuals with plantar fasciitis. Pain, functionality level, range of motion, muscle&#xD;
      performance, quality of life will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the studies carried out to date; The comparison of the effectiveness of stretching&#xD;
      exercises and Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), the comparison of ESWT therapy and&#xD;
      ultrasound therapy, the comparison of manual therapy methods and stretching exercises were&#xD;
      studied. The effects of the use of double air cushion shoes and exercise therapy on pain&#xD;
      management and functional status were investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no study has been conducted to compare the effectiveness of ESWT treatment,&#xD;
      transverse friction massage and exercise training, and to determine whether technics have&#xD;
      superiority over each other. In this study, in addition to the evaluation of pain and&#xD;
      functionality; joint range of motion, muscle performance and quality of life are the&#xD;
      distinguishing features of the study. That's why researcher came up with the idea to work on&#xD;
      this topic. This study will shed light on future studies and will contribute to the&#xD;
      literature in the treatment of this diagnosis group. It will give us information about&#xD;
      whether the different treatment methods researcher use in physical therapy are superior to&#xD;
      each other.&#xD;

      This study will be conducted with adults over the age of 18, who applied to the Şanlıurfa&#xD;
      Training and Research Hospital Physical Therapy Unit, were diagnosed with plantar fasciitis,&#xD;
      had pain for at least 3 months, and agreed to participate in the study. Patients with&#xD;
      diabetes, systemic inflammatory disease, previous foot injury, foot fracture or malignancy,&#xD;
      neurological disease and pregnant women will not be included in the study. A total of 54&#xD;
      people will be included in the study. Patients will be divided into 3 groups of 18 people&#xD;
      each in a randomized controlled manner with a computer program. Different treatment methods&#xD;
      with proven effectiveness in the treatment of plantar fasciitis will be applied to each&#xD;
      group. The 1st group will be given ESWT therapy, the 2nd group will be given transverse&#xD;
      friction massage, and the 3rd group will be given exercises that are used in the treatment of&#xD;
      plantar fasciitis and have proven effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group ESWT treatment: &quot;6000 SWT Easy&quot; device will be used for ESWT treatment. The&#xD;
           plantar fascia of the patients will be applied once a week for 3 weeks. In each&#xD;
           application, 2400 beats, 2.0 bar pressure and 12 frequency doses of ESWT will be&#xD;
           applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group transverse friction massage: Transverse friction massage will be applied to the&#xD;
           plantar fascia of the patients for 3 weeks, 3 days a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and&#xD;
           Fridays, with a break for 1 day and 15 minutes each. Transverse friction massage, when&#xD;
           the patient is in the supine semi-lying position, the big toe will be dorsiflexed and&#xD;
           the plantar fascia will be stretched, and in this position, it will be applied in the&#xD;
           direction that will be transverse to the plantar fascia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group exercise group: Stretching the plantar fascia and gastrocsoleus muscles of the&#xD;
           patients, towel picking exercises with the foot intrinsic muscles, heel drop exercises&#xD;
           will be given. All stretching and exercises will be applied once a day, 5 days a week,&#xD;
           for 3 weeks. Plantar fascia stretching exercises will be performed with a&#xD;
           physiotherapist; While the patient is lying in the supine position, 30 seconds of&#xD;
           stretching will be performed using the windlass (windlass) mechanism (toes are brought&#xD;
           to dorsi flexion). This stretch will be repeated 3 times. Gastrocsoleus stretching&#xD;
           exercises will be studied with a physiotherapist. In the supine position, the&#xD;
           gastrocsoleus muscles will be stretched for 10 seconds and stretching will be performed&#xD;
           with 10 repetitions. Towel collection exercises for the foot intrinsic muscles will be&#xD;
           practiced in 3 sets, 15 repetitions per day. Heel drop exercise will be applied in 3&#xD;
           sets of 15 repetitions per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated before treatment and 3 days after the end of 3 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. In the evaluations to be made; Sociodemographic information such as diagnosis,&#xD;
      age, height, weight, education level, gender of the patients will be recorded with the&#xD;
      prepared data registration form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain sensation will be evaluated with a visual analog scale. For pain severity, a 100mm&#xD;
      horizontal line will be written as 0 points at the beginning &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 points at the&#xD;
      end of &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;. Patients will be asked to mark the pain patients feel on this&#xD;
      100 mm long horizontal line. The length of the place marked by the patient will be recorded&#xD;
      in mm. Pain at rest, during activity, and at night will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foot functional evaluation will be done with the foot function index. This index consists of&#xD;
      3 sub-scales in which various functional states and pain sensation are evaluated and a total&#xD;
      of 23 questions. Patients will score the questions in these subscales between 0 and 10. It&#xD;
      will be evaluated out of 230 points in total. The higher the score, the worse the functional&#xD;
      status is affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional status will be evaluated with triple hop test. The patient will be asked to stand&#xD;
      on a single extremity to be tested and hop forward 3 times consecutively at the maximum&#xD;
      level, the total distance taken will be recorded, the average of the 3 repetitions will be&#xD;
      taken and recorded in cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Joint range of motion will be evaluated with a universal goniometer. The patient will be&#xD;
      asked to bring the ankle to dorsi flexion and plantar flexion while lying on back, and how&#xD;
      far patient can move will be measured in degrees with a goniometer. The active maximum amount&#xD;
      of movement made by the patient will be measured and recorded in degrees (°).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life will be evaluated with the Short Form-36 scale. The scale consists of 8&#xD;
      sub-parameters and 36 questions. These sub-parameters are; physical function, body pain,&#xD;
      limitation due to physical problems, limitation due to emotional problems, emotional&#xD;
      well-being, social function, energy/fatigue, general health perception. The higher the score&#xD;
      obtained from the scale, the higher the patient's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance of the foot flexor muscles will be evaluated with the heel rise test. While&#xD;
      standing, the patient will be asked to raise the heel as many times as possible for 30&#xD;
      seconds. How many times patients raise their heels in 30 seconds will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, permission was obtained from the Harran University Health Sciences Institute&#xD;
      Non-Drug Clinical Research Ethics Committee before starting the research.&#xD;
