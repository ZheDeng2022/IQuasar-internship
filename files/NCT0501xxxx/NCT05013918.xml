    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to propose an &quot;Oral Health and Nutrition Integrated Service&#xD;
      Model&quot; for the long-term care system based on the establishment of the assessment tools for&#xD;
      oral hygiene and health, swallowing ability, nutritional status and food texture. This&#xD;
      service model will be as the reference for long-term care policy making. This project&#xD;
      includes four aspects such as evaluation tools, professional training, community promotion&#xD;
      and policy development which will be completed in 5 stages. In the first stage, we will&#xD;
      search and review the domestic and international materials which are related with the tools&#xD;
      for evaluating oral hygiene and health (oral health assessment tool, OHAT), swallowing&#xD;
      ability (EAT-10, eating assessment tool; functional oral intake scale, FOIS), nutritional&#xD;
      status (Taiwan version of mini nutritional assessment, MNA) and food texture (Taiwan food&#xD;
      texture grading system). We will also inventory the resources of oral health and nutrition&#xD;
      before importing to community. In the second stage, an expert meeting will be held to&#xD;
      determine the evaluation tool and the teaching materials of the training courses. In the&#xD;
      third stage, an institution (En Chu Kong Nursing Home) will be the filed area to establish&#xD;
      the &quot;Oral Health and Nutrition Integrated Service Model&quot;. At the same time, assistants and&#xD;
      instructors will be trained for conducting the assessment of oral health and nutrition status&#xD;
      in the institution. Then, the status of oral health, chewing ability and nutrition will be&#xD;
      investigated in the institution. In the fourth stage, we will modified the materials of&#xD;
      training programs based on the data from resources inventory for the community (Zhong-He&#xD;
      District, for example: Li-Xing Village, De-Xing Village or Zheng-Xing Village). Furthermore,&#xD;
      the training programs for assistants and instructors will be also held in the community&#xD;
      during the fourth stage. In the fifth stage, based on the evaluation tools and the integrated&#xD;
      service models, the practical suggestions will be provided for the long-term care service&#xD;
      policy making and implementation.&#xD;
