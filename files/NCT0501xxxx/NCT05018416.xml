    <textblock>
      Multi-center, prospective, open-label, double-arm, randomized, redose study whereby eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized 1:1 after kidney biopsy to 1 of 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 subjects will&#xD;
      receive 2 REACT injections in the biopsied and non-biopsied contralateral kidneys 3 months&#xD;
      apart (+60 days). Cohort 2 subjects will receive 1 REACT injection into the biopsied kidney&#xD;
      and if a pre-defined trigger is met, will undergo a second REACT injection into the&#xD;
      contralateral kidney. Both cohorts will be followed for 24 months after the final REACT&#xD;
      injection. If a Cohort 2 subject does not meet a trigger, the subject will be followed for 24&#xD;
      months after the first injection.&#xD;

      ProKidney' s Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT), formerly known as Neo-Kidney Augment&#xD;
      (NKA), is an injectable product composed of an autologous population of selected renal cells&#xD;
      (SRC) formulated in a gelatin-based hydrogel or cryopreservation solution. In this trial,&#xD;
      REACT will be formulated with cryopreservation solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal cells are obtained from a patient via a standard percutaneous kidney biopsy procedure&#xD;
      following standard medical biopsy practice and guidelines, and the SRC population are&#xD;
      selected through a defined manufacturing process. Selected renal cells, a renal cell&#xD;
      population naturally involved in renal repair and regeneration, are formulated with&#xD;
      cryoprotectant. REACT will be injected into the kidney cortex either in the biopsied or&#xD;
      contralateral kidney. Access to the kidney is obtained using a standard percutaneous&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;

To manufacture REACT, biopsy tissue from each enrolled subject will be sent to ProKidney, in whose Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) facilities, renal cells will be expanded and SRC isolated. Selected renal cells will be frozen at a concentration of 100 × 106 cells/mL and shipped to the clinical site</description>

&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of T1DM or T2DM, controlled per institutional standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a clinical diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy as the underlying cause&#xD;
             of renal disease (diagnosis does not have to be confirmed via renal biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a serum glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level less than 10% at the&#xD;
             Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a documented clinical diagnosis of an eGFR between 20 and 50&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73m2 inclusive not requiring renal dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has stable blood pressure and is maintained on a stable anti-hypertensive&#xD;
             medication regimen, if treatment for hypertension is necessary. If treatment includes&#xD;
             an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker&#xD;
             (ARB), that treatment must be the maximum tolerated daily dose for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to randomization or, if the treatment includes a sodium glucose cotransporter 2&#xD;
             inhibitor (SGLT2i) at any dose, for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: A maximum tolerated daily dose of an ACEi or ARB is defined as the maximum tolerated&#xD;
        dose for diabetic nephropathy (for agents with an approved indication for diabetic&#xD;
        nephropathy in patients with T1DM or T2DM, i.e., losartan and irbesartan) or the maximum&#xD;
        tolerated dose for hypertension (for agents without an approved indication for diabetic&#xD;
        nephropathy), unless side effects or adverse events (AE) limit the use of the maximum dose.&#xD;
        For subjects who are not on a maximum daily dose of an ACEi or ARB, Investigators will be&#xD;
        required to document why a higher dose is contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A minimum of 3 measurements of eGFR (by sCr or cystatin C) must be obtained at least 3&#xD;
             months apart within 24 months prior to the Screening Visit to define the rate of&#xD;
             progression of CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject agrees and is able to refrain from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
             (NSAIDs), including aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, dipyridamole, and other platelet&#xD;
             aggregation inhibitors during the period beginning 7 days before through 7 days&#xD;
             following the percutaneous renal biopsy and REACT injection(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Aspirin, at a dose of up to 100 mg/day, may be continued if doing so is the standard&#xD;
        of care at the investigational site, is accepted for primary prevention of heart disease in&#xD;
        subjects with diabetes who are older than 40 years of age or have additional risk factors&#xD;
        for cardiovascular disease or stroke, and for whom the perceived benefits of aspirin&#xD;
        therapy outweigh the risks associated with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject agrees and is able to refrain from oral ingestion of fish oil supplements&#xD;
             during the period beginning 7 days before through 7 days following the percutaneous&#xD;
             renal biopsy and REACT injection(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is willing and able to cooperate with all aspects of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is willing and able to provide signed informed consent.&#xD;

             continue if approved by the Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has hemoglobin levels less than 10 g/dL and is not responsive to the&#xD;
             standard medical intervention for CKD-related anemia prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject appears to be at possibly increased risk of either thromboembolism or&#xD;
             bleeding because of abnormal results at the Screening Visit for any of the following&#xD;
             tests: activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time-international&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject has a bleeding disorder(s) or is maintained on any anticoagulant agents,&#xD;
             including fractionated heparin preparations, Coumadin® (warfarin), or direct thrombin&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject is not a good candidate to undergo percutaneous REACT injection, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the interventionalist or proceduralist who will perform the procedure.&#xD;
             This includes confirming the subject has contraindications for undergoing the&#xD;
             procedure based on depth of the kidneys, positioning limitations, body habitus, and if&#xD;
             the kidneys are greater than 15 cm from skin surface to kidney capsule.&#xD;

             injection procedure (such as horseshoe kidney variant and unexplained hydronephrosis),&#xD;
             any other documented renal pathology that would interfere with the REACT injection&#xD;
             procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Anatomic abnormalities and benign conditions are not exclusionary if the kidney&#xD;
        remains accessible and meets the criteria to receive the REACT injection.&#xD;

             not limited to, a history of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the year prior to&#xD;
             screening, frequent hypoglycemic episodes, or hypoglycemia unawareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is awaiting a pancreas transplant.&#xD;

             aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] greater than 3 times the&#xD;

          -  The subject has a positive test result for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface&#xD;
             antigen, a positive test result for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies, or a positive&#xD;
             test result for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: At the discretion of the Investigator, a subject who gives a history of a treated and&#xD;
        cured HCV infection may be screened with a test for viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) and, if a&#xD;
        cure is demonstrated, the subject may be enrolled.&#xD;

             abstinence. Or the female subject is unwilling to continue Note: A highly effective&#xD;
             method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e.,&#xD;
             less than one percent per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as&#xD;
