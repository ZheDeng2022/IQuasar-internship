  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized trial to evaluate a proactive, opt-out&#xD;
      model of provider contact to deliver smoking cessation support for people living with HIV&#xD;
      compared to standard care support delivered through traditional clinic pathways.&#xD;
      Investigators will also evaluate implementation outcomes to identify barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators towards future implementation. Investigators hope to define best practices and&#xD;
      optimize the delivery of smoking cessation interventions for people living with HIV.&#xD;
