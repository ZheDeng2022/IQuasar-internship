  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium is one of the most frequent adverse events following elective&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery and is associated with cognitive impairment at discharge, as well as&#xD;
      in-hospital and long-term mortality, however, despite being a well-recognized problem there&#xD;
      is a dearth of effective interventions for prevention and management. A modifiable risk&#xD;
      factor associated with postoperative delirium is poor postoperative pain control, and by&#xD;
      improving the pain regimen the investigators may be able to decrease the incidence and/or&#xD;
      severity of postoperative delirium. In this study, the investigators seek to study whether a&#xD;
      postoperative intravenous infusion of lidocaine, known to improve pain control in other&#xD;
      contexts, can decrease the risk of postoperative delirium and other opioid-related side&#xD;
      effects, following major reconstructive spinal surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a pilot prospective randomized double-blinded&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial of 60 patients undergoing major elective reconstructive spinal&#xD;
      surgery to investigate the effect of a postoperative lidocaine infusion on the incidence and&#xD;
      severity of postoperative delirium. Major spine surgery is defined as posterior spine fusions&#xD;
      &gt;3 levels of instrumentation and fusion, which allows standardization of the level of&#xD;
      surgical insult and postoperative analgesic requirements. The intraoperative anesthetic&#xD;
      regimen will be standardized to consist of total intravenous anesthesia using sevoflurane,&#xD;
      propofol, lidocaine and magnesium (institutional protocol), and fentanyl with boluses allowed&#xD;
      per provider discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment, inclusion and exclusion criteria: All surgeons will be contacted before&#xD;
      the start of the study to obtain their consent to allow their patients to be studied. The&#xD;
      research team has successfully completed multiple National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded&#xD;
      cohort and clinical trials at our institution with no surgeon refusing to participate.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be screened from the operating room roster to determine their&#xD;
      eligibility. Patients will be contacted by phone or in person for preoperative evaluation.&#xD;
      Please see the other section for inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment will be consecutive patients meeting inclusion criteria. Reductions in opioid&#xD;
      consumption by ~25% using intravenous lidocaine infusions have been shown to decrease opioid&#xD;
      related side effects, but there is essentially no data linking a specific degree of opioid&#xD;
      reduction to effects on delirium (46, 47). The most comparable published study to the&#xD;
      investigators' proposal is work done by Kaba (2009) studying a lidocaine infusion for&#xD;
      abdominal surgery where the average opioid reduction was ~50% (24mg +/-16.3 of piritramide in&#xD;
      the placebo vs. 10.33mg +/- 10.33 in the treatment group). Assuming similar reduction in&#xD;
      opioids of 50% and similar variance, the proposed sample size, 60 (30 per group), provides a&#xD;
      power of 0.8 (alpha = 0.05) to detect a 25% decrease in the use of postoperative opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Patients will be randomized utilizing block randomization by a random number&#xD;
      generator into either placebo or treatment groups by the research pharmacist. The&#xD;
      randomization scheme will be blinded to the researchers and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic Management: The anesthetic management will be standardized. All patients will&#xD;
      receive a general anesthetic to consisting of 50% oxygen and total intravenous anesthetics&#xD;
      consisting of infusions of propofol (60-150 mcg/kg/min), lidocaine (1 mg/kg bolus, then 1.5&#xD;
      mg/kg/hr infusion), magnesium (30 mg/kg bolus, then 6 mg/kg/hr infusion), fentanyl (1 mcg/kg&#xD;
      bolus, then 1 mcg/kg/hr infusion, prn boluses), and 0.3 Minimum Alveolar Concentration (MAC)&#xD;
      of sevoflurane. Anesthesiologists will be requested to maintain the patient's arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure to within 20% of their preoperative baseline using vasoactive agents. Patients will&#xD;
      receive mechanical ventilation to maintain normocarbia. Intraoperative warming devices will&#xD;
      be used to keep body temperature between 36-37˚C. Oxygen saturation will be maintained &gt;95%.&#xD;
      Muscle relaxants will be used during tracheal intubation and only as clinically indicated at&#xD;
      other time periods. All patients will be continuously monitored before the induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia and during surgery with SEDline Brain Function Monitor (Masimo, Inc., Irvine CA),&#xD;
      a standard monitor at our institution. Anesthesiologists will be asked to minimize&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) burst suppression by adjusting the doses of anesthetic drugs since&#xD;
      prior studies have suggested a relationship between burst suppression and postoperative&#xD;
      delirium (48, 49). Postoperatively, but before discharge from the post anesthetic care unit&#xD;
      or upon arrival to the intensive care unit, patients will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      placebo or a lidocaine infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please see the other sections for a list of primary and secondary outcomes. Briefly the&#xD;
      primary outcome is the effect of an intravenous lidocaine infusion on the incidence and&#xD;
      severity of postoperative delirium. Secondary outcomes include intravenous lidocaine safety&#xD;
      and tolerability, the effect of a lidocaine infusion on opioid usage, pain scores, opioid&#xD;
      related side effects and functional benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The investigators will use descriptive statistics to summarize the&#xD;
      characteristics of the study population by treatment groups. The investigators will use an&#xD;
      intention to treat paradigm in assessing the effect of the intervention on the outcomes of&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate the safety of a continuous infusion of lidocaine in the first two days&#xD;
      after surgery. The investigators will compare the proportion of patients that experienced at&#xD;
      least one of the adverse events between the two groups using either the Fisher Exact Test or&#xD;
      Chi Square Test as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To compare postoperative pain, and opioid usage between patients who receive placebo&#xD;
      infusions vs. lidocaine infusions. All opioid doses will be converted to oral morphine&#xD;
      equivalents. Specifically, hydromorphone and fentanyl doses will be converted to morphine&#xD;
      equivalents using the conversion formula: 1.5 mg of hydromorphone = 10 mg of morphine&#xD;
      equivalents, 0.1mg of fentanyl = 10 mg of morphine equivalents (56,57). The investigators&#xD;
      will compare the average pain scores and opioids doses between the two treatment groups using&#xD;
      two-sample t-tests or Mann-Whitney nonparametric tests if the data are not normally&#xD;
      distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To compare the incidence of postoperative delirium between patients who receive&#xD;
      placebo infusions vs. lidocaine infusions. Chi-square tests will be conducted to determine&#xD;
      the association between lidocaine infusions and incident delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To compare the functional recovery of patients between patients who receive placebo&#xD;
      infusions vs. lidocaine infusions. The investigators will compare the results of the 36-Item&#xD;
      Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), time to discharge, and&#xD;
      ability to participate in physical therapy, using the two sample t-test or Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      nonparametric test for continuous outcomes, and Fisher exact Test or Chi Square test for&#xD;
      binary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant biologic variables - All analyzes will include sex and ethnicity as covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing Data - Sensitivity Analyses to Assess the Effects of Missing Data: The investigators&#xD;
      will use model-based methods, such as Heckman and Predicted mean matching models to determine&#xD;
      the effect of missing observations for each of these reasons on the estimates. The&#xD;
      investigators will track the number of missing responses for delirium, and upwardly adjust&#xD;
      the sample size accordingly. This strategy may result in having to recruit and follow an&#xD;
      additional subject per week in the second year of data collection, which is feasible. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct sensitivity analyses to determine the effect of missing data on&#xD;
      the outcomes of interest.&#xD;
