  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided selective supraclavicular nerve block on pain control after Hickman&#xD;
      catheter, chemoport, or Perm cath insertion in children.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric patients undergoing surgical insertion of a Hickman catheter, chemoport, or&#xD;
      Permcath are randomly assigned to a test group (Ultrasound-guided selective supraclavicular&#xD;
      nerve block with Ropivacaine) and a control group (Nerve block is not performed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after induction of general anesthesia, in the test group, the supraclavicular&#xD;
      nerve block was selectively performed using ultrasound using 0.1mL/kg of 0.5% Ropivacaine&#xD;
      (Maximum dose: 5mL), and the nerve block was not completed in the control group. After that,&#xD;
      a Hickman catheter, chemoport, or Permcath is surgically inserted in the usual way and&#xD;
      allowed to recover from anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain score is evaluated between 10 and 30 minutes of entering the recovery room (1 hour&#xD;
      after the procedure) and 1 hour, 3 hours, and 24 hours after leaving the recovery room by&#xD;
      another research team who is unaware of the group assignment. In addition, the use of&#xD;
      additional analgesic drugs and related side effects were collected before discharge.&#xD;

    <description>It is confirmed by lung ultrasound in the recovery room. Hemidiaphragm visualization by ultrasound is achieved from an anterior approach, with the patient in a supine position.&#xD;
At the ultrasound, the diaphragm appears as a thick echogenic line. M-mode US may be used to measure the direction of diaphragmatic motion and the amplitude of excursion.&#xD;
The two indexes usually used for the diagnosis of diaphragmatic paralysis include a Tdi value &lt;2 mm and a diaphragm thickening fraction (TFdi)value &lt;20% [Tdi: The thickening of the diaphragm, TFdi: (thickness at the end of the inspiration - thickness at the end of expiration)/thickness at the end of expiration (in %)].</description>

    <description>The nerve involved in the operation of Hickman catheter, chemoport, and Perm cath is the supraclavicular nerve. Therefore, it is judged that if only this nerve is selectively blocked, pain control can be effectively performed with a small amount of local anesthetic, and relatively few side effects occur.</description>
