    <textblock>
      Fixed orthodontic appliances increase the rate of plaque accumulation around orthodontic&#xD;
      brackets and gingival margins. It was also found that the amount of plaque accumulation and&#xD;
      S.mutans level around banded orthodontic appliances is much higher than unbanded&#xD;
      appliances.appliances. This increases the importance of regular use of conventional tooth&#xD;
      brushing with or without mouthwash for better control of plaque accumulation. Different&#xD;
      studies had been conducted to compare the effect of different mouthwashes on plaque&#xD;
      accumulation and rate of different bacterial colonization. Among which is Chlorhexidine&#xD;
      mouthwash that showed highest antiseptic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S. mutans bacteria are the main reason for the formation of plaque and dental caries&#xD;
      associated with the use of fixed braces in 30-70% of patients. It also causes the appearance&#xD;
      of white spot lesions on the teeth during and after fixed orthodontic treatment. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is necessary to find solutions to overcome the occurrence of these effects resulting from&#xD;
      the use of fixed braces, which usually makes it difficult for the accessing of various&#xD;
      cleaning tools to these narrow places around the orthodontic brackets. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      necessary to find an effective and easy way to clean the teeth that guarantees the safety of&#xD;
      the patient's teeth during and after orthodontic treatment.Although mechanical plaque removal&#xD;
      is very effective way in controlling amount of plaque accumulation, it is not applicable for&#xD;
      subsequent application in patients with fixed orthodontic appliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Streptococcus mutans is considered as the main colonizer in the multi-species plaque biofilm.&#xD;
      Studies found that as early as one week after bonding of fixed orthodontic appliances,&#xD;
      significant changes occurred in the oral microbiota forming microbial plaque at the metal&#xD;
      surfaces and the adjacent tooth surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of three different oral hygiene protocols on&#xD;
      the amount of Streptococcus mutans colonization in adult patients with fixed orthodontic&#xD;
      appliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that there is no difference on the amount of Streptococcus mutans&#xD;
      colonization between using combined tooth brushing, interdental brushing and mouthwash than&#xD;
      using tooth brushing and interdental brushing in comparison to tooth brushing alone in adult&#xD;
      patients with fixed orthodontic appliance.&#xD;

      The study will take place in the clinic of the Orthodontic Department at the Faculty of Oral&#xD;
      and Dental Medicine, Cairo University. The recruited sample will be from the Egyptian&#xD;
      population. The principal investigator will recruit the patients according to planned&#xD;
      eligibility criteria from the clinic of Orthodontic Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo&#xD;
      University. Screening of patients will continue until the total number (27 patients) of&#xD;
      participants for the study is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal investigator will fill a medical history questionnaire for every patient to exclude&#xD;
      the presence of any systemic condition interfering with orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper examination of the oral structures is needed to identify caries, fracture or missing&#xD;
      teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal investigator will be carefully examining gingival tissues for any gingivitis,&#xD;
      periodontitis, recession or lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal investigator will check the potential patient to fulfill the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Then will ask every participant to sign an informed consent about the study. Full set of&#xD;
      records (study models, lateral cephalometric radiographs, photos) will be taken by the&#xD;
      principal investigator for every patient as part of the routine procedure for treatment of&#xD;
      patients in the outpatient clinic of the Orthodontic Department, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bonding of upper and lower arches with bracket prescription MBT 0.022-inch (American&#xD;
      orthodontics) and bondable tubes on molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      American Orthodontics O-ties will be standardized for all participants. The orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment procedure by implementation of NiTi wires for the alignment and initial leveling&#xD;
      stages, followed by stainless steel wires for the subsequent stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the initial bonding appointment, an oral hygiene kit (toothbrush Oral-B soft,&#xD;
      fluoride-toothpaste) will be given to all participants. According to BOS oral hygiene&#xD;
      leaflet, standardized oral hygiene instructions are given. Participants will be shown how to&#xD;
      use the items in the kit followed by participants practicing their use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In intervention group 1: Fluoride-based toothpaste is used for tooth-brushing beside using&#xD;
      interdental brushes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In intervention group 2: Chlorhexidine mouthwash is added to the previous oral hygiene&#xD;
      protocol being used beside fluoride-based toothpaste and interdental brushes. CHX mouthwash&#xD;
      is used by patients according to the manufacturer's instructions 15 min after tooth-brushing:&#xD;
      5 mL of 0.2% CHX was applied for 60s in the morning and at bedtime. The patients will be&#xD;
      instructed not to consume any liquid or food at least 30 min after using the prescribed&#xD;
      mouthwash. All patients are asked to bring the mouthwash bottle, so we could determine&#xD;
      patient compliance based on how much liquid was left.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any participant shows any signs of CHX hypersensitivity, the intervention will be&#xD;
      discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In control group: regular tooth-brushing is carried out using fluoride-based toothpaste&#xD;
      supplied only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Silness and Löe (1964) each patient's plaque index (PI) is determined by only&#xD;
      the index teeth (tooth numbers: 16, 12, 24, 36,32, and 44). Briefly, determination of PI will&#xD;
      be performed as follows: running an explorer along the surfaces of the teeth both supra and&#xD;
      subgingivally which give better results than the use of disclosing solution. Prior to&#xD;
      examination gingivae and teeth are dried by a blast of air. No cotton is used in order not to&#xD;
      interfere with the soft deposits. Each of the four surfaces of the teeth (buccal, lingual,&#xD;
      mesial and distal) is given a score from 0-3, score 0 when there is no plaque on the tooth&#xD;
      wall, 1 when plaque is invisible to the naked eye but can be collected using a probe, 2 when&#xD;
      plaque is visible at the gingival margin, and 3 when plaque not only is visible at the&#xD;
      gingival margin but also cover a significant part of the tooth wall. The scores from the four&#xD;
      areas of the tooth are added and divided by four in order to give the plaque index for the&#xD;
      tooth. The indices for the teeth (incisors, premolars and molars) may be grouped to designate&#xD;
      the index for the group of teeth. By adding the indices for the teeth and dividing by six the&#xD;
      index for the patient is obtained. The index for the patient is thus an average score of the&#xD;
      number of areas examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection: Samples will be taken for both groups at fixed timelines where the&#xD;
      quantities of S. mutans will be calculated in the form of colony-forming units (CFU). First&#xD;
      sample will be collected immediately before orthodontic brackets bonding (T0). The second&#xD;
      sample will be collected four weeks after bonding (T1). Each group of patients will be used&#xD;
      to adhering to the prescribed oral hygiene protocol. Participants are asked to refrain from&#xD;
      eating and drinking for ≥1 h prior to sample collection, and they are required to rinse their&#xD;
      mouths and sit quietly prior to sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Achieving good communication skills with patients to improve the efficacy of hygiene control&#xD;
      strategies is of the utmost importance. For achieving patient adherence to the prescribed&#xD;
      oral hygiene protocol prescribed, the patients are motivated by chair-side motivation and&#xD;
      active reminder motivation. Chair-side motivation is more formal and professional, focused&#xD;
      about unwanted drawbacks of improper oral hygiene to create a sense of being threatened if&#xD;
      patients do not follow instructions. Beside intentionally informing the patients that they&#xD;
      are enrolled in the study, result in sense of being observed through Hawthorne effect.&#xD;
      Moreover, using active reminder motivation allow for patients' compliance to their oral&#xD;
      hygiene by a reminder system they prefer. This is achieved by using cell phones to send&#xD;
      reminding SMS and app-based text messages to patients or their parents. Setting a&#xD;
      WhatsApp-based chatting room for participants to share teeth selfies, this allow for better&#xD;
      compliance to oral hygiene through Hawthorne effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A colleague outside the research team will enter the data and organize it in excel sheets in&#xD;
      the computer of the orthodontic department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be sent to a specialized statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specialized statistician will be responsible for the statistical analysis of the study&#xD;
      by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Presenting the data as mean, standard deviation (SD) and Standard error (SE) values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Using Paired t-test to compare between the pre-and post -treatment data for each group&#xD;
           then using independent t-test to compare between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For this study, the specialized statistician will use IBM11 SPSS12 Statistics&#xD;
                Version 20 for Windows to perform the required statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The significance level will be P ≤ 0.05. Highly significant variables are detected&#xD;
                when P value is less than 0.01.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessors Reliability:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To achieve high reliability for measurements, the supervisor will choose a&#xD;
           well-experienced inter-examiner during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each examiner will complete the measurements on a model and will repeat the procedure&#xD;
           after one week to assess the intra- and inter-examiner reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The supervisor will compare the measurements of the two assessors for disagreement with&#xD;
           a difference of more than one millimeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The supervisor will evaluate the amount of variation in measurements among and between&#xD;
           examiners to test the performance of each assessor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The examiner with less reliability will receive additional training but will be replaced&#xD;
           during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The specialized statistician will calibrate the intra and inter-examiner reliability for&#xD;
           the measurements of the study by the Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). The&#xD;
           closer the ICC to 1.0, the higher reliability between assessors. According to Fleiss:&quot;&#xD;
           ICC values between 0.7 and 0.9 represent good reliability.&quot; The kappa scores between&#xD;
           study examiners will be calculated, a range of 0.60-0.80 will represent acceptable&#xD;
           reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of the study will be strictly done by the supervisors periodically. They will&#xD;
      monitor all the steps of the followed protocol and find solutions to all troubles that have&#xD;
      occurred during the trial performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harms If any harms occur to the patient before entry to the study, it will be reported as&#xD;
      unrelated. If it happens after, it will be recorded and documented by the primary&#xD;
      investigator. Severity of harms and potential causal relationship with intervention will be&#xD;
      addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audit The trial will be audited by the supervisors in orthodontic department at Cairo&#xD;
      university frequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent All the details of the trail and the possibility of recruitment will be&#xD;
      clearly introduced to the patients. Each patient signed an informed consent before he or she&#xD;
      being recruited into the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to data To avoid any disclosure of the resulted data all the members of the research&#xD;
      team will have access to the study data besides 2 data investigators will be allowed to&#xD;
      access the trial data to be able to investigate our results at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-trial care Orthodontic treatment will be continued by the principle investigator until&#xD;
      the case is finished or will be referred to other colleague according to orthodontic clinic&#xD;
      rules of Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.&#xD;
