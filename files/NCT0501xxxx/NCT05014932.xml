      Evaluation of noise induced by ceramic-ceramic friction torques of total hip prostheses with&#xD;
      customized femoral stem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective and prospective multicentric study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On a series of patients operated on for more than two years after a total hip arthroplasty&#xD;
      that resulted in the implantation of a ceramic-on-ceramic prosthesis with a customized&#xD;
      femoral stem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To assess the frequency of occurrence of joint noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the characteristics of the noise nuisance (date of onset, frequency,&#xD;
           intensity, impact...)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the individual and surgical factors associated with the occurrence of noise&#xD;
           pollution.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of occurrence of noise nuisance (assessed in relation to the total number of patients and the total number of prostheses).&#xD;
The frequency of occurrence of noise nuisance will be analysed descriptively. The time elapsed until the occurrence of the noise nuisance will be additionally assessed by a Kaplan-Meier analysis.</description>

    <measure>Oxford Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford Hip Score questionnaire (OHS 12) consists of 12 questions. It measures pain (6 items) and hip function (6 items) in relation to activities of daily living such as walking, dressing and sleep disturbance. Each question has 5 possible answers. Each has a value from 0 to 4, with 0 representing the highest level of severity and 4 representing no or almost no symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The HOOS questionnaire is a self-administered questionnaire specific to hip arthroplasty. It consists of 40 questions with 5 domains: 5 questions on symptoms and stiffness; 10 questions on pain; 17 questions on functional results in daily life; 4 questions on sport and leisure activities; 4 questions on quality of life.&#xD;
It includes 5 sub-scores, one sub-score per domain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Forgotten Joint Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Forgotten Joint Score (FJS-12) is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 12 questions assessing the degree of forgetfulness of hip replacements in a given situation of daily life. Each answer is selected from a 5-point Likert scale with response options ranging from never (0) to most of the time (4).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prosthesis life span</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The life span of the prosthesis is the time between the implantation of the prosthesis and its complete or partial surgical revision.</description>
