  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proportion of South Africans aware of their HIV status and on treatment remains lower&#xD;
      than optimal. The goal of this study is to rapidly determine whether text messages framed&#xD;
      according to behavioural economics principles increase clinic attendance among recipients of&#xD;
      care on antiretroviral therapy in South Africa. We hypothesize that messages incorporating&#xD;
      behavioural economics principles will increase the likelihood of recipients of care attending&#xD;
      clinic appointments and returning within 28 days of a missed appointment.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to rapidly determine whether text messages framed according to&#xD;
      behavioural economics principles increase the likelihood that recipients of care attend their&#xD;
      clinic appointment and return to clinic within 28 days of a missed appointment. The study&#xD;
      will be nested in a routine HIV program, in approximately 5 selected Aurum Institute clinics&#xD;
      based in Ekurhuleni district, Gauteng province, South Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arms will include voice call attempts and one-way text messages sent by clinic&#xD;
      staff to recipients of care in two scenarios: 1) Approximately 3-7 days in advance of a&#xD;
      clinic appointment for collecting antiretroviral medication supplies or collection of a&#xD;
      specimen for viral load testing and 2) Approximately 24 hours after a missed clinic&#xD;
      appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This individually randomised trial will have four arms. Each time there is an upcoming or&#xD;
      missed clinic visit clinic staff will randomly assign recipients of care to one of the&#xD;
      following study arms: 1) Standard of Care 2) Loss aversion framed messaging 3) Social norms&#xD;
      framed messaging or 4) Altruism framed messaging.&#xD;
