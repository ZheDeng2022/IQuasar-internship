  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) along with low back pain, is one of the most frequent rheumatic&#xD;
      disorder in the Asian regions. Total Knee Arthroplasty is considered as a gold standard&#xD;
      management strategy for relieving symptoms due to degenerative arthritis of knee.&#xD;
      Rehabilitation after knee arthroplasty is an essential component among this population and&#xD;
      plays a significant role in improving the functional performance and quality of life.&#xD;
      However, access to rehabilitation, health care services and follow up is not always possible.&#xD;
      One of the possible solution is the utilization of telerehabilitation technology to allow&#xD;
      monitoring facilities be delivered to the patients from distance, so that follow up of a&#xD;
      patient could be ensured. Secondly, a type of therapeutic exercise followed after knee&#xD;
      replacement constitutes muscle strengthening, muscle stimulation with resistance exercises,&#xD;
      sensorimotor training and telerehabilitation. Sensorimotor training improves central nervous&#xD;
      system function for managing movement and appropriate muscular firing patterns for&#xD;
      maintaining joint stability. An important component missing in the treatment regime of a knee&#xD;
      replacement patient is the lifestyle modification program which is a combination of&#xD;
      education, exercise and diet. So, the aim of current project is to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      supervised sensorimotor training with and without lifestyle modifications through&#xD;
      telerehabilitation monitoring on joint position sense, balance, posture, muscle strength,&#xD;
      knee joint function and quality of life after total knee arthroplasty. The telerehabilitation&#xD;
      system would interaction between clinician at hospital and patients at home. A web based&#xD;
      portal will be developed and then utilized to provide the user with personalized information&#xD;
      such as guided video and audio instructions about each exercise. The digital rehabilitation&#xD;
      solution is well established in developed nations. It is the need of hour to introduce&#xD;
      technological advancements in Pakistan. Tele-rehabilitation should be incorporated as it will&#xD;
      be helpful for the community and will reduce the dependence on human resources while ensuring&#xD;
      better clinical outcomes as standard therapy. Intervention group will receive lifestyle&#xD;
      modification manual and follow up will be ensured through telerehabilitation monitoring.&#xD;
      Analysis will be done through SPSS 21.&#xD;

    <description>The berg balance scale (BBS) consists of 14 items scored on a 5-point ordinal scale, ranging from 0 to 4 (0 indicates lowest level of function; 4 indicates highest level of function), with a maximum total score of 56. Participants presenting a score of 41 to 56 points have been described as &quot;independent&quot;; scores of 21 to 40 are interpreted as &quot;walking with assistance&quot;; and scores of 0 to 20 are generally classified as &quot;wheelchair bound.&quot;</description>

    <description>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) is a self-administered health status measure that assesses the dimensions of pain, stiffness and function The test questions are scored on a scale of 0-4, which correspond to: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4). The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-20 for Pain, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function.</description>
