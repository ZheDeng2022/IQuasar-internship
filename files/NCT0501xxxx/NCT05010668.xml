      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cryoablation combined&#xD;
      with Sintilimab plus lenvatinib in patients with advanced intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma&#xD;
      after progression on first line systemic therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recent studies have suggested that local destruction of tumor tissue by cryoablation induced&#xD;
      activation and maturation of dendritic cells and tumor-specific T cells by cross-presentation&#xD;
      of tumor antigens. While pd-1 blocking antibody interferes with PD-1 mediated T-cell&#xD;
      regulatory signaling. And combination of pd-1 blocking antibody plus lenvatinib showed&#xD;
      increased ORR in many type of human cancers, including advanced intrahepatic&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of cryoablation combined with Sintilimab plus lenvatinib in patients with advanced&#xD;
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
