      Background: Fatigue is among the most common symptoms of the wide spectrum reported as the&#xD;
      long-term effects of coronavirus (long COVID). This study aims to compare the effectiveness&#xD;
      of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) combined with physiotherapy treatment (PT)&#xD;
      compared to PT alone on fatigue and functional limitations after two months post&#xD;
      randomization in adults with long COVID. Methods: This is a study protocol for a two-arm,&#xD;
      controlled, assessor-blinded, pragmatic randomized clinical trial. One hundred and four&#xD;
      participants will be randomly allocated for OMT+PT or PT. The PT will include usual care&#xD;
      interventions including motor and respiratory exercises targeting cardiorespiratory and&#xD;
      skeletal muscle functions. The OMT entail direct, indirect, visceral, and cranial techniques.&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated before and after a 2-month intervention program, and at a 3-month&#xD;
      followup session. The primary outcomes comprise fatigue and functional limitations at 2-&#xD;
      month post randomization as assessed by the fatigue severity scale and the Post-COVID&#xD;
      Functional State scale, respectively. Secondary outcomes comprise fatigue and functional&#xD;
      limitations, and the perceived change post-treatment as assessed by the Perceived Change&#xD;
      Scale (PCS-patient) at 3 months. Data analysis: Independent mixed linear models will be used&#xD;
      to test the interaction and main effects of the factors group and time for the study&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The coronavirus disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2)-namely COVID-19-is causing a substantial increase in hospitalizations leading to&#xD;
      overloads in global health systems. Most patients recover without hospitalization, but about&#xD;
      20% of cases require hospital care due to shortness of breath and ventilatory support to&#xD;
      treat respiratory failure. Long-term effects of coronavirus-a.k.a.long COVID-comprise the&#xD;
      effects of COVID-19 that lasts for weeks or even months beyond the acute infection. Long&#xD;
      COVID includes a wide spectrum of respiratory, neurologic, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
      and musculoskeletal systems among others, and an increased risk of death. There are more than&#xD;
      50 known possibilities of sequelae in long COVID, and the clinical manifestations may persist&#xD;
      for weeks after the acute infection, suggesting the existence of long-term effects . Evidence&#xD;
      suggests that cell damage, the production of inflammatory cytokines, and a procoagulant state&#xD;
      induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to persistent sequelae, such as chronic&#xD;
      fatigue, for example, leading to a decrease in quality of life. This condition reinforces the&#xD;
      concern with the care for these patients and the need for an integrated interdisciplinary&#xD;
      approach for patients with long COVID. Physiotherapy interventions may be required for&#xD;
      patients with long COVID aiming to symptoms (e.g., fatigue), prevent and restore the&#xD;
      patients' functional status and enabling them to perform activities of daily living. The&#xD;
      physiotherapy approach for patients with post-COVID-19 includes motor and respiratory&#xD;
      rehabilitation aiming at maintaining and/or improving joint mobility, muscle strength, and&#xD;
      functional exercise capacity. A systematic review shows the need for an individualized&#xD;
      physiotherapy approach and health habits change strategies, but also highlights that more&#xD;
      research is needed in post-intensive care unit settings and with those with COVID-19, given&#xD;
      the lack of evidence and consensus regarding outcome measures particularly in older adults.&#xD;
      Osteopathy is a healthcare system that acts in various disorders. In 1918, osteopathy played&#xD;
      a significant role against Spanish flu in the USA and doctors and scientists recommended&#xD;
      osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) as a supportive to recovery from H5N1 avian&#xD;
      influenza in 2007. Recently, evidence that OMT can reduce pain and improve function being&#xD;
      reported. Studies on the OMT combined with standard medical care show that OMT can&#xD;
      collaborate in the recovery of health in various clinical conditions, including reduction in&#xD;
      length of stay and in-hospital mortality rates in the elderly with more severe pneumonia.&#xD;
      Considering the indication of OMT use for various disorders, there is an urgent need for&#xD;
      clinical trials to assess the effects of OMT to recommended as an additional resource to&#xD;
      standard care. The primary aim of research protocol is to compare the effectiveness of OMT&#xD;
      combined with PT (OMT+PT) as compared to PT alone on fatigue and functional limitations after&#xD;
      two months post randomization in adults with long COVID. Secondarily, this research protocol&#xD;
      will investigate the effectiveness of OMT+PT and PT alone on fatigue, functional status, and&#xD;
      perceived change post-treatment after 3 months post-randomization in this population.&#xD;

    <description>Fatigue Severity Scale: the scale consists of 9 items on how fatigue interferes with certain activities. Severity is classified according to a self-report scale. The scale consists of a 7-point score where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree. The minimum score is 9 and the maximum is 63. The higher the score is the greater the severity of fatigue (Krupp et al., 1989; Toledo et al., 2011).</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will receive OMT in addition to the same interventions of PT group. The frequency of treatment will be decided based on the clinical judgment of the osteopath who is accompanying each case, not exceeding 7 consultations in total. At each visit, the participants will receive a full-body osteopathic examination which include clinical exams, observation, screening tests, palpation, and motion testing. The OMT entail direct (high-velocity low-amplitude; muscle energy; and myofascial release), indirect (functional techniques and balanced ligamentous tension), visceral, and cranial techniques(Giusti, 2017). Selection of specific OMT will follow the 'TART' criteria-Tissue texture changes, Asymmetry, Restriction of motion, Tenderness (Basile et al., 2017; Cerritelli et al., 2011; Giusti R., 2017; Pizzolorusso et al., 2011; Seffinger M.A, 2018).</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will receive physiotherapy sessions with a maximum frequency of 2 weekly sessions, as defined by the physiotherapist, according to personalized therapeutic plans for a period of 8 weeks. The physiotherapy approach for patients with long COVID includes motor and respiratory rehabilitation aiming at maintaining and/or improving joint mobility, muscle strength, and functional exercise capacity (Thomas et al., 2020). At each visit, the participants respond by self-report about their general condition. Depending on the case, the physiotherapist will perform a reevaluation with specific tests. The PT group will receive physiotherapy treatment offered by five physiotherapists, with more than 5 years of experience each, duly registered with their class council.</description>
