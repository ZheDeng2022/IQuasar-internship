    <textblock>
      A recent report (Morera Maiquez et al 2020) described reduced tic severity in people with&#xD;
      Tourette syndrome during 1-minute epochs of median nerve stimulation (MNS) at 10 Hz. Among&#xD;
      the various questions still to be answered is the question of whether a device to administer&#xD;
      MNS is practical for use in a chronic, real-world setting. This study will recruit&#xD;
      participants who complete the clinic-based, blinded, randomized controlled trial,&#xD;
      https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04731714, to determine the real-world usage and&#xD;
      apparent utility of median nerve stimulation in people with chronic tics.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic tic disorders (CTD), including Tourette syndrome (TS), are associated with a&#xD;
      substantially reduced quality of life (Evans et al 2016). Medication treatments are no more&#xD;
      than 50-60% effective in randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), and are often discontinued due&#xD;
      to unacceptable side effects (Thomas and Cavanna 2013). Behavioral therapies require ability&#xD;
      to participate in therapy and a specially trained therapist (Scahill et al 2013), but weekly&#xD;
      visits to psychologists are impractical for many Americans, especially in rural areas (Lin et&#xD;
      al 2016). Patients strongly desire new treatment options (Cuenca et al 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In June, 2020, Stephen Jackson's group at the University of Nottingham published a&#xD;
      fascinating report in Current Biology on a potential novel treatment for tics (Morera Maiquez&#xD;
      et al 2020). The radical new idea arose from observations associating movement inhibition&#xD;
      with 8-14 Hz activity in motor cortex. They first showed that rhythmic 12 Hz peripheral&#xD;
      stimulation of the median nerve evoked synchronous contralateral EEG activity over primary&#xD;
      sensorimotor cortex, whereas arrhythmic stimulation at the same mean rate did not. As&#xD;
      hypothesized, median nerve stimulation (MNS) at 12 Hz created small but statistically&#xD;
      significant effects on initiation of voluntary movements. Importantly, they also demonstrated&#xD;
      that this stimulation did not meaningfully impair concentration, suggesting that the effect&#xD;
      did not operate through simple distraction. They went on to test 10 Hz MNS in 19 TS patients,&#xD;
      and demonstrated using blinded video ratings a significant reduction in tic number and&#xD;
      severity during 1-minute stimulation epochs vs 1-minute no-stimulation epochs. They noted&#xD;
      that in some participants, benefit lasted beyond the end of the stimulation epoch [personal&#xD;
      correspondence]. Videos accompanying the publication showed dramatic benefit during MNS in&#xD;
      some subjects. Although the authors appropriately noted the steps needed to generalize these&#xD;
      results to clinical practice, news reports already have led a number of TS patients to&#xD;
      contact them asking for treatment. The Nottingham group has referred such inquiries from the&#xD;
      U.S. to me as leader of our Wash.U. Tourette Association of America (TAA) Center of&#xD;
      Excellence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the various questions still to be answered is the question of whether such a device&#xD;
      would be practical for use in the real world. This study will supply participants with a&#xD;
      commercially available transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) units to use for&#xD;
      median nerve stimulation as described in the Nottingham study. Participants will be told to&#xD;
      use the device as much or as little as desired to see how such stimulation might be utilized&#xD;
      in the real world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here the investigators propose (a) to determine the real-world usage and apparent utility of&#xD;
      stimulation in people with chronic tics, and (b) to determine momentary self-rated efficacy&#xD;
      and side effects of stimulation. The investigators will also compare results from this study&#xD;
      to those from the &quot;Peripheral induction of inhibitory brain circuits to treat Tourette's:&#xD;
      pilot&quot; study, from which participants will be drawn, in order to compare laboratory and&#xD;
      real-world efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Determine the real-world usage and apparent utility of stimulation in people with&#xD;
      chronic tics. Participants will be allowed to choose when and for how long to use the&#xD;
      stimulation, thus simulating how patients would use the stimulation in their daily lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Determine momentary self-rated efficacy and side effects of stimulation, using surveys&#xD;
      taken at the beginning and end of stimulation periods, as well as twice daily when prompted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Compare results of this trial with those from &quot;Peripheral induction of inhibitory&#xD;
      brain circuits to treat Tourette's: pilot.&quot; Participants in this study will have been drawn&#xD;
      from completers of the &quot;peripheral induction&quot; blinded RCT, allowing for clear comparisons&#xD;
      between the laboratory conditions of the first study and the real-world conditions of the&#xD;
      second.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of these Aims will provide practical information that can inform a future,&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial of chronic MNS delivered by a portable device.&#xD;
