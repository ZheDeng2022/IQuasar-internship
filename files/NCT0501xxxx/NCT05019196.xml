      Glioma is an invasive growth, easy to relapse, poor prognosis, great harm to human and&#xD;
      society. Studies have shown that gliomas can cause the dynamic reorganization of brain&#xD;
      functional areas, affecting the accuracy of surgical resection and the evaluation of&#xD;
      long-term efficacy. While, it is difficult to monitor the functional reorganization of glioma&#xD;
      in existing studies. The development trend can not effectively predict the outcome of tumor&#xD;
      anaplasia and the compensation of brain function, which restricts the accurate tumor&#xD;
      resection. In the early stage of this study, functional connectivity analysis was carried out&#xD;
      of gliomas in the motor region and showed that the damage of motor functional connectivity on&#xD;
      the opposite side of the lesion occurred earlier than that on the same side, suggesting that&#xD;
      there may be some rules of how the disease caused functional reorganization. After stroke,&#xD;
      the language and motor function will undergo plasticity, causing the functional areas to&#xD;
      slowly repair the damaged function. Contrast to stroke, low-grade glioma grows slower, which&#xD;
      gives brain more time to adapt to the damage caused by tumor growth, it may cause more&#xD;
      functional reorganization. Professor Hugues Duffau's research showed that it is brain&#xD;
      plasticity that can effectively explain patients with low-grade gliomas, even in language and&#xD;
      motor areas, did not appear obvious dysfunction. Our previous research found there were&#xD;
      significant differences in motor functional connectivity between the two hemispheres of the&#xD;
      patients between the plasma tumor group and healthy controls. In addition, in the tumor&#xD;
      group, the damage of motor connection on the contralateral side of the lesion occurred before&#xD;
      on the ipsilateral side. These results suggest that brain function has been remodeled in&#xD;
      patients with brain tumors who have not yet exhibited motor impairment. We presume there may&#xD;
      be a certain pattern of brain function reorganization caused by low-grade glioma. This study&#xD;
      take patients with brain glioma as the research object and adopt a multi-time point&#xD;
      experimental design, combining with cortical electrical stimulation and multimodal magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging data before and after operation, intending to observe the dynamic changes&#xD;
      of language and motor function networks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma is the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system in adults. It&#xD;
      is highly invasive, grows rapidly and has a poor prognosis. Brain tumors, whether benign or&#xD;
      malignant in nature, take up space in the skull and will follow the tumor. The malignant&#xD;
      degree of growth, so that the intracranial pressure increases, thus compression or&#xD;
      destruction of brain tissue, leading to central nervous damage, it endangers the life of the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, neurosurgery is still the main treatment for craniocerebral tumors. Surgical&#xD;
      resection course degree is a determinant of patient survival. Due to individual differences&#xD;
      and pathological changes, the effect of causing the variation of the anatomical position of&#xD;
      brain functional areas and the generation of intraoperative brain tissue displacement all&#xD;
      make it difficult to determine correct functional areas, which is the main reason that&#xD;
      affects the accuracy and postoperative effect of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, routine MRI scans have difficulty in identifying changes in adjacent functional&#xD;
      areas caused by tumors, and is also difficult to define the boundaries of invasive neoplasms.&#xD;
      The application of functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging enables&#xD;
      neurosurgeons not only to be accurate positioning the functional areas, but knowing the&#xD;
      functional areas caused by the tumor before neurosurgery, so as to maximize removing the&#xD;
      tumor and better protecting important functional areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After stroke, the language and motor function will undergo plasticity, causing the language&#xD;
      and motor areas to slowly repair the damaged brain function. Contrast to stroke, low-grade&#xD;
      glioma grows slower, which gives brain more time to adapt to the damage caused by tumor&#xD;
      growth, it may cause more functional reorganization. Professor Hugues Duffau's research,&#xD;
      published in the journal Brain, also shows that it is brain plasticity that can effectively&#xD;
      explain patients with low-grade gliomas, even in language and motor areas, did not appear&#xD;
      obvious dysfunction. Therefore, exploring the brain functional plasticity of low-grade glioma&#xD;
      not only facilitates the maximum resection of the tumor, but also help for prediction of&#xD;
      postoperative of rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, taking the patients with brain glioma as the object in this project, combining&#xD;
      with intraoperative cortical electrical stimulation and multiple modal magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging, a multi-time longitudinal study was designed to explore the imaging features of&#xD;
      changes in motor and language plasticity in low-grade gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All images were obtained using a GE3.0T magnetic resonance scanner. 3D-T1FSPGR（ fast spoiled&#xD;
      gradient echo）was scanned for anatomical images, T2-weighted single-shot&#xD;
      gradient-echo-planae-imaging sequence for functional images. Tak-based fMRI used block design&#xD;
      mode (e.g. ABAB mode) with 30s resting state (A) and 30s hand movement task (B) alternating,&#xD;
      the whole task process has a total of 6 resting states, 5 tasks state composition. All&#xD;
      patients and healthy controls were instructed to repeatedly play each visual stimulus with&#xD;
      open and close hand. All the subjects were trained on a specific exercise task before the&#xD;
      scans, to ensure that the task is fully understood and that you are able to cooperate&#xD;
      carefully to complete the scan. Language tasks use the block design paradigm. The equation is&#xD;
      control-task-control last for 5min30s with 30s interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the subjects looked at the &quot;+&quot; symbol on the screen and lay quietly on the&#xD;
      exam bed performing three language tasks. All the patients were trained to better cooperate&#xD;
      with the subjects. To avoid head movement displacement during scanning, patients are required&#xD;
      to speak as softly as possible that is whisper. Furthermore，derect electric stimulus was&#xD;
      conducted in every patient. If the distance between functional areas and the positive target&#xD;
      of electrical stimulation was less than 1cm, the results of fMRI and electrical considered&#xD;
      were considered to be consistent. As for functional rating scale, the standard chinese&#xD;
      version of the Quality of Life Inventory EORTC QLQ-C30 (3.0) was used to assess the&#xD;
      preoperative quality of life of patients with brain tumors; KPS( Karnofsky Performance Status&#xD;
      Scale）was used to evaluate physiological function; Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was&#xD;
      used for clinical screening of cognitive impairment, evaluate the patients' interpretation,&#xD;
      spatial orientation, memory and computation, linguistic naming and reading ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlation analysis was conducted between the fMRI data processing results and functional&#xD;
      scale score, to build the brain structure - function correlation models and explore different&#xD;
      stages of low-grade glioma recombination mode of functional areas.&#xD;
