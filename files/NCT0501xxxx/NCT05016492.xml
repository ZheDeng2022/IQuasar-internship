      Visual perceptual defects in children can negatively affect their activities of daily&#xD;
      living.The aims of this study were to develop and evaluate an interactive digital game system&#xD;
      for correcting visual perceptual defects and to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed&#xD;
      system.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TVPS-3 is a standardized and norm-referenced task for children age 4-13 years that uses a response format suitable for all children, including those with disabilities. It includes subtasks of visual discrimination, visual memory, visual-spatial relationships, form constancy, visual sequential memory, figure ground, and visual closure (Martin et al., 2006). Each of the seven subtests has 16 items of varying difficulty. Therefore, the test has 112 total questions.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>User satisfaction survey</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 20-item questionnaire content was divided into five themes: perceived ease of use (6 questions), perceived usefulness (4 questions), perceived joyfulness (4 questions), satisfaction (3 questions), and continued use (3 questions). Questionnaire items were answered on a Likert scale from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Test of the visual-perceptual interactive game system</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The digital game test had 7 subtests, and each subtest had 10 questions. Based on the seven-item rules of TVPS-3, 1 point was assigned to each question, for a score of 10 points for each subtest, and a total score of 70.</description>
