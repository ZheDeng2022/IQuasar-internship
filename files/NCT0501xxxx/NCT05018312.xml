      The present study wish to compare the preliminarily effects and feasibility of Modified&#xD;
      Collaborative Assessment (MCA) - a novel therapeutic approach to diagnostic assessment - with&#xD;
      assessment-as-usual (AAU) among patients with evasiveness as a core psychopathological&#xD;
      feature in a randomised controlled study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include and randomise 42 patients 1:1 to either MCA or AAU, which will be&#xD;
      administered as a pre-treatment to the standard psychotherapeutic intervention they will&#xD;
      receive in the psychotherapeutic clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCA will utilize standardised psychological tests administered in collaboration with the&#xD;
      patients, in order to thorough diagnose the included patients. The tests available will be&#xD;
      the Present State Examination (PSE), the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Personality&#xD;
      Disorders (SCID-5-PD), the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP), the Autism&#xD;
      Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2), the Examination of anomalous self-experience&#xD;
      (EASE), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV), the Level of Personality Functioning&#xD;
      - Brief Form 2.0 (LPFS-BF), the Personality Inventory for DSM-5, 36 item version (PID-36) and&#xD;
      the Conners´ Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are gathered through a number of questionnaires from patients prior to randomization&#xD;
      (T0), at end of MCA (T1) and after four weeks of psychotherapy (T2) - absolute time depend on&#xD;
      clinical logistics and timing of group therapy onset.&#xD;

In contrast to other scales that were designed to assess optimism, this one explicitly refers to personal agency, i.e., the belief that one's actions are responsible for successful outcomes.&#xD;
The minimum score is 10 and maximum value is 40. A higher score indicate that the patient feels better suited to handle difficult situations, compared to a lower.</description>
