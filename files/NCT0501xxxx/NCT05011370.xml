  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center prospective cross-sectional observational study that will assess the&#xD;
      prevalence of liver disease in patients dependent on parenteral nutrition (PN) for 4 or more&#xD;
      days per week, for the past 6 months or longer. Liver disease will be determined by the&#xD;
      presence of choline deficiency, cholestasis (confirmed by elevated serum alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
      (ALP) liver isoenzyme level), and steatosis (confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging-derived&#xD;
      proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate the presence/prevalence of liver disease in&#xD;
      patients dependent on PN (≥4 days a week) for 6 months or longer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will provide blood samples at Visit 1 to determine choline deficiency,&#xD;
      elevated serum ALP liver isoenzyme level and liver dysfunction. Only participants diagnosed&#xD;
      as having choline deficiency and elevated serum ALP liver isoenzyme level will be requested&#xD;
      to return for a second clinic visit for imaging (MRI-PDFF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to understand and document critical epidemiological data related&#xD;
      to choline deficiency and the incidence of liver disease in patients dependent on PN (≥ 4&#xD;
      days a week) for 6 months or longer and to better understand this patient population to help&#xD;
      determine who might benefit from innovative treatments including IV Choline Chloride&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant and/or their parent/Legally Authorized Representative is willing and&#xD;
             able to provide signed informed consent or assent as appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female adults 18 to 80 years of age, or adolescents age 12 to 17 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dependent on parenteral nutrition, defined as receiving PN ≥ 4 days a week for 6&#xD;
             months or longer prior to screening to meet nutritional, caloric, fluid, and/or&#xD;
             electrolyte needs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Investigator expects no changes in the lipid, dextrose, amino acid, or vitamin&#xD;
             regimen to be medically necessary during the participant's participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness of participant to maintain his/her current habitual oral diet and fluids&#xD;
             regimen for the study duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants taking steatogenic medications for ≥12 weeks in the past 12 months (e.g.,&#xD;
             amiodarone, tamoxifen, methotrexate, tetracycline, glucocorticoids, anabolic steroids,&#xD;
             over the usual dose of estrogen for hormone replacement therapy, and valproate); those&#xD;

             pentoxifylline, S-adenosyl-L-Methionine, and betaine) that could affect the&#xD;
             measurement of IFALD within 12 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants taking potential hepatotoxic medications that in the judgement of the&#xD;
             Investigator is causing hepatic abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a cardiac pacemaker, intravascular stents, other metallic devices,&#xD;
             and claustrophobia which are contraindicated to magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who took choline supplements or choline-containing multivitamins within&#xD;
