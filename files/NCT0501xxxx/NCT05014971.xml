  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the 2nd most common neurodegenerative dementia in the US. Optimal&#xD;
      care requires an interdisciplinary approach, however often faced barriers include rural&#xD;
      residence, limited access to specialists, travel distance, limited awareness of resources,&#xD;
      and physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments making travel to appointments&#xD;
      challenging. Delivering interdisciplinary care remotely using video technology has the&#xD;
      potential to improve access to care for patients with LBD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to convert an in-person patient-centric interdisciplinary care&#xD;
      model to a virtual platform using stakeholder engagement from individuals with LBD, their&#xD;
      caregivers and healthcare providers. Subsequently researchers will conduct a prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled pilot study implementing the virtual stakeholder developed&#xD;
      interdisciplinary care model (tele-neurohub) for 6 month and assess the implementation&#xD;
      outcomes of feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the tele-neurohub model. The&#xD;
      research goal is to establish and iteratively improve a virtual interdisciplinary model of&#xD;
      care allowing patients with LBD and their caregivers to access sub-specialty care from their&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
