      The aims of this study are to evaluate the comfort, and ease of application and removal, of&#xD;
      GraduSOX™ compression stockings compared to standard compression stockings of the same&#xD;
      compression class.&#xD;

      After being informed about the study, all participants giving written informed consent will&#xD;
      be randomised by closed envelope randomisation to either a) GraduSOX on their right leg and&#xD;
      Sigvaris on their left leg, or b) Sigvaris on their right leg and GraduSOX on their left leg.&#xD;
      At Day 1, participants will attend the clinic and be fitted with their stockings and given an&#xD;
      Evaluation Form. The Evaluation Form has four sections to be completed on Day 1, Day 2, Day 4&#xD;
      and Day 8 of the study. Each section asks multiple choice questions related to the comfort&#xD;
      and ease of applying and removing each stocking.&#xD;
