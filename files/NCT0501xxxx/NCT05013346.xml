  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes has been poorly characterised, with very sparse information available in the&#xD;
      literature about the characteristics of the disease in Africa. Atypical young onset diabetes&#xD;
      is often reported by clinicians in sub-Saharan Africa, including patients who have the&#xD;
      phenotype of type 1 diabetes but do not appear to have an absolute insulin requirement. The&#xD;
      onset of type 1 diabetes in many sub-Saharan African populations seem to occur at later ages&#xD;
      (20s to 40s) than what is generally seen in Caucasian populations. The investigators seek to&#xD;
      characterise young-onset insulin treated diabetes (clinically diagnosed type 1 diabetes) in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa;&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific objectives will be to; (1) characterise a population with clinically diagnosed&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes and to determine the proportion of islet autoantibody positivity rates and to&#xD;
      compare with a similar cohort of patients in the UK, (2) to determine the proportion of&#xD;
      participants with retained endogenous insulin secretion (C-peptide &gt; 600pmol/l) and whether&#xD;
      they have evidence of autoimmunity as assessed by islet autoantibody and the type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      genetic risk score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting: This study will be a multi-center cross-sectional study of clinically&#xD;
      diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients who are currently on insulin treatment who are being&#xD;
      followed-up in existing diabetes care centers in 4 sub-Saharan African countries; Cameroon,&#xD;
      Uganda, Tanzania and South Africa. Recruitment will take place at regional diabetes care&#xD;
      centers which usually serve as the main diabetes treatment hub for many smaller spoke clinics&#xD;
      in the sub-region. In Cameroon, the Yaounde Central Hospital and the Bafoussam Regional&#xD;
      Hospital will serve as main clinical sites. In Uganda the clinical sites involved are the&#xD;
      Mulago National Referral and Teaching Hospital, St. Francis Hospital Nsambya, all in Kampala&#xD;
      and the Masaka Regional Referral Hospital. The Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar Es Salaam&#xD;
      will serve as the main clinical site in Tanzania. Cameroon, Uganda and Tanzania will carry&#xD;
      out primary data collection over the study period while South Africa (University of&#xD;
      Witwatersrand Medical School) will provide secondary data consisting of a minimal dataset and&#xD;
      relevant collected samples for analysis. All these centers have existing diabetes care&#xD;
      clinics with experienced staff who are used to collecting and providing data for research&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: All patients with a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or young-onset insulin&#xD;
      treated diabetes, who were diagnosed before the age of 30 years will be eligible to be&#xD;
      enrolled into the study. We estimated a minimum total sample size of 500 participants will&#xD;
      have a high precision with 95% confidence intervals of 17-25% around a prevalence of 20% for&#xD;
      a clinical or biological characteristics (e.g. retained C-peptide or presence of islet&#xD;
      auto-antibodies) and 46-54% around a prevalence of 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling method: We will follow a systematic sampling method, enrolling consecutive eligible&#xD;
      participants from the different primary collection clinical sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: All consented patients will be interviewed using a structured pre-tested&#xD;
      questionnaire (Data Collection Form) by a trained study staff to collect relevant&#xD;
      information; demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, family history, history of diabetes and&#xD;
      diabetes complications. The questionnaire used in this study is available in English and has&#xD;
      been translated into the major local language(s); the appropriate questionnaire is used&#xD;
      according to the participant's preference. After the interview, a short clinical examination&#xD;
      will be performed to record anthropometric characteristics (weight, height, waist and hip&#xD;
      circumferences) and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using standardized operating procedures (SOPs), saliva, blood and urine samples will be&#xD;
      collected from all study participants for biochemical analysis, and biobanking for future&#xD;
      studies. Saliva will be used for DNA extraction and for the determination of type 1 genetic&#xD;
      risk score (T1D GRS) using a 67 single nucleotide polymorphism score as described by Sharp et&#xD;
      al. 2019. Venous whole blood will be used for full blood count and A1c determination. Plasma&#xD;
      will be used for random C-peptide determination on the 801 module of the Cobas 8000 analyser&#xD;
      and the measuring range will be truncated to &lt;3pmol/L. Serum creatinine will be measured to&#xD;
      assist in the interpretation of the C-peptide result. Islet autoantibodies, GAD, IA2 and ZnT8&#xD;
      will be measured in serum on the RSR Limited ELISA (RSR Limited, Cardiff, U.K.). Dipstick&#xD;
      urinalysis will be done, with urinary C-peptide and creatinine measurement for the&#xD;
      determination of the urinary C-peptide to creatinine ration (UCPCR). .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected from the different clinical sites using the data collection form will be&#xD;
      entered into a centralized data management tool (REDCap). All data will be anonymised before&#xD;
      being stored in the data management system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration: All participants will be required to provide a written informed&#xD;
      consent before participating in the study. Refusal to participate will not affect the quality&#xD;
      of care of the participants at the clinical sites. The study has received ethical clearance&#xD;
      from the National Ethics Committee of Cameroon ( No 2018/12/1252/L/CNERSH/SP), and the Uganda&#xD;
      Virus Research Institute (GC/127/19/12/736), Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH/IRB/I/2020/019)&#xD;
      and Human Research Ethics Committe, South Africa (M200174).&#xD;
