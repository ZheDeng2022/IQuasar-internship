  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During revision spinal surgery for aseptic indications, there remains a concern that the&#xD;
      failure may have resulted from undetectable subclinical infection. In the common revision&#xD;
      indications of hardware loosening and adjacent segment disease it is possible that bacterial&#xD;
      colonization and low-grade infection precipitated the failure event. There is also&#xD;
      significant controversy on the role infectious processes have in the development of&#xD;
      degenerative disc disease (modic changes). In particular, this study will investigate whether&#xD;
      discogenic colonization with Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) can be associated with modic&#xD;
      changes. Whereas, in surgery for known spinal infection, epidural abscess and septic&#xD;
      revisions, it is possible that standard culture techniques fail to detect polymicrobial flora&#xD;
      or accurate speciation. This may lead to inappropriate antibiotic management that is not&#xD;
      addressing the range of pathology present. There remains an incomplete understanding of the&#xD;
      role that subclinical infection plays in aseptic spinal revision surgery and degenerative&#xD;
      disc disease&#xD;
