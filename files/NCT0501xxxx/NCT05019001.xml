      The efficacy of laminoplasty and laminectomy with fusion for ossification of the posterior&#xD;
      longitudinal ligament with high occupation rate in the cervical spine is not clear in the&#xD;
      literature report so far. This study is designed to further research the difference in&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament(OPLL) is a common spinal disease which&#xD;
      can lead to neurological dysfunction and its morbidity is related to genetic factors. OPLL is&#xD;
      usually found in cervical spine and characterized by hypertrophy and ossification of the&#xD;
      posterior longitudinal ligament in the rear of the corresponding cervical vertebral body,&#xD;
      which can encroach the space in the spinal canal and compress the spinal cord and/or nerve&#xD;
      roots of the corresponding segments, resulting in sensory and motor disorders of the limbs as&#xD;
      well as visceral autonomic nervous dysfunction, leading to neurological dysfunction and even&#xD;
      high paraplegia. It not only causes great harm but also brings heavy economic and spiritual&#xD;
      burden to patients and society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the surgical treatments for OPLL include anterior and posterior approach, the&#xD;
      anterior approach requires excellent equipment and rich operation experience for surgery&#xD;
      doctor. Many articles showed significantly higher complications rate in anterior approach&#xD;
      than that of posterior approach. Posterior approach surgery is considered to be one of the&#xD;
      effective treatment methods for OPLL in cervical spine. In the posterior approach, there are&#xD;
      two commonly recognized surgical procedures, laminoplasty and laminectomy with fusion. The&#xD;
      efficacy of laminoplasty and laminectomy with fusion for ossification of the posterior&#xD;
      longitudinal ligament with high occupation rate in the cervical spine is not clear in the&#xD;
      literature report so far. This study is designed to further research the difference in&#xD;
      efficacy between the two surgical methods. The purpose of this study is to make patients get&#xD;
      the biggest medical benefits and to make a right surgical treatment strategy when doctors&#xD;
      treating patients with high occupation rate OPLL in cervical spine.&#xD;
