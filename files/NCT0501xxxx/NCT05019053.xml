  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a significant psychological stressor that threatens&#xD;
      the onset of a mental health crisis in the US. Fear and anxiety about COVID-19 and its&#xD;
      economic impact, as well as loneliness due to the required social isolation, are driving the&#xD;
      mental health impacts of COVID-19; in a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll, 45% of&#xD;
      respondents reported that the coronavirus has had a negative impact on their mental health.&#xD;
      This is reflected in Southeastern Ohio. In data that the investigators collected from 317&#xD;
      Ohio University faculty, staff, and students from late May to early June, 39% reported&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe levels of anxiety, 41% reported moderate-to-severe levels of depression&#xD;
      and 57% reported the COVID-19 outbreak was impacting their sense of social connection much or&#xD;
      very much. Despite the significant community need for accessible and affordable care, there&#xD;
      are currently no evidence-based interventions for individuals coping poorly with&#xD;
      coronavirus-related distress. The investigators have developed a virtual group-based&#xD;
      intervention targeting cognitive biases that amplify the experience of stress and anxiety&#xD;
      (i.e., amplifying cognitions; Coping with Coronavirus-Related Emotion and Worry [COPING&#xD;
      CREW]). The next step in developing this intervention in a scientifically rigorous manner is&#xD;
      to refine the manual and procedures and conduct a pilot test of the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a coming mental health crisis in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Already, rates&#xD;
      of depression, anxiety, and suicide are elevated in response to the pandemic. A recent study&#xD;
      of more than 5,400 people in the US found prevalence rates of anxiety and depression in June&#xD;
      of 2020 were 3-4 times higher than these rates in June of 2019. In this same study, 41% of&#xD;
      respondents in June 2020 reported experiencing an adverse mental or behavioral health&#xD;
      condition, including 13% who endorsed using substances to cope with stress or emotions and&#xD;
      11% who reported seriously contemplating suicide in the prior 30 days. Thus, heightened&#xD;
      anxiety, stress, and depression will likely continue to lead to increases in self-harm and&#xD;
      maladaptive substance use if left unchecked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is crucial that empirically validated psychotherapies be developed to meet these needs.&#xD;
      These treatments must address how common barriers to treatment, including time, cost,&#xD;
      transportation, and stigma about mental health may be exacerbated by the pandemic. The&#xD;
      investigators developed a brief, virtual group-based intervention, framed as educational,&#xD;
      Coping with Coronavirus-Related Emotions and Worries (COPING CREW), to address these&#xD;
      barriers. This intervention was developed over the summer by Drs. Allan, Suhr, and Austin,&#xD;
      working with two graduate student research assistants for administration by clinical&#xD;
      psychology graduate student therapists as part of their practicum experience at the Ohio&#xD;
      University Psychology and Social Work Clinic (PSWC). A benefit of this approach, therefore,&#xD;
      is that this intervention is highly scalable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretical models posit the short- and long-term stressors experienced during the pandemic&#xD;
      exacerbate the experience of negative emotions an individual is already predisposed to&#xD;
      experience. That is, people who are already experiencing mental health issues are going to&#xD;
      experience more severe issues and people who may not already be experiencing mental health&#xD;
      issues are more likely to develop mental health issues during the pandemic. Cognitive risk&#xD;
      factors (i.e., amplifying cognitions) such as anxiety sensitivity (fear of anxiety&#xD;
      sensations), intolerance of uncertainty (fear of the unknown), and loneliness (the subjective&#xD;
      feeling of isolation) increase the experience of negative emotions as well as the likelihood&#xD;
      of unhealthy coping behavior such as increased alcohol consumption or self-harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty, and loneliness can be reduced through brief&#xD;
      interventions applying cognitive-behavioral therapy principles. Reductions in these&#xD;
      constructs lead to later reductions in anxiety, depression, and suicide. Targeting these risk&#xD;
      factors appears critical to address distress due to COVID-19. In 317 Ohio University faculty,&#xD;
      staff, and students, anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty, and loneliness&#xD;
      accounted for 63%-75% of the variance in ratings of anxiety, depression, and suicidality as&#xD;
      well as 49% of COVID-related disability. These findings highlight the prominent role these&#xD;
      risk factors play in the distress many individuals are experiencing due to COVID-19. The&#xD;
      investigators have developed a virtual group-based intervention targeting risk factors that&#xD;
      amplify the experience of emotional distress; the next steps in developing a scientifically&#xD;
      rigorous intervention that can be disseminated broadly is to develop and pilot test this&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals specific to this project are to 1) engage stakeholders in the design of a brief&#xD;
      group-based treatment to improve COPING CREW and 2) to conduct a Stage I pilot trial through&#xD;
      evaluating the acceptability and feasibility of COPING CREW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Refine a prototype for COPING CREW by working virtually with a community partner&#xD;
      stakeholder advisory group (SAG) as well as participants receiving the intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators will develop a SAG comprising one participant from each community partner. The&#xD;
      investigators will meet with the SAG at least three times during the 1-year project. Meetings&#xD;
      will occur prior to starting COPING CREW groups, after running the first two groups, and&#xD;
      after all four groups have been completed. The investigators anticipate that building a&#xD;
      strong relationship with this SAG will increase treatment relevance to clientele, treatment&#xD;
      engagement, and treatment dissemination. In turn, this will enhance the durable impacts and&#xD;
      sustainability of COPING CREW. In addition to SAGs, the investigators will also utilize a&#xD;
      systematic approach to engage with participant stakeholders by asking for feedback about the&#xD;
      intervention (the Exit Interview). The investigators have used these intervention modules&#xD;
      separately a number of times but have yet to examine these modules as part of the same&#xD;
      intervention. Thus, participants will provide important information on how to tailor the&#xD;
      intervention, including the order of the components, the amount of homework specific to each&#xD;
      component, and the length of time before the booster session to best meet their needs.&#xD;
      Although the investigators are confident that COPING CREW will largely be viewed as&#xD;
      acceptable, it can be modified to increase acceptability by effective engagement with&#xD;
      community partners. Solicitation of feedback will occur via two mechanisms. First,&#xD;
      information related to adaptation will be obtained from quantitative and qualitative feedback&#xD;
      during the intervention. Second, information related to adaptation and engagement will also&#xD;
      be collected in separate, focused feedback sessions with COPING CREW participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine acceptability and feasibility of COPING CREW, delivered virtually. A pilot one&#xD;
      arm trial will be conducted, delivering the intervention to 24 participants across 4 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: It is hypothesized that the intervention will demonstrate high acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility (as measured by completion rates and favorable ratings of satisfaction) across&#xD;
      intervention modules and components within sessions. Components will include psychoeducation,&#xD;
      challenging cognitive biases or mythbusting, behavioral exposure, behavioral experiments, and&#xD;
      ecological momentary intervention (EMI) for treatment monitoring and homework tracking.&#xD;

    <description>18-item self-report measure of anxiety sensitivity. This scale was developed to provide a more stable measure of the three most widely recognized AS subfactors (cognitive, social and physical concerns) than the previous ASIs provided. The ASI-3 will be utilized to assess level of overall anxiety sensitivity. Participants are asked to rate the degree to which anxiety symptoms are distressing on a five-point scale from 0 (&quot;Very Little&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Very Much&quot;). Possible total scores range from 0 to 72. Greater distress is indicated by higher scores.</description>

First, following informed consent, eligible participants will complete a baseline assessment appointment in the week prior to the group beginning. During the baseline appointment, participants will provide informed consent, be instructed in the use of Microsoft Teams, complete a battery of self-report measures, be given a semi-structured diagnostic interview, and follow instructions to install a mobile app that will be used to track their mood and homework. Then, 4 groups of COPING CREW, with 6 participants per group, will be run. Participants will complete four weekly 60-minute virtual intervention sessions followed by a booster session two weeks later. Participants will complete daily surveys and homework assignments on their mobile devices. Links to follow-up surveys will be sent to participants at 1- and 3-month follow-ups.</description>

    <description>Coping Crew consists of five 60-minute virtual intervention sessions coinciding with five weeks of EMI. Participants will receive psychoeducation, challenge cognitive biases or mythbust, and participate in behavioral exposure and behavioral experiments. An EMI component of this treatment will be included for the purpose of treatment monitoring and homework tracking. Participation in this EMI component involves the daily report of levels of anxiety, depression, stress, and loneliness. When participants endorse elevated levels on any of these constructs, they will receive a targeted message reminding them of the topics covered in COPING CREW. One month after the intervention session, COPING CREW participants will complete follow-up questionnaires and interview. Participants will also participate in a feedback session 3 months after the intervention.</description>
