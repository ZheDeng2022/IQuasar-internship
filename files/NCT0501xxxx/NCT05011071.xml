  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational clinical cohort study involving 405 children born&#xD;
      premature (at less than 37 weeks gestation) and their mother/parent/guardian. The purpose of&#xD;
      the study is to investigate how the microbiome (the collection of microbes in a biological&#xD;
      site) of children develops over the first years of life and its associations with the risk of&#xD;
      childhood health outcomes including allergies and asthma. The study will also examine how&#xD;
      perinatal factors associate with patterns of microbiome development, and their effects on the&#xD;
      microbiome, metabolome (the collection of metabolites in a biological sample) and immune&#xD;
      development of this population in the first years of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premature birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy) occurs in about 1 in 10 pregnancies.&#xD;
      When infants are born prematurely their gut is not as developed. One important factor in gut&#xD;
      health is the large community of microbes (tiny living things such as bacteria) that live on&#xD;
      the human body called the microbiome. Recent studies have shown that premature infants are&#xD;
      more likely to experience changes to their gut microbiome that are associated with health&#xD;
      issues, such as asthma and allergies. However, the specific microbiome features of children&#xD;
      born preterm and the role of their microbiome in disease risk and childhood health is not&#xD;
      well understood. The Alberta BLOOM Premature Child Study (PCS) investigates how the&#xD;
      microbiome and immune health of premature children develops over the first years of life and&#xD;
      its associations with the risk of childhood health outcomes. BLOOM-PCS will also study how&#xD;
      the microbiome of children born premature differs from the microbiome in the term population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of microbes that are present in the infant's gut in the first months of life have a&#xD;
      major impact on the microbiome that will form during childhood. There are many environmental&#xD;
      factors during pregnancy, birth and the first months of life that can impact an infant's&#xD;
      microbiome development. Factors such as diet, exposure to antibiotics, surgical procedures,&#xD;
      and mode of delivery can strongly affect early microbiome development. This study will&#xD;
      investigate how these factors influence the types of early microbes present in preterm&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hypothesizes that specific microbial patterns, trajectories and/or metabolites&#xD;
      will be significantly associated with single or a combination of perinatal maternal and/on&#xD;
      infant factors. Also, that microbial alterations resulting from preterm birth contributes to&#xD;
      the allergy and asthma outcomes in infants through immune mechanisms.&#xD;

        This study recruits children born premature that reside in the Calgary Metropolitan Area&#xD;
        and their mother (where possible) parent or guardian. Children are recruited either in the&#xD;
        first week of life or, if previously participated on at least one of the PROBIO, BLOOM PTN,&#xD;
        Pregnancy During the Pandemic or BLOOM LTFU studies, between 3 months and 3.5 years&#xD;
        corrected age. A control group of children born at term (≥37 weeks gestation) will also be&#xD;
        recruited.&#xD;
