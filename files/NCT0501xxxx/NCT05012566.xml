  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social interaction via facial mimic expression is crucial in human relationship and&#xD;
      communication. Neural function disorder in this mechanism therefore affects human&#xD;
      communication and social interaction. Facial nerve palsy is the paralysis of any structure&#xD;
      innervated by the facial nerve, thus inibiting and severely compromising facial expression.&#xD;
      In the last decade a new algorithm of treatment of facial paralysis has been raised. It&#xD;
      connects the expertise of Aesthetic Medicine with the expertise of Plastic and Reconstructive&#xD;
      Surgery. It is based on the use of Botulinum Toxin (BT) and Hyaluronic Acid (HA fillers).&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin is a paralytic toxin that determine flaccid paralysis and is nowadays used in&#xD;
      the static correction of facial paralysis with minimal invasiveness, optimal results and no&#xD;
      time consumption. The HA fillers has the ability to restore facial volume loss and it is used&#xD;
      in the treatment of facial palsy to harmonize symmetry. The aim is to study the effects of&#xD;
      the BT and HA in facial paralysis patients in order to understand the efficacy of these&#xD;
      products that have never been injected together in this type of patients. Primary objective.&#xD;
      To evaluate the functional improvement of facial asymmetries due to facial nerve lesion after&#xD;
      the treatment with OnabotulinumtoxinA and hyaluronic acid fillers compared with the untreated&#xD;
      group. The evaluation will be performed analyzing the two groups at the baseline (visit 0)&#xD;
      and the end of the treatment period (visit 5, after 9 months). Improvement difference of at&#xD;
      least 1 grade on the House-Brackmann scale, compared with the untreated group, will be&#xD;
      considered clinically significant. Methods. The investigation is randomized open lab phase II&#xD;
      single centre clinical trial. This experimental study proposes to evaluate a group of 70&#xD;
      patients affected by hemifacial paralysis of level 3 to 6 on the House-Brackmann scale. 35&#xD;
      patients will be treated (Group A) with both OnabotulinumtoxinA and hyaluronic acid fillers&#xD;
      with a monitored follow up. A control group of 35 patients (Group B) who will not be treated,&#xD;
      will be enrolled to compare the efficacy of the treatment. During the study all the AE/ADR&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;

      The patients will be evaluated with instrumental (3D pictures, neuro-physiological&#xD;
      examination (EMG), radiological [Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)], Cone Beam Computer&#xD;
      Tomography (CBCT) and Ultrasound (US)) and non-instrumental analysis (clinical questionnaires&#xD;
      and hystological analysis). The histology will be performed with both traditional and&#xD;
      electronic approaches. The area of the biopsy will be the paralytic area in the two groups in&#xD;
      order to study the soft tissue modulation of the injected molecules. Patient's qiality of&#xD;
      life (QoL), through specifically test (FACE-Q), will be also evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>Change from baseline House-Brackmann score at day 270 will be assessed and then compared between the trial groups. The House-Brackmann score is a score to grade the degree of nerve damage in a facial nerve palsy.&#xD;
The measurement is determined by measuring the upwards (superior) movement of the mid-portion of the top of the eyebrow, and the outwards (lateral) movement of the angle of the mouth. Ti is consist of VI level: Grade I - Normal; Grade II - Slight Dysfunction; Grade III - Moderate Dysfunction; Grade IV - Moderate Severe Dysfunction; Grade V - Severe Dysfunction; Grade VI - Total Paralysis</description>
