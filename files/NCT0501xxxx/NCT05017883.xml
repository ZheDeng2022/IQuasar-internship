      This is a clinical study of ytaa05 cell injection in the treatment of patients with recurrent&#xD;
      / refractory acute myeloid leukemia.The purpose is to evaluate the safety and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of FLT3 car-t cells in patients with recurrent / refractory FLT3 positive acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia.#TAA05 cell injection is a T cell targeting FLT3 chimeric antigen receptor#&#xD;

      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological malignancy caused by abnormal differentiation&#xD;
      and uncontrolled proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. If AML is not given active&#xD;
      treatment within one year after diagnosis, it will cause fatal infection, bleeding and organ&#xD;
      infiltration due to abnormal proliferation of tumor cells. AML is one of the most common&#xD;
      leukemia. About 3.8 patients in every 100000 people are in the higher incidence rate among&#xD;
      people aged 65 and over, and 17.9 patients in every 100000 people. The cure rate of AML is&#xD;
      about 35-40% in patients ≤ 60 years old and only 5-15% in patients over 60 years old. The&#xD;
      survival of elderly patients who can not tolerate chemotherapy is frustrating, and the median&#xD;
      survival time is only 5-10 months. In the past 20 to 30 years, the treatment of acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) has made significant progress, so that about 80% of adult patients under the&#xD;
      age of 55 can achieve complete remission. However, more than half of Cr patients will&#xD;
      relapse, and the long-term survival rate is about 40%. Until the 1970s, diagnosis was only&#xD;
      based on pathological and cytological examination of bone marrow and blood. The five-year&#xD;
      survival rate was less than 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAR-T cells can recognize specific antigens in a non restricted manner of HLA and&#xD;
      continuously activate T cells. FLT3 is a potential target of AML. Therefore, the construction&#xD;
      of car-t cells that recognize human FLT3 molecule has high clinical value in the treatment of&#xD;
      AML.&#xD;

    <description>Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (car-t)&#xD;
Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (car-t) is one of the most effective therapies for malignant tumors (especially hematological tumors). Like other immunotherapies, the basic principle is to use the patient's own immune cells to clear cancer cells. Chimeric antigen receptor (car) is the core component of car-t, which endows T cells with the ability to recognize tumor antigens in an independent manner,which enables car modified T cells to recognize a wider range of targets than natural T cell surface receptors (TCR). The basic design of car includes a tumor associated antigen binding region (usually derived from scFv segment of monoclonal antibody antigen binding region), transmembrane region and intracellular signal region. The selection of target antigen is a key determinant for the specificity and effectiveness of car and the safety of genetically modified T cells.</description>
