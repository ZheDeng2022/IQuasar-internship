  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose, multi-cohort study.&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single and&#xD;
      7-day repeat oral doses LABP-104 in healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: a single ascending dose (SAD) part (Part A) and a&#xD;
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) part (Part B). A total of 56 participants will be randomized in&#xD;
      this study (35 in the SAD part, 21 in the MAD part).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAD Part: Participants will be randomized to receive a single oral dose of LABP-104 (250 mg,&#xD;
      500 mg, 750 mg, 1000 mg or 1500 mg) or placebo after a 6-hour fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAD Part: Participants will be randomized to receive LABP-104 (250 mg, 750 mg, or 1500 mg) or&#xD;
      placebo once daily for 7 days after a 6-hour fast.&#xD;
