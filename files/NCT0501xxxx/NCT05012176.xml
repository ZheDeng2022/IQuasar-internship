    <textblock>
      This clinical trial evaluates the use of an Episodic Future thinking Intervention to promote&#xD;
      weight loss in breast cancer survivors. Obesity is associated with multiple negative health&#xD;
      sequelae in breast cancer survivors. This includes an increased risk of cancer recurrence and&#xD;
      mortality, multiple quality of life issues, and increased risk of co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delay Discounting is a behavioral health economic target that refers to the &quot;discounting&quot; of&#xD;
      a larger benefit in the future for a smaller, more immediate reward in the present. A high&#xD;
      delay discounting rate is correlated with poor dietary choices and sedentary lifestyle.&#xD;
      Episodic Future Thinking (EFT) simulates positive events that may occur in one's future,&#xD;
      engaging the science of prospection. EFT decreases delay discounting rate, resulting in&#xD;
      healthier diet choices and weight reduction. However, valuation of the future may impact&#xD;
      cancer survivors differently due to adjusted mortality perception and cancer-related stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of remotely delivered&#xD;
      (smartphone application) EFT as a behavioral intervention for weight loss in breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors. Implementation of EFT as a complementary approach to standard lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions could lead to improvement in weight loss, food choice, and quality of life,&#xD;
      thereby positively impacting overall health and longevity in cancer survivors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the feasibility of the 12-week remotely delivered episodic future thinking&#xD;
      (EFT) intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the impact of EFT compared to control (episodic recent thinking [ERT]) on&#xD;
      weight loss and delay discounting (DD) in overweight and obese breast cancer survivors at 12&#xD;
      and 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the baseline and 12 week change in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIa. Patient reported outcomes (PROs) measured by standard instruments: Patient Reported&#xD;
      Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scales 29 Profile version (v)2.1 (domains:&#xD;
      physical function, social roles, fatigue, depression, anxiety, pain, sleep disturbance) and&#xD;
      Global Health Short Form (general physical and mental health).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIb. Insulin resistance (Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance [HOMA-IR]) and&#xD;
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIc. Diet quality, measured by Health Eating Index (HEI)-2015 on Vioscreen food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire (FFQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients participate in EFT over 12 weeks, in which they will receive prompts via a&#xD;
      guided smartphone application to engage in EFT in their daily lives. Patients are asked to&#xD;
      recall future positive experiences to create text cues which vividly describes these&#xD;
      experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients participate in Episodic Recent Thinking (ERT; control arm) over 12 weeks, in&#xD;
      which they will receive prompts via a guided smartphone application to engage in control&#xD;
      thinking in their daily lives. Patients are asked to recall past positive experiences to&#xD;
      create text cues which vividly describes these experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up for an additional12 weeks.&#xD;
