      SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) and response assessment after neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      with computed tomography (CT) are two diagnostic modalities used to assess metastatic spread&#xD;
      in gastric cancer patients. It is still unclear in what proportion of patients clinically&#xD;
      relevant metastases or other significant findings (e.g. contra-indications of surgery) are&#xD;
      detected that impact on the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the clinical value of diagnostic laparoscopy and computed tomography&#xD;
      response assessment after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with gastric and&#xD;
      esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Multicentre retrospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All Patients with gastric and gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma who&#xD;
      underwent clinical staging and were discussed at multidisciplinary team meetings (MDT)&#xD;
      between January 2016 and December 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): Not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is the proportion (%) of patients&#xD;
      who do not proceed with treatment as planned after a DL and CT response assessment (i.e. the&#xD;
      proportion of patients in which metastasized disease or other contra-indications for surgery&#xD;
      is found).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Since this is an observational study, no burden or risks are associated with&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;

        All patients with gastric and gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma who presented or were&#xD;
        referred to one of the participating centres and have been discussed at multidisciplinary&#xD;
        team meetings (MDT) for curative management from January 2016 through December 2018. The&#xD;
        University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz will only contribute&#xD;
        with data on DL and not on patients who underwent CT response assessment.&#xD;
