  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal is a relatively rare cancer (less than 3% of&#xD;
      digestive cancers) but its incidence has been increasing in recent decades, probably because&#xD;
      of its association with HPV (human papillomavirus) infection. Its extension is mainly&#xD;
      locoregional pelvic by lymphatic route, rarely metastatic. The standard treatment nowadays is&#xD;
      radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy for locally advanced tumors (T2 or more corresponding&#xD;
      to a size of 2 cm or more, or N+): mitomycin C and 5-FU (or capecitabine). While the 5-year&#xD;
      disease control rates are excellent in localized forms, around 80%, for locally advanced&#xD;
      tumors, the prognosis is poorer, with only 70% progression-free survival at 3 years in&#xD;
      patients treated with radiochemotherapy. In these patients, it seems particularly interesting&#xD;
      to understand the mechanisms of tumor resistance to treatments, in order to increase their&#xD;
      efficacy and to propose new therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microenvironment of solid tumors, which has been extensively studied in the last two&#xD;
      decades, is now recognized as a major factor in tumor development and invasion. Immune cells,&#xD;
      and more particularly macrophages, represent an essential component of the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment, and constitute a link between innate and adaptive responses. The presence&#xD;
      of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and in particular M2 macrophages, with an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor action (as opposed to M1 macrophages which are on the&#xD;
      contrary tumoricidal and pro-inflammatory), has been studied in many cancers, such as head&#xD;
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma,&#xD;
      and non-small cell lung cancer. To our knowledge, it has not been studied in squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the anal canal.&#xD;
