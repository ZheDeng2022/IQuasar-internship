    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies the safety and feasibility of inducing a hypothyroxinemic&#xD;
      state in patients with glioblastoma or gliosarcoma that has come back (recurrent). This trial&#xD;
      aims to see if giving a specific thyroid hormone, such as methimazole and liothyronine, is&#xD;
      safe and could benefit cancer treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of inducing a hypothyroxinemic state in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of inducing hypothyroxinemic state by assessing&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the correlation of PFS and OS with thyroid hormone levels. III. To evaluate&#xD;
      the correlation of overall response rate (ORR) with thyroid hormone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the correlation of potential side effects with T3 levels or methimazole dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CATEGORY 1 (normal baseline thyroid function and no levothyroxine replacement): Patients&#xD;
      receive methimazole orally (PO) daily and lomustine daily. Treatment with lomustine repeats&#xD;
      every 6 weeks for up to 6 cycles or 12 months. Patients may receive liothyronine PO twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) when thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is above upper normal limit. Treatment&#xD;
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CATEGORY 2 (baseline primary hypothyroidism in patients taking levothyroxine): Patients&#xD;
      receive liothyronine PO BID to maintain lower free T4 below lower limit of normal and TSH and&#xD;
      free T3 in the normal range. At the time of cessation of exogenous T4, patients receive&#xD;
      lomustine every 6 weeks for up to 6 cycles or 12 months. Treatment continues in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CATEGORY 3 (secondary/tertiary hypothyroidism): Patients receive liothyronine PO BID to&#xD;
      maintain lower free T4 below lower limit of normal and free T3 within normal range. At the&#xD;
      time of cessation of exogenous T4, patients receive lomustine every 6 weeks for up to 6&#xD;
      cycles or 12 months. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6 and&#xD;
      8 weeks.&#xD;
