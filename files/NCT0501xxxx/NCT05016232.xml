  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;PrEP N' Shine&quot; is a two-stage randomized controlled pilot trial which utilizes a behavioral&#xD;
      intervention to optimize the uptake and adherence of Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) in&#xD;
      Transgender women (TGW).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;PrEP N' Shine&quot; package includes two behavioral intervention components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Peer-led, strengths-based case management (SBCM) for PrEP linkage and uptake, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A resource-efficient, adaptive &quot;stepped-care&quot; technology and counseling intervention&#xD;
           that addresses individualized barriers to optimal use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: TGW will be equally randomized to receive either the strengths-based case management&#xD;
      or standard of care referral to PrEP clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Those from stage 1 who initiate PrEP , regardless of stage 1 randomization&#xD;
      condition, will then be equally randomized to either the &quot;PrEP N' Shine&quot; adherence&#xD;
      intervention or standard of care comparison condition.&#xD;

    <description>Change in sexual risk behavior to be measured using AIDS-Risk Behavior Assessment (ARBA), a computerized self-interview designed to assess self-reported sexual behaviors. Sexual risk questions refer to three types of sexual behavior (anal, oral, vaginal) and assess detailed sexual risk information by partner type (transactional, casual, main) and by HIV-status, whether protected or unprotected, and whether in the context of substance use in past 3 months.</description>

    <ipd_description>It is anticipated that this data will be presented annually on data collected after the second year when sufficient baseline data is collected. It is anticipated that most of the papers and data-based projects/presentations will happen in year 3, when all of the baseline data is collected, and the 3 month outcome has occurred for all participants. Sharing of the findings will involve a primary paper describing the study outcome and a paper that describes the intervention, as well as submitting to lead workshops on the intervention approach at relevant national meetings and conferences. Raw data for additional analysis will be available to outside individuals through contacting the MPIs. Information regarding the availability of data for analysis will be listed on the MPIs' web pages. Contact information for the MPIs will be listed in all manuscripts and publications as another means to access data.</ipd_description>
