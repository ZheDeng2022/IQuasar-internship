  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a gene transfer study for patients with a type of blood cancer called Acute&#xD;
      Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) that has come back or has not gone away after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect&#xD;
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer:&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from&#xD;
      infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special&#xD;
      infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with&#xD;
      viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with&#xD;
      cancers. They have shown promise but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. For&#xD;
      example, T lymphocytes can kill cancer cells but there normally are not enough of them to&#xD;
      kill all the cancer cells. Some researchers have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown&#xD;
      more of them in the laboratory and then given them back to the person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antibody used in this study targets CD19, CD20 and CD22. This antibody sticks to ALL&#xD;
      cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called CD19, CD20 and/or CD22. For&#xD;
      this study, the antibody to CD19, CD20 and CD22 has been changed so that instead of floating&#xD;
      free in the blood, it is now joined to the T cells. When T-cells contain an antibody that is&#xD;
      joined to them, they are called chimeric antigen receptor- T cells or CAR-T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the laboratory, we have also found that T cells work better if we also add proteins that&#xD;
      stimulate them. One such protein is called 4-1BB. Adding the 4-1BB molecule makes the cells&#xD;
      grow better and last longer in the body, giving them a better chance of killing the leukemia&#xD;
      cells. In this study we are going to attach the CD19/CD20/CD22 chimeric receptor that has&#xD;
      4-1BB added to the patient's T cells. We will then test how long the cells last.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These T cells, called &quot;TriCAR&quot; T cells are investigational products not approved by the Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TriCAR T-cells were made in the laboratory by stimulating the patient's blood with growth&#xD;
      factors to make the T cells grow. To get the CD19/CD20/CD22 antibody and 4-1BB to attach to&#xD;
      the surface of the T cell, we inserted the antibody gene into the T cell. This is done using&#xD;
      a virus called a retrovirus that has been made for this study and will carry the antibody&#xD;
      gene into the T cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be assigned a dose of TriCAR T-cells. Prior to receiving the TriCAR&#xD;
      T-cells patients will receive two chemotherapy medications, cyclophosphamide (for 2 days) and&#xD;
      fludarabine (4 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An injection of TriCAR T-cells will be given into a vein through an IV at the assigned dose.&#xD;
      The injection will take from 1 to 20 minutes. Before receiving the infusion of TriCAR T-cells&#xD;
      patients may be pre-medicated with Benadryl and Tylenol. Patients will be monitored for up to&#xD;
      3 hours after the injection, and will have to remain locally for at least 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If after a 4-week evaluation period, the patient has a complete response, they may proceed to&#xD;
      bone marrow transplant, and will be removed from the treatment portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment, patients will undergo a series of tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam and History&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test for female patients who are of childbearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of your leukemia tumor cells by bone marrow studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging such as PET scans, CT scans or MRIs will be obtained if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      During and after treatment, patients will receive these standard medical tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and physical examination: pre-infusion of T cells (pre-day 0, day 0) and at day&#xD;
           1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 28 and 63 post infusion of T- cells. Subsequently, history will be&#xD;
           taken at 3-, 6-, and 12-months post infusion of T-cells, and then yearly for a total of&#xD;
           15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function (On Days 4, 7, 10, 14, 28&#xD;
           and 63; then at month 3, 6, and 12; then yearly to year 15)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of your leukemia tumor cells by bone marrow studies 3-6 weeks after the&#xD;
           infusion, possibly 9-12 weeks after the infusion and then per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging such as PET scans, CT scans or MRIs will be obtained, if needed, 4-6 weeks&#xD;
           following the infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Draws:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be taken before the chemotherapy drugs, 2-4 hours after the T cell infusion, at&#xD;
      around day 7, day 10, day 14, day 28 and day 63 after the infusion, at 3 months, 6 months, 9&#xD;
      months, at 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, then yearly for a total of 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional doses of TriCAR T-cells (re-treatment): Up to three additional infusions of&#xD;
      TriCAR-T cells may be given if eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of your death, we will request permission from your next of kin to perform an&#xD;
      autopsy to learn more about the effect of this experimental treatment on your cancer.&#xD;
