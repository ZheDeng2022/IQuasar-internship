  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current treatments for type 2 diabetes (e.g., lifestyle changes and clinical interventions&#xD;
      such as medication), have been shown to be unsustainable due to low levels of physical&#xD;
      activity and increasing clinical costs. Therefore, scientists have been looking for new&#xD;
      treatments to address this issue. One such treatment that is being investigated is passive&#xD;
      heating (e.g., hot baths, saunas, etc.). In this study the investigators want to ascertain&#xD;
      what passive heating, if any, individuals with T2DM currently do, what their perceptions of&#xD;
      passive heating would be if it were to become a treatment, what may make it easier or more&#xD;
      difficult for them to engage in passive heating, and how this might impact other areas of&#xD;
      their life such as physical activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study employs an interpretivist approach through semi-structured interviews to highlight&#xD;
      participants' perceptions of and experiences with passive heating. To date, this topic has&#xD;
      not been explored in-depth - this approach should bring nuance and context to light, aiding&#xD;
      in future advocacy work which explores the potential of passive heating as a viable treatment&#xD;
      for adults with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured interviews will be facilitated by an interview guide consisting of four main&#xD;
      topic areas aiming to explore an individual's perception of and experience with passive&#xD;
      heating as a treatment for T2DM and to ascertain whether engaging in this behaviour may&#xD;
      affect physical activity. As no two conversations are ever the same, the approach to the&#xD;
      interviews is one of flexibility through the use of open-ended questions and potential probes&#xD;
      as the situation dictates - remaining open to following particular lines of participant&#xD;
      thought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will all be conducted by the Principal investigator, Mr Thomas James, a doctoral&#xD;
      researcher who has been trained in the required skills. He has also undertaken necessary&#xD;
      training in Good Clinical Practice and Valid Informed Consent. Interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      virtually, by telephone or in person and will take place either at home or in a laboratory&#xD;
      setting, dependent upon the individual's wishes. The interviews will be audio recorded and&#xD;
      subsequently transcribed verbatim by a member of the research team. Transcriptions will be&#xD;
      analysed via thematic analysis to determine the main themes expressed by participants. All&#xD;
      data analysis will be conducted by a trained member of the research team.&#xD;
