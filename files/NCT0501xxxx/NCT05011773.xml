  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of sleep disturbances is mainly attempted through drug administration. However,&#xD;
      certain drugs are associated with unwanted side effects or residual effects upon awakening&#xD;
      (e.g. sleepiness, ataxia) which can increase the risks of falls and fractures. In addition,&#xD;
      there can be systemic consequences of long-term use. An alternative method of manipulating&#xD;
      sleep is by stimulating the brain to influence the electroencephalogram (EEG). To date, there&#xD;
      have been mixed results from stimulating superficial areas of the brain and, as far as we&#xD;
      know, there has been no systematic attempt to influence deep brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients suffering from movement disorders, such as Parkinson's Disease (PD) and&#xD;
      Multiple Systems Atrophy (MSA), also have disrupted sleep. Currently, at stages where drug&#xD;
      treatment no longer offers adequate control of their motor symptoms, these patients are&#xD;
      implanted with a deep brain stimulation system. This involves depth electrodes which deliver&#xD;
      constant pulse stimulation to the targeted area. A similar system is used in patients with&#xD;
      severe epilepsy, as well as some patients with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this feasibility study is to investigate whether we can improve sleep quality in&#xD;
      patients with deep brain stimulators by delivering targeted stimulation patterns during&#xD;
      specific stages of sleep. We will only use stimulation frequencies that have been proven to&#xD;
      be safe for patients and frequently used for clinical treatment of their disorder. We will&#xD;
      examine the structure and quality of sleep as well as how alert patients are when they wake&#xD;
      up, while also monitoring physiological markers such as heart rate and blood pressure. Upon&#xD;
      awakening, we will ask the patients to provide their subjective opinion of their sleep and&#xD;
      complete some simple tests to see how alert they are compared to baseline condition which&#xD;
      would be either stimulation at the standard clinical setting or no stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope that our study will open new ways of optimising sleep without the use of drugs, in&#xD;
      patients who are implanted with depth electrodes. We also believe that our findings will&#xD;
      broaden the understanding of how the activity of deep brain areas influences sleep and&#xD;
      alertness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study that will take place in two UK sites: the John Radcliffe Hospital&#xD;
      (Oxford) and the Surrey Sleep Research Centre, University of Surrey. The identification,&#xD;
      consent and screening of patients will take place in Oxford, and the sleep assessments will&#xD;
      take place in Surrey. A parallel study will also be conducted at US sites (Mayo Clinic,&#xD;
      Rochester MA, and UCSF, CA) under the same funding but this will be reviewed by their local&#xD;
      IRB. De-identified data may be shared between sites for analyses purposes. This will be done&#xD;
      securely in an encrypted fashion while participants will be made fully aware of this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be identified during their routine clinic visits with the Functional&#xD;
      Neurosurgery team (John Radcliffe Hospital) and invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Screening of interested potential participants will take into account pre-operative&#xD;
      assessment data. Testing will ensue (within a variable period from screening, but within the&#xD;
      aforementioned study timeline), over two visits to the Surrey Sleep Research Centre, each&#xD;
      consisting of two nights. The maximum duration between consent and first study visit will be&#xD;
      three months, while there will be a minimum of two weeks between each study visit to allow&#xD;
      for preliminary analyses. Informed consent and baseline sleep recordings will be obtained&#xD;
      over the first night of the first visit to Surrey, with the remaining nights consisting of&#xD;
      stimulation trials. Questionnaires, daytime vigilance testing, autonomic parameters and&#xD;
      cortisol levels will be collected. No long-term follow-up is planned at this stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regards to data collection processes, the population of patients visiting the Surrey&#xD;
      site will have already been implanted with a DBS system (such as an Activa PC/PC+S&#xD;
      (Medtronic) or an Abbot/St Jude device). The investigators will leverage rules from the&#xD;
      current AASM guidelines, technologies and methods for manual and automated sleep scoring&#xD;
      using standard scalp polysomnography as well as novel methods we previously developed for&#xD;
      sleep scoring using intracranial electrophysiology. To avoid contamination of the&#xD;
      electrophysiology monitoring amplifiers by the stimulation protocol, a combination of bipolar&#xD;
      stimulation and sampling-stimulate rate interactions will be used. For example, we will apply&#xD;
      know-how from the Activa PC+S work to place any residual artefacts into bands of little&#xD;
      physiological interest (DC, 50/60Hz, etc.). A preliminary assessment of amplifier performance&#xD;
      will provide assurance that we will be able to maintain sleep staging accuracy over the&#xD;
      course of our experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For perturbations, the CE-marked clinician programmer will be used (especially at the&#xD;
      open-loop stage) or a research variant thereof. In this study, high-frequency (HF) is&#xD;
      specified at a stimulation range from 41Hz to 250Hz, while low frequency (LF) will be defined&#xD;
      as 2-40Hz. All perturbations will be within the clinical range used and approved for DBS&#xD;
      patients. A combination of subjective and objective measurements of sleep quality and&#xD;
      efficiency to measure the impact of any sleep perturbations will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following objective metrics will be derived from visual/manual polysomnography (gold&#xD;
      standard) &amp; automated algorithm sleep staging:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total sleep time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Number of sleep cycles (switches of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement&#xD;
           (REM) sleep).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Initial sleep and REM latencies (Time from beginning of study to the first stage of&#xD;
           sleep, and from beginning of sleep to first REM sleep onset).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Duration of N1, N2, N3, and REM stages, and the duration of NREM (sum of&#xD;
           N1,N2,N3)stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sleep efficiency (100*total sleep time/time in bed).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Number of awakenings during night, including arousals per hour and duration of time&#xD;
           spent awake after initial sleep onset (i.e., wake after sleep onset time)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Apnoea-hypopnea and respiratory disturbance indices (the frequency of stop or reduced&#xD;
           breathing episodes, and respiratory arousals per hour)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Periodic limb movement indices (the frequency of periodic leg movements of sleep per&#xD;
           hour)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Measures of arousal during sleep&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. behavioural macrostate observations such as eye opening or blinking that can be&#xD;
                assessed in video recordings&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. microarousal observations defined exclusively by cortical fast frequency shifts&#xD;
                (ie, &gt;14 Hz rhythms) lasting 3 seconds or longer, with or without added autonomic&#xD;
                measures of tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Spectral composition of the sleep stage specific EEG over the 0.25-32 Hz frequency&#xD;
                range Salivary samples to characterize awakening levels of cortisol will be&#xD;
                obtained in the Surrey Sleep Research Centre at the end of each night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be administered to patients such as those listed below (not all&#xD;
      necessary):&#xD;
