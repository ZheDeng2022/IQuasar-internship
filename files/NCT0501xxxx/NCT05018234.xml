  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>safety of device as measured by the number of patients with adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>During the time the OA device is worn, that is, from the time of appointment 2(1 month after enrollment) to the time of appointment 3 (1 week after appointment 2)&quot;</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comfort of the novel OA device as measured by the delivery (pre care) patient feedback survey</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after enrollment(appointment 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Comfort will be assessed through a numerical rating scale and short answer survey that will assess comfort and user feedback while wearing the novel OA device. There are 4 questions in the survey, the first one has 5 answer choices about how the appliance fits to the teeth and ranges from very tight fit to very loose fit .The rest of the questions are rated form 1-10,a higher number indicating more comfort</description>

    <measure>Comfort of the novel OA device as measured by the post care patient feedback survey</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after appointment 2(appointment 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Comfort will be assessed through a numerical rating scale and short answer survey that will assess comfort and user feedback while wearing the novel OA device.There are 12 questions in the survey, the first one has 5 answer choices about how the appliance fits to the teeth and ranges from very tight fit to very loose fit .The next 8 questions are rated form 1-10,a higher number indicating more comfort, the 9th question indicates any adverse events and the last 3 questions are short answer questions describing the patient's experience with the device.</description>
