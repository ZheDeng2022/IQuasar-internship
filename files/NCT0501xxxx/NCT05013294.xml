      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a diet-related mHealth (mobile&#xD;
      health) intervention on glycated hemoglobin among adults with type 2 diabetes. The study&#xD;
      hypothesizes that using mHealth influences food literacy and dietary behavior and may result&#xD;
      in a reduction of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) by at least 0. 3% in 12 weeks in adults with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes. This study will be conducted in Nakuru County, a cosmopolitan county located&#xD;
      in Northwestern Kenya. Participants will be eligible to be included in the study if they will&#xD;
      meet the following criteria: (i) adults over the age of 18 years; (ii) diagnosed with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes in the previous 1 year and obtaining care at a participating level 4 hospital; (iii)&#xD;
      able to read and write English or Swahili Language; (iv) currently own and able to read and&#xD;
      send mobile text messages using any phone. Participants will be excluded if they are on&#xD;
      dialysis or pregnant. The primary outcome measure will be HbA1c, which shall be measured at&#xD;
      baseline and at the end of the intervention. Secondary outcome measures will include fasting&#xD;
      plasma Glucose (FPG), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and high-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). Other secondary outcome measures will include anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements (weight, height, waist and hip circumferences) and behaviour change (changes in&#xD;
      dietary intake of legumes, fruits and vegetables). Additionally, mHealth satisfaction shall&#xD;
      be assessed at 12 weeks and 24 weeks post-intervention to assess the sustainability of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sample size of 60 a-priori (n=30 intervention, n=30 control arm) was determined to assess&#xD;
      feasibility of text messaging in optimizing glycemic control. It is anticipated that this&#xD;
      proof-of-concept study will obtain parameters that will be used in determining a robust power&#xD;
      calculation for a fully powered efficacy trial. Purposive sampling will be used to select two&#xD;
      hospitals, one in a rural setting and another in an urban setting in Nakuru County, Kenya.&#xD;
      Multistage random sampling using computer-generated list of random numbers will then be&#xD;
      applied to randomly assign 15 participants to either the intervention arm or control arm. The&#xD;
      hospitals' diabetes registers will be used to select patients on regular diabetes care from&#xD;
      the hospital patient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will receive a total of 43 text messages developed using the Behavior&#xD;
      Change Wheel (BCW) approach. The text messages that are linked to specific behavior change&#xD;
      techniques will provide practical information or guidance to influence selection and eating&#xD;
      of healthy diet for type 2 diabetes. Additionally, two-way text messages, will be sent to&#xD;
      study participants to rate their ability on selection of food and eating of healthy diet&#xD;
      based on the messages received after every 4 weeks. The combination of the one-way and&#xD;
      two-way messages in this in the intervention arm are designed to increase engagement of the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will continue receiving standard care in the hospitals. This group shall&#xD;
      also receive clinic appointment reminder text messages one day prior to the actual date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be analyzed by the intention to treat principle. Various patient&#xD;
      characteristics and primary outcome measures, including anthropometric and biochemical&#xD;
      measurements (HbA1c, Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG), lipid profiles) at baseline will be&#xD;
      summarized using descriptive statistics. The descriptive statistics will include means and&#xD;
      standard deviations for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HbA1c levels will be compared at 12 weeks between the two arms using an ANCOVA which will&#xD;
      control for baseline HbA1c levels. The intervention and the control groups will be&#xD;
      followed-up for six months to assess sustainability and mHealth satisfaction of the&#xD;
      intervention. One-way and two-way text messaging data will be analyzed descriptively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analysis per hospital and participant socio-demographics including age, sex,&#xD;
      education and income levels will be conducted. All statistical analyses will be performed&#xD;
      using R version 4.0.3.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention group will receive a total of 43 text messages. Text messages were developed using the Behavior Chang Wheel (BCW) through a systematic process linked to specific behavior change techniques. The text messages will provide practical information or guidance to influence selection and eating healthy diet for type 2 diabetes care. The text messages were either loss- or gain-framed to increase influence on behavioral decisions. Additionally, the participants will receive a text message to rate their ability on selection of food and eating of healthy diet based on the messages received in the month. The combination of the one-way and two-way messages in this group are designed to increase engagement of the participants.</description>
