  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gastric cancer diagnosis and treatment specifications clearly point out that tumor&#xD;
      markers need to be detected in the process of diagnosis, efficacy evaluation and follow-up.&#xD;
      However, there is currently a lack of gastric cancer markers with high sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity, and the detection of markers is limited to a single index analysis, which has&#xD;
      many shortcomings such as long analysis time, large reagent consumption, and high detection&#xD;
      cost. Therefore, this project will use protein chips to detect new types of gastric cancer&#xD;
      patient markers and establish a multi-diagnostic model for early screening of gastric cancer.&#xD;
      Finally, monoclonal antibodies will be produced against various high-specific tumor markers&#xD;
      and a gastric cancer diagnostic kit will be established.&#xD;

      1 Preliminary screening of early gastric cancer markers and antibody verification&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Recruitment and sample preparation of patients and healthy people: This project requires&#xD;
      four batches of subjects, three batches of healthy people, early gastric cancer and advanced&#xD;
      gastric cancer groups, with an average of 30 cases in each group. The other batch (the second&#xD;
      batch) is healthy people and 30 cases of chronic atrophic gastritis, early gastric cancer and&#xD;
      30 cases of chronic atrophic gastritis. There were 100 cases in each of the advanced gastric&#xD;
      cancer group, and 20 cases in each of liver cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer.&#xD;
      Serum and plasma samples obtained from subjects are used to screen potential gastric cancer&#xD;
      tumor markers, verify the practicability of established gastric cancer tumor marker&#xD;
      diagnostic models and test kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment of gastric cancer patients: 30 cases of early gastric cancer patients (T1,&#xD;
           T2) and advanced gastric cancer patients (T3, T4) are selected respectively. The staging&#xD;
           of gastric cancer is based on the eighth edition of UICC (International Union Against&#xD;
           Cancer) TNM staging. Subjects were screened according to the requirements of the&#xD;
           informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recruitment of healthy people: 30 volunteers without underlying diseases are selected as&#xD;
           healthy control group. Subjects were screened according to the requirements of the&#xD;
           informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample preparation: intravenous collection to obtain whole blood samples of patients and&#xD;
           healthy controls. The sample requirement for each subject is 600ul of serum and plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2) Antibody chip screening for potential tumor markers of gastric cancer for the first time&#xD;
      In order to screen for potential protein markers of gastric cancer, Raybiotech's&#xD;
      high-throughput quantitative antibody chip (AAH-BLG-2000) was used to measure 640 in the&#xD;
      first batch of subjects (early gastric cancer, advanced gastric cancer, and healthy controls&#xD;
      each 30). Kind of human protein. Preliminarily screen out differential proteins, conduct&#xD;
      bioinformatics analysis, and finally screen differentially expressed proteins relevant to the&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2Customized antibody chip to verify gastric cancer tumor markers In order to further verify&#xD;
      the candidate tumor markers for the diagnosis of gastric cancer, the differential proteins&#xD;
      screened in the previous stage were customized for antibody chips. Use subject serum samples&#xD;
      (second batch) for potential biomarker verification. According to the test results, the&#xD;
      poorly specific proteins are discarded, and the more specific proteins are retained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Establishment of diagnostic model Use regression analysis to combine and compare multiple&#xD;
      differential proteins, perform quantitative analysis, establish a standard curve, establish a&#xD;
      diagnostic model for highly specific differential proteins, and further measure the&#xD;
      practicability of the highly specific differential protein diagnostic model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Kit development Monoclonal antibodies were produced as capture antibodies for various&#xD;
      high-specific tumor markers, and finally a gastric cancer diagnosis kit was established and&#xD;
      promoted in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishment and performance measurement of gastric cancer diagnostic kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish gastric cancer diagnostic kits, quality control reference materials and&#xD;
           formulate relevant standards on the basis of the above research results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Precision testing: Dilute the self-made quality control reference materials to 3&#xD;
           concentrations of high, medium, and low, each with 3 replicate holes, repeat the test 10&#xD;
           times, and calculate the mean, standard deviation, and test value of each quality&#xD;
           control reference product. Coefficient of Variation (CV) value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sensitivity detection: Take the zero reference standard (specific difference protein) as&#xD;
           the sample, and substitute the average value of the fluorescence value measured 20 times&#xD;
           plus 2 times the standard deviation into the standard curve equation to calculate the&#xD;
           minimum detection volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Stability test: Divide the self-made kits into two groups and place them in a 4℃ freezer&#xD;
           for 6 months and 37℃ for 7 days. The physical appearance of the kit, the linearity of&#xD;
           the dose-response curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and minimum detection volume And other&#xD;
           indicators are measured, and the specific detection method is the same as the above&#xD;
           steps (2) and (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Comparison with other gastric cancer detection methods: use self-prepared detection kits&#xD;
           to detect 30 cases of early gastric cancer serum samples, 30 cases of advanced gastric&#xD;
           cancer serum samples, and 30 healthy human serum samples, and analyze the test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Promotion and optimization of the kit. Random sampling is performed among patients using&#xD;
           this kit to observe the diagnosis rate of early clinical gastric cancer and the&#xD;
           corresponding prognosis, and analyze the results of the return visit. According to the&#xD;
           results of the return visit, continue to conduct corresponding experiments to optimize&#xD;
           the performance of the kit, for example: improve its accuracy, sensitivity, and so on.&#xD;
