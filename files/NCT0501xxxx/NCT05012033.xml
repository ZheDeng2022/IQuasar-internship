    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to investigate serum prednisolone profiles in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients on high doses of prednisolone for any inflammatory disorder, both in the acute&#xD;
           and chronic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients stepping up from or down to prednisolone therapy in association with a course&#xD;
           of high dose methyl-prednisolone or dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise 3 groups, including those started on high doses of prednisolone&#xD;
      acutely in an inpatient or outpatient setting, participants on chronically high doses, and&#xD;
      those receiving a several week course of high dose methylprednisolone or dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to measure prednisolone levels at a number of time points to investigate serum&#xD;
      profile differences in those receiving prednisolone acutely compared with longer term steroid&#xD;
      use. Further samples will be taken to characterise additional metabolic changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prednisolone is an anti-inflammatory drug widely used to reduce inflammation and immune&#xD;
      activation in a number of medical conditions, including asthma, allergy, inflammatory and&#xD;
      auto-immune conditions. Its therapeutic actions, however, are accompanied by several adverse&#xD;
      side effects, which are more frequent following high doses and long term treatments. The aim&#xD;
      is therefore to use the lowest effective dose or highest dose for the shortest treatment&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been observed in a select number of patients on replacement prednisolone doses for&#xD;
      adrenal insufficiency (AI) that serum prednisolone levels change over time, despite patients&#xD;
      remaining on the same dose. It is currently unclear whether serum levels of prednisolone&#xD;
      match the doses in patients taking high dose prednisolone, both in the acute and chronic&#xD;
      setting, and whether the way in which prednisolone is metabolised is altered after receiving&#xD;
      high doses for prolonged periods of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for the use of particular doses for particular conditions is not clear, and has&#xD;
      been developed historically in the absence of individual patient data. It is possible that&#xD;
      more tailored dosing of prednisolone will result in reduced side effects, and that the&#xD;
      minimum possible dose may be weight related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, genetic and epigenetic factors may also play a role in the efficacy of&#xD;
      prednisolone and in the risk of developing side effects, accounting for some of the&#xD;
      inter-individual variation in drug response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further characterising this may help to create an evidence base to tailor anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      doses and weaning regimens of synthetic glucocorticoids that avoid deleterious effects.&#xD;
