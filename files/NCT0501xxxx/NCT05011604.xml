  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The digital workflow in dental implantology has been used for planning the cases with the&#xD;
      intraoral scanners and computer tomography, together helping clinicians to be more accurate&#xD;
      and precise. Today, thanks to digital technology clinicians can plan from surgical to the&#xD;
      final prosthesis using 3D models and cad-cam machines. The aim of this research is to&#xD;
      validate the full digital workflow for the single-tooth implant rehabilitation. A total of 19&#xD;
      patients (22 implants) were included in the present study with mean follow-up time of 2&#xD;
      years. A full-digital workflow was performed on each patient through the design and printing&#xD;
      of a surgical guide, the taking of the impression with an intraoral scanner and the CAD-CAM&#xD;
      design of the crowns.&#xD;

      Study design The present study was a retrospective case series conducted in one clinical&#xD;
      center in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines (GCPs) following the&#xD;
      recommendations of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki-ethical principles&#xD;
      for medical research involving human subjects as revised in Fortaleza (2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were informed about the benefits and the possible risks of a fully digital&#xD;
      workflow and its alternatives finally a signed written consent was obtained. Subject&#xD;
      population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current retrospective study was performed in a private clinic in Rome, Italy, where all&#xD;
      patients treated by the same operator between January 2017 and June 2020 were consecutively&#xD;
      enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients older than 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in good health (Asa 1 or Asa 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with healthy periodontium (probing pocket depth ≤ 4 mm, no bleeding on probing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients not requiring bone augmentation procedures Patients requiring a single implant&#xD;
           supported reconstructions were included in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical and prosthetic workflow For all patients included in the study, a digital impression&#xD;
      was taken using an intraoral scanner (CS3600, Carestream Dental, Atlanta, Ga). During the&#xD;
      same day, a CBCT (CS9000 3D, Carestream Dental, Atlanta, Ga) exam was performed on the&#xD;
      mandibular or maxillary jaw with the missing tooth. The stl. and the dicom. files were then&#xD;
      superimposed to allow the surgical planning (RealGuide, 3Diemme, Cantù, Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after planning, implant insertion was performed after the elevation of a flap with a&#xD;
      papilla preservation technique. Once designed, the flap was dis-epitelized using a diamond&#xD;
      bur. Then it was elevated and reflected to increase the volume on the buccal side and exposed&#xD;
      the bone surface. After this point, the implant (Sweden &amp; Martina, Padua, Italy) was&#xD;
      inserted, and another digital impression was taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sutures 6.0 were positioned (monofilament-polyglecaprone suture, Surgiclryl-Monofast&#xD;
      ®SMI-Belgium) after healing abutment positioning to stabilize the soft tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the mean, time, the file of the impression was sent to technician and the final abutment&#xD;
      and the provisional were designed and manufactured using cad-cam technology. One week&#xD;
      thereafter, definitive abutment was positioned and screwed at 25N/cm Provisional restoration&#xD;
      was then cemented using provisional cement (Temp Bond, Kerr Sybron Dental Specialities,&#xD;
      Washington, DC, USA) removing all the possible occlusal contacts both in protrusive and in&#xD;
      lateral positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sutures were removed 2 weeks postoperative. Three months thereafter, once osteointegration&#xD;
      was obtained, definitive zirconia restoration was positioned and cemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eventual deficiencies of the prosthetic rehabilitation at the time of provisional restoration&#xD;
      (contact points, esthetics) were noticed and fixed directly adding composite. In all these&#xD;
      cases, a new impression after soft tissue maturation was performed and strategically, a new&#xD;
      crown in PMMA was designed and realized. Final check before producing the zirconia element&#xD;
      was performed positioning the crown on the abutment.&#xD;
