  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the majority of the French population is covered by social security, the effects of&#xD;
      social inequalities on health are still very visible and are even increasing in France and in&#xD;
      Europe. Thus, according to INSEE, excess mortality is observed among the most disadvantaged&#xD;
      populations. Similarly, the prevalence of certain chronic diseases in France and Europe,&#xD;
      particularly cardiovascular diseases, is linked to social inequalities and excess morbidity&#xD;
      can be observed in the most disadvantaged populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to social inequalities, which refer to disparities in health levels according to&#xD;
      social category, there are the effects of territorial inequalities. In France, there are&#xD;
      geographical areas of excess mortality, which essentially correspond to areas far from urban&#xD;
      centers. Similarly, there are major geographical differences in terms of medical supply and&#xD;
      equipment, and the distance between patients and health centers is a direct obstacle to the&#xD;
      use of the health care network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying explanations for social inequalities in health are multiple. While it is&#xD;
      likely that difficulties in accessing and using care play a role, it is also possible that&#xD;
      they are due to differences in exposure to certain environmental (e.g. pollution) or&#xD;
      individual (e.g. smoking) risk factors. But it is also possible that the causal relationship&#xD;
      is the opposite and that diseases create or reveal social inequalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For multiple sclerosis (MS) the impact of social and territorial inequalities is more&#xD;
      debated. Indeed, with regard to the relationship between disease prevalence and social&#xD;
      inequalities, a recent literature review found 21 separate studies on the subject, of which&#xD;
      13 failed to show a link between socioeconomic status and MS risk, 5 concluded that there was&#xD;
      an increased risk of MS in advantaged populations and 3 concluded that there was an increased&#xD;
      risk of MS in disadvantaged populations. There are plausible pathophysiological explanations&#xD;
      for either direction of the relationship, but the question remains open.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, the link between MS prognosis and social inequalities has been little&#xD;
      studied, as disadvantaged populations are more often exposed to the poor prognostic factor of&#xD;
      smoking [6-8], the hypothesis of a negative prognostic role of social inequalities remains&#xD;
      plausible. Similarly, the current consensus is that the diagnosis and treatment of MS should&#xD;
      be as early as possible [9,10] in order to preserve brain capital. Easy access to a&#xD;
      neurologist and MRI are therefore potentially prognostic factors for MS in relation to&#xD;
      territorial inequalities. It should be noted that the link between social and geographical&#xD;
      inequalities and a potential delay in treatment has not been demonstrated in France in the&#xD;
      case of cancer, but it is possible that the importance of the means implemented in the fight&#xD;
      against cancer erases these effects. In MS, a study showed a link between delay in starting a&#xD;
      second disease-modifying therapy and socio-economic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the causal link between MS and socio-professional status has not yet been demonstrated,&#xD;
      the socio-economic impact of MS has been measured. In particular, it has been shown that&#xD;
      having MS is associated with an increased risk of unemployment and/or early retirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of our study is to determine whether delay in treatment, as a marker of&#xD;
      difficulties in access to care in MS, is associated with social and territorial inequalities&#xD;
      in MS. Secondary objectives will be to explore the link between MS prognosis and social and&#xD;
      territorial inequalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to sunlight is a known protective factor and is consistent with the&#xD;
      north-east-south-west gradient observed in France. The choice of centers associated with the&#xD;
      research, spread over the French territory, will make it possible to monitor and measure this&#xD;
      effect in the prognosis of MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the available treatments have evolved considerably over the last ten years, and in order&#xD;
      to avoid a period effect, the patients recruited in the study will have to have a date of&#xD;
      onset of the disease after 1 January 2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective Determining the relationship between socio-economic inequalities and the&#xD;
      time to start disease-modifying therapy in MS Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the relationship between geographical inequalities and delay in starting&#xD;
           disease-modifying therapy in MS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the relationship between socio-economic inequalities and time to walking&#xD;
           disability (EDSS 4)&#xD;
