    <textblock>
      Self- and peer-assessment is one of the important methods among student-centered assessment&#xD;
      methods. The ability of the student to evaluate himself and his peers provides many&#xD;
      contributions to him in his education and professional life.Nursing education aims to gain&#xD;
      many psychomotor skills.Aim is to examine the effects of self and peer assessment training on&#xD;
      the success of stoma care skills.&#xD;

      There are different results regarding the effects of self-assessment and peer assessment on&#xD;
      psychomotor skill achievement. It is thought that the reason for this difference in results&#xD;
      may be student-related reasons or may be related to the effectiveness of the education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to measure the stoma care skill success of the students who are given self and&#xD;
      peer assessment training through the rating scale.&#xD;

    <measure>The self and peer assessment scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,:6 months Change from self and peer assessment scale score at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The self and peer assessment scale consists of 13 items. The scale measures the learner's tendency to self and peer assessment.A minimum score of 13 and a maximum of 65 points can be obtained from the scale. In the scale applied before and after the self and peer assessment training, the increase in the scale score of the student after the training compared to the pre-training indicates that the learner develops a positive attitude towards self and peer assessment, while the decrease in the score indicates that he develops a negative attitude. shows</description>
