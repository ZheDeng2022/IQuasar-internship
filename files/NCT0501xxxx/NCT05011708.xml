  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the difference in tear film stability and&#xD;
      symptomatic relief between I-DROP MGD and another commercially available drop in the Canadian&#xD;
      market.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare tear film measurements for two hours after putting one drop of I-DROP MGD eye&#xD;
           drops into one eye and one drop of Thealoz Duo eye drops in the other eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the relief of dry eye symptoms with I-DROP MGD eye drops after 7 days of&#xD;
           use.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection or&#xD;
                  inflammation which requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered&#xD;
                  clinically relevant) lid abnormalities (blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction,&#xD;
                  papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining are not considered active ocular&#xD;
                  disease. Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result of previous hypoxia,&#xD;
                  infection or inflammation and are therefore not active.&#xD;
