  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The competitive swimming and open water swimming events are scheduled for the 2024 Paris&#xD;
      Olympic and Paralympian Games. Generally associated with a non-neglectable number of medals&#xD;
      in the last Olympics, swimming performance depends on the swimmer's ability to manage his or&#xD;
      her Stroke Length and Stroke Rate, where Velocity can be defined as the product of SR and SL.&#xD;
      The optimisation of this management depends on the swimmer's ability to develop a large motor&#xD;
      repertoire and to use the coordination mode (catch-up, opposition, superposition) best suited&#xD;
      to the environmental constraints and opponents' adversity. These adaptations may contribute&#xD;
      to 1) a modification of the energy expenditure or be dependent on the energy supply necessary&#xD;
      for muscular contraction and 2) the preferential use of one or other of the metabolic&#xD;
      pathways in the production of this chemical energy, moreover in an aquatic environment&#xD;
      inducing particular thermal exchanges.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To swim fast, one need to be able to create great propelling forces in addition to minimizing&#xD;
      resistance. Propulsion emerged from the appropriate spatial-temporal coordination of the four&#xD;
      limbs. The purpose of this study is to determine the motor repertoire (coordination&#xD;
      possibilities) of each swimmer and para-swimmer in order to monitor their swimming economy,&#xD;
      as a function of their energy expenditure. Crawl coordination has been studied extensively,&#xD;
      and recent technologies such as inertial units and machine learning methods may be combined&#xD;
      to characterize it automatically. There is a strong need to extend this knowledge to the&#xD;
      other three swimming strokes and adapt it to para-swimmers' disabilities to clearly measure&#xD;
      the impacts of SR and V manipulations on swimming economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swimming is performed in a complex aquatic environment serving both as a support for&#xD;
      propulsion and as a resistance to progress forward. Therefore, to properly behave through&#xD;
      water, swimmers coordinate their limbs to increase their velocity (V). Cyclic activities&#xD;
      performance, such as swimming, corresponds to the reaching of high speed, defined by the&#xD;
      product of stroke length (SL, in m.cycle-1) and stroke frequency (SR, cycles.min-1). Many&#xD;
      authors have therefore focused on the behaviors of elite swimmers and they observed a change&#xD;
      in arm coordination when values of 1.8 m.s-1 in V and/or 50 cycles.min-1 in SR were reached.&#xD;
      Such results are related to the high degree of flexibility in the swimmer's motor behavior ,&#xD;
      that should not imply an additional energy expenditure that may become detrimental to&#xD;
      performance. Studies showed that changes in V and/or SR would influence the value of the&#xD;
      energy cost of swimming. These studies, mainly performed in front crawl would be of valuable&#xD;
      interest to develop for all other strokes (i.e. breaststroke, butterfly and backstroke) and&#xD;
      for multiple group of participants (i.e. para-swimmers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two intermittent swimming tests of progressive velocity will be performed in the swimmers'&#xD;
      and para-swimmers' specialty with or without prescription of the SR. Coordination and&#xD;
      physiological variables will be collected to investigate if changes in motor behaviors are&#xD;
      linked to changes in energy expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in two main centers, with a duration of the inclusion period&#xD;
      equals to 3 years. Moreover, the duration of participation of each participant is also fixed&#xD;
      to 3 years . One of the objectives is obtaining a landscape of possible motor behaviors for&#xD;
      each participant according to the manipulation of swimming frequency and speed. This&#xD;
      'landscape' will show whether, for all participants, the behavioral adaptations are efficient&#xD;
      (in reference to their energy expenditure).&#xD;

    <description>This is a study based on a comparative clinical trial (effect of an imposed V and/or SR on the swimming economy of swimmers or para-swimmers). This longitudinal study is carried out on a representative sample of swimmers and para-swimmers selected for their potential at the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympian Games. Following a standardized warm-up, all swimmers will perform intermittent swimming tests of progressive velocity in a 50 m indoor pool in their swimming specialty with or without an imposition of the SR to adopt. During the trials, the swimmers and para-swimmers will be equipped with inertial measurement units, as well as a heart rate monitor and tissue oximeters. The swimming and non-swimming phases will also be filmed continuously. Gas exchanges will be recorded 2 minutes after the warm-up and during the 7 minutes of passive recovery. Micro blood samples will be taken from the earlobe at the end of the warm-up and at 1, 3, 5 and 7 minutes of recovery between each trial.</description>
