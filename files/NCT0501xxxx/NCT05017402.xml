  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to investigate that whether the higher dose ERT improve safety and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes of Pompe disease patients. Also, wish to develop a new therapeutic&#xD;
      recommendation and hope that it could improve the long-term outcomes of Pompe diesease&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
