  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol misuse and related risky sexual behaviors are a significant public health concern&#xD;
      among college students. Two-thirds of students are current drinkers, at least 1 in 3 report&#xD;
      past month binge drinking (5+ drinks in a row), and 1 in 10 report high intensity drinking&#xD;
      (10+ drinks in a row). Greater student alcohol consumption and heavy drinking on a given day&#xD;
      is linked to increased sexual activity and RSB (e.g., unprotected sex, sex with casual&#xD;
      partners). This puts students at risk for negative health outcomes (e.g., STIs) and is a&#xD;
      pathway to sexual victimization and escalated drinking. The first few weeks of college, or&#xD;
      the 'red zone,' present a critical window of opportunity to intervene for escalated alcohol&#xD;
      use and associated risks, which can result in a potentially high public health and clinical&#xD;
      impact. However, individual-level prevention strategies for college students tend to focus on&#xD;
      students' alcohol use patterns and consequences more broadly, with little to no integration&#xD;
      of content on the relationship between alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors, an important&#xD;
      gap in the literature and a priority area for NIAAA. Our team previously established&#xD;
      short-term efficacy of a personalized feedback intervention (PFI), a gold standard&#xD;
      intervention approach, with integrated content on alcohol and risky sexual behaviors. We&#xD;
      propose a cross-tailored dynamic feedback (CDF) intervention as an extension of the&#xD;
      integrated PFI, which leverages technology to incorporate daily assessments of student&#xD;
      behavior and provide them with dynamic weekly feedback to amplify the integrated PFI effects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project utilizes a multisite, hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation study design to&#xD;
      (1) evaluate the impact of CDF for at-risk first-year college students and (2) identify&#xD;
      implementation factors critical to its success to facilitate future scale-up in campus&#xD;
      settings. The first aim is to conduct a multi-level stakeholder-engaged adaptation of the&#xD;
      integrated alcohol and risky sex PFI through the development and inclusion of CDF. The second&#xD;
      aim is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the enhanced intervention (PFI+CDF)&#xD;
      in a sample of 600 first-year college students who report recent binge drinking and are&#xD;
      sexually active. Our primary hypothesis is that participants who receive the PFI+CDF&#xD;
      intervention will report less alcohol use, fewer risky sexual behaviors, and fewer&#xD;
      consequences relative to those who receive a PFI supplemented with generic health information&#xD;
      at follow-up (1, 2, 3, 6, and 13 months). Participants (N=600 total, 300 per site) will be&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 4 groups: (1) PFI+CDF with weekend diary surveys, (2) PFI+GHI with weekend&#xD;
      diary surveys, (3) PFI-only, no weekend diary surveys, and (4) assessment-only control, no&#xD;
      weekend diary surveys. All participants will complete a baseline survey during the first week&#xD;
      of the semester, be randomly assigned to condition, and complete follow-up surveys at 1, 2,&#xD;
      3, 6, and 13 months. This staggered design allows for comparison of the enhanced PFI+CDF&#xD;
      relative to the PFI+GHI condition, which may be consistent with a &quot;treatment-as-usual&quot;&#xD;
      comparison group (e.g., of the universities that have adopted an evidence-guided alcohol&#xD;
      intervention program for their campus, many currently deliver commercialized alcohol-focused&#xD;
      PFIs to incoming first-year students). Providing weekly GHI in the comparison condition&#xD;
      allows for an equal number of &quot;exposures&quot; between the more intensive conditions (PFI+CDF vs.&#xD;
      PFI+GHI), analogous to an attention control group, offering a clearer understanding of the&#xD;
      overall impact of the PFI+CDF adaptation. The inclusion of two PFI conditions, one with&#xD;
      weekend diary assessments and one without allows us to control for potential assessment&#xD;
      reactivity that might result from the diary-style assessment approach. Overall, this design&#xD;
      is intended to allow a separation of the &quot;true&quot; intervention effect of the CDF above and&#xD;
      beyond the effect of assessment reactivity. The PFI-only vs. assessment-only control group&#xD;
      comparison will provide a test of basic efficacy of the integrated PFI that has been adapted&#xD;
      based on stakeholder feedback. Our third aim seeks to identify factors critical to PFI+CDF&#xD;
      implementation in campus settings through conducting focus groups with a subset of students&#xD;
      from the RCT and with local and national systems-level stakeholders. The intervention has&#xD;
      strong potential for widespread dissemination and targets a group at high risk for alcohol&#xD;
      misuse and RSB.&#xD;
