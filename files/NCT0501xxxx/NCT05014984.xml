  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40% of Veterans have obesity and are at increased risk for cardiometabolic&#xD;
      disease. Intensive lifestyle-based weight management programs can lead to clinically&#xD;
      significant ( 5%) weight loss. The VA's MOVE! program is effective for promoting weight loss&#xD;
      and behavior change for those who attend. Unfortunately, MOVE! has low enrollment and high&#xD;
      attrition due to several obstacles including low motivation. Mental Contrasting with&#xD;
      Implementation Intentions (MCII) is an innovative strategy developed over 20 years of&#xD;
      research that uses imagery to increase motivation for behavior change. MCII can be&#xD;
      implemented in primary care settings using an easy to teach technique called &quot;WOOP&quot; (Wish,&#xD;
      Outcome, Obstacle, Plan) that Veterans then use regularly on their own with the help of&#xD;
      paper-based tools or the WOOP app. The research team will evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      implementation of MCII when combined with telephone-delivered MOVE! vs. telephone-delivered&#xD;
      MOVE! alone to enhance weight management outcomes for Veterans in primary care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Approximately 40% of Veterans have obesity. Intensive weight management programs&#xD;
      such as MOVE! promote clinically significant weight loss, but only 3-7% of eligible Veterans&#xD;
      attend. Low enrollment and high attrition are due to obstacles such as travel, cost, and&#xD;
      motivation. Developed through over 20 years of research, Mental Contrasting with&#xD;
      Implementation Intentions (MCII) is a novel, evidence-based intervention to increase&#xD;
      motivation and behavior change. MCII has been shown to increase physical activity and&#xD;
      consumption of fruits and vegetables and promote weight loss, and the research team recently&#xD;
      demonstrated that MCII is feasible and acceptable to Veterans for weight management. However,&#xD;
      has not been tested adequately within primary care nor demonstrated weight loss in Veterans.&#xD;
      The investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy and implementation of MCII for behavior&#xD;
      change and weight loss in Veterans within primary care when combined with the VA MOVE!&#xD;
      Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance/Impact: This proposal aligns with the VA HSRD &quot;primary care practice and&#xD;
      management of complex chronic diseases&quot; funding priority. Primary care providers and PACT&#xD;
      members do not provide sufficient counseling to increase engagement with the MOVE! Program.&#xD;
      MCII can be taught by lay educators and can be delivered in conjunction with MOVE! and other&#xD;
      weight management treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: MCII is innovative in its use of imagery, ease of delivery by lay educators,&#xD;
      novel mechanisms of action (via non-conscious motivational and cognitive processes), and&#xD;
      ability to be combined with other programs. Veterans can practice MCII on their own in under&#xD;
      10 minutes. MCII uses a standardized, 4-step imagery procedure called WOOP that can be taught&#xD;
      in 30 minutes. Veterans can then continue to use WOOP regularly, with the assistance of a&#xD;
      WOOP App and website containing video-, audio-, and paper-based tools. This study will be the&#xD;
      first randomized controlled trial of MCII within primary care and the first RCT to test the&#xD;
      efficacy and implementation of MCII for weight management when combined with MOVE! in&#xD;
      Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: 1. Compare the impact of MCII + MOVE! vs. MOVE! alone on percent weight change&#xD;
      and waist circumference at 6 and 12 months. 2. Compare the impact of MCII + MOVE! vs. MOVE!&#xD;
      alone on MOVE! attendance, physical activity, and healthy eating at 6 and 12 months. 3.&#xD;
      Evaluate implementation of MCII. The investigators will use the Reach, Effectiveness,&#xD;
      Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework7,8 to evaluate implementation&#xD;
      barriers, facilitators, and outcomes of MCII.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The investigators will randomize 366 Veterans within primary care to either MCII&#xD;
      + telephone-delivered MOVE! (intervention) vs. telephone-delivered MOVE! alone (control) at&#xD;
      the Manhattan VA. At 6 and 12 months, participants will return to the clinic for a study&#xD;
      visit where weight, diet, and physical activity will be assessed in both groups. The&#xD;
      investigators will use intention-to-treat analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation/Next Steps: MCII is designed to be easily implemented in a variety of settings&#xD;
      and for a variety of behaviors. Freely available online training materials will facilitate&#xD;
      implementation. To guide future implementation and policy change, the research team will&#xD;
      present data from Aim 3 implementation analyses and obtain input from Veteran stakeholders as&#xD;
      well as local VA and NCP leaders. If found to be efficacious, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      hybrid effectiveness/implementation studies of MCII in a multi-site study.&#xD;

    <description>The HEI-2015 is a diet quality index that measures alignment with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. To measure dietary intake at each time point, we will use an automated, cost-effective and valid 24-hour dietary recall instrument for measuring diet quality. The web-based Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Recall (ASA24-2020), developed by the National Cancer Institute and first released in 2009 was modeled after the US Department of Agriculture's interviewer- administered Automated Multiple-Pass Method (AMPM). To limit participant burden, participants will perform one weekday measurement (self-administered in person with staff available to answer questions as needed) and one weekend measurement (self-administered at home). While at least three 24-hour recall measurements are considered the gold standard, two measurements are valid. If we cannot obtain a weekend measure, we will obtain two weekday measures and account for this in the analysis.</description>

During an initial enrollment visit, RAs will place the Link monitor on the participant's non-dominant wrist and instruct the participant to measure PA for 24 hours a day for 7 days, except when swimming and bathing, and to return the monitor at the baseline visit two weeks later. We will use accelerometer data to report weekly minutes of MVPA.</description>

    <description>During the baseline visit, Veterans randomized to the control arm will receive only the standard information about MOVE!, diet, and physical activity delivered by the same lay educators. They will not learn the WOOP technique nor receive telephone follow up as detailed below. While we considered having an attention control with the same amount of contact, we decided that the study would be more pragmatic and findings would be more relevant to real-world practice if the control arm followed standard patient education and referral strategies. Data collection during study visits will be at the same timepoints in both arms.</description>

    <description>To deliver MCII, Dr. Oettingen developed a step-wise procedure called WOOP (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan; Figure 1).36 In a quiet setting, patients identify an important wish (e.g., losing weight) and then name and vividly imagine the best outcome (e.g., feeling healthier). Next, they name a current internal obstacle (e.g., urge to eat when feeling stressed) and try to vividly imagine their experience when they encounter this obstacle. Finally, they address their obstacle with an if-then plan specifying when, where, and how to overcome it (e.g., &quot;If I have the urge to eat when feeling stressed, I will go for a walk)&quot; and then imagine themselves experiencing the obstacle and carrying out the action of surmounting it. To facilitate use of the WOOP technique, Dr. Oettingen developed a free, publicly available WOOP app</description>

    <description>MOVE! is a national VA weight management and health promotion program to improve the quality of life of Veterans.6,75 This effective program encourages healthy eating behavior and increased physical activity. MOVE! will be delivered via telephone (16 sessions) by existing staff consistent with national MOVE! program guidelines. The program has 16 modules and will offered weekly, but Veterans will be able to make up sessions at their own pace if they miss one. MOVE! staff use the MOVE! facilitator guide that provides instruction on delivering the program via telephone.</description>
