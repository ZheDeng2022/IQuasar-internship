  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Awareness during general anesthesia - that has an incidence between 0.1% and 0.9% of cases&#xD;
      and may be more in elderly - remains a concern for anesthesiologists. Awareness experiences&#xD;
      range from isolated auditory perceptions to reports of a patient being fully awake,&#xD;
      immobilized, and in pain. The isolated forearm technique allows assessment of consciousness&#xD;
      of the external world (connected consciousness) through a verbal command to move the hand (of&#xD;
      a tourniquet-isolated arm) during intended general anesthesia.&#xD;

      Objective: To compare inhalational induction versus intravenous induction regarding awareness&#xD;
      during laryngoscopy and intubation in elderly patients undergoing day case elective surgery.&#xD;

    <description>In group A:&#xD;
The researcher, who supervised the anesthesia, explained the concept of the study to all patients before induction, and then a tourniquet was placed around the dominant arm of the patients after placing a cotton bandage; to be inflated to 200mmHg or 40 mmHg above the systolic blood pressure of the patient; immediately before administration of the muscle relaxant later on.&#xD;
Patients received inhalation induction using sevoflurane 8% and fentanyl 2 µg/kg was administered intravenously. After loss of consciousness, and BIS value of 50 or less, the tourniquet cuff was inflated then atracurium 0.5 mg/kg was given intravenously and sevoflurane reduced to 2%, then laryngoscopy and intubation were done when action of neuromuscular blocker (NMB) was confirmed by the disappearance of T3,T4. During this time, mask assisted ventilation with 100% oxygen was used to achieve normocapnia</description>

In group B: propofol 1.5 mg/kg and fentanyl 2 µg/kg were administered intravenously. After loss of consciousness, and BIS value of 50 or less, the tourniquet cuff was inflated and then atracurium 0.5 mg/kg was given intravenously. Propofol infusion 6 mg/kg/hr was started, until action of neuromuscular blocker (NMB) was confirmed by disappearance of T3,T4, then laryngoscopy and intubation were done. The used dosing regimen is according to previous guidelines [8] [9].No inhalational agent was used. Mask assisted ventilation was used to achieve normocapnia.</description>
