  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls among older adults are a serious public health concern and injuries resulting from&#xD;
      falls can cause significant loss of independence, premature death, and higher caregiver&#xD;
      burden. Home-based fall prevention programs, such as the Otago Exercise Program, educate&#xD;
      older adults about the importance of identifying fall risk and provide strategies for&#xD;
      reducing fall risk; however, many are costly and are not scalable, accessible, or&#xD;
      sustainable. This project will evaluate the use of a digital solution that translates&#xD;
      evidence-based fall prevention programs (such as Otago Exercise Program and Matter of&#xD;
      Balance) to a digital solution (Health in Motion Fall Prevention Platform), as an alternative&#xD;
      to home-based fall prevention programs that is affordable, scales to the millions of older&#xD;
      adults across the country at risk for falls and is sustainable for the older adult's life.&#xD;

      This study will involve 2 groups. Both groups will be followed for 12 months. The&#xD;
      investigators will use a comparative prospective longitudinal (12-months) observational&#xD;
      cohort study to compare the Health in Motion Fall Prevention Program with a no-intervention&#xD;
      group. Metrics of effectiveness include the rate of falls, fall risk, fear of falling, and&#xD;
      falls efficacy. Economic benefit will be measured using the EQ-5D-5L, along with hospital and&#xD;
      clinical visits. The primary outcome is the incidence of falls (rate in person-months).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The System Usability Scale is used to evaluate usability and learnability of software products. We will use information from this survey to improve the usability of Health in Motion. The test uses a 0-5 Likert scale. The statements are worded such that the best score alternates between 1 (Strongly Disagree) and 5 (Strongly Agree). For example, statement #1 is &quot;I think that I would like to use this system frequently&quot; whereas statement #2 is &quot;I found this system unnecessarily complex&quot;. The participant's scores for each question are converted to a new number, added together, and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores of 0-40 to 0-100. Though the scores are 0-100, these are not percentages and should be considered only in terms of their percentile ranking.&#xD;
SUS scores above 68 are considered above average and anything below 68 is below average.</description>
