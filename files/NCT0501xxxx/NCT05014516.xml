      In this study the Investigators aim to deploy UTE and HP 129Xe MRI for structural and&#xD;
      functional evaluation of persistent lung abnormalities in COVID-19 survivors.&#xD;

      What is COVID-19? The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused when an&#xD;
      individual is infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This infection can result in pneumonia&#xD;
      involving the small airways and alveoli (the tiny air sacs at the end of the airways that&#xD;
      help oxygen get into the blood). COVID-19 can cause damage to the lungs, making it hard to&#xD;
      breathe without medical help. To understand what is happening to a patient's lungs, doctors&#xD;
      may use imaging tests such as chest x-rays or CT Scans (computed tomography). However, these&#xD;
      types of tests may not tell the Investigators the whole story.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the purpose of the study? Led by The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), this&#xD;
      study is being done to determine if MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans can tell the&#xD;
      Investigators more about the lungs of people who had COVID-19. The Investigators will use a&#xD;
      special type of MRI where participants breathe in a special gas (hyperpolarized xenon-129)&#xD;
      before they have the MRI. This gas will help the Investigators to see' the lungs. The&#xD;
      advantage of MRI scans is that there is no radiation involved in these types of images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is involved? In this study, participants will have an MRI of their lungs. The&#xD;
      Investigators will examine these MRI scans to see if the Investigators can identify any&#xD;
      changes in the structure or the function of the lung. If the Investigators do find any&#xD;
      changes, they will see how these changes relate to other tests that have been conducted or&#xD;
      other parts of the clinical story.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be asked to come to SickKids for 3 study visits. A fourth visit will be&#xD;
      conducted via telephone. These visits will span over 3 years. Each study visit will take&#xD;
      about 4 hours. If the participant is unable to attend one of the in-person visits, they will&#xD;
      be given the option for a phone/virtual visit instead.&#xD;
