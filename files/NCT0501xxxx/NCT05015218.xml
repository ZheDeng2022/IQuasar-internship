  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess internal jugular vein ultrasound derived measurements and indices&#xD;
      prior to spinal anesthesia in elderly population who fulfills predetermined inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and might greatly benefit from an appropriate hemodynamic control during orthopedic&#xD;
      surgery. Therefore, it is evaluated the diagnostic performance of these indices in predicting&#xD;
      spinal-induced hypotension in this subset of participants.&#xD;

      1. Study design. The present, observational, prospective study, will be conducted over a&#xD;
           12-month period,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Population. Consecutive sampling is used to recruit aging patients (&gt;70 years), who&#xD;
           sustain trauma of the lower limb and underwent an orthopedic surgical procedure under&#xD;
           spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           More specifically, patients included, are subjected to an orthopaedic surgical repair of&#xD;
           a proximal femur fracture under spinal anaesthesia. Patients' medical history, physical&#xD;
           examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and X-ray assessment are performed during the&#xD;
           pre-operative assessment, supplemented by specific exams or tests (e.g. TTE, troponin or&#xD;
           pro-BNP levels) as per the consultant cardiologists' recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients in our study are American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology&#xD;
           (AHA/ACC) stage I OR II, and their cardiac disease status is compensated. As per&#xD;
           departmental protocol and fasting guidelines, all patients could receive clear liquids&#xD;
           and solid food until 2 and 8 hours before surgery, respectively. Creatinine and urea&#xD;
           values and subsequently GFR are measured in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria included severe pulmonary hypertension, tachycardia (heart rate &gt; 100&#xD;
           beats/min), atrial fibrillation with heart rate&gt; 100 beats/min and severe valvular&#xD;
           diseases. Additionally, all patients who had spinal anaesthesia and the maximum cephalad&#xD;
           dermatomal extension of the sensory block was below T12 were excluded from the study.&#xD;
           Arterial hypotension related to overt intra-operative bleeding (&gt;150 cc) or patients&#xD;
           requiring blood transfusion, for any reason, were not considered in the statistical&#xD;
           analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Duplex carotid ultrasound protocol and measurements. Ultrasonographic measurements is&#xD;
           performed by an anaesthesiologist with prior training, supervised by physician component&#xD;
           and certified to cardiovascular imaging techniques. After the patients is placed in the&#xD;
           supine position, using GE-T8 Ultrasound System device, the carotid artery is visualized&#xD;
           on the short axis with a 5-10 MHz linear probe in B-mode. Subsequently, the probe notch&#xD;
           was rotated 90° to the head of the patient, and the carotid artery image is obtained in&#xD;
           long axis orientation. The diameter of the right CA (RCA) is found by measuring between&#xD;
           the intima layers of both vessel walls approximately 2-3 cm proximal to the carotid&#xD;
           bulb. Then, pulse-wave Doppler imaging is performed again on the same image, the Doppler&#xD;
           angle is adjusted to 50-60°, and the flow through the carotid artery of the patient is&#xD;
           displayed as a Doppler spectrum. CA blood flow peak velocity (V peak), systolic VTI,&#xD;
           flow time (FT), carotid corrected (ccFT), were measured prior to spinal anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ccFT values are calculated using Wodey's formula, ccFT= FT+1.29(HR-60), which has been&#xD;
           shown to better correct for fast heart rates in comparison to widely used Bazett's&#xD;
           formula. FT is measured from the beginning of the systolic upstroke to the dicrotic&#xD;
           notch. Patients with plaque thickness equal or greater than 2.5 mm in the examined&#xD;
           common carotid artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To visualize both IJVs a linear transducer with a 5-10 MHz linear probe is placed over&#xD;
           the neck, and the IJV is measured just below the bifurcation of the sternal and&#xD;
           clavicular heads of the muscle. The IJV measurements are performed on the transverse&#xD;
           axis over a single respiratory cycle. Patients with evidence of IJV thrombosis are&#xD;
           excluded. IJVs measurements included the antero-posterior maximum diameter at the end of&#xD;
           expiration (IJVmax), the antero-posterior mimimum diameter at the end of inspiration&#xD;
           (IJVmin), the IJV collapsibility index (IJV-CI) during spontaneous, quiet, breathing,&#xD;
           [(IJVmax -diameter)/IJVmax] and the ratio (R) of IJVmax-to-IJV-CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two examiners each performed all the measurements two times, generating four values; the&#xD;
           mean of these values was used for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Anesthetic protocol and measurements. Spinal anesthesia is introduced with a single&#xD;
           intrathecal injection of 0.75% (15 mg) plain ropivacaine using a 22 or 25-gauge needle&#xD;
           with the patient in the lateral or sitting position. Intraoperative ECG, SPO2 and&#xD;
           non-invasive blood pressure (measurements every two minutes) monitoring are routinely&#xD;
           used. Patients who experienced a MAP less than or equal to 65 mmHg, or greater than or&#xD;
           equal to 25% reduction of its baseline preoperative value is considered hypotensive&#xD;
           (duration greater than or equal to 2 min time-period: from spinal anesthesia induction&#xD;
           to the end of surgery). Arterial hypotension related to bone cement application,&#xD;
           tourniquet deflation, overt intraoperative/postoperative bleeding (blood loss&gt;150cc) or&#xD;
           patients having received blood transfusion for any reason were not considered in our&#xD;
           statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of sensory block (cold test) is assessed by an anesthesia nurse not further&#xD;
      involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Previously, many echocardiographic indices have been used to predict&#xD;
      spinal-induced hypotension. The collapsibility index of the inferior vena cava has showed an&#xD;
      area under the curve in a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis between 0.77. We&#xD;
      hypothesized, therefore, that the area under the curve of the right or the left IJV-CI would&#xD;
      be at least 0.77 to predict spinal induced hypotension. We calculated the required sample&#xD;
      size for the comparison of the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve with a&#xD;
      null hypothesis value. Considering the α error of 0.05 with 80% power, 32 patients are&#xD;
      needed. To allow for a possible 20% dropout rate, we use a sample size of 38 patients.&#xD;
