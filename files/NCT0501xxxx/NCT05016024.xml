    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of Colilen IBS, a Medical Device&#xD;
      made of natural substances, even when taken in addition to other therapies, for the treatment&#xD;
      of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Post Market, randomized, double blind, cross-over clinical evaluation that will be&#xD;
      conducted in 66 patients with diagnosis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome according to Rome IV&#xD;
      criteria. As this is a cross-over clinical investigation, each eligible patient will take&#xD;
      both the products under investigation, Colilen IBS and its Placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 2-week run-in period, at Baseline visit each patient included in the study will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the two treatment sequences (i.e., Sequence AB and Sequence BA),&#xD;
      for a 16-week total sequential treatment period (8 weeks for each of the 2 treatment periods)&#xD;
      first with verum Colilen IBS and then with its Placebo, or vice versa. A wash out period (3&#xD;
      weeks) is forecast between the two treatment periods.&#xD;
