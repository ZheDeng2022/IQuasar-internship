      Background The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on medical services&#xD;
      is overwhelming due to limited medical resources. During its initial surge in 2020, Taiwan's&#xD;
      government rapidly established diverse public actions, which helped maintain the medical&#xD;
      supply without travel restrictions. However, whether the fear of being infected with COVID-19&#xD;
      interfered with health-seeking behavior (HSB) remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to&#xD;
      elucidate whether acute complicated appendicitis (ACA) rates in adults were affected by the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A retrospective analysis of acute appendicitis in adults was performed between&#xD;
      January 1 and June 30, 2020 (COVID-19 period). The control period was collected from the&#xD;
      first two quarters for the preceding 3 years. Outcome measures were ACA and length of&#xD;
      hospital stays.&#xD;
