  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between serum rT3 (serum reverse&#xD;
      triiodothyronine) concentrations, T3/T4 (triiodothyronine/thyroxine) ratio, and persistent&#xD;
      symptoms /quality of life in treated hypothyroid patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are going to measure TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone), free-T3, free-T4,&#xD;
      reverse-T3 levels, biochemical markers of hypothyroidism and quality of life (assessed by&#xD;
      validated questionnaires).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: L-thyroxin (T4) substitution is the mainstay of treatment for hypothyroidism&#xD;
      irrespective of disease origin. In a subset of patients with hypothyroidism however an&#xD;
      inadequate peripheral T4-&gt;T3 conversion is hypostasized by some authors. This is speculated&#xD;
      to lead to tissue level hypothyroidism and persistent symptoms even with adequate T4&#xD;
      replacement. As a potential pathogenetic mechanism, the inborn or acquired defect of&#xD;
      peripheral deiodinases, decreased T3 and increased rT3 production is suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few results support this hypothesis. A decreased T3/T4 ratio has been reported in some&#xD;
      post-surgical hypothyroid patients, while a few studies patient show increased patient&#xD;
      satisfaction with combined T4+T3 substitution. However these differences have not been shown&#xD;
      to be significant in large meta-analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the lack of convincing evidence current guidelines advocate against both routine rT3&#xD;
      measurement and T3 substitution. However in recent years, rT3 measurement and T3&#xD;
      supplementation has been steadily gaining popularity amongst some medical and functional&#xD;
      medicine practitioners. Recent publications estimate order volume for rT3 tests in the US to&#xD;
      be over 1 million per year. Thus, despite several decades of experience and multiple trials,&#xD;
      the role of liothyronine (T3) substitution remains somewhat controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between rT3 levels, T3/T4 ratio, quality of life and persistent symptoms of&#xD;
      hypothyroidism in patients treated with adequate thyroxine doses has not been previously&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant association of this nature would suggest the possibility of decreased&#xD;
      peripheral T4-&gt;T3 conversion in some patients leading to worse treatment outcomes. A lack of&#xD;
      relationship would further discredit the above detailed theories and could potentially help&#xD;
      reduce the inadequate use of T3 substitution in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients treated for hypothyroidism with no significant comorbidities are&#xD;
      to be enrolled. Sample size calculations show adequate statistical power with over 150&#xD;
      participants. Based on the number of hypothyroid patients at our outpatient clinic, a sample&#xD;
      size of 300-350 patients can reasonably be expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of activities: All study related procedures are performed during a single visit.&#xD;
      These include recording of basic anthropometric data, a single draw of blood, and&#xD;
      administration of psychological questionnaires. Laboratory tests include comprehensive&#xD;
      thyroid function testing (TSH, T3, FT3, FT4, aTPO [anti-thyroperoxidase antibody]) with the&#xD;
      addition of rT3 measurement. Less specific markers, associated with hypothyroidism are also&#xD;
      assessed. These include serum cholesterol, CK (creatin-kinase), GOT/ASAT&#xD;
      (aspartate-aminotransferase), GPT/ALAT (alanine-aminotransferase), creatinine and sodium&#xD;
      levels. Psychological tests administered at the visit include ThyDQol, ThySRQ and the&#xD;
      Somatosensory Amplification Scale (SASS) adding up to ~50 items including demographic&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Statistical methods for this study possibly include correlation&#xD;
      analysis, linear and logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and endpoints: Current understanding of hypothyroidism and thyroid hormone&#xD;
      replacement imply that treatment with thyroxine doses that are sufficient to the normalize&#xD;
      TSH lead to adequate tissue T3 levels and euthyroid state in the whole body. An association&#xD;
      however between quality of life and rT3, levels or T3/T4 ratio could point out patients that&#xD;
      could potentially benefit from additional T3 replacement.&#xD;
