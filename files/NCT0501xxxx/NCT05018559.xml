  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the health-promoting effects of physical activity are well known and apprentices&#xD;
      often possess an insufficient amount of physical activity, there is a lack of interventions&#xD;
      promoting physical activity in vocational education and training. Against this background,&#xD;
      the PArC-AVE project uses a co-creation approach to develop and implement physical&#xD;
      activity-promoting interventions tailored to the needs of the target group and the given&#xD;
      setting in two vocational education and training institutions. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the effectiveness of the co-created interventions in vocational education and&#xD;
      training, namely the BuG lesson in nursing care and the tutoring system in automotive&#xD;
      mechatronics. Therefore, the investigators conducted two non-randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      from October 2018 to September 2019.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in self-reported physical activity: BSA questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical Activity, Exercise, and Sport Questionnaire (Bewegungs- und Sportaktivität Fragebogen; BSA-F) is a German questionnaire that assesses the amount of physical activity during the last four weeks. It differentiates between leisure-time/transportation activities (physical activity score) and sport-/exercise-related activities (sports score). Participants are required to report the frequency and duration of activities executed during the last four weeks. Minutes of leisure-time physical activity per week and sport-/exercise-related activity per week are calculated to get the physical activity and the sports score. Both scores can be combined to receive the overall volume of physical activity completed during leisure-time/transportation and sport-/exercise-related activities.</description>

    <measure>Changes in physical activity-related health competence: BGK Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by the German version of the Physical Activity-Related Health Competence questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of 44 total items that measure three sub-competencies necessary for a health-promoting physical activity behavior: movement competence (20 items; min = 0, max = 17.6), control competence (10 items; min = 0, max = 10.8), physical activity-related self-regulation competence (14 items; min = 0, max = 14.8). Higher scores indicate higher competencies.</description>

    <description>Participants of the intervention group in nursing care received a co-created setting-specific intervention to promote physical activity called BuG lesson. The BuG lesson comprises a weekly 90-minute lesson for apprentices of nursing care during regular school hours, covering physical activity and health in theory and practice. Previously, the nursing teachers voluntarily underwent a qualification process as physical activity instructors, enabling them to conduct the BuG lessons independently.</description>

    <description>Participants of the intervention group in automotive mechatronics received a co-created setting-specific intervention to promote physical activity called tutoring system. In the tutoring system, automotive mechatronics apprentices act as physical activity promotors for their fellow apprentices. In the sense of a peer-to-peer approach, apprentices voluntarily participate in a workshop to be qualified as tutors. Subsequently, the tutoring system takes place every two weeks for about ten to fifteen minutes during regular working hours, allowing the tutors to discuss the issues of physical activity and health among their peers.</description>
