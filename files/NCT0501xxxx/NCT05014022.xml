  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in five patients admitted to hospital suffer a sudden reduction in kidney function,&#xD;
      termed acute kidney injury (AKI). Rather than kidney 'injury' being caused by physical&#xD;
      trauma, the term describes reversible damage caused by conditions such as being dehydrated or&#xD;
      having an infection. Having AKI puts patients at an increased risk of long-term health&#xD;
      problems, especially chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD can also lead to other important&#xD;
      health problems including a higher risk of heart disease and stroke. If we can reduce the&#xD;
      progression of AKI to CKD this will benefit patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is a gap in the follow-up of patients after AKI due to a lack of evidence&#xD;
      about which patients should be followed up and when. Treatments for AKI during the episode&#xD;
      and afterwards to prevent CKD are limited. This is mainly due to a lack of understanding&#xD;
      about how and when the kidney recovers after AKI. New tools are needed in order to better&#xD;
      identify patients at risk of CKD after AKI. This study aims to address these gaps in our&#xD;
      knowledge by studying a group of AKI patients in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, the aim of this study is to produce results that will allow better planning of&#xD;
      follow-up for patients as well the planning of future research to develop new treatments to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of CKD in people recovering from AKI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a sudden loss of renal function occurring in up to 20% of&#xD;
      hospitalised patient. People who survive an episode of AKI are at increased risk of long-term&#xD;
      effects on their health, in particular the development or progression of chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD). At present, there are no interventions proven to reduce the development of CKD&#xD;
      after an episode of AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant gap exists in the current provision of post-AKI follow-up care. Current methods&#xD;
      of assessing renal recovery are overly reliant on serum creatinine, an imperfect measure that&#xD;
      over-estimate the degree of renal recovery due to the effect of critical illness on muscle&#xD;
      mass. Based on expert opinion only, it is currently recommended that everyone who has&#xD;
      experienced AKI should have kidney function and albuminuria checked at 90 days. In reality,&#xD;
      current practice falls significantly below these standards. Less than half of patients with&#xD;
      the most severe AKI see a nephrologist after discharge. Even for patients who have required&#xD;
      dialysis for AKI, follow-up rates can be as low as 12%. Lack of evidence prevents a more&#xD;
      evolved approach. Improving post-AKI care and reducing the development or progression of CKD&#xD;
      could therefore directly benefit large numbers of patients. This is particularly pertinent&#xD;
      with the additional restrictions on hospital appointments due to COVID-19. More evidence is&#xD;
      urgently needed to inform which patients need follow-up and to integrate new techniques that&#xD;
      significantly improve assessments of renal recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Important knowledge gaps make it difficult to move directly to testing new interventions in&#xD;
      randomised trials. AKI is not a single condition, rather a heterogeneous syndrome with a&#xD;
      variety of causes affecting a wide range of people. Outcomes differ between clinical settings&#xD;
      and are affected by factors related to AKI (e.g. its severity or duration), but also by an&#xD;
      individual's co-existing long-term conditions, and possibly by their frailty. As well as CKD&#xD;
      development, AKI is associated with higher long-term mortality rates, increased heart failure&#xD;
      events, hospital readmissions, recurrent AKI and poorer quality of life. Which groups are&#xD;
      most at risk of the different outcomes is not well established; similarly the groups that&#xD;
      would have the greatest benefit from interventions to reduce the development of CKD are not&#xD;
      currently known. It is therefore likely that subgroups of people who have sustained AKI will&#xD;
      benefit from different models of post- AKI care i.e. a one-size fits all approach is unlikely&#xD;
      to be beneficial or cost-effective. Finally, the timing of the renal recovery phase after an&#xD;
      episode of AKI is poorly understood outside of experimental models, which differ in a number&#xD;
      of ways from clinical AKI. Failure of recovery of creatinine by 90 days after AKI strongly&#xD;
      associates with subsequent long-term reductions in renal function, suggesting that&#xD;
      interventions may be needed prior to this time point, but descriptions of renal recovery&#xD;
      between AKI and 90 days are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI has emerged as an imaging modality with promise to improve the understanding and&#xD;
      characterisation of renal pathophysiology. It is a versatile technique in which structural&#xD;
      and functional MRI measurements can be performed in a single multiparametric scan session to&#xD;
      assess altered renal tissue microstructure, oxygenation, perfusion and blood flow. MRI is&#xD;
      non-invasive, safe and avoids sampling bias by characterising the entire kidney with high&#xD;
      spatial resolution. MRI does not involve ionising radiation, is repeatable (allowing serial&#xD;
      assessments over time) and the MRI measures do not require gadolinium contrast agents. A&#xD;
      series of recent systematic reviews covering the main functional renal MRI measures conclude&#xD;
      that evidence is now needed to accelerate the translation of multiparametric renal MRI for&#xD;
      clinical use. The reviews focussed on: arterial spin labelling (ASL, a measure of renal&#xD;
      perfusion); Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD, sensitive to changes in renal oxygenation);&#xD;
      longitudinal (T1) relaxation time (increases with scarring, correlates with fibrosis in the&#xD;
      heart and liver; diffusion weighted imaging (DWI, sensitive to changes in renal tissue&#xD;
      microstructure); and Phase Contrast (PC-MRI, a measure of renal artery blood flow).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the high incidence of AKI, the long-term consequences of AKI present a major&#xD;
      unmet clinical need affecting large numbers of people, with no proven interventions nor data&#xD;
      to inform optimal care provision. If patients at risk of developing CKD could be better&#xD;
      identified, this would provide a basis upon which interventions to improve patient outcomes&#xD;
      could be planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outputs of this study would directly inform planning of future research in the following&#xD;
      ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of data supporting a larger prospective cohort study of AKI patients, using&#xD;
           data from this study to directly inform study design and MRI protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of those at greatest risk of developing CKD after AKI will make clinical&#xD;
           trials more efficient and more likely to succeed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increasing understanding of the time course of renal recovery will allow planning of the&#xD;
           optimal time points for interventions and patient follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate the potential application of renal MRI in NHS scanners leading to improved&#xD;
           clinical evaluation of patients&#xD;
