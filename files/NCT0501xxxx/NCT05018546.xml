    <textblock>
      Urolithiasis is one of the most prevalent urological diseases affecting general population&#xD;
      across the world. The available treatment modalities for renal stones are Shock wave&#xD;
      lithotripsy (SWL), Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PNL), and Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery&#xD;
      (RIRS). Irrigation for RIRS is the critical component for the success of procedure. To avoid&#xD;
      detrimental effects of high pressure, intra-renal pressure (IRP) has to be lower. Different&#xD;
      studies have shown that high irrigation pressure raises intra-renal pressure leading to&#xD;
      pyelo-venous and pyelo-lymphatic reflux which can lead to sepsis and septic shock.&#xD;
      Comparative study of different irrigation pressure during RIRS is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is randomized controlled trial conducted in Department of Urology and Renal Transplant&#xD;
      Surgery for duration of one year. Objective of the study is to compare safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      gravity irrigation versus pressure irrigation. Patients with symptomatic kidney stones: non&#xD;
      lower pole stones &lt;2cm, lower pole stones &lt;1cm and lower pole stones 1-2 cm in whom PCNL is&#xD;
      contraindicated will be enrolled in study with informed consent. Retrograde intrarenal&#xD;
      surgery will be performed as standard procedure and Ho:YAG laser will be used to fragment&#xD;
      stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stone free rate at postoperative day 1 and after 1 month will be monitored through X-ray KUB.&#xD;
      Maximum irrigation pressure, duration of surgery, stone size, density, location,&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative complications as classified by Clavien-Dindo will be noted&#xD;
      for all patients. Data will be appropriately analyzed and statistical tests applied as&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction Urolithiasis is one of the most prevalent urological diseases affecting general&#xD;
      population across the world. The worldwide prevalence ranges from 7%- 13% in North America,&#xD;
      5%-9% in Europe, and 1%-5% in Asia.1 West Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia as well as several&#xD;
      developed countries, including South Korea and Japan, have been categorized into stone&#xD;
      forming belt countries with prevalence ranging from 5% to 19.1%. Increasing incidence of&#xD;
      stone disease is linked with modern life style, food habits, climate as well as increasing&#xD;
      use of imaging (computed tomography or ultrasonography)2,3,4 Renal stones constitute about&#xD;
      80% of total urolithiasis. Shock wave lithotripsy(SWL), Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy(PNL),&#xD;
      and Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery (RIRS) are available treatment modality for renal stones.&#xD;
      According to European Association of Urology (EAU) 2020 Guidelines, when active treatment of&#xD;
      renal stones of size &lt;10 mm is indicated, primary treatment modality is either SWL or RIRS.&#xD;
      For stones of size &gt; 20 mm, PNL is first line of treatment, however if it is contraindicated&#xD;
      then RIRS or SWL can be used. Stones of size 10-20 mm in non-lower pole calyx can be dealt&#xD;
      with SWL or Endourology (PNL or RIRS). Lower pole calyx stones of 10-20 mm with unfavorable&#xD;
      factors like steep infundibulo-pelvic angle, long calyx, long skin to stone distance, narrow&#xD;
      infundibulum and shock wave resistant stones need to be treated with endourology (PNL or&#xD;
      RIRS). However, favorable lower pole calyx stones of size 10-20 mm are recommended for SWL or&#xD;
      Endourology.5According to AUA guidelines6, in symptomatic patients with a total non-lower&#xD;
      pole renal stone burden ≤ 20 mm, SWL or RIRS can be offered. Patients with a total renal&#xD;
      stone burden &gt; 20 mm, PNL are the first line therapy. For patients with &lt; 10 mm lower pole&#xD;
      renal stones, SWL or RIRS is first line treatment. Patients shouldn't be offered SWL as first&#xD;
      line therapy to lower pole stones &gt;10 mm. Patients with lower pole stones &gt;10mm in size need&#xD;
      to be explained that PNL has a higher stone free rate but greater morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIRS is occasionally associated with severe infectious complications.14 Reasons commonly&#xD;
      attributed to it are high intra-pelvic pressure, obstruction, infected urine and stone, break&#xD;
      in sterility of procedure etc. Ureteral Access Sheath (UAS) is one of the measure used to&#xD;
      decrease intra-pelvic pressure during stone fragmentation.13 Irrigation for RIRS is the&#xD;
      critical component for the success of procedure. For better vision during procedure,&#xD;
      irrigation pressure (IP) and irrigation flow (IF) needs to be increased. To avoid detrimental&#xD;
      effects of high pressure, intra-renal pressure (IRP) has to be lower than 22 mmHg (30 cm of&#xD;
      water (H2O))7. High pressure irrigation raises intrarenal pressure leading to pyelo-venous&#xD;
      and pyelo-lymphatic reflux which can lead to sepsis, septic shock, bleeding, infundibular&#xD;
      rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have estimated that at an IP of ≤ 100 cm H2O (73 mmHg), IRPs remain lower than&#xD;
      30 cm H2O if Ureteric Access Sheath (UAS) bigger than 10/12 F is utilized. An IP of 200 cm&#xD;
      H2O (146 mmHg) may offer high irrigation flows but could result in IRPs &gt; 40 cm H2O8,9.&#xD;
      During forced irrigation and stone fragmentation, IRP can rise upto 300mmHg for short&#xD;
      interval.15 Omar M. et al in another similar endourological procedure, PCNL which showed High&#xD;
      Irrigation Pressure (272 cm H2O) to be associated with a higher risk of SIRS (46%) compared&#xD;
      to low Irrigation Pressure (108.8 cm H2O) risk of 11%.10 Gravity irrigation at 100 cm of H2O&#xD;
      (73 mmHg), exerts IRP lower than 30 cm of H2O, however in pressure irrigation IRP increases&#xD;
      significantly higher. In this study Investigators want to compare between two groups in terms&#xD;
      of safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale and Justification of study Irrigation is required in RIRS for better vision and&#xD;
      smooth performance of surgery. However, high IP during RIRS is implicated for infective&#xD;
      complications. Comparative study of different pressures for irrigation during RIRS is&#xD;
      lacking. Investigators would like to study the safety and efficacy of gravity irrigation&#xD;
      versus pressure irrigation in RIRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objectives To study the safety and efficacy of gravity irrigation versus pressure&#xD;
      irrigation in RIRS Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the demographic pattern of patients undergoing RIRS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare complications rate of gravity irrigation versus pressure irrigation in RIRS&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify the stone clearance of gravity irrigation versus pressure irrigation in RIRS&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare duration of stone fragmentation of gravity irrigation versus pressure&#xD;
           irrigation in RIRS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Research question Which irrigation system is safe and efficacious: gravity or pressure&#xD;
           irrigation? Research Hypothesis Null hypothesis There is no difference in terms of&#xD;
           safety (complications and length of hospital stay) and efficacy (stone free rate and&#xD;
           fragmentation time) between gravity and pressure irrigation in RIRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Alternative hypothesis There is difference in terms of safety and efficacy between&#xD;
           gravity and pressure irrigation in RIRS.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
           Expected time and duration of the study- 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tools and techniques for data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection will be done using preformed proforma and entered in windows excel.&#xD;
           Patient's demographic profile, stone characteristics and pelvi-calyceal anatomy will be&#xD;
           recorded. Categorical variables will be expressed as proportions (%) and continuous&#xD;
           variables expressed as Mean ± Standard Deviation(SD). Chi-square test will be used for&#xD;
           categorical data and Mann-Whitney U test or student's t test will be applied for&#xD;
           continuous variables as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Management protocol of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with symptomatic renal calculi fulfilling inclusion criteria, will be&#xD;
           considered for RIRS. Pre-operative workup of patients includes Complete blood count,&#xD;
           Renal function test, Chest X ray, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Urine routine and microscopy,&#xD;
           Urine culture and sensitivity. Imaging work-up includes X-ray Kidney Ureter and Bladder&#xD;
           (KUB), Ultrasonography Abdomen and Pelvis and Computed Tomography (CT) Urography.&#xD;
           Pre-operatively R.I.R.S. scoring system is used to predict stone free rate.11 Patient&#xD;
           planned for surgery needs sterile urine. If patient has indwelling tube/catheter and&#xD;
           urine culture shows colonized organism, then patient will be treated with sensitive&#xD;
           antibiotics for at least 3 days. Informed written consent will be taken from patient and&#xD;
           patient information sheet (PIS) will be given. Patient will be randomized to two groups:&#xD;
           gravity irrigation group and pressure irrigation group in 1:1 ratio through computer&#xD;
           generated random numbers. Even numbers will be assigned to gravity irrigation group and&#xD;
           odd numbers to pressure irrigation group. Patient will get prophylactic antibiotic at&#xD;
           the time of induction with single dose of ceftriaxone 1gm IV and amikacin 750 mg IV or&#xD;
           sensitive antibiotics will be continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient will be placed in lithotomy position and rigid cystoscopy (19 Fr sheath and 30&#xD;
           scope) will done. Guidewire (Terumo 0.035 inch) will be parked into renal pelvis and&#xD;
           ureteric access sheath 9.5/11.5 Fr (Cook Medical, Bloomington) will be placed reaching&#xD;
           just proximal ureter under fluoroscopy. Flexible ureteroscopy will be done with Karl&#xD;
           Storz FLEX X2S connected to irrigation system consisting of Transurethral resection&#xD;
           (TUR) set connected to 3 L normal saline bag placed at height of 100 cm from patient's&#xD;
           symphysis pubis. In Gravity irrigation group, RIRS surgery will be done with 3 L normal&#xD;
           saline bag placed at 100 cm from patient's symphysis pubis. In case of poor vision and&#xD;
           procedure can't be completed with gravity irrigation, pressure irrigation will be used&#xD;
           and this conversion will be mentioned in proforma. In pressure irrigation group,&#xD;
           Irrigation pressure will be given by arterial line pressure bag and will be started from&#xD;
           80 mmHg and subsequently increased by 10 mmHg as required and peak irrigation pressure&#xD;
           required will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stones will be dusted and fragmented with laser energy (LithoDK30, Holmium 2.1&#xD;
           micrometer, Quanta System, Milan, Italy). Duration of surgery along with stone&#xD;
           fragmentation time will be noted. After the procedure, DJ stent will be placed and&#xD;
           removed after 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stone clearance will be confirmed fluoroscopically at the completion of surgery, Post&#xD;
           operative day one (POD1) and Post operative month one (POM1) with X-ray KUB and USG&#xD;
           abdomen and pelvis. If patient requires more than one stage procedure, it will be&#xD;
           mentioned. Patient's post-operative course will be monitored and any complications will&#xD;
           be noted. For rapid identification of sepsis, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment&#xD;
           (qSOFA) score will be used: respiratory rate of 22/min or greater, altered mentation, or&#xD;
           systolic blood pressure of 100 mmHg or less. qSOFA score more than two alerts to&#xD;
           evaluate for sepsis and septic shock. Double J (DJ) stent will be placed for 2 weeks&#xD;
           unless its removal required because of fever. Post-operative complications will be&#xD;
           recorded as per classification described by Clavien-Dindo.12&#xD;
&#xD;
           Process of data Analysis Data collected in Proforma will be entered in Windows Excel.&#xD;
           Comparative analysis will be done between gravity irrigation versus pressure irrigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CONSORT Flow Diagram&#xD;
&#xD;
           Plan for data management and statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection will be done in proforma and will be entered in Windows Excel. Patient's&#xD;
           demographic profile, stone characteristics and pelvi-calyceal anatomy will be recorded.&#xD;
           Categorical variables will be expressed as proportions (%) and continuous variables&#xD;
           expressed as Mean ± SD. Chi-square test will be used for categorical data and&#xD;
           Mann-Whitney U test or student's t test will be applied for continuous variables as&#xD;
           appropriate. P value of &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Biases and Limitations of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           During procedure, vision is subjective and depends on surgeon's assessment and may&#xD;
           require high pressure to obtain optimum vision. Surgeon's patience is required to wait&#xD;
           till vision becomes clear. Size of stone, type and volume of stone, use of ureteric&#xD;
           access sheath, past history of DJ stent placement, past history of endourological&#xD;
           procedure as well as patient's comorbidities like diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised&#xD;
           status can be confounding factors for longer duration of surgery, complications and&#xD;
           stone clearance rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety considerations During evaluation and treatment of patient, safety and care of&#xD;
           patient will be taken. No unnecessary intervention or medication will be given to&#xD;
           patient apart from what is mentioned in our study and current best practice for&#xD;
           management of renal stones.&#xD;
