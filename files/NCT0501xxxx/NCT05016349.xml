      Investigating the potential role of a novel quadrate combination therapy&#xD;
      Mifepristone(Antiprogestrone), Tamoxifen, Retinoic acid and Cannabidiol ( selective cyp 26&#xD;
      inhibitor) for treating early breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer is the main cause of mortality among women. The disease presents high&#xD;
      recurrence mainly due to incomplete efficacy of primary treatment in killing all cancer&#xD;
      cells. Therapy resistance remains a major problem in estrogen receptor-α (ERα)-positive&#xD;
      breast cancer. Half of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers contain a subpopulation of&#xD;
      cytokeratin 5 (CK5)-expressing cells that are therapy resistant and exhibit increased cancer&#xD;
      stem cell (CSC) properties. Here, we propose a testable hypothesis that treatment of breast&#xD;
      cancer with tamoxifen or retinoic acid or a combination of the two, may result in induction&#xD;
      or conversion of some ER-positive breast cancer cells to ER-negative cancer cells expressing&#xD;
      the basal cytokeratin-5 (CK5) via stimulation of progesterone receptors effect, and&#xD;
      production . Therefore, we raised an issue with the answer &quot; Why Antiprogestrone such&#xD;
      Mifepristone and cyp 26 inhibitors must be combined with Tamoxifen or its combination with&#xD;
      retinoic acid in the era of oncology for treating early breast cancer&quot; .In fact, limited&#xD;
      evidence has indicated that induction of CK5+ cells in ERα+ breast cancer is a unique effect&#xD;
      of progestin (Prg) but many studies have demonstrated that progesterone (P4) increases CK5+&#xD;
      breast cancer cells. In case-cohort study of 405 incident breast cancer cases, elevated&#xD;
      circulating progesterone levels were associated with a 16% increase in the risk of breast&#xD;
      cancer. A study demonstrated that tamoxifen induced progesterone receptors (PGR) in short&#xD;
      term treatment. Another study showed that High progesterone receptor expression correlates to&#xD;
      the effect of adjuvant tamoxifen in premenopausal breast cancer patients. These CK5-positive&#xD;
      cells are therapy resistant and have increased tumor-initiating potential. Also, previous&#xD;
      work has shown that retinoic acid, a chemical that results from the body's natural breakdown&#xD;
      of vitamin A, should act against these CK5+ cells, but clinical trials of retinoids against&#xD;
      breast cancer have been largely unsuccessful .Therefore we suggest that combination of&#xD;
      retinoiac acid and tamoxifen was unsucssecful in treating breast cancer owing its ability to&#xD;
      induce progesterone receptors and production leading to increasing numbers of CK5-positive&#xD;
      cells which are therapy resistant . Although retinoid fenretinide reduced the accumulation of&#xD;
      CK5+ cells during estrogen depletion. A study investigated the effects of all-trans-RA (atRA)&#xD;
      on progesterone production in immature rat GCs cultured without gonadotropin. demonstrated&#xD;
      that atRA enhanced progesterone production by upregulating the levels of steroidogenic acute&#xD;
      regulatory protein (StAR) and cytochrome P450scc (Cyp11a1). Here, we suggest that tamoxifen&#xD;
      or its combination with retinoic acid must be combined with anti-progesterone (Mifepristone)&#xD;
      to achieve treatment with significant effect against early breast cancer. Moreover, Numerous&#xD;
      studies have shown that CYP2D6 variant carriers (around 50% CYP2D6 variant carriers in&#xD;
      Chinese population) will not benefit a lot from tamoxifen, and combined use of CYP2D6&#xD;
      inhibitors will further affect the efficacy of tamoxifen. In addition, All-trans-retinoic&#xD;
      acid acts as an inducer of CYP26A1 expression. Which is the second expected cause of&#xD;
      unsuccessful trial of Tamoxifen and retinoic acid in breast cancer treatment. Furthermore,&#xD;
      The CYP26 inhibitor also induced expression of atRA-responsive genes. All-trans retinoic acid&#xD;
      (ATRA) significantly inhibited aromatase activity in a concentration-dependent manner in&#xD;
      microsomes isolated from JEG-3 human placental carcinoma cells. One study found that high&#xD;
      retinol was significantly. associated with reduced breast cancer risk. Another found a&#xD;
      significant trend of reduced retinol levels with more advanced disease stage. A study showed&#xD;
      that intake of vitamin A and retinol could reduce breast cancer risk. Therefore we will take&#xD;
      the benefit of cyp 26 inhibitor in this trial by combining Cannabidiol, a major&#xD;
      phytocannabinoid, as a potent atypical inhibitor for CYP2D6.&#xD;

      The study is a randomized interventional comparative Phase II trial. which will Investigating&#xD;
      and test the safety and effectiveness of a Novel Quadrate Combination Therapy&#xD;
      Mifepristone(Antiprogestrone), Tamoxifen, Retinoic Acid and Cannabidiol ( Selective Cyp 26&#xD;
      Inhibitor) to learn whether this novel combination therapy works in treating Treating Early&#xD;
      Breast Cancer. The primary objective of the study is to; 1) evaluate the anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      of this combination therapy within the context of a phase II study Other objectives are: 2)&#xD;
      to determine the effect of this novel combination therapy on cytokeratin 5 (CK5)-expressing&#xD;
      cells;3) and to determine the expression of CK5 biomarkers of breast carcinogenesis before&#xD;
      and after treatment.160 adult female patients with breast cancer and fulfilling the below&#xD;
      outlined inclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
