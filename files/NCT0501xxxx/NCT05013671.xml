  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BPPV is a benign condition of the balance organ, localized in the inner ear, in which calcium&#xD;
      crystals loosen up and move freely in the endolymphatic fluid of the inner ear (more&#xD;
      specifically in the semi-circular canals). During certain posture changes or head movements,&#xD;
      these moving calcium crystals cause dizziness and balance problems. The general objective of&#xD;
      the study is to evaluate the impact of BPPV on the balance of older adults in nursing homes.&#xD;
      For this purpose, we will compare the balance of residents with BPPV with residents without&#xD;
      BPPV. Furthermore, we will identify the impact of treatment on balance problems and fall risk&#xD;
      in older adults in nursing homes.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>First, the nursing home resident will be assessed for the presence of BPPV. Based on the presence of BPPV, two groups will be formed: BPPV-group and control group. The residents suffering from BPPV will undergo balance tests and will be treated for their BPPV (BPPV-group). The nursing home residents with BPPV will be matched to residents without the disease (case control design) and will also undergo balance tests. At 1,3,6 and 12 months the presence of balance problems will be followed up in both groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The strength of the knee extensor muscles of the right leg will be assessed with hand-held dynamometry (MicroFET). This dynamometer is placed between the leg segment to be evaluated and the examiner's hand. Participants were asked to sit with their legs over the end of a standard, examination table, with hips and knees flexed to 90. Participants have to hold the side-edges of the table with their hands and carry out a maximal isometric voluntary contraction for 3-5 s. The break method will be used to asses the knee extensor strength. This test will be performed 3 times.</description>
