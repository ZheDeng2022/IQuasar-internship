  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron is an essential micronutrient for nearly all living organisms, including microbes. The&#xD;
      adult human body contains approximately 3-5 g of iron (45-55 mg/kg of body weight in adult&#xD;
      women and men, respectively). Iron-deficiency related anaemia (IDA) is a major public health&#xD;
      problem that affects more than 2 billion people globally and this represents 24.8% of the&#xD;
      world's population. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), iron deficiency is the most&#xD;
      common cause of anaemia worldwide, with infants, children and women at higher risk, making it&#xD;
      a global public health problem. Much iron deficiency is a result of poor iron dietary&#xD;
      absorption since iron is poorly absorbed (~15%). Absorption inhibition factors (iron&#xD;
      chelators) like phytate and tannins, found in tea and vegetables have been reported to act as&#xD;
      potent iron uptake inhibitors. Despite its health benefits, tea-containing polyphenols&#xD;
      (tannins) have been associated with reduction and disruption of iron absorption, acting as&#xD;
      inhibitors of non-haem iron uptake, potentially resulting in poor iron status. However, most&#xD;
      studies on the effect of tea on iron absorption are largely based on isotope-labelled single&#xD;
      meal studies and animal studies. Iron is a requirement of many microorganisms, as such&#xD;
      changes in iron availability can also have an impact on the gut microbiota. Long-term&#xD;
      controlled human intervention studies to investigate the effect of tea on iron absorption and&#xD;
      the effect on gut microbiota composition are scarce. In addition, the impact of dietary&#xD;
      tannins on the gut microbiota is not understood. Thus, this proposed human intervention trial&#xD;
      will investigate the combined effect of tea-tannins on iron status, inflammation and gut&#xD;
      microbiota composition. This will be the first study to consider this combination of factors.&#xD;

    <description>gut inflammation will be assessed by measuring concentration (pg/mL) of gut inflammatory markers as plasma intestinal fatty acid-binding protein and cytokines from plasma (e.g. IL-10, IL-6, TNFÎ±).

    <description>Gut inflammation will be assessed measuring concentration (mcg/g) of calprotectin. Increase in the levels of Calprotectin indicates the migration of neutrophils to the intestinal mucosa, which occurs during intestinal inflammation.</description>
