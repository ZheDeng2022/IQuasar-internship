  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      formulated with MK-5180 when administered as a SC injection to participants with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors. Participants will receive SC injections of MK-3475A containing one of 2&#xD;
      different concentrations (Conc) of pembrolizumab, Conc1 and Conc2, which total the same&#xD;
      overall dose of pembrolizumab (Dose Level [DL] 1).&#xD;
