    <description>irORR is defined as the number of patients achieving a complete response (irCR) or partial response (irPR) based on the immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) at any time during the study. irCR = disappearance of all target lesions, irPR is =&gt;30percent decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, progressive disease (irPD) is &gt;20percent increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, stable disease (irSD) is &lt;30percent decrease or &lt;20percent increase in sum of diameters of target lesions.</description>

    <description>When calculating the incidence of adverse event (AE)s, each AE (as defined by NCI CTCAE v5.0) will be counted only once for a given subject.</description>
