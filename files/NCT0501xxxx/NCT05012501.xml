  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate whether NETs markers can enhance procoagulant&#xD;
      activity and predict portal vein thrombosis in patients with live cirrhosis, so as to&#xD;
      establish a novel predictor to guide clinical decision-making.So we recruit liver cirrhosis&#xD;
      with portal vein thrombosis and without portal vein thrombosis treated at the Affiliated&#xD;
      Hospital of Qingdao University and collection of blood samples.&#xD;

      Seventy-nine patients with benign liver cirrhosis treated at the Affiliated Hospital of&#xD;
      Qingdao University (China) from September 2020 to January 2021 were recruited for this study,&#xD;
      including 26 patients with portal vein thrombosis and 53 patients without portal vein&#xD;
      thrombosis. NETs markers (Myeloperoxidase, Neutrophil elastase, Citrate histone H3), tissue&#xD;
      factor, endotoxin, factor X, TAT complex, and anti-β2 glycoprotein I were detected in plasma&#xD;
      using capture ELISA and specific ELISA kits. T-test was performed to analyze whether there&#xD;
      was a statistical difference between the two groups, and regression analysis was performed&#xD;
      between NETs markers and tissue factor, endotoxin, factor X, TAT complex, and anti-β2&#xD;
      glycoprotein I to investigate whether there was a correlation. This study without any&#xD;
      intervention measures, will not cause harm.&#xD;
