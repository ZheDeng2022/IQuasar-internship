  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rebound pain is a well-recognized phenomenon after the effects of a nerve block wear off.&#xD;
      Severe rebound pain can happen after outpatient surgery, with patients often needing to come&#xD;
      back to the hospital or use other health care resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who are younger, female or have more pain before surgery are at higher risk of having&#xD;
      rebound pain. Bone surgeries and upper limb surgeries also increase the chances of having&#xD;
      rebound pain after surgery. Patients who have a tourniquet used during leg surgery often have&#xD;
      worse pain after surgery compared to patients who get surgery without the use of a&#xD;
      tourniquet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Things that may reduce the chances of getting rebound pain are the use of nerve block&#xD;
      catheters, certain additives in nerve blocks and using multiple types of pain killers before&#xD;
      the block wears off. Using nerve block catheters can be expensive, so a targeted approach of&#xD;
      giving these catheters to patients who have the highest chances of getting rebound pain may&#xD;
      be the best way to allocate resources and help patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to create and test a risk model for severe rebound pain after lower&#xD;
      limb surgery where patients are getting a sciatic nerve block.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rebound pain is a well-recognized phenomenon after the resolution of peripheral nerve blocks.&#xD;
      Severe rebound pain is prevalent after ambulatory surgery, with potential resultant increased&#xD;
      health-care utilization and cost. Risk factors for severe rebound pain may include younger&#xD;
      age, female sex, high preoperative pain score, bone surgeries, and upper limb surgeries. Use&#xD;
      of tourniquet for lower limb procedures is also associated with worse postoperative pain&#xD;
      compared to without. Protective factors may include continuous perineural catheter, regional&#xD;
      anesthesia adjuncts, and multimodal oral pain management prior to resolution of peripheral&#xD;
      nerve blockade. However, placement of continuous peripheral nerve block catheters utilizes&#xD;
      additional health care resources; hence, a targeted approach where continuous perineural&#xD;
      catheters are offered to patients at the highest risk of severe rebound pain could&#xD;
      potentially offer the biggest benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to derive and validate a multivariable prediction model for severe&#xD;
      rebound pain after lower limb surgery involving popliteal blockade, to assist with risk&#xD;
      stratification and shared decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary model endpoint is severe rebound pain, defined by transition from well-controlled&#xD;
      pain (numerical rating scale [NRS] 3 or less or patient report of satisfactory pain control)&#xD;
      in the post anesthetic care unit (PACU) while the block is working to severe pain (NRS pain&#xD;
      score 7 or greater) within 48 h of block performance. This definition is modified from that&#xD;
      of Barry et al., 2020 as clinically, the investigators have noted some patients having&#xD;
      sensory blocks lasting more than 24 hours with the use of adjuncts.&#xD;
