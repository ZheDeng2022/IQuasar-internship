  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is the most common secondary condition in patients with CP and the most important factor&#xD;
      associated with reduced health-related quality of life. Pain in adolescents with CP is&#xD;
      reported approximately 50-75%. Despite being a condition that can be seen with such a high&#xD;
      prevalence, it is difficult for researchers and clinicians to capture this subjective&#xD;
      perception in CP, as the individual may be a small child, may be cognitively impaired,&#xD;
      visually impaired, or have communication difficulties. For these reasons, unrecognized pain&#xD;
      can have negative effects on quality of life and participation in daily living activities,&#xD;
      both as a result of limited mobility resulting from pain itself and fear-driven avoidance of&#xD;
      specific activities. Self-report of pain is appropriate for individuals with CP without&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. However, depending on the severity of communication impairment,&#xD;
      self-report may be limited or even impossible to obtain in individuals with severe CP. In the&#xD;
      case of individuals with CP, self-report supplemented with parent report, when possible, is&#xD;
      the recommended strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study: (i) to explore what is known about the prevalence, location,&#xD;
      intensity and the effect of pain on daily lives of adolescents with CP; (ii) to demonstrate&#xD;
      the relation between pain, clinical and sociodemographic characteristics; (iii) to compare&#xD;
      self-reports of pain with mothers'reports of their child's pain.&#xD;

      The investigators will record demographical data including age, gender, height (cm), weight&#xD;
      (kg), body mass index (BMI), school type, type of family (core or combined family) of the&#xD;
      children and socioeconomic status of the family, mothers' age and educational level. The&#xD;
      subtypes of CP will be classified, using the Swedish classification, into spastic&#xD;
      (tetraplegia, diplegia and hemiplegia), ataxic, dyskinetic and mixed. Severity of CP will be&#xD;
      determined based on the Gross Motor Functional Classification System. It will be questioned&#xD;
      in which situations the pain occurred in the previous week (at rest from spasms, at rest from&#xD;
      splints, on feeding, on moving, on dressing, at night, on exercise, on other treatments, on&#xD;
      botulinum toxin application) and record as yes/no. The pain questionnaire described by Doralp&#xD;
      et al (14) will be used both for the self-evaluation of adolescents with CP' pain and for&#xD;
      mothers to evaluate their children's pain. Participants will be asked to respond to the&#xD;
      initial question &quot;Over the past month, have you experienced physical pain?&quot; (yes or no).&#xD;
      Those responding &quot;yes&quot; will be asked &quot;Please indicate how severe your pain was over the past&#xD;
      month, on average,&quot; with response options from 1 (very little pain) to 10 (extremely&#xD;
      painful). They will be asked to indicate &quot;How much the pain gets in the way of your daily&#xD;
      activities over the past month&quot; from a low of 1 (does not get in the way at all) to 10&#xD;
      (unable to carry out activities because of the pain). Finally, they will be asked to indicate&#xD;
      the body regions in which they experienced pain.&#xD;
