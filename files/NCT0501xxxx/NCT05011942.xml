  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study objectives include assessing the use of Irrisept irrigation solution in lumbar spinal&#xD;
      fusion procedures and effect on clinical and patient reported outcome measures. This includes&#xD;
      assessing postoperative SSI as well as fusion rates in addition to patient reported outcome&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;

      This is a randomized controlled pilot study with a study size of 50 patients. Results will be&#xD;
      utilized to plan a larger scale study. Background literature supports the use of&#xD;
      chlorhexidine gluconate as an irrigation solution to decrease SSI although this has not been&#xD;
      conducted in this population of patients (lumbar spine fusion) to date. A decrease in SSI&#xD;
      with Irrisept, could support the possible use of this as an irrigation solution to decrease&#xD;
      infections postoperatively. It will be important to know the effect if any of Irrisept on&#xD;
      fusion rates. This study will provide valuable information that may assist in future&#xD;
      treatment and prevention of SSI in lumbar spinal fusion patients.&#xD;
