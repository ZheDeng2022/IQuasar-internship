      REACH2 is a three-year implementation research study designed to examine the implementation&#xD;
      through a mass drug administration platform of bi-annual single-dose azithromycin to reduce&#xD;
      child mortality among children ages 1 to 11 months who reside in high child mortality&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to provide the government of Côte d'Ivoire and other stakeholders the&#xD;
      information needed to understand what is required to bring bi-annual mass drug administration&#xD;
      (MDA) of single-dose azithromycin for children ages 1 to 11 months in high child mortality&#xD;
      settings to scale using the existing MDA platform used for trachoma and other neglected&#xD;
      tropical diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The serial cross-sectional study will be carried out in 19 health districts in&#xD;
      coordination with the trachoma MDAs over the course of three years. The intervention under&#xD;
      study will involve a public health campaign of bi-annual distribution of single-dose&#xD;
      azithromycin, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Expanded coverage with azithromycin during annual trachoma MDAs to children 1-5 months&#xD;
           of age when delivered at the same time as the annual trachoma MDA, which already covers&#xD;
           children 6-11 months, followed by&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stand-alone MDAs targeting children 1 to 11 months delivered at the approximately&#xD;
           6-month interval between annual trachoma MDAs, or bi-annually in areas where the annual&#xD;
           trachoma MDAs are phased out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study scale up of these intervention activities, the investigators will systematically&#xD;
      collect data, guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance&#xD;
      (RE-AIM) implementation science framework. Data collection activities will involve:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analyses of routine monitoring, process, and adverse drug reaction data from the&#xD;
           trachoma MDA platform into which the REACH activities are being integrated&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Periodic, cross-sectional, post-MDA surveys to verify coverage and examine exposure to&#xD;
           project information/messaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Qualitative data collection through in-depth interviews (IDI) and/or focus group&#xD;
           discussions (FGD) with parents or primary caregivers of children ages 1 to 11 months in&#xD;
           the 19 health districts, and district-level MDA implementers to explore issues of&#xD;
           acceptability, communication, challenges and areas for improvement in implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, after the first round of the annual trachoma MDA scheduled to take place in July&#xD;
      2021, a round of focus groups will be carried out with parents of children ages 1-11 months&#xD;
      and local implementers to inform message development for the public health campaign.&#xD;
