  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current study, the study team will explore whether small incentives are effective at&#xD;
      promoting flu vaccine uptake. The study is designed to compare the relative efficacy of&#xD;
      incentives of equal perceived expected value (EV) or equal implementation costs, to assess&#xD;
      whether people are more likely to get vaccinated in response to lotteries with very high&#xD;
      payoffs than to small certain cash payout or slightly higher-probability, more moderate&#xD;
      payoffs. In particular, given the potential appeal of official state lottery tickets, one&#xD;
      study arm will receive a Pennsylvania scratch-off lottery ticket for getting a flu vaccine. A&#xD;
      primary hypothesis is that lotteries will outperform simple reminders (encouraging&#xD;
      respondents to get the flu shot at their upcoming appointment) and the standard of care,&#xD;
      representing the ambient healthcare system and public health campaigns to increase&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the 2021-22 flu season, the study team will contact Geisinger patients who have a&#xD;
      primary care or specialist appointment scheduled during flu season and encourage them to get&#xD;
      a flu shot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into 4 to 9 study arms, depending on a sample size projection&#xD;
      completed in August 2021. Arms will test the relative efficacy of a variety of small monetary&#xD;
      incentives on flu shot uptake. Incentives may include (a) a $1 Pennsylvania scratch-off&#xD;
      lottery ticket (with top prize of $5,000), (b) $1 in cash, (c) entry into a raffle for $5,000&#xD;
      absent upfront odds, (d) entry into a raffle for $5,000, with 1-in-5,000 odds of winning, (d)&#xD;
      entry into a raffle for $50, with 1-in-50 odds of winning, and (e) entry into a raffle for&#xD;
      $500, with 1-in-500 odds of winning. There will be one no-contact control arm and at least 1&#xD;
      reminder control arm (with additional control arms added given sufficient sample size and&#xD;
      additional message versions to be tested).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included in the study will be current Geisinger patients 18+ years of age with no&#xD;
      contraindications for flu vaccine who have an appointment scheduled during the study period&#xD;
      with a provider who can administer the vaccine. The primary study outcomes will be the rates&#xD;
      of flu vaccination and flu diagnosis during the 2021-22 season by targeted patients.&#xD;
