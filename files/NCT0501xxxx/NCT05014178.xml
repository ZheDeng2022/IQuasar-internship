  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The corticomedullary gradient is largely responsible for developing the gradients that are&#xD;
      needed to concentrate urine (more solutes and less water). The ability of the kidneys to&#xD;
      produce concentrated urine is a major determinant of the ability to survive the warm weather.&#xD;
      When temperatures are high, we lose water through sweat, and so the kidneys retain water to&#xD;
      maintain fluidity in the blood. The maintenance of a sodium (salt) gradient is required for&#xD;
      urine concentration because increased medullary sodium concentration increases the&#xD;
      reabsorption of water into the kidney, to be redistributed in the blood. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to know if the corticomedullary gradient is altered in patients across a wide&#xD;
      spectrum of kidney disease using sodium Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a machine that&#xD;
      takes pictures and measures the salt content in the kidneys. 23Na kidney MRI, will provide&#xD;
      functional MR of the kidney as a non-invasive tool to describe medullary function to improve&#xD;
      management of chronic and kidney disease.&#xD;

      This study is a pilot exploratory study (preliminary project to assess the use of a kidney&#xD;
      sodium coil across a wide spectrum of kidney disease). Approximately 200 patients from the&#xD;
      London Health Sciences Regional Renal Program will be recruited. This study involves two&#xD;
      visits at Robarts Research Institute or St. Joseph's Hospital, London, Ontario depending on&#xD;
      scanner availability, lasting approximately 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first study visit participants will undergo a sodium MRI scan of your kidneys. Prior&#xD;
      to the scan, participants will have their sitting blood pressure and heart rate measured&#xD;
      three times consecutively using a standard automatic blood pressure monitor. In addition to&#xD;
      this, participants will be asked to provide a spot urine sample and have blood work done. If&#xD;
      participants have been treated for nephrolithiasis, they will be responsible for completing a&#xD;
      24-hour urine volume test sometime the week before the MRI scan.&#xD;
