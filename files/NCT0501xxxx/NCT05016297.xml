  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators had observed that baricitinib was effective and safe in active pSS patients&#xD;
      in a pilot study. So the investigators plan to conduct a multi-center, prospective,&#xD;
      open-label, randomized study to compare the efficacy of baricitinib + hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
      (HCQ) with HCQ alone in active pSS patients. The participants will be randomized (1:2) to&#xD;
      receive HCQ (200mg twice a day) or baricitinib (4mg per day) + HCQ (200mg twice a day) until&#xD;
      week 24. The primary endpoint is the ESSDAI and ESSPRI response (define as an improvement of&#xD;
      ESSDAI at least three points, and ESSPRI at least one point or 15%) at 12 weeks. According to&#xD;
      an expected response rate of 70% in baricitinib + HCQ group and 30% in HCQ group, the&#xD;
      investigators will involve approximately 87 participants (29:58) with 20% drop out rate. The&#xD;
      investigators will switch HCQ to baricitinib + HCQ if the participants has no response at 12&#xD;
      weeks. The investigators hypothesized that baricitinib was effective and safe in active pSS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will be divided into HCQ group or HCQ + baricitinib group randomly. On the&#xD;
      basis of the HCQ treatment before, the participants in the latter group will be given&#xD;
      baricitinib 4mg once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will come to visit at week 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. The final evaluation&#xD;
      will be at week 24. The participants who has no response to HCQ treatment alone at week 12&#xD;
      will be switched to baricitinib + HCQ group and treated with baricitinib 4mg per day until&#xD;
      the end of the study (week 24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline information included demographics, SS duration, clinical manifestations, laboratory&#xD;
      parameters, current medications, and disease activity. Laboratory tests, including complete&#xD;
      blood counts, urinalysis, liver and renal function tests, ESR, and IgG test were performed at&#xD;
      each visit. Disease activity was assessed using the ESSDAI, EULAR primary SS patient reported&#xD;
      index (ESSPRI), and physician global assessment (PGA) scores.&#xD;

                       history), medical history, clinical features, and abnormal chest x-ray at&#xD;
                       screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test or T-SPOT®.TB test (as available and if compliant&#xD;
                       with local TB guidelines) may be used instead of the PPD test. Patients are&#xD;
                       excluded from the study if the test is not negative and there is clinical&#xD;
                       evidence of active TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Exception: patients with a history of active TB who have documented evidence of&#xD;
                  appropriate treatment, have no history of re-exposure since their treatment was&#xD;
                  completed, have no clinical features of active TB, and have a screening chest&#xD;
                  x-ray with no evidence of active TB may be enrolled if other entry criteria met.&#xD;
                  Such patients would not be required to undergo the protocol-specific TB testing&#xD;
                  for PPD, QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test, or T-SPOT®.TB test but must have a chest&#xD;
                  x-ray at screening (i.e., chest imaging performed within the past 6 months will&#xD;
                  not be accepted).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Have evidence of untreated/inadequately or inappropriately treated latent TB,&#xD;
                  defined in this study as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Positive PPD test, no clinical features consistent with active TB, and a&#xD;
                       chest x-ray with no evidence of active TB at screening; or&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  If the PPD test is positive and the patient has no medical history or chest&#xD;
                       x-ray findings consistent with active TB, the patient may have a&#xD;
                       QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test or T-SPOT®.TB test (as available and if compliant&#xD;
                       with local TB guidelines). If the test results are not negative, the patient&#xD;
                       will be considered to have latent TB (for purposes of this study); or&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test or T- SPOT®.TB test (as available and if compliant&#xD;
                       with local TB guidelines) may be used instead of the PPD test. If the test&#xD;
                       results are positive, the patient will be considered to have latent TB. If&#xD;
                       the test is not negative, the test may be repeated once within approximately&#xD;
                       2 weeks of the initial value. If the repeat test results are again not&#xD;
                       negative, the patient will be considered to have latent TB (for purposes of&#xD;
                       this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exception: Patients who have evidence of latent TB may be enrolled if he or she&#xD;
             completes at least 4 weeks of appropriate treatment prior to randomization and agrees&#xD;
             to complete the remainder of treatment while in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exception: Patients with a history of latent TB who have documented evidence of&#xD;
             appropriate treatment, have no history of re-exposure since their treatment was&#xD;
             completed, have no clinical features of active TB, and have a screening chest x-ray&#xD;
             with no evidence of active TB may be enrolled if other entry criteria met. Such&#xD;
             patients would not be required to undergo the protocol-specific TB testing for PPD,&#xD;
             QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test, or T-SPOT®.TB test but must have a chest x-ray at screening&#xD;
             (i.e., chest imaging performed within the past 6 months will not be accepted).&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Have been exposed to a live vaccine within 12 weeks of randomization or are expected&#xD;
             to need/receive a live vaccine during the course of the study (with the exception of&#xD;
             herpes zoster vaccination).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: All patients who have not previously received the herpes zoster vaccine by&#xD;
             screening will be encouraged (per local guidelines) to do so prior to randomization;&#xD;
             vaccination with live herpes zoster vaccine must occur &gt;4 weeks prior to randomization&#xD;
             and start of investigational product. Patients will not be randomized if they were&#xD;
             exposed to a live herpes zoster vaccination within 4 weeks of planned randomization.&#xD;
             Investigators should review the vaccination status of their patients and follow the&#xD;
             local guidelines for vaccination of patients ≥18 years of age with non-live vaccines&#xD;
             intended to prevent infectious disease prior to entering patients into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Are currently enrolled in or have discontinued within 4 weeks of screening from any&#xD;
             other clinical trial involving an investigational product or nonapproved use of a drug&#xD;
             or device or any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or&#xD;
             medically compatible with this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Participants with active renal or central nervous system disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Significant impairment of major organ function (lung, heart, liver, kidney) or any&#xD;
             condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize the participant's&#xD;
             safety following exposure to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         29. Psychiatric illness or history of medical non-compliance that the study team feels&#xD;
             will make the patient unlikely to complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         30. Known allergic reactions to baricitinib or its components.&#xD;
&#xD;
         31. Are largely or wholly incapacitated permitting little or no self-care, such as being&#xD;
             bedridden or confined to wheelchair.&#xD;
&#xD;
         32. In the opinion of the investigator, are at an unacceptable risk for participating in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         33. Have donated more than a single unit of blood within 4 weeks prior to screening or&#xD;
             intend to donate blood during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         34. Have a history of intravenous drug abuse, other illicit drug abuse, or chronic alcohol&#xD;
             abuse within the 2 years prior to screening or are concurrently using, or expected to&#xD;
             use during the study, illicit drugs (including marijuana).&#xD;
&#xD;
         35. Are unable or unwilling to make themselves available for the duration of the study&#xD;
             and/or are unwilling to follow study restrictions/procedures.&#xD;
