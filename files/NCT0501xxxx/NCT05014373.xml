  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label randomized controlled clinical trial which was designed to confirm the&#xD;
      potential efficacy and safety of favipiravir in the management of patients with mild to&#xD;
      moderate COVID-19 compared to best supportive care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Favipiravir is an antiviral agent whose indication in Japan is currently for influenza&#xD;
      infections. There were earlier reports from China suggesting its promising potential for&#xD;
      benefit in the treatment of COVID-19. This is an open label randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial was designed to verify the potential efficacy and safety of favipiravir in the&#xD;
      management of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 compared to best supportive care. This&#xD;
      study will look at the potential of using this repurposed oral agent in managing non-severe&#xD;
      cases of COVID19. Consenting patients admitted to hospitals or isolation/quarantine&#xD;
      facilities will be randomized at a 2:1 ratio to either favipiravir versus best supportive&#xD;
      care. Patients will be examined daily and will have xray and nasopharyngeal swabs every 3-4&#xD;
      days for close monitoring.&#xD;
