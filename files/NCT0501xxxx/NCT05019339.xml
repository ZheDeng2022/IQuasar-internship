  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity prevention efforts are needed in the United States, especially for families&#xD;
      with low income. Educating parents and caregivers on simple lifestyle and affordable home&#xD;
      environment changes is an effective strategy to improve health outcomes for the entire&#xD;
      family. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine whether HomeStyles-2, a&#xD;
      nutrition education and childhood obesity prevention program for families with children in&#xD;
      middle childhood (ages 6 to 11 years), motivates parents to shape their home environments and&#xD;
      weight-related lifestyle practices to be more supportive of optimal health and weight status&#xD;
      of their children aged 6-11 years more so than those in the control condition. The study will&#xD;
      include the experimental group and an attention control group who will engage in a nutrition&#xD;
      education program, Eat Healthy Be Active, that is equal in nonspecific treatment effects but&#xD;
      does not overlap on topics covered in HomeStyles-2. This study will be implemented in&#xD;
      Florida's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-Education (SNAP-Ed) program, which&#xD;
      provides nutrition education and obesity prevention supports for individuals with low income&#xD;
      who are receiving or eligible for SNAP benefits. Nutrition Educators will be randomized to&#xD;
      the experimental or attention control condition, and will lead participants through virtual,&#xD;
      group-based nutrition education series. The following data will be collected:&#xD;
      sociodemographic characteristics of the participant and child; child and parent health&#xD;
      status; parent weight-related cognitions; weight-related behaviors of the participant and&#xD;
      child; and weight-related characteristics of the home environment. Enrollment for this study&#xD;
      will begin late-2021.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the HomeStyles-2 for SNAP-Ed families RCT is to determine whether HomeStyles-2&#xD;
      enables and motivates SNAP-Ed parents and child caregivers (e.g., guardians) to shape their&#xD;
      home environments and weight-related lifestyle practices to be more supportive of optimal&#xD;
      health and weight status of their children aged 6-11 years than those in the control&#xD;
      condition. The study will be a two-arm, cluster randomized trial and will follow the CONSORT&#xD;
      guidelines extension for cluster trials. Individual counties or groups of small counties&#xD;
      operate as a single division with one individual who supervises the SNAP-Ed Nutrition&#xD;
      Educators assigned to that division. Every participating division will function as a cluster&#xD;
      in the study. Half of the Nutrition Educators in each cluster that choose to participate in&#xD;
      the study will be randomized and trained to only deliver the experimental treatment and the&#xD;
      other half the control intervention. Eligible participants will be recruited by Nutrition&#xD;
      Educators through existing SNAP-Ed community partnerships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once identified, eligible individuals will be screened for eligibility, consented, and&#xD;
      complete the baseline survey with a trained research assistant over the phone. Participants&#xD;
      who complete the baseline survey and meet survey plausibility checks will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. Their assignment to experimental or attention control condition is dependent upon the&#xD;
      Nutrition Educator's random assignment to teach experimental or attention control curriculum.&#xD;
      Recruitment materials and the bona fide treatment to be delivered to the attention control&#xD;
      group are designed to blind participant assignment to study condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a six-week virtual nutrition education program, with each weekly&#xD;
      session lasting approximately 30 minutes. Nutrition Educators will conduct the sessions over&#xD;
      video conferencing software (e.g., Zoom). Participants will receive intervention materials by&#xD;
      mail before the first class of the series and will have electronic access to the materials&#xD;
      through a free learning management system. After the six-week virtual nutrition education&#xD;
      program, participants will be invited to take the post survey over the telephone with a&#xD;
      trained research assistant. Approximately 4 to 10 weeks after participants complete the post&#xD;
      survey, they will be invited to take the follow-up survey to assess longer-term intervention&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant progress through the RCT will be monitored by tracking attendance at each&#xD;
      educational session. Trained research assistants and SNAP-Ed staff will be available to&#xD;
      answer questions throughout the study. Participants will receive modest stipends that&#xD;
      increase in value after they complete each survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HomeStyles-2 experimental group intervention materials (i.e., &quot;Healthy&quot; HomeStyles-2)&#xD;
      were designed to be congruent with White House and IOM recommendations for home-centered&#xD;
      obesity prevention interventions and critical elements for effective interventions (e.g.,&#xD;
      interventions are positive, culturally sensitive, supportive of parent-child interaction and&#xD;
      child development; develop realistic, effective plans that empower families). HomeStyles-2&#xD;
      for middle childhood intervention materials provide intensive, interactive, fun,&#xD;
      non-judgmental opportunities for parents to shape their home environments and lifestyle&#xD;
      practices to protect child health. They also promote positive strategies and changes that&#xD;
      adults can control in their environments to reduce risk of excessive weight gain in their&#xD;
      middle childhood youth. Key factors contributing to childhood obesity that can be suitably&#xD;
      addressed in the home environment with middle childhood kids identified for inclusion in the&#xD;
      intervention materials were selected using systematic literature reviews and input from&#xD;
      experts in childhood obesity prevention. The topics that emerged and will be covered in the&#xD;
      SNAP-Ed arm of the study include inadequate intake of fruits and vegetables, infrequent&#xD;
      family meals, excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, large portion sizes, and&#xD;
      irregular breakfast consumption. An additional factor was children's limited food preparation&#xD;
      skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The attention control group will receive a different but bona fide, credible treatment at the&#xD;
      same time as the experimental group. The control condition will provide information distinct&#xD;
      from the &quot;active&quot; ingredient in the experimental intervention, while still aligning with the&#xD;
      description of the study recruitment materials (i.e., to build happier, healthier families)&#xD;
      and adhering to the regulations governing educational content of SNAP-Ed programming. The&#xD;
      control condition materials are from the SNAP-Ed Eat Healthy, Be Active program and were&#xD;
      adapted to match the experimental intervention in number of sessions, length of sessions,&#xD;
      4-page informational guide, goal-setting activity, and incentive items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To adapt the experimental and control programs for virtual delivery, a Microsoft PowerPoint&#xD;
      presentation and script was created for each of the educational sessions. The scripts include&#xD;
      suggested questions and opportunities for Nutrition Educators to use to actively engage&#xD;
      participants in the session, such as by speaking, typing questions and comments in the chat&#xD;
      box, or using emojis to register reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study survey, &quot;Home Obesogenicity Measure of EnvironmentS&quot;-Families with School-age Kids&#xD;
      (HOMES-FSAK), will be used to collect baseline, post, and follow-up data in the HomeStyles-2&#xD;
      RCT. The Social Cognitive Theory along with the key concepts addressed in the HomeStyles-2&#xD;
      guides provided the framework for identification of cognitions, behaviors, and aspects of the&#xD;
      home environment to be assessed. The survey will collect sociodemographic characteristics of&#xD;
      the participant and child; child and participant health status; parent weight-related&#xD;
      cognitions; weight-related behaviors of the parent and child; and weight-related&#xD;
      characteristics of the home environment.&#xD;
