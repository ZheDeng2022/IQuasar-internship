    <textblock>
      The purpose of the protocol is to evaluate the long-term safety of medicine 177Lu-satoreotide&#xD;
      tetraxetan (also known as 177Lu-IPN01072 or 177Lu-OPS201) for patients who have previously&#xD;
      received 177Lu-satoreotide tetraxetan in the clinical study OPS-C-001 / D-FR-01072-001.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study qualifies as interventional not because of the use of an investigational product,&#xD;
      but because the imposed specific data collection includes assessments/blood collection and&#xD;
      on-site visits not necessarily part of routine clinical practice.&#xD;
