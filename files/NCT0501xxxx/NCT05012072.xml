  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will test an intervention called the Mastery Lifestyle&#xD;
      Intervention (the MLI) that was developed from data of 1000+pregnant Hispanic women related&#xD;
      to risks of preterm birth. The investigators will deliver a psychoeducational intervention&#xD;
      that is manualized over 6 group sessions in a prenatal care office. The investigators will&#xD;
      also have a usual care group that receives standard prenatal care. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      enroll 234 pregnant women and start the study with them at 14-20 weeks gestation. The&#xD;
      investigators will also test the biological response of the intervention by measuring&#xD;
      Corticotropin Releasing Hormone, progesterone, estriol, and test for cotinine. The&#xD;
      investigators will also determine any effect on infant outcomes at delivery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To address the gaps related to interventions for Hispanic Mexican American pregnant women,&#xD;
      the investigators have developed and successfully pilot tested the Mastery Lifestyle&#xD;
      Intervention (MLI): a culturally-relevant, manualized psychosocial group intervention that&#xD;
      integrates two evidence-based behavioral therapies - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)&#xD;
      and Problem-Solving Therapy (PST). The MLI is a 6-week program designed to be integrated into&#xD;
      regular prenatal care to facilitate more comprehensive care delivered by a nurse practitioner&#xD;
      (NP) or certified nurse midwife (CNM). We propose the following hypotheses for a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial: Hypothesis 1a: Participants in the 6-week MLI will have decreased&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, disengaged coping, and increased active coping compared&#xD;
      to UC at end-of-treatment and after 6 weeks. Hypothesis 1b: The effects of MLI versus UC on&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, stress, acculturative stress, and coping will be mediated via&#xD;
      psychological flexibility and moderated by acculturation. Hypothesis 2a: Compared to UC, MLI&#xD;
      participants will have significantly lower mean levels of CRH over time from baseline to&#xD;
      end-of-treatment. Hypothesis 2b: Compared to UC, MLI participants will have significantly&#xD;
      higher progesterone levels and lower estriol levels (higher progesterone/estriol ratios) over&#xD;
      time from baseline to end-of-treatment. Hypothesis 3: As compared to UC, infants from mothers&#xD;
      in the MLI group will have longer gestational age, greater birth weight, and fewer NICU&#xD;
      admissions.&#xD;
