      This study is a randomized clinical trial designed to test a novel financial navigation&#xD;
      intervention. The study assesses the impact of the financial navigation intervention on&#xD;
      financial hardship and health-related quality of life, cancer-related material and&#xD;
      psychological financial hardship, patient-centered communication, and time to initiation of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to half of people with cancer experience financial hardship. Cancer-related financial&#xD;
      hardship is associated with several adverse intermediate and health outcomes, including poor&#xD;
      quality of life, treatment non-adherence, and lower survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational evidence suggests that communication about financial concerns and out-of-pocket&#xD;
      (OOP) costs early in the treatment trajectory and in partnership with the care team could&#xD;
      help to prevent or lessen financial hardship. This type of communication could be delivered&#xD;
      through patient navigation programs and is consistent with both patient and care team&#xD;
      preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, to date there is no evidence from randomized trials showing the impact of financial&#xD;
      navigation during the active treatment on financial hardship. Further, no intervention-based&#xD;
      studies have provided evidence on the most effective ways to mitigate cancer-related&#xD;
      financial hardship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As costs of cancer care in U.S. have risen over time, so has the burden of out-of-pocket&#xD;
      (OOP) costs and indirect costs such as travel, employment changes, and caregiver costs. These&#xD;
      cumulative costs pose increased financial risk for people diagnosed with cancer. Despite a&#xD;
      patient's health insurance status, financial hardship from cancer care is prevalent: 47%-49%&#xD;
      of cancer survivors report financial hardship and 12%-62% of cancer survivors report debt due&#xD;
      to treatment costs. Financial hardship is associated with decreased treatment initiation and&#xD;
      adherence, poor symptoms and quality of life, and increased mortality risk, so preventing or&#xD;
      mitigating its effects is a clinical imperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integration of cost of cancer care information into conversations between patients and&#xD;
      clinicians can optimize medical decision-making and reduce the risk of financial hardship,&#xD;
      and is consistent with high-quality cancer care and patient preferences. Patient&#xD;
      understanding of OOP costs can assist with planning and budgeting, and can facilitate early&#xD;
      connection with financial support services that may help to mitigate the financial burden of&#xD;
      cancer care. Yet, less than one in five patients report having cost discussions.&#xD;
      Consequently, many patients are uninformed about the costs of their cancer care and face&#xD;
      unexpected OOP costs, with important consequences for material (e.g., debt), psychological&#xD;
      (e.g., cost-related distress), and behavioral (e.g. treatment adherence) financial hardship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an urgent need for evidence-based interventions on how to prevent or mitigate&#xD;
      financial hardship for people with cancer. While the extent of financial hardship as a&#xD;
      toxicity of cancer care is increasingly well-documented, there is limited evidence to date as&#xD;
      to what types of interventions can mitigate or prevent financial hardship due to cancer care.&#xD;
      Policy, societal, and organizational-level interventions, such as those focused on bending&#xD;
      the curve of rising health care cost or improving price transparency to ordering providers&#xD;
      are all needed, but these may take a long time or show limited effect. In the meantime,&#xD;
      patients continue to need assistance navigating, managing and anticipating OOP costs, and&#xD;
      patient- and team level-interventions such as the CAFÉ study may hold promise for this&#xD;
      purpose.&#xD;

It is scored to a 10-point scale, where 1 is &quot;Overwhelming financial distress/lowest financial well-being,&quot; and 10 is &quot;No financial distress/highest financial well-being.&quot; It has been validated in multiple populations and national norms are provided.</description>
