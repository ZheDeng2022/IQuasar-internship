  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of intraoral cryotherapy on the inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine levels during root canal treatment and postoperative pain intensity and incidence.&#xD;
      Mandibular premolar teeth of 30 patients diagnosed with asymptomatic apical periodontitis&#xD;
      will be included to the study for this purpose. The experimental protocols consist clinical&#xD;
      and laboratory phases. In clinical phase, procedures of cryotherapy and control groups will&#xD;
      be applied in 2-visit-root canal treatment. The samples, which were collected during root&#xD;
      canal treatment, will be subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis in&#xD;
      laboratory. Levels of interleukin and inflammatory destructive enzymes will be determined in&#xD;
      collected samples. During the analysis of visual analogue scale scores, the correlation&#xD;
      between the changes of the cytokine and proteolytic enzyme levels and presence and intensity&#xD;
      of pain will be evaluated.&#xD;

      Cryotherapy is the reduction of the temperature of living tissues for therapeutic purposes.&#xD;
      The temperature decrease that will occur as a result of cryotherapy depends on the degree of&#xD;
      the applied tissue and agent, the application time, and the thermal permeability of the&#xD;
      tissues and the agent . With the application of cryotherapy in human tissues, it is aimed to&#xD;
      reduce the temperature of the host cells and control pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited data on the use of cryotherapy, which is widely used in medicine, in the&#xD;
      field of operative dentistry. It is frequently used after surgical procedures such as&#xD;
      cryotherapy, periodontal surgery, tooth extraction and implant application, but its first use&#xD;
      in endodontics is to extend the cold saline solution of during root canal treatment. It has&#xD;
      been described in laboratory studies that it reduces the external temperature of the root by&#xD;
      applying it with apical negative pressure irrigation system for 5 minutes following the&#xD;
      procedures. Following this in vitro study, the efficacy of different cryotherapy protocols in&#xD;
      reducing pain after root canal treatment was reported by all of the few clinical studies.&#xD;
      Studies reported that after endodontic treatment of teeth with symptomatic apical&#xD;
      periodontitis, pain severity decreased after cryotherapy application and the frequency of&#xD;
      postoperative painkiller use of patients decreased. It was reported that cryotherapy&#xD;
      application in endodontic treatments of teeth with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with&#xD;
      vital pulp reduced postoperative pain severity. A laboratory study performed on extracted&#xD;
      teeth reported that cryotherapy application reduces the vertical fracture strength of the&#xD;
      roots, however, comprehensive laboratory and clinical studies evaluating the various physical&#xD;
      properties of the teeth are required in order to make definitive interpretations concerning&#xD;
      the clinic and to create a consensus.It has not been fully revealed how and by what mechanism&#xD;
      intra-canal cryotherapy applications reduce pain. When cold is applied, a decrease in blood&#xD;
      flow occurs in living tissues; It has been shown that neural receptors are inhibited in skin&#xD;
      and subcutaneous tissues. Clinical studies report that cold therapy reduces acute&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain, muscle spasms, connective tissue strains, nerve conduction time, and&#xD;
      hemorrhage. Cryotherapy restricts the inflammatory reactions that occur in the damaged area&#xD;
      by causing vasoconstriction and inhibition of cellular metabolism. Vasoconstriction thus&#xD;
      causes a decrease in edema and blockage of nerve endings with the decrease in temperature&#xD;
      leads to a decrease in pain. Although decreasing body temperature also decreases peripheral&#xD;
      nerve conduction, when it falls below 15 ° C, nerve conduction is completely deactivated.&#xD;
      Tissue damage that may result from secondary hypoxia is also minimized by slowing down cell&#xD;
      metabolism. The activities and amounts of destructive enzymes in the tissue are reduced. The&#xD;
      analgesic effect of cryotherapy is achieved by a combination of reducing the chemical&#xD;
      mediators of pain and slowing down neural pain signals. In addition, a 50% slowdown in&#xD;
      metabolism has a positive effect on oxygen diffusion in damaged tissues. How intra-canal&#xD;
      cryotherapy reduces postoperative endodontic pain has not been fully elucidated yet. When the&#xD;
      effects of cryotherapy applications on damaged muscle and connective tissues are interpreted,&#xD;
      a decrease in the amount of inflammatory cytokines is expected in a region where cryotherapy&#xD;
      is applied. The amounts of inflammatory cytokines and destructive enzymes in periradicular&#xD;
      tissues were not evaluated after intra-canal cryotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-canal cryotherapy stands out as a simple, economical and non-toxic pain control&#xD;
      technique, although it eliminates the side effects that may be caused by drugs by reducing&#xD;
      the use of painkillers after the procedure. It is a technique that should be applied rather&#xD;
      than an alternative, especially for patients who are recommended to avoid painkiller use&#xD;
      (drug allergy, geriatric population). It consists of washing the root canals with cold saline&#xD;
      solution for 5 minutes, which can be easily adapted to the endodontic treatment routine. This&#xD;
      procedure can be applied with negative pressure irrigation systems or endodontic irrigation&#xD;
      needles used in routine irrigation. It is a more practical and controlled procedure than&#xD;
      applying an ice pack inside or outside the mouth after the procedure, and it will be applied&#xD;
      by the physician.&#xD;
