  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ACTION Teens is a multinational cross-sectional survey-based study. The study consists of a&#xD;
      quantitative online survey to be conducted among three groups of respondents in ten countries&#xD;
      worldwide. The respondent population will include Adolescents Living with Obesity (ALwO),&#xD;
      Caregivers of ALwO, and HCPs treating adolescents who have obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to provide insights to drive awareness around the needs of&#xD;
      adolescents living with obesity and their caregivers, as well as to identify key areas of&#xD;
      misalignment between adolescents, their caregivers and the HCPs involved in obesity treatment&#xD;
      and management. ACTION Teens is designed to generate evidence to identify and address these&#xD;
      challenges on both a global and local level, extending the insights from the previously&#xD;
      conducted ACTION-IO study.&#xD;
