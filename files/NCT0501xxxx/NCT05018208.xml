      This study investigates a device that closely monitors vital signs, as well as a smartphone&#xD;
      application (app) that allows patients to respond to different questions and tests that will&#xD;
      monitor for new symptoms. This study may help researchers understand if wearing the device is&#xD;
      a better tool than standard vital sign assessment tools done only while at the doctor's&#xD;
      office or hospital, and if using the smartphone app is a better tool than standard assessment&#xD;
      tools used while in the doctor's office or hospital.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Develop patient-specific algorithms to predict the trajectory of cytokine release syndrome&#xD;
      (CRS) and or neurotoxicity and time to escalation of medical intervention is needed. (Arm 1)&#xD;
      II. Establish the validity for the use of mobile technology to assess neurologic symptoms&#xD;
      remotely. (Arm 1) III. Compare the time to escalation of potential medical intervention&#xD;
      between remote monitoring (RM) and standard care (SC) based on retrospective analysis of&#xD;
      clinical trial data. (Arm 1) IV. Establish the feasibility for the use of wearable device for&#xD;
      continuous, remote monitoring of physiologic parameters by quantifying false alerts and&#xD;
      downstream clinical actions. (Arm 1) V. Define the range of physiologic variables associated&#xD;
      with receipt of radiation and chemotherapy. (Arm 2) VI. Correlate PROs and physician rated&#xD;
      CTCAE to biologic parameters. (Arm 2) VII. Establish the feasibility for the use of wearable&#xD;
      device for continuous, remote monitoring of physiologic parameters by quantifying false&#xD;
      alerts and downstream clinical actions. (Arm 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 1: Patients undergoing CAR-T therapy use the Biofourmis wearable device(s) and smartphone&#xD;
      app to answer a series of questions about health and neurologic symptoms a few times a day&#xD;
      for 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2: Patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT) for head and neck, lung, or&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancers use the Biofourmis wearable device(s) for 90 days after completion&#xD;
      of RT. Patients also use the smartphone app to answer a series of questions about health and&#xD;
      neurologic symptoms before start of RT, after completion of RT, 3 months after completion of&#xD;
      RT, and 1 year after completion of RT. In addition, patients complete weekly questionnaires&#xD;
      regarding side effects and tolerance of the device.&#xD;
