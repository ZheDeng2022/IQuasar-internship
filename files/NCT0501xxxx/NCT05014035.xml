  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptom burden remains a critical concern for individuals with non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) following the completion of treatment. Of those, symptom clusters such as dyspnea&#xD;
      (shortness of breath) and fatigue, contribute to physical decline, reductions in quality of&#xD;
      life, and a higher risk of comorbidities and mortality. It has been proposed that dyspnea is&#xD;
      a primary limiter of exercise capacity in individuals with lung cancer, resulting in exercise&#xD;
      avoidance and an accelerated physical decline. As such, specifically designing resistance&#xD;
      exercise programs with cluster sets, to mitigate feelings of dyspnea and fatigue may result&#xD;
      in improved exercise tolerance, resulting in the maintenance of physical function and quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a&#xD;
      hybrid-delivery of home-based cluster-set resistance exercise in individuals with NSCLC.&#xD;
      Methods: Individuals with NSCLC (n=15), within 12-months of completion of treatment will be&#xD;
      recruited to participate in this single arm feasibility trial. Participants will complete&#xD;
      8-weeks of home-based resistance training (RT) designed to target dyspnea and fatigue. The&#xD;
      hybrid-delivery of the program will include supervised sessions in the participants home, and&#xD;
      virtual supervision via video conferencing. The primary outcome of feasibility will be&#xD;
      measured via recruitment rates, retention, acceptability and intervention fidelity.&#xD;
      Exploratory outcomes (dyspnea, fatigue, quality of life, physical function and body&#xD;
      composition) will be assessed pre- and post- intervention.&#xD;

      Analysis plan. Descriptive statistics (percentages and means (with standard deviations)) will&#xD;
      be used to report on feasibility outcomes (recruitment, retention, fidelity etc.). Unless&#xD;
      explicitly stated, means and standard deviations will be reported for assessments of&#xD;
      exploratory outcomes at baseline and follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Exercise fidelity will be reported using metrics previously outlines by Fairman et al (2019). Specifically, volume load will be calculated as a function of sets x reps for each exercise and summed to give total volume for each session. We will report the proportion of volume achieved relevant to what was prescribed to give a &quot;relative-dose intensity&quot; (RDI) for each person. RDI will then be averaged and used to determine fidelity to the RT intervention.</description>
