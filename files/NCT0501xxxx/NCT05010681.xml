      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lenvatinib plus&#xD;
      Sintilimab in patients with advanced liver cancer progressed after treatment with immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There is a need for options to address progressed liver cancer after the treatment of immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Sintilimab and lenvatinib are active as monotherapies liver&#xD;
      cancer; Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of lenvatinib combined with&#xD;
      sintilimab in the treatment of these patients.&#xD;
