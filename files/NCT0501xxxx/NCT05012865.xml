    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, non-interventional, retrospective, medical chart review of&#xD;
      patients with metastatic renal cell cancer(mRCC) treated with avelumab plus axitinib as a&#xD;
      first-line therapy in Japan between 20 December 2019 and 20 December 2020. All decisions&#xD;
      regarding clinical management and treatment of the participating patients were made by the&#xD;
      investigator as part of standard care in real-world clinical setting and were not contingent&#xD;
      upon the patient's participation in the study. Data will be collected if available per study&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
