      To evaluate the effect of daily consumption of a combination of garlic and onion extracts on&#xD;
      the intestinal microbiota and the production of short chain fatty acids in elderly healthy&#xD;
      volunteers living in a residence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likewise, any incident related to health that occurred during that period will be noted.&#xD;

      This study is a continuation of another (C002, registration number NCT04647071).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers from study C002 were invited to participate in this new study and, by the end&#xD;
      of C002, all gave 2 stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4 weeks of washout, the control group volunteers in C002 will begin consuming 1 capsule&#xD;
      per day of garlic and onion extract after lunch. The intervention group volunteers in C002&#xD;
      will not consume anything.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 36 weeks any incident related to the health of the volunteers will be noted. Likewise,&#xD;
      during this time, the volunteers will maintain their lifestyle and eating habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 36 weeks, 2 stool samples will be taken from all volunteers.&#xD;
