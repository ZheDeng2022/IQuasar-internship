  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pragmatic trial compares the effectiveness of virtual culinary medicine classes vs.&#xD;
      standard of care medical nutrition visits to improve glycemic control in patients with&#xD;
      uncontrolled type 2 diabetes . Culinary medicine teaches healthy eating principles through a&#xD;
      combination of experiential cooking classes and focused didactic sessions. The primary study&#xD;
      outcome is glycemic improvement (A1c). Qualitative evaluation will assess participant&#xD;
      experience, impact, and durability of behavior changes related to nutrition. A short term&#xD;
      cost analysis will be conducted to inform program costs and cost effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 130 participants with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes will be recruited from a&#xD;
      safety-net health system that provides comprehensive care for the uninsured and underinsured&#xD;
      residents of Dallas County, Texas. Eligible participants will be actively engaged in primary&#xD;
      care and recruited from clinical practice. Participants will be randomized to two arms:&#xD;
      Culinary Medicine and standard of care medical nutrition therapy (MNT). Certified culinary&#xD;
      medicine instructors will deliver a series of 6 monthly Culinary Medicine classes virtually&#xD;
      with participants cooking in their own homes. A series of 6 standard of care medical&#xD;
      nutrition sessions will be delivered by the health system using a combination of individual&#xD;
      and group sessions both in person and virtually. All participants will be enrolled in a 12&#xD;
      month food assistance program in partnership with community based partners to provide access&#xD;
      to healthy foods. Classes will be delivered over 6 months, and participants will be followed&#xD;
      for an additional 6 months to assess the durability of glycemic response and behavior&#xD;
      changes. A cost analysis will examine the system cost to deliver the intervention and the&#xD;
      short term cost effectiveness examining the cost per participant achieving a clinically&#xD;
      meaningful reduction in A1c.&#xD;

Change in A1c will be assessed at 6 months (end of active intervention) and also at 12 months (i.e. 6 months after completion of active intervention) to assess the durability of the intervention on glycemic control. Pre-specified subgroup analyses will also examine A1c outcomes by: 1) prior participation in diabetes education and nutrition education. Stratified analyses by number of sessions attended will also be conducted.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the Culinary Medicine intervention will complete a series of 6 virtual culinary medicine cooking classes (1 class per month for 6 months). Virtual sessions will be delivered via Zoom using a combination of large group instruction and small group break-out sessions in which participants prepare a recipe in their home kitchen with the virtual assistance from trained group facilitators. After preparing the dish, participants will enjoy the dish they prepared and report-back to the large group about their dish and experience. Classes will be conducted in English and Spanish with language-concordant instructors and facilitators.</description>
