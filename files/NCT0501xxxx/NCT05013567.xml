      Phase III clinical trial, multicentre of superiority, randomized, double-blind, parallel&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed for the relief of acute musculoskeletal pain, characterized by pain in&#xD;
      muscles, ligaments, tendons, and nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is performed in participants of both sexes, over 18 years of age, who have pain of&#xD;
      moderate intensity as a result of ankle sprains, upper limb contusions, thigh muscle strains,&#xD;
      or torticollis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for studying the topical use of ibuprofen is the possibility of an alternative&#xD;
      treatment for musculoskeletal pain, avoiding systemic adverse events caused by oral&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of participants achieving at least 50% pain reduction on day 5 of treatment by assessing pain intensity using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), compared to baseline VAS.
