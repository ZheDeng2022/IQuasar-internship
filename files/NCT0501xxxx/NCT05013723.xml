  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is now recognized that many patients who develop symptomatic COVID-19 infection continue&#xD;
      to suffer from a variety of symptoms that persist well after the acute syndrome. This has&#xD;
      been called post-acute COVID-19 (PACS), or &quot;long COVID&quot; syndrome. In a meta-analysis of&#xD;
      studies of hospitalized patients, 70% of patients reported PACS symptoms 60 days after&#xD;
      diagnosis. Patients with non-severe COVID-19 appear to have lower rates of PACS symptoms,&#xD;
      although a recent study suggested that at 4 months follow-up, 28% of patients still reported&#xD;
      at least one symptom. PACS is associated with significant morbidity, decreased quality of&#xD;
      life, mental and behavioral health impact and healthcare cost. Neither the pathophysiology&#xD;
      nor risk factors for PACS are well-understood and further research is needed to characterize&#xD;
      this syndrome. Some studies have suggested that age, female gender, obesity, comorbid burden,&#xD;
      symptoms at diagnosis and hospitalization during acute COVID-19 increase risk for PACS.&#xD;
      Because of the significant overall impact of PACS, there is significant interest in&#xD;
      identifying therapies to prevent this condition. Early neutralizing therapy with&#xD;
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) addresses the initial phase of disease and has&#xD;
      now been shown to be effective at decreasing viral load and preventing progression to severe&#xD;
      disease, hospitalization and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding how MAb therapy may impact PACS symptoms is important to determining usage and&#xD;
      value of these products and an important contribution to our understanding of how to prevent&#xD;
      PACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective electronic survey using matched case-control design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Use the Intermountain real-world MAb-treatment registry and control group to&#xD;
      prospectively evaluate PACS symptoms at least 120 days after initial COVID-19 diagnosis. Aim&#xD;
      1: Determine whether ambulatory patients who received monoclonal antibody infusion for early&#xD;
      symptomatic COVID-19 have fewer persistent symptoms of post-acute COVID-19 (&quot;long COVID&quot;)&#xD;
      syndrome at least 120 days after initial diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: MAb therapy is associated with significantly less post-acute COVID-19 (PACS)&#xD;
      symptoms at 120 days post diagnosis Aim 2: Explore predictors associated with PACS symptoms&#xD;
      in high risk patients Hypothesis: Hospitalization, age, obesity, number of comorbidities and&#xD;
      symptoms at diagnosis predict PACS&#xD;
