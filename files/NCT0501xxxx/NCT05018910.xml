  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to monitor heart rate variability in preterm infants receiving&#xD;
      respiratory support, including conventional mechanical ventilation, during skin-to-skin care.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that skin to skin care will be associated with a more mature pattern of&#xD;
      parasympathetic activity as measured by various domains of heart rate variability.&#xD;
      Specifically, the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal interval (SDNN), the root mean&#xD;
      squared of successive differences of normal-to-normal intervals (RMSDD), and the standard&#xD;
      deviation of deceleration (SDDec) will decrease in infants that are receiving skin-to-skin&#xD;
      care across all types of respiratory support compared to infants who are lying in their&#xD;
      isolette.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective crossover study, with each infant serving as their own control.&#xD;
      Any infant for whom the parent has consented to participate in the study will have heart rate&#xD;
      variability leads applied and be monitored before, during and after a skin-to-skin session&#xD;
      with the infant's parent. Due to the nature of the study, blinding is not feasible. Infants&#xD;
      will remain on the hospital cardiac monitor during the study to maintain standard of care,&#xD;
      and data obtained in this study will not be used for clinical care. All sessions will occur&#xD;
      during the infant's NICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will be screened for eligibility by reviewing the Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU)&#xD;
      census daily. Consent will be obtained after an infant has delivered. No pregnant women will&#xD;
      be approached for consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any infant who has been consented for participation and completes at least 1 skin to skin&#xD;
      session will be included in the final study sample. As skin to skin is part of standard of&#xD;
      care, and information, aside from gender, will not be obtained from the parent, consent will&#xD;
      be obtained for the infant to participate in the study.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Infants born preterm are eligible for study inclusion if they meet the above criteria.&#xD;
      </textblock>
    </study_pop>
    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants must be less than or equal to 30 weeks gestational age at time of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both inborn and outborn infants are eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants must be less than 6 weeks postnatal age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants must have had a cranial ultrasound with results showing no intraventricular&#xD;
             severe intraventricular hemorrhage (Grade III or IV) [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants must require respiratory support at the time of the first session. This will&#xD;
             include mechanical ventilation, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV),&#xD;
             continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or low flow&#xD;
             nasal cannula (LFNC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consenting biological or legal adoptive mother of the infant must speak English. If&#xD;
             the study is unable to enroll an appropriate number of patients, will consider&#xD;
             including non-English speaking patients. However, due to limited resources for this&#xD;
             study, we will start with only English-speaking patients. Biological or legal adoptive&#xD;
             mother will provide consent for the infant to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biological or legal adoptive fathers of the infant are eligible to complete skin to&#xD;
             skin sessions with the infant. As we are not collecting any information from the&#xD;
             father, and skin to skin is a part of accepted standard of care, consent will not be&#xD;
             obtained from the father.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants of employees are eligible to participate. Undue influence or coercion will not&#xD;
             be applied to infants of employees and participation or lack thereof will not affect&#xD;
             employment status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants who have not received a head ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants with grade III or higher intraventricular hemorrhage identified on a head&#xD;
             ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants on high frequency ventilation, due to the artifact transmitted to ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants with known genetic disorders or known prenatal chromosomal anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants with one or more major congenital anomaly.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants undergoing active sepsis evaluation or treatment for infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants on blood pressure or cardiac medications or infusions including inotropic&#xD;
             mediations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mothers (biological or legal adoptive) that are &lt;18 years of age will not be&#xD;
             approached for consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mothers (biological or legal adoptive) who are unable to provide consent due to having&#xD;
             a legal representative will not be approached for consent in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mothers (biological or legal adoptive) who are prisoners will not be approached for&#xD;
             this study as participation requires multiple skin to skin session with the infant&#xD;
