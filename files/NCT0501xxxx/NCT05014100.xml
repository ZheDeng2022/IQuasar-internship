    <textblock>
      Obrutinib is a highly selective BTKi and has shown efficacy in CLL/MCL. This study aims to&#xD;
      investigate the initial efficacy and safety of obrutinib combined with R2 regimen in the&#xD;
      treatment of relapsed or refractory CD20+B cell lymphoma&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a member of the TEC family of non-receptor tyrosine proteins,&#xD;
      is expressed in B lymphocytes, mast cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, etc., and is&#xD;
      a key molecule in the signaling of B cell antigen receptor (BCR). The development and&#xD;
      differentiation of B cells can be controlled by activating positive cell cycle regulators and&#xD;
      differentiated cytokines, and the survival and proliferation of B cells can be controlled by&#xD;
      regulating the expression of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins. BTK inhibitors&#xD;
      inhibit B cell maturation and activation by targeting the BCR signaling pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with other BTK inhibitors, orelabrutinib is highly selective. Previous studies&#xD;
      showed that among 456 tested kinases, the inhibition rate of orelabrutinib only exceeded 90%&#xD;
      at 1µM concentration, which is the BTK inhibitor with the highest kinase selectivity reported&#xD;
      so far. It has shown a good safe treatment window in animal models, and its pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      properties are far superior to those of ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Phase I dose exploration study of orelabrutinib in Australia, the single dose was from&#xD;
      20mg/ day to 400mg/ day, and the continuous dose was from 100mg/ day to 200mg/ day. No&#xD;
      serious adverse events related to the drug occurred, and no dosion-limiting toxicity was&#xD;
      found. The main adverse reactions were headache, intubation pain, fatigue, etc. Most of them&#xD;
      were mild and generally well tolerated, providing a reference for the selection of subsequent&#xD;
      clinical drug dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I/II clinical trials of orelabrutinib for MCL and CLL/SLL have been conducted in more&#xD;
      than 20 centers across the country. Based on preliminary results observed in Phase I,&#xD;
      obrutinib has demonstrated excellent safety and tolerability in patients with relapsed&#xD;
      refractory MCL and CLL/SLL. Most of the adverse reactions were grade 1-2. Good results have&#xD;
      been observed early on in patients. Good pharmacokinetic/pharmacokinetic properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that ibrutinib combined with lenalidomide and rituximab improves&#xD;
      survival in patients with relapsed refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In addition,&#xD;
      ibrutinib combined with lenalidomide and rituximab has been included in the expert&#xD;
      recommendation of multiple relapsed and refractory B-cell lymphomas in the 2021CSCO Lymphoma&#xD;
      Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, orelabrutinib and lenalidomide combined with rituximab demonstrated good&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of relapsed refractory B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
      Moreover,orelabrutinib has better selectivity than ibrutinib, so we believe that&#xD;
      orelabrutinib combined with lenalidomide and rituximab (OR2) may have better efficacy in the&#xD;
      treatment of relapsed and refractory B-cell lymphoma, and there is no research report on this&#xD;
      regimen. The application of this regimen may bring new hope for relapsed refractory B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;
