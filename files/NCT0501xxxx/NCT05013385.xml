  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults, between 18 and 75 years of age, who have narrowings in the&#xD;
      small bowel (strictures) due to Crohn's disease. Strictures can lead to bowel obstruction&#xD;
      (blockage). People whose symptoms got worse because of strictures can join the study.&#xD;
      Participants get standard treatment for Crohn's disease and the strictures. The purpose of&#xD;
      the study is to test whether the strictures improve further when treated with a medicine&#xD;
      called spesolimab added to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are in the study for about 1 year and 4 months. In the first 3 months,&#xD;
      participants get standard treatment only. After 3 months, participants whose condition&#xD;
      improved are put into 2 groups randomly, which means by chance. One group gets spesolimab&#xD;
      added to their standard treatment. The other group gets placebo added to their standard&#xD;
      treatment. Both spesolimab and placebo are given as infusions into a vein. Placebo infusions&#xD;
      look like spesolimab infusions but do not contain any medicine. For the first 2 months,&#xD;
      participants get the infusions every month. Thereafter, participants get the infusions every&#xD;
      2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants have about 11 visits to the study site. The doctors regularly&#xD;
      check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects. At 3 of the visits, doctors&#xD;
      take images of the bowel using Magnetic Resonance Imaging and with an endoscope. At these&#xD;
      visits, the doctors also take a small sample of bowel tissue (biopsy). The participants note&#xD;
      their symptoms of Crohn's disease and how the symptoms affect daily life in an electronic&#xD;
      diary. At the end of the study, results from the diaries and bowel imaging are compared&#xD;
      between the spesolimab group and the placebo group.&#xD;
