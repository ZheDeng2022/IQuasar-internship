  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a descriptive, retrospective, chart-review study where the study's primary goal is to&#xD;
      use the vital statics data and other related information to support a comprehensive&#xD;
      assessment of survival for all Thymidine Kinase 2 deficiency (TK2d) subjects who have been&#xD;
      treated with pyrimidine nucleos(t)ides (chemical-grade dCMP/dTMP,&#xD;
      deoxycytidine/deoxythymidine (dC/dT), and/or MT1621), worldwide, compared to an untreated&#xD;
      control group by combining this study's data with the treated and untreated TK2d populations,&#xD;
      respectively, in other MT1621 program studies. The data from the treated subjects in this&#xD;
      study will be added to the treated population from the MT1621 combined studies. The data from&#xD;
      the untreated subjects in this study will be added to the untreated control group which&#xD;
      consist of subjects from natural history studies and other published literature. The&#xD;
      secondary goals of this study will focus on describing the treated subject's clinical course&#xD;
      and treatment experience.&#xD;

        It is estimated that medical records from approximately 30 to 50 subjects with TK2&#xD;
        deficiency will be reviewed. The final number of subjects to be included will be determined&#xD;
        based on available medical records obtained within the timeframe of the estimated duration&#xD;
        of the study.&#xD;
