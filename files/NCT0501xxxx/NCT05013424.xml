  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperfunctional facial lines that develop from repeated facial expression, such as glabellar&#xD;
      lines (GL), are typically treated by selectively weakening specific muscles with small&#xD;
      quantities of botulinum toxin. BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA) was first approved for aesthetic&#xD;
      treatment of glabellar lines in 2001 and is one of the most common nonsurgical procedures in&#xD;
      aesthetic medicine. This is a proof-of-concept study to evaluate how safe this new OnabotA X&#xD;
      formulation is in treating adult participants with GL .&#xD;
&#xD;
      OnabotA X is an onabotulinumtoxinA investigational product being developed for the treatment&#xD;
      of moderate to severe glabellar lines (GL). This is a 180-day, open-label study to assess the&#xD;
      safety of OnabotA X in adult subjects with moderate to severe GL. Around 90 participants will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study in approximately 5 sites in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive one dose of OnabotA X administered as 5 injections on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their&#xD;
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular weekly visits during the study at a&#xD;
      hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood&#xD;
      tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a casual relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of the study. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event, that based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent adverse events/ treatment emergent serious adverse events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of the study drug.</description>
