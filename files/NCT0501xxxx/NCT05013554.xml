      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 (Dose Escalation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the MTD/maximum administered dose (MAD) of SAR443216 administered as a&#xD;
           single agent in participants with HER2 expressing solid tumors and determine the RP2D in&#xD;
           the dose escalation part.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum lead-in dose and the recommended target dose for phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of SAR443216&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 (Dose expansion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess preliminary clinical activity of single agent SAR4443216 at the RP2D in&#xD;
      participants with HER2 expressing solid tumors, with various levels of HER2 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess preliminary clinical activity of single agent SAR443216 at the R2PD in&#xD;
      participants with HER2 expressing solid tumors, with various levels of HER2 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the safety of SAR443216&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 and 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR443216 when administered as a&#xD;
           single agent&#xD;

      The expected duration of study intervention for participants may vary, based on progression&#xD;
      date; median expected duration of study per participant is estimated to be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  7.5 months (up to 1 month for screening, a median of 3.5 months for treatment, and a&#xD;
           median of 3 months for long term follow-up) in escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  9.5 months (up to 1 month for screening, a median of 5.5 months for treatment, and a&#xD;
           median of 3 months for long term follow-up) in expansion.&#xD;
