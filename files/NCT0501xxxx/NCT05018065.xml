      With identifying a new type of coronavirus, the infection disease known as Coronavirus&#xD;
      disease-2019 (Covid-19) is still effective worldwide. Within the frame of the description&#xD;
      that the health is &quot;a complete physical, mental and social welfare,&quot; many physical and mental&#xD;
      modality may be expected due to the pandemic and the measures against pandemic. Among them,&#xD;
      sexual health is one of the basic indicative factors of human welfare. There are few data on&#xD;
      sexual dysfunctions from the previous clinic pandemic experiences. From the very early stages&#xD;
      of Covid-19 pandemic, health systems and researches focused on mortalities and short-term&#xD;
      morbidities. Although there are similar studies about effects of pandemic on sexual behaviors&#xD;
      of general community, there is no comparative study about the effects on sexual functions of&#xD;
      women survived from Covid-19 and women having no Covid-19 history, yet. This study aims to&#xD;
      compare women survived from Covid-19 and women having no Covid-19 history and having similar&#xD;
      characteristics in terms of sexual dysfunctions.&#xD;
