    <textblock>
      SPH3127-US-01 is a proof-of-concept multi-center, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      of of daily oral administration of SPH3127 or placebo for 8 weeks in patients with&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. After meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      eligible patients will be randomized to receive SPH3127 (50 mg daily, 50 mg twice daily) or&#xD;
      placebo tablets; all patients will take 2 tablets (SPH3127 or placebo) twice a day for 8&#xD;
      weeks. All randomized subjects will have the opportunity to enter an active-treatment&#xD;
      extension (50 mg SPH3127 once or twice daily) for an additional 10 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Female patients who have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and who agree to use&#xD;

             applicable) or who is post-menopausal (i.e., amenorrhea ≥ 1 year) or who have been&#xD;
             surgically sterilized.&#xD;
