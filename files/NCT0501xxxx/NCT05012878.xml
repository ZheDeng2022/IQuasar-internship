  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to better understand the influence of cardiovascular disease on&#xD;
      brain blood flow regulation and cognitive function, determine whether exercise-based cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation can lead to better regulation of brain blood flow that may help to improve or&#xD;
      maintain cognitive function, and determine whether exercise intensity influences changes in&#xD;
      brain blood flow regulation and cognitive function.&#xD;

      This study will investigate the influence of exercise training and intensity (as part of&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation) on improving cerebral blood flow regulation and cognitive function&#xD;
      following a cardiac event. This will be a randomized control trial, recruiting adults in&#xD;
      mid-life (years 40-65) with coronary artery disease, enrolling in cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      following a cardiac-related hospital admission. Patients that enroll in the Mayo Clinic&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation will be randomized 1:1 to high intensity interval training (HIIT) or&#xD;
      moderate intensity continuous training (MICT), with stratification for sex and coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass graft surgery. Patients that decline enrollment cardiac rehabilitation will&#xD;
      also be recruited as an observational control group, which will be matched to the&#xD;
      intervention groups by age decade, sex, BMI category, and surgical status. A healthy control&#xD;
      group without cardiovascular disease will also be recruited for baseline comparison of&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;

    <description>The main domains of cognitive function assessed using a neuropsychometric testing battery will be executive function, processing speed, and memory. Scores from these domains will be combined as the NIH Toolbox Fluid composite score, and assessed for change from baseline to follow-up.

    <description>Participants will receive exercise advice in line with usual hospital discharge procedures. This involves exercise physiologists providing verbal and written information on achieving the national physical activity guidelines (150min/week of moderate intensity exercise) 60 and range of movement exercises for surgical patients with sternotomy. However, no structured or supervised exercise training program or other contact with participants will be provided after hospital discharge, to reflect the usual care process for patients that decline cardiac rehabilitation.</description>
