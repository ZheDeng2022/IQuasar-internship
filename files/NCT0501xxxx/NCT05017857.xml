    <textblock>
      The objectives of this pilot project are to determine whether pairing rTMS with an&#xD;
      evidence-based PST intervention is acceptable to and feasible for individuals with executive&#xD;
      function deficits after stroke and whether rTMS enhances executive functioning and uptake of&#xD;
      the PST intervention to improve generalization of the PST strategy and support long-term goal&#xD;
      attainment. To achieve the objectives, the investigators propose two specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Establish the acceptability and feasibility of delivering up to 6 sessions of PST+&#xD;
      rTMS to individuals with executive function deficits ≥ 6 months post stroke. Hypothesis&#xD;
      1a:80% participants will complete 6 PST sessions. Hypothesis 1b: 1b: Participants who receive&#xD;
      rTMS directly prior to the PST intervention will report higher satisfaction with the overall&#xD;
      intervention compared to those who receive rTMS simultaneously with PST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Assess the initial efficacy of PST+rTMS for improving patient outcomes in individuals&#xD;
      with stroke. Hypothesis 2a Patients will demonstrate a significant increase in executive&#xD;
      functioning (ie. attention, immediate memory and cognitive flexibility and reasoning) as&#xD;
      measured by the Digit Span Test and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Hypothesis 2b: Patients will&#xD;
      achieve 80% of self-set goals. Hypothesis 2c: Patients will demonstrate a significant&#xD;
      increase in task-oriented coping skills as measured by the Brief Cope at 1-month post&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

      The investigators plan to conduct a small 2-group feasibility trial with assessment at&#xD;
      initial visit, final visit (visit 6) and 1 month post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods: The investigators will conduct a feasibility pilot trial of&#xD;
      PST+rTMS in 4 adults with chronic stroke --to assess if the intervention is acceptable to&#xD;
      (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8) and feasible for (sessions completed; percentage of&#xD;
      rTMS intensity reductions) individuals with executive function deficits after stroke and&#xD;
      whether rTMS enhances (1) attention and immediate memory (digit span), (2) cognitive&#xD;
      flexibility and reasoning (Wisconsin Card Sorting Task), and (3) uptake (uptake&#xD;
      questionnaire) of the PST intervention to improve, (4) self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy&#xD;
      Scale), (5) generalization (Goal Attainment Scaling-trained vs. untrained goals; Brief Cope)&#xD;
      of the PST strategy and support long-term goal attainment (Goal Attainment Scaling at 1&#xD;
      months). Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, completion of intervention and 1-months post.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 4 participants will be enrolled. The pilot data from this study will provide the&#xD;
      parameter estimates necessary to perform sample size determination for a future large&#xD;
      randomized control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: The PI will perform set-up and application of the TMS coil, and will&#xD;
      administer the assessments at baseline (visit 1- in person), completion of intervention&#xD;
      (visit 6-in person) and 1-months post intervention completion (via RedCap link that is&#xD;
      emailed to the participant or via phone call, participant's preference). All intervention&#xD;
      sessions will be audio-recorded to ensure fidelity. Data will be stored in RedCap database.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Description of Intervention: The intervention will consist of 6 sessions of PST(approximately&#xD;
      30 minutes each) that follow a structured format outlined in the PST manual. The&#xD;
      interventionist (Osborne, PI) will facilitate the participant's use of the steps of PST to&#xD;
      develop specific action plans to overcome barriers to goal attainment while the participant&#xD;
      receives rTMS or directly after the participant receives rTMS. The investigators will deliver&#xD;
      10 Hz of rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 80% RMT with trains of 5-s&#xD;
      duration (50 pulses per train), 25-s inter-train intervals, and a total of 40 trains (2000&#xD;
      pulses) for the first 20 minutes of the PST session using the MagPro x100-MagVenture rTMS&#xD;
      technology with a figure-8 coil.9 The optimal stimulation parameters in this population have&#xD;
      not been established. The investigators' intent is to excite the targeted neuro-circuitry,&#xD;
      therefore the investigators propose a frequency of 10Hz which has successfully stimulated the&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex in patients with stroke in multiple studies. A 2016 systematic review of&#xD;
      rTMS for the treatment of depression after stroke included 24 studies. Twenty-one of the&#xD;
      studies targeted the prefrontal cortex and 10 of the studies employed a frequency of ≥10Hz. A&#xD;
      pooled analysis (881 patients randomized to the experimental group) revealed a significant&#xD;
      difference in headache occurrence between the experimental (15 patients,1.7%) and control&#xD;
      groups (6 patients, 0.7%). There were no significant differences between groups for other&#xD;
      adverse events or withdrawals as a result of adverse events.Targeting method will use the&#xD;
      international 10-20 system to locate specific brain targets. This method has been validated&#xD;
      in use in TMS research, it maximizes targeting precision and individualizes to the subject&#xD;
      head size and shape. rTMS will be discontinued at 20 minutes regardless of PST session&#xD;
      length.&#xD;

    <measure>Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) item mean score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1 month followup</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome for acceptability is satisfaction, with a Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 item mean of &gt;3.5 as an indicator of high satisfaction. CSQ-8 is a standardized assessment of client satisfaction with an intervention. Scores range from 8-32. A higher scores indicates a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Changes in coping style as measured by the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced-Brief (Brief Cope)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1 month followup</time_frame>
    <description>To test the first hypothesis, the investigators will use intent-to-treat analyses to measure pre-post-test differences in coping between baseline and final intervention session using paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank test.&#xD;
The Brief Cope is a 28 item self-reported questionnaire that measures effective and ineffective ways to cope with life events that cause stress. The assessment measures the degree to which a person utilizes a specific coping strategy.</description>

    <description>To test the second hypothesis, the investigators will calculate the total percentage of attained goals (Goal Attainment Scaling outcome level &gt;&quot;as expected&quot;) out of all attempted goals for each participant.&#xD;
GAS is a method for developing patient-centered goals and measuring goal achievement. GAS has been found to be a valid, reliable and sensitive measure of goal attainment in an IRU population. GAS scale (-2, achieved less than expected outcome; -1, achieved somewhat less; 0, achieved expected level; +1, achieved somewhat more; +2, achieved much more)</description>

    <description>RepetiveTranscrainal Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS): rTMS is a non-invasive electromagnetic stimulation of the brain. A train of electric pulses is delivered at the same intensity over a set period of time to a targeted region of the brain. The current stimulates or suppresses neuronal activity based on the frequency and inter-train interval between the pulses.</description>

    <description>Problem-Solving Training (PST) is a metacognitive strategy training in which patients are guided through a process of conscious self-assessment resulting in problem identification, generation of solutions, development of specific goals and action plans, and evaluation and revision of plans as needed. PST thus helps to circumvent impulsive or unrealistic problem-solving attempts that lead to failure, discouragement, and feelings of helplessness.</description>
