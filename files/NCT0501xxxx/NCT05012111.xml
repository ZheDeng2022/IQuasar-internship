    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow failure diseases are rare. Much is known about the diseases at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis, but long-term data about the effects of the diseases and treatments are lacking.&#xD;
      Researchers want to better understand long-term outcomes in people with these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To follow people diagnosed with acquired or inherited bone marrow failure disease and study&#xD;
      the long-term effects of the disease and its treatments on organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People aged 2 years and older who have been diagnosed with acquired or inherited bone marrow&#xD;
      failure or Telomere Biology Disorder. First degree family members may also be able to take&#xD;
      part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests. They&#xD;
      may have a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration. For this, a large needle will be inserted in&#xD;
      the hip through a small cut. Marrow will be drawn from the bone. A small piece of bone may be&#xD;
      removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also be screened with some of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cheek swab or hair follicle sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine or saliva sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation by disease specialists (e.g., lung, liver, heart)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging scan of the chest&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver ultrasounds&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six-Minute Walk Test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung function test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be put into groups based on their disease. They will have visits every 1 to&#xD;
      3 years. At visits, they may repeat some screening tests. They may fill out yearly surveys&#xD;
      about their medicines, transfusions, pregnancy, bleeding, and so on. They may have other&#xD;
      specialized procedures, such as imaging scans and ultrasounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for up to 20 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site natural history study at the Clinical Center to prospectively follow&#xD;
      subjects with severe aplastic anemia, other acquired marrow failure syndromes, and inherited&#xD;
      marrow failure syndromes to study the biology and history of the disease and their long term&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. Patients will be assessed on a 1-2 year basis, depending on disease cohort&#xD;
      and clinical parameters. Family members of patients with either suspected or confirmed&#xD;
      inherited bone marrow failure will also be clinically assessed for the presence of bone&#xD;
      marrow failure and have genetic and other laboratory studies performed to confirm mutation&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
