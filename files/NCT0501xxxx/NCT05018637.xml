  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) are serious health problems.&#xD;
      Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has gained considerable attention to treat&#xD;
      osteoporosis and OVCFs because implanted healthy MSCs could be differentiated into&#xD;
      osteoblasts and reduce the susceptibility of fractures by facilitating new bone formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study compares teriparatide (PTH 1-34) injection to combined treatment with Wharton's&#xD;
      jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs) and teriparatide (PTH 1-34) in patients with OVCFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a randomized, open-label, phase 2 study.&#xD;
