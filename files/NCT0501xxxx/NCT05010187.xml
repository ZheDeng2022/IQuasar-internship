  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heavy alcohol use is a pressing public health issue that results in more negative&#xD;
      consequences for young adult women, despite them drinking at lower rates than their male&#xD;
      peers. However, particular groups of women, such as women who identify as lesbian and&#xD;
      bisexual (i.e., sexual minority women), evidence markedly higher rates of alcohol misuse as&#xD;
      well as negative consequences from this use. Sexual minority women are more likely to use&#xD;
      alcohol, do so at problematic levels, and to meet criteria for alcohol use disorders than&#xD;
      heterosexual women and sexual minority men. Despite these disparities, as well as evidence&#xD;
      that sexual minority women have unique mechanisms of risk (e.g., minority stress, social&#xD;
      context), there are currently no interventions designed to reduce alcohol misuse among sexual&#xD;
      minority women. This study represents the first attempt to design an in-person intervention&#xD;
      specifically tailored to sexual minority women, which will be accomplished through an&#xD;
      Intervention Mapping framework to identify behavioral determinants of their use (e.g.,&#xD;
      minority stress and distress; social context) and then map effective behavior change&#xD;
      strategies onto these determinants.&#xD;

      This particular study aim is devoted to the piloting of a brief motivational intervention to&#xD;
      reduce alcohol misuse and consequences among sexual minority women. The objective of this&#xD;
      study aim is to examine the preliminary feasibility and acceptability of the intervention&#xD;
      following treatment development and refinement. Participants will be randomized to a brief&#xD;
      intervention or an attention-matched control arm. Participants in both conditions will&#xD;
      complete: a baseline survey as well as a follow-up assessment at 1- and 4-months&#xD;
      post-intervention. The investigators hypothesize that the developed intervention will be&#xD;
      feasible (as indicated by the number of women eligible who consent, attend their intervention&#xD;
      session, and return for follow up). The investigators also hypothesize that the intervention&#xD;
      will be acceptable to sexual minority women. The investigators will also obtain preliminary&#xD;
      evidence of intervention efficacy in terms of alcohol use outcomes. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that participants in the intervention will report less frequent&#xD;
      heavy episodic drinking and fewer alcohol consequences post-intervention compared with those&#xD;
      in the control group.&#xD;
