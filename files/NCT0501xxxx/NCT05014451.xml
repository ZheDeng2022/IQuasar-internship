  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to identify the relation between pelvic alignment and standing&#xD;
      balance and also the relation between pelvic alignment and selective motor control in&#xD;
      children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, pelvic alignment of children with diplegia will be evaluated using the&#xD;
      Formetric instrument system. Their standing balance will be evaluated using the Biodex&#xD;
      balance system, while selective voluntary motor control of lower extremities will be assessed&#xD;
      using the Selective Control Assessment of the Lower Extremity scale (SCALE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be compared to find the correlation between pelvic alignment and standing&#xD;
      balance and the correlation between pelvic alignment and selective motor control. Results can&#xD;
      help clinicians to better address the problems of pelvic asymmetry in children with spastic&#xD;
      diplegia to improve their overall balance and functional abilities.&#xD;
