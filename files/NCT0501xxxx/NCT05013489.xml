  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic, many physicians have presented&#xD;
      burnout. A range of associated factors need to be considered for effective prevention and&#xD;
      intervention. Objective 1: To assess the association of burnout in medical doctors with&#xD;
      individual factors, self-reported medical errors, medical leave, and demands of the work&#xD;
      environment demand. Objective 2: to assess the effectiveness of a online mindfulness,&#xD;
      compassion and intercare based intervention to reduce burnout.&#xD;
