  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common complication of obesity patients. According to&#xD;
      previous literature reports, weight loss and metabolic surgery are powerful means to treat&#xD;
      obesity complicated with T2DM. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the standard operation&#xD;
      recommended by the international society. One-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) was&#xD;
      recommended by IFSO（the International Federation for the Surgery of OBESITY AND METABOLIC&#xD;
      DISORDERS ） in 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, two kinds of metabolic surgery will be compared. At present, focusing on the&#xD;
      above two operations, only two effective randomized controlled clinical studies have been&#xD;
      carried out, among which one single-center clinical study has been followed up for 2 years,&#xD;
      and the primary end point is weight loss; Another multicenter study, with a 2-year follow-up,&#xD;
      showed that the primary end point was weight loss, and the secondary index was the&#xD;
      effectiveness of two surgical methods in the treatment of T2DM.There is still a lack of&#xD;
      evidence-based evidence for the effectiveness and safety of the two surgical methods in the&#xD;
      treatment of T2DM. This study will make high-level evidence about the advantages and&#xD;
      disadvantages of OAGB and RYGB in the treatment of T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a number of centers with rich experience and clinical research experience in&#xD;
      weight loss and metabolic surgery in Asia will be combined to complete the enrollment of 248&#xD;
      patients. Those who meet the standards will be randomly divided into two kinds of operations,&#xD;
      and they will be followed up for 5 years on schedule. The rate of lost follow-up is&#xD;
      controlled within 20%, and the data integrity is controlled within 95%. Taking the blood&#xD;
      glucose remission rate of type 2 diabetes as the main observation index, the prospective&#xD;
      verification shows that OAGB is clinically effective in treating obesity with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      compared with RYGB.&#xD;

    <description>Complete remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus: the blood sugar HbA1c&lt;6.0% and fasting plasma glucose&lt; 5.6 mmol/L can be controlled only by changing lifestyle intervention without taking hypoglycemic agents after operation. Partial remission: blood glucose can be controlled only by changing lifestyle intervention after operation. HbA1c&lt;6.5%, fasting plasma glucose 5.6~6.9mmol/L, and blood glucose 7.8~11.0mmol/L 2 hours after meal. Failure: blood sugar was relieved once, and then returned to the preoperative level.Unified OGTT measurement method</description>
