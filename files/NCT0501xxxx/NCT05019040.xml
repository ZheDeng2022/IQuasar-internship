  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamic characteristics of multiple ascending dose (MAD) of PA1010 tablets in&#xD;
      Chinese adults with Chronic Hepatitis B.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled, dose-escalation clinical trial,&#xD;
      the objective is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      characteristics of PA1010 tablets in Chinese patients with Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB). There&#xD;
      are three dose groups of PA1010 ( 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg) proposed to be tested sequentially&#xD;
      in this study. A total of 36 patients with CHB, either hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive&#xD;
      (+) or HBeAg-negative (-), are planned to be enrolled in this study and will be stratified by&#xD;
      HBeAg status by the ratio of 2: 1, that is, 24 of HBeAg + and 12 of HBeAg- patients. Twelve&#xD;
      subjects in each dose group were randomly assigned in a 3: 1 ratio to receive either PA1010&#xD;
      tablets or or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) tablets. All patients will be dosed for 28&#xD;
      consecutive days, and the dose-related safety, PK, and antiviral efficacy of PA1010 will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
