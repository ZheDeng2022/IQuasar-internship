  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant; Side effects associated with&#xD;
      high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy, night treatment and care, social isolation cause&#xD;
      emotional problems and deterioration in sleep quality in this patient population. In a&#xD;
      meta-analysis conducted in 2014, it was reported that music can be effective in improving&#xD;
      sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, an experimental design with pre-test - post-test control group will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of music therapy on sleep quality given to patients undergoing&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It will be held between December 2020 and May 2021&#xD;
      at the Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit of Istanbul University-Cerrahpaşa Cerrahpaşa Medical&#xD;
      Faculty Hospital. The population of the study will be the patients hospitalized in the unit&#xD;
      within the specified date range and the sample number was determined as 30.&#xD;

      Research Universe and Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population of the study will be the patients who applied to the Bone Marrow&#xD;
      Transplantation Unit of Istanbul University-Cerrahpaşa Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty Hospital&#xD;
      between December 2020 - May 2021 and accepted the study. Considering the previous years in&#xD;
      the date range of the study, it is predicted that an average of 25 patients will be&#xD;
      hospitalized for stem cell transplantation. In a study conducted in 2014, it was reported&#xD;
      that sleep disturbance continued in the long term after the transplantation in half of the&#xD;
      patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In the light of this&#xD;
      information, the sample size was calculated as 24 using the OpenEpi program. Considering the&#xD;
      possibility of patient or treatment-related disruptions during the study, it was planned to&#xD;
      include 30 patients, 15 of which were experimental and 15 were control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools The age, gender, type of transplant, habits and sleep of the patients&#xD;
      created by the researcher during the data collection phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Patient Identification Form&quot;, which consists of 14 questions related to patients such as&#xD;
      problems, and developed by Richards in 1987, was developed by Karaman Özlü et al. &quot;Richard&#xD;
      Campbell Sleep Questionnaire&quot;, whose validity and reliability study has been made, will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Musical Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      In determining the music to be used, a quiet music containing the sounds of nature was&#xD;
      determined in consultation with the music therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be applied to the experimental group by using an mp3 player in the patient room,&#xD;
      starting on the day before the transfer (D-1), every evening for 10 days and each session for&#xD;
      30 minutes. It will be applied between 23:00 and 24:00 in the evening so as not to prevent&#xD;
      the standard treatment and care of the patients. After 10 days, the sleep quality of the&#xD;
      patients will be re-evaluated using the Richard Campbell Sleep Questionnaire.&#xD;
