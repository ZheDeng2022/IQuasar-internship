  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mobile health clinic evaluation study examines the impact of mobile health clinics on&#xD;
      access reproductive and sexual healthcare services in underserved communities. Multiple&#xD;
      mobile clinics operating throughout the U.S. are participating by implementing the same&#xD;
      evaluation plan for their programs and contributing de-identified data into a shared&#xD;
      database. This allows the investigators to both determine the impact of individual programs&#xD;
      and to compare and contrast their impact across different programs, states, population&#xD;
      densities (rural, urban, suburban), and populations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective/retrospective cohort study is to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of each individual participating mobile health clinic in improving their community's health&#xD;
      and access to care, and to compare each clinic's performance and reach within their&#xD;
      respective communities. This Institutional Review Board (IRB)-exempt study is a descriptive&#xD;
      review of de-identified evaluation, clinical, and operations data, including staff and&#xD;
      patient surveys, patient metrics, and clinic operations metrics. The investigators anticipate&#xD;
      that additional mobile clinic programs will submit de-identified data from evaluations done&#xD;
      under local IRB exemption. The study will utilize data already collected or to be collected&#xD;
      by each mobile health clinic as a part of its clinical and operational activities. Each&#xD;
      mobile health clinic will decide which indicators from the evaluation instrument it will use&#xD;
      for its own evaluation, and which will be reported to the shared database, depending on the&#xD;
      specific services provided and population served. Data will be tracked on a per-patient-visit&#xD;
      level or per-operational day, whichever is more relevant to the variable at hand. Data will&#xD;
      be sourced from each mobile health clinic's current evaluation sources, including patient&#xD;
      intake records (for demographic information, clinic visit dates, clinic procedures done),&#xD;
      time and budget tracking software (for hours/patient and cost/patient spent), patient&#xD;
      questionnaires (for patient satisfaction and attitudes about their mobile health clinic&#xD;
      visit), patient post-visit follow-up questionnaires (for simple referral or prescription&#xD;
      follow-up), and clinic operational records (for distance traveled).&#xD;
