  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of concussion patients with long-term consequences of concussion&#xD;
      experience visually related symptoms such as headache, blurred vision, double vision, and&#xD;
      fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients often have difficulties coordinating the movement of the two eyes (convergence&#xD;
      insufficiency) which is essential for single and clear vision to be obtained and is hence a&#xD;
      likely explanation for the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 patients with long-term symptoms of concussion and convergence insufficiency will be&#xD;
      offered either exercises or placebo treatment the evaluate the effect of exercises aimed at&#xD;
      improving coordination between the two eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will provide data to support clinicians in deciding whether to use exercises or not&#xD;
      as a treatment of symptoms for patients with convergence insufficiency as a long-term&#xD;
      consequence of concussion.&#xD;
