  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, university students have faced many challenges&#xD;
      and without any preparation. Studies conducted during the first lockdown show an increase in&#xD;
      unhealthy lifestyles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be proposed to students from University of Nimes an 8-week physical activity&#xD;
      program. Two groups will be constituted: the first will benefit from of innovative physical&#xD;
      activity program on the base of the co-construction with users (Experimental Group), another&#xD;
      that will not benefit from any intervention (Control Group). Investigators plan to include&#xD;
      approximately 90 university students, 45 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the study is to propose innovative program to promote PA (Physical Activity)&#xD;
      and reduce ST (Sedentary Time) of young adults aged over 18 from university of Nîmes. The&#xD;
      levels of PA and ST of the experimental group will be compared to a control group with the&#xD;
      realization of pre and post intervention measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)&#xD;
      as a global pandemic. In France, all universities have been closed on 16th March 2020. In&#xD;
      September 2020, face-to-face teaching restarted in French universities, but with new&#xD;
      constraints (e.g., reducing number of students in classrooms, wearing masks) and significant&#xD;
      changes in teachings (e.g., distance and/or hybrid education). In October 2020, several&#xD;
      French universities closed down again due to significant contamination among students.&#xD;
      Finally, on 30th October 2020, the French government imposed a second lockdown and all&#xD;
      universities have been closed. It is only in February 2021 that face-to-face teaching started&#xD;
      again in French universities (within the limit of 50% of the universities' capacity and 20%&#xD;
      of the teachings). Since the beginning of the pandemic, university students have faced many&#xD;
      challenges and without any preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even before the pandemic, university students were identified as a population with unhealthy&#xD;
      lifestyles and habits, notably reflected in high levels of sedentary behavior, low levels of&#xD;
      physical activity and unhealthy diet. Studies conducted during the first lockdown have shown&#xD;
      an increase in unhealthy lifestyles;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deleterious effects of the pandemic on students' health are now evident. However, some&#xD;
      areas of research are still under-explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The majority of research is largely descriptive and do not identify the factors involved&#xD;
           in the deterioration of health&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To date, no interventional studies have been conducted to prevent the deterioration of&#xD;
           students' health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators expect a 9-week intervention. During the first week, a workshop of the&#xD;
      co-construction with the users will be realized in order to remove the barriers to the&#xD;
      practice of a physical activity. The aim of co-construction with users is to obtain better&#xD;
      adherence to program, based on needs and not decided from above. Then, a group information&#xD;
      session focusing on the promotion of active behaviors will be organize, and physical&#xD;
      activities (moderate to vigorous) will be proposed for 8 weeks, twice a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the study is to propose innovative program to promote PA (Physical Activity)&#xD;
      and reduce ST (Sedentary Time) of young adults aged over 18 from university of Nîmes. The&#xD;
      levels of PA and ST of the experimental group will be compared to a control group with the&#xD;
      realization of pre and post intervention measures.&#xD;
