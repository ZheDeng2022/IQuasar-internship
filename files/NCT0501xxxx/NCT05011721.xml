  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: In young women, breast cancer (BC) has particular characteristics, such as a more&#xD;
      advanced stage at diagnosis, aggressive tumor characteristics, and a poorer prognosis. NeoFit&#xD;
      aims to use an activity tracker to identify and describe various digital profiles (physical&#xD;
      activity, heart rate, sleep) in women under 45 years of age treated with neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy for BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: NeoFit is a prospective, national, multicenter, single-arm open-label study. It will&#xD;
      include a total of 300 participants under the age of 45 years treated with neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy for BC. Participants will receive a Withing Steel HR activity tracker, which&#xD;
      they will be asked to wear 24 h per day for 12 months. The principal assessments will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline, at the end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and at 12 months. We will&#xD;
      evaluate clinical (e.g. toxicity, efficacy of chemotherapy), lifestyle, quality of life,&#xD;
      fatigue, and physical activity parameters. All questionnaires will be completed on a REDCap&#xD;
      form, via a secure internet link.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCUSSION: NeoFit will make it possible, through the use of an activity tracker, to&#xD;
      visualize changes, over a one-year period, in the lifestyle of young women treated for BC by&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This exploratory study will provide fundamental knowledge about the&#xD;
      digital phenotypes of young BC patients treated with NAC and their relationships to&#xD;
      chemotherapy toxicity and efficacy. This trial will pave the way for interventional studies&#xD;
      on physical activity and sleep interventions.&#xD;

    <measure>Identify digital profiles (physical activity, heart rate, sleep) in breast cancer patients under 45 years of age treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>To identify digital profiles we will combine step counts profiles, heart frequency profiles and sleep profiles using mixed models with latent classes. The use of a mixed model will make it possible to analyze repeat data for the population, and to determine an average profile or trajectory for the whole population. The optimal number of classes will be determined a posteriori, based on a set of statistical and clinical criteria. The most widely used statistical criterion is the &quot;Bayesian information criterion&quot; (BIC), which penalizes the model's likelihood according to its complexity. The BIC, which is stricter than many other criteria, has been shown to have a better performance in simulations. The number of trajectories will also be based on clinical interpretation (whether it is worthwhile retaining classes containing very small numbers of subjects, etc.).</description>

    <description>Occurence of severe toxicity (grade &gt;2) according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Tests will be performed to compare means (Student's t test), or categorical variables (chi2test).

    <description>Quality of life will be assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) version 3 validated in 2000, a multidimensional questionnaire validated for use with cancer patients. The QLQC30 questionnaire contains 30 items assessing five functional domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), one overall quality-of-life domain, three symptom domains (pain, fatigue and nausea), and six individual items (dyspnea, insomnia, anorexia, diarrhea, constipation, and financial impact). Participants will respond on a Likert scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot; and from &quot;very poor&quot; to &quot;excellent&quot; for the overall quality-of-life questions only. Scores will be standardized on a scale of 0 to 100, according to the EORTC scoring manual. Higher scores correspond to better functioning, a better overall quality of life and more symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Analyze the effects of digital profiles on fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>End of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The multidimensional aspects of fatigue will be evaluated with the EORTC QLQ-FA12 version 1 module, which was validated for cancer-related fatigue in 2017. EORTC QLQ-FA12 contains 12 items assessing the physical, cognitive, and emotional domains of cancer-related fatigue. Participants will complete a four-point Likert-scale questionnaire, with responses ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot;. All scores will be transformed to a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of fatigue. The estimated completion time for this questionnaire is five minutes.&#xD;
Tests will be performed to compare means (Student's t test), or categorical variables (chi2test). We will also perform multinomial logistic regression analyses with univariate and multivariate models, to determine the probability of belonging to a class relative to the corresponding reference class</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a Withings Steel HR activity tracker (Withings, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France), which they will be asked to wear 24 hours per day throughout the whole intervention (12 months). At baseline, the Withings Health Mate mobile phone application will be downloaded onto each participant's smartphone or tablet. The clinical research assistant will instruct the participant in the use of the activity tracker. The participant will then accept and activate the sharing of the data collected with the secure server dedicated to the &quot;NeoFit&quot; study at the Institut Curie. Participants will be asked to synchronize the activity tracker regularly (ideally daily) via Bluetooth with the Withings Health Mate application, for automatic transfer of the data to the secure &quot;NeoFit&quot; space.</description>
