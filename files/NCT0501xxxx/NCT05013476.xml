  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to perform a comparative analysis of novice ultrasound users when&#xD;
      taught in person versus virtually. This study aims to show that students will not demonstrate&#xD;
      a statistical difference in scores learning in in a virtual environment, guided by&#xD;
      professionals, when compared to students learning ultrasound in a traditional, in-person&#xD;
      format. Utilizing a Butterfly ultrasound machine, a hand held personal ultrasound device,&#xD;
      students wil be guided through a FAST (Focused assessment with sonography in trauma)&#xD;
      examination and imaging of the carpal tunnel using modules and instructor aid. The FAST&#xD;
      (Focused assessment with sonography in trauma) exam images the heart and abdomen for free&#xD;
      flowing blood. The carpal tunnel is a region in the wrist that houses the tendons for finger&#xD;
      movement. Participants will be assessed on the ability to identify key regions, anatomical&#xD;
      landmarks and confidence in utilize the ultrasound machine.&#xD;

      This project intends to adapt previous research (&quot;Innovations with tele-ultrasound in&#xD;
      education sonography: the use of tele-ultrasound to train novice scanners&quot;) to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of tele-education using the Butterfly handheld ultrasound device when compared&#xD;
      to in person education imaging devices, learning modules and assessments will be kept&#xD;
      constant across experimental groups. This experiment aims to adapt the current ultrasound&#xD;
      modules used by the University of Colorado Anschutz school of Medicine and Modern Human&#xD;
      Anatomy program to formulate in depth modules that outline the following: Carpal Tunnel&#xD;
      (wrist), Brachial Plexus (shoulder), and FAST &quot;Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma&quot;.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will be provided an orientation module that will be completed&#xD;
      prior to the live session. Participants will be divided into either the in-person group or&#xD;
      virtual group and participate in a live session where participants go through each module&#xD;
      with a trained instructor. Participants will be asked to complete a pre/post assessment to&#xD;
      determine prior knowledge and the level of learning that took place during the session as&#xD;
      well as participant satisfaction and confidence levels.&#xD;

    <measure>Comparison of participant assesment scores when asked to identify key features of the FAST and Carpal Tunnel between in person learners and virtual learners.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Scores are measured on a pass (1) or fail (0) grading system with a total number of 17 points per participant. An Anderson-Darling test will determine if the data is normally distributed. If the data demonstrates normal distribution, either a parametric analysis via a two-way ANOVA or non-parametric equivalent analysis via pairwise Mann-Whitney U will be performed to compare responses from the different groups. Further a Bran-Altman Test will be considered.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Student comparative confidence levels in ultrasound between virtual learners and in-person learners.</measure>
    <time_frame>1.5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Likert Scale measures participant's subjective opinion on a question. Five answer choices are provided on a scale of 0 to 5 with an extreme on both ends, a neutral choice and a middle ground answer for both ends of the spectrum. A higher score represents a greater degree of confidence in the material. Lower scores indicate little to no confidence in the material.</description>

    <description>Likert Scale measures participant's subjective opinion on a question. Five answer choices are provided on a scale of 0 to 5 with an extreme on both ends, a neutral choice and a middle ground answer for both ends of the spectrum. Higher scores indicate high satisfaction levels with the learning modality. Low scores indicate that participant's did not enjoy the learning modality.</description>
