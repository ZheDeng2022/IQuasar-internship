  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Though Cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) under epidural anesthesia in&#xD;
      conscious patients is associated with increased risk of epidural hematoma. The investigators&#xD;
      developed a monitored anesthesia care (MAC) platform for cardiac surgery under CPB. In the&#xD;
      current prospective study, the investigators investigated the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      MAC platform versus intubated general anesthesia (IGA) in patients receiving elective&#xD;
      open-heart surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included adult patients who were scheduled to undergo open-heart surgery under CPB&#xD;
      at Shuguang Hospital between April 2012 and December 2021. MAC consisted of local anesthesia&#xD;
      at the site of sternotomy, sedation with dexmedetomidine, analgesia with&#xD;
      remifentanil/sufentanil and electroacupuncture. MAC versus IGA was chosen by the patients.&#xD;
      The investigators will investigate the safety and effectiveness of the MAC platform versus&#xD;
      IGA in patients receiving elective open-heart surgery.&#xD;

    <masking_description>We set a blind code in case patients have adverse effects. The random code and blind code will be conducted using opaque envelopes by a &quot;third party&quot; independent of the study. The envelopes will be sealed and shuffled, and the assignment records will not be disclosed until the end of the study. Trial participants, cardiothoracic surgeons, anesthesiologists, outcome assessors, and data analysts will be blinded to the treatment allocation to minimize potential sources of bias. Only the nurse of the anesthesiology department (having received specialized acupuncture training) will know the participants' group allocations. However, this nurse will not know any other information about the patients.</masking_description>

    <measure>The Vasoactive-inotropic Score</measure>
    <time_frame>end of the surgery, up to 48 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The vasoactive-inotropic score was used to evaluate the dose of various vasoactive drugs and calculated by the following formula: Vasoactive-inotropic score = dopamine (×1) + dobutamine (×1) + amrinone (×1) + milrinone (×15) + epinephrine (×100) + norepinephrine (×100) + isoprenaline (×100). The minimum value was 0 and the maximum values had no upper limit. The higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Electroacupuncture was performed for two consecutive days before surgery (2 daily 30-min sessions) by a licensed acupuncturist at 4.0 mA using an alternating frequency of 2 and 100 Hz (every 1.5 seconds) (LH-202, Huawei, Beijing, China). Acupoints included bilateral Yunmen (LU2), Zhongfu (LU1), Lieque (LU7), and Neiguan (PC6). On the day of surgery, electroacupuncture started upon the completion of a loading dose of dexmedetomidine, was suspended when CPB started (to avoid interference with electrocardiogram recording) and continued until the end of surgery.</description>

    <description>Anesthesia was induced with propofol (2.0-3.5 μg/mL) by target control infusion and 0.3-0.5 μg/kg sufentanil. Tracheal intubation was facilitated by rocuronium (1.0 mg/kg). Anesthesia was maintained using isoflurane at 0.7-1.0 minimal alveolar concentration in a gas mixture of oxygen and air and remifentanil (0.05-0.2 μg·kg-1·min-1) by intravenous injection pump. Sufentanil dose was totally 2.5-4.0 μg/kg. Muscle relaxation was achieved using 1/3-1/4 of the induction dose every 40-60 min based on a train of four. Mechanical ventilation with 80% O2 in air was used. Tidal volume (7-8 mL/kg) and respiratory rate (10-12/min) were adjusted according to PETCO2 to achieve normal ventilation (PETCO2 35-45 mmHg).</description>
