  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a major public health issue due to its frequency (prevalence of 7.5% in&#xD;
      adults), its difficulties in therapeutic management (ineffective in 30% of cases and poor&#xD;
      compliance) and its societal cost (170 billion euros per year). The most frequent clinical&#xD;
      expression is a characterized depressive episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity, through better management of emotions and stress, has been proposed as a&#xD;
      complementary therapeutic approach in depression. Studies have shown a decrease in depressive&#xD;
      symptoms during a sports program of at least 2 weeks in addition to pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment. Similarly, mindfulness meditation, because it reduces ruminations, could also&#xD;
      improve the therapeutic management of depression. More recently, virtual reality (VR)&#xD;
      exposure therapy has also been proposed in the treatment of anxiety and depression, with a&#xD;
      benefit of multisensory stimulation induced by a virtual environment in cognitive and&#xD;
      sensory-motor rehabilitation and emotion regulation. However, these therapeutic strategies,&#xD;
      in addition to pharmacological treatments, have limits. There is thus a real challenge in&#xD;
      designing innovative therapeutic programs for the treatment of depression that encourage&#xD;
      motivated practice. A sports activity coupled with immersion in VR could combine the benefits&#xD;
      of each of these treatments. With the emergence of new immersive technologies, VR allows the&#xD;
      recreation of sensory experiences in an environment close to the ecological context. The use&#xD;
      of physical activity on an indoor rower or other sensor-equipped device could thus intensify&#xD;
      the psychological benefits of exercise and improve compliance. However, there is a lack of&#xD;
      clinical evidence to recommend this coupled therapeutic approach in the additional treatment&#xD;
      of depression. This approach is part of the embodied virtual medicine road map.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, a better understanding of the biological, metabolomic, and cerebral mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying this approach could improve its effectiveness. It would make it possible to&#xD;
      propose and evaluate biomarkers for therapeutic and prognostic monitoring of depression. In&#xD;
      particular, progress in the field of the &quot;-omics&quot; family includes new tools with great&#xD;
      potential. This is more specifically the case of metabolomics. The analysis of metabolites&#xD;
      present in the organism or released with natural secretions would allow to constitute a&#xD;
      metabolomic signature evolving during the treatment. The interest in characterizing&#xD;
      metabolomic biomarkers is an interesting avenue to meet the need to establish a biological&#xD;
      diagnosis with quantified values, for better objectivity and follow-up. Functional imaging&#xD;
      could also be used to highlight regional activity or connectivity anomalies and markers of&#xD;
      response to therapy in relation to biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this work is to determine the clinical impact of physical exercise in VR on a&#xD;
      depressive state, and to study in biology, metabolomics and neuroimaging the functional&#xD;
      substrates of such a practice in order to understand the mechanisms involved and to propose&#xD;
      ways to improve the management of depression.&#xD;

    <description>This questionnaire is built on the 9 symptoms used in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5): sad mood, concentration, self-criticism, suicidal ideation, interest, energy/fatigue, sleep disturbance, decreased/increased appetite or weight, and psychomotor slowing/agitation.&#xD;
The total score ranges from 0 to 27 with higher scores meaning higher levels of depression.</description>

    <description>SPECT allows the measurement of cerebral perfusion, reflecting the global synaptic activity, via a 3D acquisition of 20 minutes, 15 minutes after injection of 740 MBq of radiotracers (ECD - Neurolite or HMPAo - Cerestab), with iterative reconstruction. The data will be processed at the voxel scale by the SPM12 software, with analysis of brain connectivity.</description>
