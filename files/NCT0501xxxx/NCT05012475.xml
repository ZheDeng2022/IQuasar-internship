  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a tele-research approach, we will recruit, enroll, guide and support carers and&#xD;
      participants to engage in computer based activities (modified virtual reality) with the&#xD;
      primary outcome of reducing stereotypies and increasing independent arm and hand use and&#xD;
      secondary outcome of improving quality of living. Because of our virtual approach, we are&#xD;
      able to recruit from multiple countries and all states and territories of the USA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early in life, individuals with Rett syndrome lose purposeful use of their hands and engage&#xD;
      in handwringing and handmouthing stereotypies. It is important to pursue interventions that&#xD;
      may facilitate the development and sustained use of arms/hands for productive involvement in&#xD;
      daily needs that ultimately improve quality of life. Investigators plan to use a&#xD;
      tele-research approach to assist caregivers and the participants in playing customized&#xD;
      computer generated games that require independent and sustained hand separations and&#xD;
      initiated and sustained movement patterns to control the modified virtual reality activity&#xD;
      that serves as our intervention. Customization of the games and activities used will require&#xD;
      collaboration with the caregivers of each participant to ensure that the level of motivation&#xD;
      and interest of the participant matches the game/activities used. Brightly colored wristbands&#xD;
      will be worn on each participant's wrist during the one-hour long intervention in which they&#xD;
      will be involved 3 days per week for ~12 weeks. These wrist bands will be detected by the&#xD;
      software we developed. As the participants move their arms, our software will detect these&#xD;
      position changes and activate the computer-based activities. At 5 different points in the&#xD;
      study investigators will test for changes in independent reaching abilities that may result&#xD;
      from exposure to the intervention. Specifically, investigators will assess the impact of the&#xD;
      intervention on minimizing hand stereotypies and improving the amount and quality of&#xD;
      independent arm function. At the start and end of the study, investigators will also assess&#xD;
      the impact the intervention had on activities of daily living, and therefore quality of life,&#xD;
      via three goals developed in collaboration with the family/caregiver of the participant. Due&#xD;
      to the virtual nature (tele-research) of the study, investigators aim to recruit 10-12&#xD;
      participants from multiple countries. Once enrolled, each participant will remain involved&#xD;
      for up to 5-6 months. Since all activities are hand selected for each participant in&#xD;
      collaboration with the caregivers, risks of involvement in this study are low. Investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that this intervention will improve motor planning abilities for arm use and&#xD;
      reduce stereotypies.&#xD;
