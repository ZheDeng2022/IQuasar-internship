  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high frequency of unplanned hospital visits of patients with chronic hypercapnic&#xD;
      respiratory failure (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity-related&#xD;
      hypoventilation) constitutes a major public health problem. Most patients admitted for acute&#xD;
      exacerbations (AHRF) have additional comorbidities, especially sleep disorders. Often&#xD;
      untreated, sleep disorders contribute to multiple readmissions (≈70% at one year) and&#xD;
      increase readmission costs. The investigators will: 1) identify these patients early during&#xD;
      unplanned hospital admissions and perform sleep studies using EEG and oximetry before&#xD;
      hospital discharge and two months after to compare sleep abnormalities in the two moments; 2)&#xD;
      investigate the association between sleep abnormalities in the two sleep studies with&#xD;
      clinical outcomes (1-year readmission and death); 3) investigate the acute effects of&#xD;
      high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) to treat sleep abnormalities as a simplified alternative. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate sleep abnormalities during the hospital stay and two months after&#xD;
      discharge will be associated with poor clinical outcomes (readmission, death) and HFNC to&#xD;
      acutely reduce sleep abnormalities.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform sleep studies using nocturnal EEG measurements and oximetry 1)&#xD;
      while the participants are still in the hospital but have reached relative clinical stability&#xD;
      (≥48 h after admission, not in ICU and pHv ≥7.36) and 2) two months after hospital discharge&#xD;
      at the participant's home. Sleep studies will be performed from 5:00 pm to 8 am. EEG&#xD;
      measurements will be performed using a portable monitor (Prodigy Sleep System, Cerebra,&#xD;
      Winnipeg, Canada). Sleep assessment will be performed offline. The ORP will be continuously&#xD;
      quantified and ORP-derived indices will be calculated. Nocturnal oximetry will be used for&#xD;
      detecting sleep desaturation episodes. Comorbidities (e.g., obesity, diagnosed lung or heart&#xD;
      disease, Charlson comorbidity index) and exacerbations/hospitalization in the previous year&#xD;
      will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 21 participants, the investigators will perform one additional sleep study with the&#xD;
      participants breathing with high-flow nasal cannula therapy (HFNC) to investigate the acute&#xD;
      impact (i.e., during one night) of HFNC on reducing sleep abnormalities. HFNC will be set&#xD;
      from 25 - 60 L/min based on participant's tolerance and the inspired fraction of oxygen will&#xD;
      be titrated to maintain patient SpO2 similar to the levels during standard oxygen therapy.&#xD;
