  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 Extension trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABP-450 for migraine&#xD;
      prevention in adults who suffer from six or more migraine days per month. The study will&#xD;
      enroll 690 patients across approximately 60 sites in the United States, Canada and Australia&#xD;
      from the Phase 2 trial. Study subjects will be divided evenly across a low dose group and a&#xD;
      high dose group. All patients will receive four treatment cycles of ABP-450 utilizing the&#xD;
      Company's novel injection paradigm.&#xD;

      The Phase 2 Extension trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABP-450 for migraine&#xD;
      prevention in adults who suffer from six or more migraine days per month. The study will&#xD;
      enroll 690 patients across approximately 60 sites in the United States, Canada and Australia&#xD;
      from Phase 2 trial. Study subjects who had their initial dose of study drug in Phase 2 trial&#xD;
      study, irrespective of treatment allocation, will be eligible to enroll in this extension&#xD;
      study. Study subjects will be divided evenly across a group receiving a low dose of ABP-450&#xD;
      and a group receiving a high dose of ABP-450. All patients will receive four treatment cycles&#xD;
      utilizing the Company's novel treatment paradigm involving fewer injections than the current&#xD;
      botulinum toxin treatment option for chronic migraine.&#xD;
