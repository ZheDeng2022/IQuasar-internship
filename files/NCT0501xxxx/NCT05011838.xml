  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention to reduce the gaps&#xD;
      in hypertension care and control at a population level in low-income Communes of Medellin,&#xD;
      Colombia, and assess the process and fidelity of the intervention's implementation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi-component intervention was designed based on international guidelines, a&#xD;
      cross-sectional population survey results, and consultation with the community and&#xD;
      institutional stakeholders. Three main components integrate activities related to (I) Health&#xD;
      services redesign, (II) Clinical staff training (III) Patient and community engagement. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated in a controlled before-after&#xD;
      quasi-experimental study, with two deprived Communes of the city selected as intervention and&#xD;
      control arms. Two representative population-based surveys of adults aged 35 years or older&#xD;
      will be undertaken in the intervention and the control Communes two years apart, one before&#xD;
      the intervention implementation and the other after. The surveys will include different&#xD;
      adults. The main outcomes assessed will be the gaps in hypertension diagnosis, treatment,&#xD;
      follow-up and control. Effectiveness will be evaluated with &quot;difference in difference&quot;&#xD;
      measures. Generalized estimation equations models will be fitted considering the clustered&#xD;
      nature of data and adjusting for potential confounding variables. The implementation process&#xD;
      will be studied with mixed methods. Finally, implementation fidelity will be documented to&#xD;
      assess to which degree the components of the intervention were implemented as intended.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Two deprived Communes of the city have been selected as intervention and control arms. All the intervention components will be implemented in Commune 2, located in the northeast of Medellin. Commune 6, located northwest of Medellin, has been selected as the control area to deliver routine care. Two representative population surveys of adults aged 35 years or older will be undertaken in the intervention and the control Communes two years apart, one before the intervention implementation and the other after. The surveys will randomly include different individuals. The main outcomes assessed will be the gaps in hypertension diagnosis, treatment, follow-up and control.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>1.1. Healthy Hearts service: a nursing station providing blood pressure measurement, cardiovascular risk assessment, preventive counselling and effective follow-up in extended opening hours.&#xD;
1.2. Hypertension screening: All adults attending health care facilities who did not have their blood pressure measured in the previous year will be referred to the Healthy Hearts Service for screening.&#xD;
1.3. Clinical management: 1.3.1. Creation of the cardiovascular risk team: a group of doctors supervising hypertension management and coordinating improvement.&#xD;
1.3.2. Guideline-based standardized diagnostic and treatment protocols: a simplified diagnostic and treatment algorithm will identify a core set of primary and secondary antihypertensive medications.&#xD;
1.3.3. Availability of antihypertensive medications: it will be assured through procurement mechanisms and its availability will be communicated to clinicians at the beginning of each week and ad hoc in case of stock-outs.</description>

    <description>2.1. Training on good clinical management of hypertension: focused on correct blood pressure measurement, use of evidence-based guidelines, cardiovascular risk assessment, use of a standardized diagnostic and treatment algorithm, correct prescription of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment, patient counselling, and how to tackle clinical inertia.&#xD;
2.2. Training on communication skills and patients' needs assessment for all health workers involved in hypertension care. This training will be designed under the &quot;patient-centred medicine&quot; framework, aiming at equipping health providers with tools for understanding patients' feelings and experience of illness, and to improve their capacity to address social, psychological, and behavioural dimensions of hypertension care.</description>

    <description>3.1. Patient empowerment: &quot;expert hypertensive patients&quot; , under the supervision of a social worker, will provide support and transmit their know-how to other patients in need, particularly those newly diagnosed or non-adherent to treatment or presenting uncontrolled hypertension.&#xD;
3.2. Community engagement: a Community Hypertension Outreach Group will be set up, composed of existing voluntary community health workers, who will be trained and certified. This group will conduct blood pressure measurements in selected public areas of the commune, referring those with positive screening to the nearest health facility for diagnosis confirmation. It will also provide health information with emphasis on healthy lifestyles. Existing local communication channels such as the community radio and the local newspaper will be engaged.</description>
