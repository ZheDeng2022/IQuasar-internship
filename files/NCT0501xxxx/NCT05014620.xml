  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic patient education (TPE) is one of the approaches used to manage chronic diseases.&#xD;
      It aims to make the patient an active participant in his or her own care and to establish an&#xD;
      effective partnership with the carer, thereby also responding to the need to control health&#xD;
      expenditures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the contribution of TPE has revolutionised healthcare professions, in particular by&#xD;
      profoundly changing the carer-patient relationship and certain aspects of their professional&#xD;
      culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a recent action-research study conducted in partnership with Crf-Cnam in Paris showed that&#xD;
      although the training of professionals appears to be a major issue, the integration of TPE&#xD;
      forces the involved parties to question their practices. TPE imposes a change in the&#xD;
      understanding that carers have of their usefulness in accompanying patients and in their&#xD;
      perception of education and care. It also changes their relationship to the involvement of&#xD;
      patients in maintaining their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of educational approaches in Mental Health is also at the origin of many&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study of patients suffering from schizophrenia, discrepancies appeared amongst the&#xD;
      carers, whose outlooks seemed to be correlated with their experience in TPE. The&#xD;
      carer-caregiver relationship was evoked with a feeling of lack of exchange, and a feeling of&#xD;
      infantilization for certain carers. This study highlights the misconception that some&#xD;
      psychiatric caregivers have of TPE in somatic care, and the idea that TPE is limited to drug&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic education is of particular importance as it is a determinant of the schizophrenic&#xD;
      patient's adherence to therapeutic principles. However, it must be based on an appropriate&#xD;
      strategy that facilitates communication and the exchange of knowledge with patients suffering&#xD;
      from severe and persistent psychological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the implementation of two ongoing TPE programs initiated with schizophrenic patients,&#xD;
      we were able to observe that despite the knowledge of the TPE caregivers, there were still&#xD;
      difficulties in its implementation: lack of recruitment, organizational difficulties, loss of&#xD;
      motivation...&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the same prism as the development of new care strategies by the Ministère des solidarités&#xD;
      et de la santé, we asked ourselves questions about strengthening the training of paramedical&#xD;
      staff, such as: how can health literacy be enriched in mental health training programs? But&#xD;
      the trainig of individuals in the field seems to be only one of the components. This care&#xD;
      project raises questions about values systems and the mechanisms for legitimizing power, and&#xD;
      requires consent and commitment from the various actors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis formulated is that one of the keys to better patient adherence and better&#xD;
      appropriation of a TPE programme in mental health would be to take into account the&#xD;
      representations of the carers dispensing these programmes. This investigation will be based&#xD;
      on TPE programs dispensed to schizophrenic patients at La Chartreuse Psychiatric Hospital in&#xD;
      Dijon, France.&#xD;
