      The study investigators will conduct a prospective study on patients with non-metastatic&#xD;
      vulvar cancer who will receive radiation treatment using Volumetric Arc Therapy (VMAT)&#xD;
      modality with curative intent. Our aim is to compare straight-leg versus frog-leg position in&#xD;
      terms of RTOG acute skin toxicity. Also, the study investigators will evaluate if positioning&#xD;
      has an impact on the total treatment time and deviation on Cone Beam CT (CBCT) that might&#xD;
      warrant re-simulation and consequently re-planning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vulvar cancer is a rare tumor with a prevalence of about 3-5% of gynecological malignancies&#xD;
      with squamous cell carcinoma being the most common histopathologic subtype. It is more common&#xD;
      among elderly and postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is the cornerstone for the management of patients with early stage vulvar cancer.&#xD;
      Radiotherapy is an integral part of the management of vulvar cancer both in the definitive&#xD;
      and adjuvant settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that intensity modulated radiotherapy IMRT is associated with&#xD;
      better locoregional control compared with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 3DCRT. In&#xD;
      addition, it is associated with dosimetric advantage and better sparing of the organs at&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, frog-leg position was the standard to provide better access for electron boost&#xD;
      in conventional era. After evolution of inverse planning, electron boost is not further&#xD;
      needed. Some centers have adopted straight-leg position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is paucity of literature regarding vulvar cancer in general and there is lack of data&#xD;
      addressing radiation therapy treatment position specifically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators will conduct a prospective study on patients with non-metastatic&#xD;
      vulvar cancer who will receive radiation treatment using Volumetric Arc Therapy (VMAT)&#xD;
      modality with curative intent. Our aim is to compare straight-leg versus frog-leg position in&#xD;
      terms of RTOG acute skin toxicity. Also, the investigators will evaluate if positioning has&#xD;
      an impact on the total treatment time and deviation on Cone Beam CT (CBCT) that might warrant&#xD;
      re-simulation and consequently re-planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If both positions proved to be similar in terms of skin toxicity, then the investigators will&#xD;
      adopt supine position in the treatment of all patients with vulvar cancer. It will be more&#xD;
      comfortable position, and so more reproducible and this reproducibility will be reflected on&#xD;
      better treatment outcomes.&#xD;
