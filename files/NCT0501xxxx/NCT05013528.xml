    <textblock>
      Autism is an Umbrella term for a lifelong neuropsychiatric disorder which falls into the&#xD;
      category of pervasive developmental disabilities. Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a&#xD;
      syndrome that often develops in early childhood, characterized by impairment of speech, the&#xD;
      problems encountered in communication with the environment, display of certain skills, and&#xD;
      developmental retardation in almost all cognitive functions. Autism is a &quot;spectrum disorder''&#xD;
      ranging in severity in every individual. Symptoms of autistic disorder arise during the&#xD;
      initial 2 years of life. Problem with language advancement and social interaction are the&#xD;
      major concerns reported by parents by 2 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence has recommended that motor disability is quite possibly the most predictable&#xD;
      markers, close by socio communicative challenges, for mental imbalance range issue such as&#xD;
      autism spectrum disorder. These motor anomalies could have basic ramifications for resulting&#xD;
      psychological and social turn of events. In any case, this territory of improvement is&#xD;
      especially under examined in the mental imbalance related setting, and early mediation&#xD;
      programs normally center around the core symptoms of the Autism disorder. Although the&#xD;
      confined nature of the literature prevents researchers from drawing definitive conclusions,&#xD;
      the outcomes from the research mentioned in this study verified probably huge upgrades in the&#xD;
      motor skills of autistic children after the physical therapy interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity plays important role in improving cognition, enhancing executive functions&#xD;
      of children to perform daily life activities in children with Autism Spectrum disorders and&#xD;
      mental retardation A case report organized and ratified by Rehabilitation department of the&#xD;
      University of Lowa, to determine the efficacy of Rhythmic Balance, Auditory, and Vision&#xD;
      Exercises as an adjunctive intervention to conventional physical therapy protocol&#xD;
      administered in child with Autism and ADHD.A 6 year old child diagnosed with ADHD and Autism&#xD;
      was recruited in the study with major recognized difficulties in strength and agility. A 9&#xD;
      week protocol of Bal-A-Vis-X program involving a multi system approach was incorporated in&#xD;
      addition to basic pediatric rehabilitation protocol. A notable improvement in child gross&#xD;
      motor functions was observed as measured by Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency,&#xD;
      Second Edition after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study was conducted to ascertain the effect of Rhythmic Balance, Auditory, and Vision&#xD;
      Exercises on selective attention of the students. A 10-minutes of Bal-A-Vis-X training twice&#xD;
      per week for eight weeks was administered. Significant gains in focused attention and&#xD;
      concentration was reported and measured after the intervention in students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research investigating the effect of Bal-A-Vis-X protocol on elementary school students of&#xD;
      special education department was carried on. A positive effect of Bal-A-Vis-X training is&#xD;
      observed in on task attention during academic activities in children with ADHD , Autism and&#xD;
      other mentally disabled individuals The past research records are evident that therapists&#xD;
      have determined the individual effect of Aerobic training and Rhythmic Balance, Auditory, and&#xD;
      Vision Exercises training for rehabilitation of ASD children. The evidence for implementation&#xD;
      of two protocols for rehabilitation of ASD children is sparse. So the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the effects of Rhythmic Balance, Auditory, and Vision Exercises and Aerobic training&#xD;
      in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.&#xD;
