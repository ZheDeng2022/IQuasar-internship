  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of an application for smartphones based on&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) that was designed to increase treatment adaptation&#xD;
      (i.e. learning therapy skills) and treatment utility (i.e. feedback for the patient). The use&#xD;
      of this avatar- led application will be tested by patients with mental disorders adjunctive&#xD;
      to their therapy. Patients will be given a smartphone for one week with the application&#xD;
      developed specifically for this purpose. The study will be a single group design and patients&#xD;
      will be assessed two times: before and after having tested the application. Measurements will&#xD;
      include acceptability (adherence, utilization, utility, satisfaction) of the application, as&#xD;
      well as patients characteristics, such as diagnostic interviews, questionnaires about&#xD;
      symptomatology, well-being, social interactions, and an exit questionnaire when leaving the&#xD;
      study to assess what was learned.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a digital tool with the aim to test whether a &quot;Virtual Coach&quot; can&#xD;
      increase treatment adaptation (i.e., learning of therapy skills, prevent drop-out), treatment&#xD;
      utility (i.e., via direct feedback to the patient and therapist), and increase adherence. The&#xD;
      digital tool will be an avatar-led application for smartphones and be based on the Acceptance&#xD;
      and Commitment Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Virtual Coach&quot; will be used adjunctive to therapy and help patients initiate behavioral&#xD;
      changes and accelerate the learning of new therapy skills. The questions addressed will be&#xD;
      the following: a) adherence to and utilization of the Virtual Coach itself ; b) application&#xD;
      of therapy skills; c) perceived usefulness of the Virtual Coach by patients and therapists,&#xD;
      and d) the frequency of prosocial behaviors and their impact on well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is the feasibility of using the Virtual Coach adjunctively to&#xD;
      a therapy. However, it also will be explored how outcomes may be related to the severity of&#xD;
      symptoms and other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study contains a pilot test in a single-arm trial to evaluate the main outcomes of&#xD;
      acceptability (adherence, utilization, utility, satisfaction) with n = 40. Patients will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline and again after the course of their psychotherapy (post-assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will complete informed consent, undergo a short diagnostic assessment, then receive&#xD;
      a smartphone with the application to carry for one week. They will be asked to use the&#xD;
      application at least three times per day in order to practice skills involved in the&#xD;
      treatment. The assessment targets will include intentions, activities, and goals of the&#xD;
      patient, interpersonal activities, and health behaviors. Subjective reports (e.g., emotions,&#xD;
      thoughts, reactions, plans) and objective data (response times, adherence to prompts, etc.)&#xD;
      will be tracked. In addition to the main acceptability outcomes, additional assessments will&#xD;
      be used to measure patient characteristics. This will include a diagnostic interview,&#xD;
      questionnaires about symptomatology, well-being, social interactions, and an exit&#xD;
      questionnaire when leaving the study to assess what was learned.&#xD;

An example item would be &quot;attractive - unattractive&quot;. Items are scored on a 7-point Likert scale and range from full agreement with the negative term (-3) to the full agreement with the positive term (+3). Half of the items start with the positive term, the rest with the negative term. Higher sum scores indicate more positive evaluation of the app.</description>
