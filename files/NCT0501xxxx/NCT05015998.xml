    <textblock>
      The objectives of this analysis is to determine the incidence of anemia occurring in patients&#xD;
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in primary care (i.e. prior to any eventual referral to&#xD;
      nephrology care). This analysis also evaluates patient characteristics, anemia treatment and&#xD;
      associated cardiovascular risk.&#xD;

      Data will be derived from the Stockholm CREATinine Measurement (SCREAM) cohort, a repository&#xD;
      of laboratory data of individuals residing and accessing healthcare in the region of&#xD;
      Stockholm and who underwent a creatinine assessment between 2012 - 2018.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 years at maximum</time_frame>
    <description>Anemia will be defined as the composite of: a diagnosis of anemia, a haemoglobin (Hb) measurement within the defined range for anemia followed by iron (oral or intravenous [IV]) or erythropoietin-simulating agent (ESA) treatment within 3 months, a Hb measurement within the defined range for anemia followed by another low Hb measurement &gt;3 months apart. Anemia as an outcome will be defined by current World Health Organization (WHO) definitions (Hb &lt; 12 g/dL or 7.45 mmol/L for female and &lt; 13 g/dL or 8.07 mmol/L for male). The incidence rate of anemia will be calculated as the number of new cases divided by person-time of CKD stage 3-5 patients who were &quot;at risk&quot; of becoming an incident anemia case.</description>

        The primary data source will be the Stockholm CREAtinine Measurement (SCREAM) cohort. This&#xD;
        is a cohort comprising Swedish citizens residing in or accessing healthcare in Stockholm&#xD;
        county with a valid personal identification number and a creatinine measurement taken&#xD;
        between 2006 - 2018. Records of patients meeting inclusion criteria, in this healthcare&#xD;
        utilization cohort will be linked to national Swedish registries including the Regional&#xD;
        healthcare utilization registry, the national Patient Registry and the National Prescribed&#xD;
        Drugs Registry.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  With at least one eligible Hb after eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2. The date of the first&#xD;
             eligible Hb test is the study entry point/index date of the study.&#xD;

             haematological diseases or leukaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with chronic infections (hepatitis, tuberculosis, or human immunodeficiency&#xD;
             virus [HIV]); note by definition chronic infections are chronic and look back period&#xD;
             will be to 1997.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with anemia at baseline (index date), defined by an anemia diagnosis in the&#xD;
             year prior, a baseline Hb value within the anemia range according to the WHO&#xD;
             definition, or the presence of a recent dispensation of ESA or iron (up to six months&#xD;
             prior).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient referred to nephrologist within the previous 2 years from cohort entry/ index&#xD;
             date.&#xD;
