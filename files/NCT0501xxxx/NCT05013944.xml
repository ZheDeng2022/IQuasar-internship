      The objective of this study is the development, implementation and management of a registry&#xD;
      of patient data that captures clinically meaningful, real-world, data on the diagnosis,&#xD;
      nature, course of infection, treatment(s) and outcomes in patients with complex disease&#xD;
      globally.&#xD;

      The AnovaOS™ Network Powered Patient Registry may be used to inform the development and&#xD;
      conduct of clinical trials and observational studies designed to better understand, prevent,&#xD;
      diagnose, treat, ameliorate or cure disease. The AnovaOS™ Network Powered Patient Registry&#xD;
      may additionally be used to expedite identification and recruitment of participants for&#xD;
      clinical trials of promising therapeutics and observational studies.&#xD;

        Real-world clinical data about patients with complex, serious or immediately&#xD;
        life-threatening disease collected as part of the AnovaOS™ platform is important to the&#xD;
        scientific community. These data support biopharmaceutical companies, academic researchers&#xD;
        and other sponsors with program design and prioritization, study activation and enrolment,&#xD;
        and study conduct to help advance promising new therapeutic approaches. Learning from&#xD;
        real-world evidence can help inform drug development and help as our research system&#xD;
        evolves from a traditional model to one capable of recognizing the benefits of precision&#xD;
        medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The objective of this study is the development, implementation and management of a registry&#xD;
        of patient data that captures clinically meaningful, real-world, data on the diagnosis,&#xD;
        nature, course of infection, treatment(s) and outcomes in on patients with complex disease&#xD;
