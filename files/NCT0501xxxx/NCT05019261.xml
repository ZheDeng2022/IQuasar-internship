  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The National Academy of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health have called for urgent&#xD;
      action to improve the care delivered to the nearly 1,000,000 older Americans who die in&#xD;
      intensive care units (ICUs) annually or survive with substantial impairments. These patients&#xD;
      often die with distressing symptoms and may receive more invasive, life-prolonging treatment&#xD;
      than they would choose for themselves. Moreover, their family members acting as surrogate&#xD;
      decision-makers often experience lasting psychological distress from the ICU experience. We&#xD;
      will conduct a multicenter randomized trial among 370 incapacitated, critically ill older&#xD;
      adults at high risk of death or severe functional impairment to determine whether a&#xD;
      multi-component family support intervention can improve the patient- and family-centeredness&#xD;
      of care (primary outcome), as well as positively impact a variety of other patient, family,&#xD;
      and healthcare delivery outcomes. The multicomponent intervention involves: Proactive family&#xD;
      meetings scheduled within 48 hours of ICU admission and approximately every 5 days after&#xD;
      that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surrogates will have access (computer, tablet, or mobile phone) to the interactive web-based&#xD;
      family support tool. The tool will familiarize families with the ICU and prepare them for&#xD;
      their interactions with the clinical team by completing specific sections of the Family&#xD;
      Support Tool upon study enrollment, before family meetings, and any other time they wish. The&#xD;
      ICU team will receive a tool-generated summary of information about the family before each&#xD;
      family meeting, including their main questions and concerns, information about the patient's&#xD;
      values and preferences, prognostic expectations, and unmet psychological needs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Family Support Tool intervention is designed to help families navigate the emotional,&#xD;
      psychological, and cognitive complexities of being a surrogate for an incapacitated&#xD;
      critically ill patient, and also to enhance the timeliness and quality of clinician-family&#xD;
      communication. The intervention consists of three components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Proactive clinician-family meetings within 48 hours of enrollment and every 5-7 days&#xD;
           thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Family members complete sections of an interactive web-based tool upon study enrollment,&#xD;
           before family meetings, and any other time they wish. Family members can access the tool&#xD;
           anywhere via computer, tablet, or mobile phone. The first section of the tool is&#xD;
           completed on the first day of study enrollment and contains: video messages supporting&#xD;
           families including stories from other families and their experiences and coping&#xD;
           strategies, tips on self-care and links to hospital resources. The second and third&#xD;
           sections of the FST are completed before scheduled clinician-family meetings on study&#xD;
           day 2-3 and again 5-7 days letter. These sections of the tool contain: videos detailing&#xD;
           what to expect during family meetings, interactive exercises and prompts about patient&#xD;
           values, prognosis, care expectations and treatment leanings to help prepare for family&#xD;
           meetings. The family study team will provide families a printed summary sheet of their&#xD;
           main questions for the ICU team that they are encouraged to bring to the family meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Before each scheduled family meeting the ICU team receives a written report that&#xD;
           summarizes the family's main questions and concerns, information about the patient's&#xD;
           values and preferences, surrogates' prognostic expectations, and a visual display of&#xD;
           their unmet PC needs.&#xD;

    <description>The multi-component intervention is designed to enhance the quality of clinician-family communication and help families manage the emotional and cognitive complexities of surrogate decision-making. It involves: 1) proactive clinician-family meetings; 2) use by surrogates of an interactive web-based tool throughout the ICU stay which is narrated by family members of ICU patients and includes stories and experiences from other families, self-care strategies, brief videos explaining what to expect during family meetings, a question prompt list, an interactive values clarification exercise, and an explanation of different treatment pathways for critically ill patients. 3. Prior to the proactive family meetings, the ICU team is provided with a summary of the family's main questions/concerns, their prognostic expectations, a summary of the patient's values and preferences, and surrogates' current ratings of the extent to which their psychosocial needs are being addressed in the ICU.</description>
