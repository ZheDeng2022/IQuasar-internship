      The goal of the proposed study is to examine the efficacy of using an honest placebo to&#xD;
      relieve pain for patients with an acute pain condition. People with acute pain will receive&#xD;
      their standard dose of opioid medication for pain management. In addition, some people will&#xD;
      be asked to take placebo pills, honestly described as placebos, as well. Patients will answer&#xD;
      a few short questions over the phone once per day for seven days about pain and opioid use.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that participants in the open label placebo group will take&#xD;
      fewer opioids and have less pain than those in the treatment as usual group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      America is in the midst of an opioid epidemic. One of the reasons opioid addiction and&#xD;
      overdose deaths have recently increased is that doctors are frequently prescribing opioid&#xD;
      medication as a treatment for pain. If researchers can develop ways of increasing the&#xD;
      pain-relief patients experience from a set amount of opioids, then doctors might ultimately&#xD;
      be able to prescribe fewer opioid medications, which could help curb the opioid crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although &quot;placebos,&quot; a medication whose benefit derives solely from positive psychological&#xD;
      factors rather than pharmacological factors, are often disparaged in medicine, research&#xD;
      suggests that placebos can actually help reduce pain. In fact, there is reason to think that&#xD;
      placebos are effective even when a patient knows they are taking a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the proposed study is to examine the efficacy of using an honest placebo to&#xD;
      relieve pain for patients with an acute pain condition. People with acute pain in the&#xD;
      Emergency Department, or patients undergoing hand/wrist surgery, will receive their standard&#xD;
      dose of opioid medication for pain management. In addition, some people will be asked to take&#xD;
      placebo pills, honestly described as placebos, as well. Patients will answer a few short&#xD;
      questions over the phone once per day for seven days regarding their pain, opioid use, and&#xD;
      placebo use (only those assigned to take placebo pills).&#xD;
