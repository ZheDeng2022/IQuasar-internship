      The aim of this study is to collect clinical and radiographic data from the case histories of&#xD;
      patients surgically treated for radio-capitellar fracture and undergoing prosthetic&#xD;
      replacement with a modular metal radio-capitellar prosthesis with smooth stem at the&#xD;
      Shoulder-Elbow Department of the Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute, in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical and radiographic results at least 10 years after surgery.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to collect clinical and radiographic data from the case history of&#xD;
      patients (about 30 cases) surgically treated from 2003 to 2011 at the Shoulder-Elbow&#xD;
      Department of the Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute for radio-capitellar fracture with prosthetic&#xD;
      replacement with a modular metal radio-capitellar prosthesis with smooth stem in order to&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical and radiographic results at least 10 years after treatment. Patients&#xD;
      will be contacted to perform a clinical examination and radiographic control at the Rizzoli&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an interventional study with clinical and radiographic evaluation, at FU of at least&#xD;
      10 years, of patients treated surgically with prosthetic replacement for radio-capitellar&#xD;
      fracture at the Shoulder-Elbow Department of the Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mayo elbow performance score (MEPS):</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 10 years after radiocapitellar prosthesis surgical treatment</time_frame>
    <description>MEPS score assesses the presence of pain with a score of 0 to 45, Range of Motion with a score of 0 to 20, elbow stability with a score of 0 to 10, and the ability to perform 5 activities of daily living (combing, eating, personal hygiene, dressing, and putting on shoes) to each of which 5 points are assigned. It provides a result from 0 to 100 where results above 90 are defined as excellent, results between 75 and 89 are defined as good, between 60 and 74 are defined as sufficient and below 59 as poor.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Broberg - Morrey Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 10 years after radiocapitellar prosthesis surgical treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Broberg and Morrey assessment system is a 100-point system that summarizes data from the medical record, personal interview, and biomechanics laboratory examination. It consists of four sections: motion (40 points), strength (20 points), stability (5 points), and pain (35 points). In the final evaluation 95-100 points indicate an excellent result; 80-94 points, a good result; 60-79 points, a fair result; ≤60 points, a poor result. The result can be considered satisfactory if the outcome is rated as good or excellent and unsatisfactory if it is fair or poor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-12 (SF-12):</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 10 years after radiocapitellar prosthesis surgical treatment</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 serves as a generic indicator of quality of life and assesses the individual's subjective perception of health, understood as biopsychosocial well-being. Through 12 of the 36 questions of the original questionnaire, the SF-12 investigates 8 different aspects related to health status: physical activity, role limitations due to physical health, emotional state, physical pain, perception of general health status, vitality, social activities and mental health; the synthesis of the total scores allows to build two synthetic indices, a physical health index (PCS-12) and a mental health index (MCS-12). The lower the score of the two indices, indicatively below 20 points, the greater the level of disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment opinion post- surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 10 years after radiocapitellar prosthesis surgical treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The patient should indicate satisfaction and relative degree with treatment at the end of the clinical trial (24 months follow-up). All patients will be able to indicate their health condition by choosing from this answers; &quot;Full recovery&quot;, &quot;much better&quot;, &quot;somewhat better&quot;, &quot;no change&quot;, &quot;a little worse&quot;, &quot;much worse&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiographic assesment (RX)</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 10 years after radiocapitellar prosthesis surgical treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic assessment is useful to document re-ruptures, mobilizations and calcifications of the interested site</description>
