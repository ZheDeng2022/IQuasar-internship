    <description>Change in Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) score CAP score is a measurement of fatty change in the liver. A CAP score is measured in decibels per meter (dB/m). It ranges from 100 to 400 dB/m.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to day 168</time_frame>
    <description>This scale specifically evaluates self-efficacy judgments specific to eating behaviors in five situational factors: negative emotions, food availability, social pressure, physical discomfort, and positive activities. This measure has evidenced adequate psychometric properties, including internal consistency coefficients ranging from 0.76 to 0.90</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to day 168</time_frame>
    <description>The RAND 36-Item Health Survey (Version 1.0) laps eight concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved.</description>

    <description>The Noom platform uses a cognitive behavioral approach to weight loss that integrates set content with interaction with live coaches to support client efforts at behavior change. The Healthy Weight program follows guidelines from the Obesity Society's &quot;2013 Guidelines for the Management of Overweight and Obesity in Adults&quot; NIH &quot;Practical Guide on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults&quot;. It has 52 weeks of curriculum with 1-3 articles to read per day (Reading level: Grade 6-8).</description>

    <description>The Healthy Weight program follows guidelines from the Obesity Society's &quot;2013 Guidelines for the Management of Overweight and Obesity in Adults&quot; NIH &quot;Practical Guide on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults&quot;. Users are encouraged to log their weight (Weight Logging) at least 1x/week and log their food and beverages (Food Logging) daily. Exercise logging (steps via automatic collection or manually added) is done daily. The Noom Food color grading system is founded on calorie-density (Volumetrics diet, Barbara Rolls) and is a simple and effective method for creating long lasting changes in diet and food choice. Coaches are contacted via In-app messaging or phone communication.</description>
