  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      NH102 when administered as single oral dose at escalating dose levels in healthy&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called NH102. NH102 is being tested to treat people&#xD;
      who have depression. This study will look at the safety, tolerability and PK of NH102 in&#xD;
      healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may enroll up to 72 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned within&#xD;
      each cohort to receive NH102 or placebo which will remain undisclosed to the participants and&#xD;
      study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need). Each cohort will&#xD;
      enroll 12 participants，which including 2 sentries (all were male, one receive NH102 and the&#xD;
      other receive placebo) and 10 subjects(4 males and 4 females receive NH102 and 1 male and 1&#xD;
      female receive placebo). Participants enrolled in Cohort 1 to 6 will receive NH102 3mg, 9mg,&#xD;
      20mg, 40mg, 60mg and 80 mg or NH102 placebo-matching tablet. 2 sentries in all cohorts can be&#xD;
      administered at the same time, and the remaining subjects of the same cohort can be&#xD;
      administered only after observation for at least 24 hours and initial safety confirmation.&#xD;
