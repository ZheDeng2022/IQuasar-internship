    <textblock>
      Safety of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) vaccines has been a concern. Despite safety&#xD;
      profile of different vaccines demonstrated in phase 2/3 trials, there has been evolving&#xD;
      evidence on adverse effects of some particular COVID-19 vaccines. One of the mostly known&#xD;
      example is vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Apart from the thrombotic risk&#xD;
      of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, there has been studies providing the preliminary data on effect&#xD;
      of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine on blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A case series report was published on Hypertension in June 2021 on documented stage III&#xD;
      hypertension within minutes of vaccination (mRNA vaccines) in a vaccination centre located in&#xD;
      Switzerland. The study reported 9 subjects experienced a surge in blood pressure to stage III&#xD;
      hypertension after vaccination. Yet the study had a few shortcomings. There was not baseline&#xD;
      measurement of blood pressure. Surge of blood pressure shortly after vaccination could be due&#xD;
      to nervousness or white coat effect. Thus surge of blood pressure within minutes of&#xD;
      vaccination could be not due to vaccination. There was not long-term follow-up on blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further to the case series report, another prospective study in Italy investigated effect of&#xD;
      mRNA vaccine on blood pressure and heart rate. The study was conducted as a survey. There was&#xD;
      5.3% of respondents (6/113) reported rise of home blood pressure of at least 10mmHg after 1st&#xD;
      dose vaccination, compared with home blood pressure prior to vaccination. Among these&#xD;
      subjects, 4 of them required anti-hypertensive medication intensification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet there remains lack of evidence and detailed description on effect of COVID-19 vaccines&#xD;
      and blood pressure before and after vaccination. Use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring&#xD;
      (ABPM) before and after vaccination helps to understand the details on short-term blood&#xD;
      pressure changes.&#xD;
