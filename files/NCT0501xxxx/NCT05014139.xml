  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test a drug called enfortumab vedotin in participants with a type of bladder&#xD;
      cancer called non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate what the side effects are and if the drug works to treat NMIBC.&#xD;
      A side effect is anything a drug does to your body besides treating your disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study enfortumab vedotin will be put into the bladder using a catheter. A catheter is&#xD;
      a thin tube that can be put into your bladder.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will comprise of 2 parts. The first part (dose escalation) will find the highest&#xD;
      dose of enfortumab vedotin that does not cause unacceptable side effects in participants. The&#xD;
      second part (dose expansion) will use the dose found in the first part to test how well the&#xD;
      drug works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive enfortumab vedotin. Treatment on the study will occur during&#xD;
      the induction and maintenance phases, and participants will enter a follow-up period after&#xD;
      completion of the maintenance phase.&#xD;
