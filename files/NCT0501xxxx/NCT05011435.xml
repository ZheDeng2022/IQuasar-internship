  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burnout syndrome has been recognized as a mental illness since 2020. All workers can be&#xD;
      affected. The consequences are multiple and often serious, ranging from stoppage of work to&#xD;
      depression or even suicide. According to a 2019 survey by Malakoff, 56% of employees are in&#xD;
      &quot;professional or personal fragility&quot;, but the statistics are incomplete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the medical community, the burnout rate is doubled compared to the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of pre-burnout can precede a burnout by several months, an early treatment can&#xD;
      then reduce complications and improve the quality of life at work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a study model on health data already carried out as part of a cancer detection application&#xD;
      in smokers which involved 7000 users and which showed the ability to of such an application&#xD;
      to detect curable symptomatic cancers from questionnaires (24% with application against 9%&#xD;
      without application), we will carry out a descriptive evaluation of the use of an application&#xD;
      to detect pre-burnout, burnout and depressive syndrome in a worker population. In the event&#xD;
      of a risk alert of pre-burnout, burnout or depressive syndrome, the application will display&#xD;
      a message to the user suggesting that he consult his general practitioner or put him in&#xD;
      contact with a doctor through a teleconsultation via a dedicated platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This first study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of an early detection approach&#xD;
      among professionals of a state of &quot;fragility&quot; (pre-burnout, burnout or depressive syndrome).&#xD;
      Subsequently, a larger study will evaluate the effectiveness of this application for the&#xD;
      early detection of burnout among professionals, its management and the reduction of costs for&#xD;
      the healthcare system and society.&#xD;
