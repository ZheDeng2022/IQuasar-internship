  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After the Fontan procedure applied in patients with a functional or anatomical single&#xD;
      ventricle, patients are faced with significant morbidity and mortality risk. Most of the&#xD;
      common complications after Fontan such as arrhythmia, cyanosis, ventricular dysfunction,&#xD;
      heart failure, atrioventricular valve insufficiency, protein-losing enteropathy, thrombosis,&#xD;
      bleeding, venous insufficiency directly or indirectly limit exercise capacity. It has been&#xD;
      reported that hemodynamic, vascular and muscular factors may be effective in the decrease of&#xD;
      exercise capacity. In previous studies, it has been reported that cardiac output, one of the&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters, is the main factor affecting exercise capacity in patients with&#xD;
      Fontan, and this is due to insufficient increase in stroke volume. In addition to the&#xD;
      hemodynamic profile, the effects of muscle oxygenation, arterial stiffness and peripheral&#xD;
      muscle strength on exercise capacity have been mentioned in different studies. For this&#xD;
      reason, it is thought that examining the effects of hemodynamic, vascular and muscular&#xD;
      profile together on submaximal and maximal exercise capacity in patients with Fontan will&#xD;
      provide information about the mechanisms of influence of different exercise capacities and&#xD;
      will provide important information in terms of determining exercise-based rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs for such patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fontan operation is a palliative surgical procedure performed in patients with a functional&#xD;
      or anatomical single ventricle. After the Fontan procedure, patients face significant risk of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, and patients with complicated congenital heart disease need to be&#xD;
      followed for life by a cardiologist experienced in the care of patients. Annual follow-up is&#xD;
      recommended in uncomplicated patients, but more frequent follow-up is required in patients&#xD;
      with postoperative complications. Survival rates of 15-20 years after the operation vary&#xD;
      between 60-85%. Since there is no ventricular pump to push blood into the pulmonary artery&#xD;
      circulation in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure, there is increased systemic venous&#xD;
      pressure compared to normal biventricular circulation. Most of the common complications after&#xD;
      Fontan are directly or indirectly related to elevation of central venous pressure. These&#xD;
      complications include arrhythmia, cyanosis, decreased exercise capacity, ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction, heart failure, atrioventricular valve insufficiency, protein-losing enteropathy,&#xD;
      thrombosis, bleeding, venous insufficiency. Patients undergoing the Fontan procedure&#xD;
      generally do not experience a normal increase in cardiac output during exercise; therefore&#xD;
      exercise capacity is limited. It has been emphasized that hemodynamic, vascular and muscular&#xD;
      factors may be effective in decreasing exercise capacity. In previous studies, it has been&#xD;
      reported that cardiac output is the main factor affecting exercise capacity in patients with&#xD;
      Fontan, and this is due to insufficient increase in stroke volume. However, in previous&#xD;
      studies, it has been reported that factors such as insufficient precision of measurements&#xD;
      (resting echocardiography in supine position, resting cardiac MRI) and failure to see optimal&#xD;
      functions with maximum effort are insufficient to interpret the effects of hemodynamic&#xD;
      profile on exercise capacity. Therefore, non-invasively determining the hemodynamic profile&#xD;
      with a thoracic bioelectrical impedance device during exertion has gained importance. One&#xD;
      study reported the role of chronotropic insufficiency and impaired stroke volume in reduced&#xD;
      aerobic capacity in young Fontan patients. In addition to the hemodynamic profile, the&#xD;
      effects of muscle oxygenation, arterial stiffness and peripheral muscle strength on exercise&#xD;
      capacity were also mentioned in some separate studies. Changes in muscle oxygenation in&#xD;
      children undergoing the Fontan procedure indicate that the balance between the oxygen demand&#xD;
      of the tissues and the amount of oxygen supplied is impaired. It is thought that this may be&#xD;
      a mechanism that causes a decrease in exercise tolerance in this patient population. Also,&#xD;
      the function of peripheral muscles by acting as a pump is particularly important for venous&#xD;
      return in the Fontan circulation, and skeletal muscle mass is reduced in patients with&#xD;
      Fontan. Studies have shown that leg lean mass is closely related to an increase in blood flow&#xD;
      during exercise, and skeletal muscle contractions can generate pulsatile pulmonary blood flow&#xD;
      in some patients with Fontan circulation. A relationship was also found between arterial&#xD;
      stiffness and cardiorespiratory fitness in pediatric and adult patients with fontan&#xD;
      circulation, and it has been reported that practices to increase exercise capacity may be&#xD;
      important for the preservation of vascular structures. Exercise capacity in children and&#xD;
      adults undergoing the Fontan procedure is evaluated with field tests such as the&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). CPET is very&#xD;
      important in terms of providing objective data in terms of cardiopulmonary fitness in the&#xD;
      evaluation of maximal exercise capacity and being the gold standard. However, in terms of&#xD;
      determining the functional levels of individuals and maintaining their daily living&#xD;
      activities, submaximal exercise capacity, which is evaluated with both cheap and practical&#xD;
      6MWT, also gains importance. When the literature was searched, there was no study examining&#xD;
      the effects of hemodynamic, vascular and muscular profile on submaximal and maximal exercise&#xD;
      capacity. Therefore, in this study, it is aimed to determine and compare the effects of&#xD;
      hemodynamics, arterial stiffness and muscle oxygenation on maximal and submaximal exercise&#xD;
      capacity in patients with single ventricle who underwent Fontan procedure.&#xD;

    <measure>Maximal O2 consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>30-45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>CPET, the gold standard for cardiorespiratory fitness, will be used in the assessment of maximal exercise capacity based on maximal O2 consumption . Cardiopulmonary exercise test system (Cosmed Quark CPET, Rome, Italy) is a safe method in which the patient can be monitored via ECG during the execution of the individual on a treadmill. The most commonly used method for KPET applied with a treadmill is the Bruce protocol. However, since the Bruce protocol prefers high workload preferences, the Modified Bruce/half Bruce protocol with intermediate increments will be used.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6MWT distance</measure>
    <time_frame>15-20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Submaximal exercise capacity based on 6MWT distance will be assessed with the 6MWT. The standard test protocol will be applied in a continuous 30 meter corridor. The patient wearing comfortable clothes and shoes will be given standard instructions and verbal guidance during the test. The distance the patient walked during the test will be recorded in meters.</description>

    <measure>Cardiac output (Q) and stroke volume (SV)</measure>
    <time_frame>30-45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiac output (Q) and stroke volume (SV) during CPET and 6MWT will be evaluated non-invasively using PhysioFlow (PF07 Enduroâ„¢, Manatec Biomedical, France), a thoracic bioelectrical impedance device. The device has been validated in children and adults, and between the peak cardiac output obtained from the device and the peak cardiac output obtained according to the Fick equation; Relationships were reported with rest (r=0.89; p&lt;0.001), submaximal exercise (r=0.85; p&lt;0.001), and maximal exercise (r=0.94; p&lt; 0.01). During the test, the device will be appropriately placed over the patient and the device electrodes on the neck, on the back at the level of the xiphoid, on the left side of the spine, on the left at the level of the lower rib and right clavicle. Hemodynamic parameters such as peak cardiac output, peak cardiac index, and peak cardiac power will be recorded at rest and during testing.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper and lower extremity muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>15-20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Upper extremity muscle strength will be measured using a hand grip strength hand dynamometer (Jamar, Sammons Preston, Rolyon, Bolingbrook, IL, USA). Measurements shall be made using standard procedures, right and left sides, with the arms at the side of the trunk, the elbow in a 90 degree flexion position, and the forearm and wrist in a neutral position. The highest of the three measurements will be considered as hand grip strength. For lower extremity muscle strength, the maximum isometric muscle strength of the Quadriceps femoris muscle will be measured with a dynamometer (Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette, Indiana).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2)</measure>
    <time_frame>30-45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle oxygenation will be measured during CPET and 6MWT. Muscle oxygenation will be assessed with the Moxy monitor (Moxy, Fortiori Design LLC, Minnesota, USA), a device that measures local oxygen saturation (SmO2) in muscle capillaries using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). During the tests, Moxy will be placed on the vastus lateralis muscle of the participant's dominant leg, midway between the greater trochanter and lateral epicondyle of the femur. After five minutes of sitting resting, SmO2 and THb will be recorded as resting data. During the test, the Moxy data will be recorded continuously and the average value of the recorded data from the beginning to the last moment of the test will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Arterial stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>30-45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Arterial stiffness will be evaluated in the evaluation of vascular function. Arterial stiffness will be assessed using the pulse wave velocity (PWV) technique with an oscillometer-based device, the Mobil-O-GRAPH (TG) (I.E.M., Stolberg, Germany). Pulse waves will be recorded by placing the proximal sensor of the device in the places where the carotid artery and the distal sensor of the femoral artery are best palpated. The distance between these two points and the pulse propagation velocity will be calculated with the help of a computer in m/sec. High velocity data indicates high arterial stiffness, and low velocity indicates less arterial stiffness.</description>
