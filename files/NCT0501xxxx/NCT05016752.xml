  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients are prone to blood stream infection (BSI) due to bone&#xD;
      marrow suppression, oral and gastrointestinal mucositis, endovascular tubes, and the&#xD;
      application of a large number of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The associated mortality rate is&#xD;
      as high as 7.1 %-42%. The use of antibiotics within one hour after the first observation of&#xD;
      hypotensive symptoms can guarantee a 79.9% survival rate. For every hour of delay, the&#xD;
      patient's survival rate will drop by 7.6%. At present, the blood culture test cycle is long&#xD;
      and the positive rate is low. Other infection-related indicators (PCT, CRP) or&#xD;
      next-generation sequencing are not highly specific and easy to be misdiagnosed. X-ray, CT and&#xD;
      other examinations only have a certain auxiliary value for the infected site. We need new&#xD;
      diagnostic tools to accurately identify pathogens. Nano-seq is a next-generation sequencing&#xD;
      technology for single-molecule, real-time sequencing and analysis. With ultra-long sequencing&#xD;
      read length, it can quickly and accurately identify BSI pathogens types, and give appropriate&#xD;
      drug sensitivity results based on drug resistance genes to meet the needs of 99.9% pathogen&#xD;
      screening. At the same time, we hope to conduct a prospective evaluation to target high-risk&#xD;
      groups of AML prone to BSI in the early stage. The intestine is the body's largest immune&#xD;
      organ and the largest reservoir of microbial pathogens. The expansion of certain gut&#xD;
      microbiota usually precedes BSI. If there is a correlation between the gut microbiota and&#xD;
      MDR-BSI, the colonization and changes of the intestinal flora can be used to predict the risk&#xD;
      of BSI in patients during treatment, and preventive measures such as early decolonization or&#xD;
      biological intervention will reduce the risk of infection in the future. Combined with&#xD;
      Nano-seq and various existing clinical pathogen detection technologies to reduce the&#xD;
      occurrence and progress of clinical BSI.&#xD;

      For AML patients with bloodstream infections, we analyzed and compared the sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, and consistency of Nano-seq and traditional blood culture tests, and evaluated&#xD;
      the advantages of Nano-seq for clinical diagnosis and treatment guidance of newly-treated AML&#xD;
      bloodstream infections. At the same time, the homology analysis of gut microbiota and&#xD;
      bloodstream infection strains was carried out to explore the correlation between gut&#xD;
      microbiota and bloodstream infection in newly treated AML patients.&#xD;
