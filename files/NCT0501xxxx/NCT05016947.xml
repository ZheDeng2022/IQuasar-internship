      This research study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of administering venetoclax and&#xD;
      inotuzumab ozogamicin in combination in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inotuzumab ozogamicin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of venetoclax in combination with inotuzumab ozogamicin for the&#xD;
      treatment of CD22-positive (CD22+) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and lymphoma&#xD;
      (B-LBL), hereafter referred to as &quot;ALL,&quot; in patients with disease relapsed from or refractory&#xD;
      (R/R) to prior intensive chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved venetoclax for ALL but it has&#xD;
      been approved for other uses. Venetoclax is an oral (pill) chemotherapy that works by&#xD;
      blocking the action of certain proteins in cancer cells that help those cells survive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved inotuzumab ozogamicin as a treatment&#xD;
      option for ALL but not in combination with other drugs. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is an&#xD;
      antibody-drug conjugate. An antibody-drug conjugate is a medication where a cancer drug&#xD;
      (chemotherapy) is attached to an antibody, an immune system protein, that targets a specific&#xD;
      protein on the cancer cell. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is combination of an antibody that targets&#xD;
      the CD22 protein on ALL cells and calicheamicin, a chemotherapy compound that kills cancer&#xD;
      cells. Once the antibody portion of inotuzumab ozogamicin binds to CD22 protein on cancer&#xD;
      cells, the calicheamicin is released into the cell, where it damages the cancer cell's DNA&#xD;
      and causes its death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for approximately 6-9 months depending on their&#xD;
      response to the study treatment and followed for two years after completion of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that 20 to 32 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abbvie is supporting this research study by providing the study drug venetoclax and funding&#xD;
      research tests and procedures.&#xD;

                  but none or minimal marrow involvement) are eligible if eligibility criteria&#xD;
                  otherwise met.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Participants with Philadelphia-chromosome positive B-ALL are eligible but&#xD;
                  must be refractory to 2 or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or refractory&#xD;
                  to ponatinib.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless due to Gilbert's&#xD;
                  syndrome or of non-hepatic origin (i.e. hemolysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ALT and AST ≤ 2.5x ULN, unless clearly due to disease, in which case ≤ 5x ULN is&#xD;

             chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) pregnancy test result within 14 days prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study drugs. Women of non-childbearing potential are those who are&#xD;
             postmenopausal greater than 1 year or who have had a bilateral tubal ligation or&#xD;
             hysterectomy. The effects of venetoclax and inotuzumab ozogamicin on the developing&#xD;
             human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men&#xD;
             must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry, during treatment, and for at least 8 and 5 months&#xD;
             after the last dose, respectively. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants on effective anti-retroviral&#xD;
             therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
             Medication list must be carefully reviewed to ensure no contra-indicated drug-drug&#xD;
             interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For participants with known evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the&#xD;
             HBV viral load must be confirmed to be undetectable (and appropriate suppressive&#xD;
             therapy must be initiated in consultation with an infectious disease expert, if&#xD;
             indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a known history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have an&#xD;
             undetectable HCV viral load confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment&#xD;
             does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial. The treating investigator must&#xD;
             review such cases with the overall PI prior to confirming eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with prior HSCT or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy&#xD;
             (autologous or allogeneic) are eligible if they are day +60 from cell infusion and do&#xD;
             not have active Glucksberg grade 2 or higher graft versus host disease (GVHD). Patient&#xD;
             must be off calcineurin inhibitor for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign and date written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute blast count of ≥25 K/µL prior to initiation of study treatment. Steroids,&#xD;
             hydroxyurea, and/or vincristine may be used to reduce blast count.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with venetoclax for relapsed disease; if venetoclax used during&#xD;
             first-line therapy, 60 or more days must have elapsed since last dose of venetoclax.&#xD;
             Note: The number of patients with prior receipt of venetoclax will be capped at 50% of&#xD;
             the participants enrolled in the dose expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment for ALL with chemotherapy within 14 days of first dose of study drugs except&#xD;
             for hydroxyurea, steroids, vincristine, and/or intra-thecal chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic central nervous systemic (CNS) disease and CNS-3 disease. Asymptomatic&#xD;
             CNS-2 disease is permitted. Prior CNS disease is not an exclusion. See Appendix B for&#xD;
             definition of CNS disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with history of decompensated hepatic cirrhosis, veno-occlusive disease&#xD;
             (VOD)/sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS), or severe liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with uncontrolled intercurrent illness, or severe acute or chronic medical or&#xD;
             psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator may increase the risk associated with study participation or&#xD;
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and/or would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment into this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer&#xD;
             therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) except for alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances within 7 days that are strong&#xD;
             CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as fluconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, isavuconazole, and&#xD;
             clarithromycin) or inducers (such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin, carbamazepine,&#xD;
             and St. John's Wort) of CY3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are&#xD;
             constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently updated medical&#xD;
             reference (Appendix C). Of note, anti-fungal azole therapy may be re-introduced after&#xD;
             venetoclax dose escalation as outlined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have consumed grapefruit, grapefruit products, Seville oranges (used&#xD;
             in marmalade), or star fruit within 3 days prior to starting venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malabsorption syndrome or other conditions (such as inability to swallow pills) that&#xD;
             preclude enteral route of venetoclax administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit adherence to&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of venetoclax and&#xD;
             inotuzumab ozogamicin on the developing human fetus are unknown with the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. There is an unknown but potential risk for&#xD;
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with venetoclax&#xD;
             and inotuzumab ozogamicin and therefore breastfeeding should be discontinued.&#xD;
