      To explore the efficacy of treatment of pulmonary cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV2 with a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody to IL-2 (Basiliximab) in addition to current standard of care vs current&#xD;
      standard of care with the primary efficacy endpoint being the proportion of subjects alive&#xD;
      and free of ventilator support, defined as intubation and requiring mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      at Day 28 from time of randomization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current pandemic driven by SARS-CoV2 creating the COVID-19 disease state is creating&#xD;
      enormous healthcare challenges globally with limited treatment paradigms outside of&#xD;
      supportive medical, and intensive care measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the human population was entirely naïve to this viral pathogen, a particularly vigorous&#xD;
      response of the immune cascade through cell-mediated mechanisms is a driving force behind the&#xD;
      lethality of this disease in susceptible individuals. It is not presently understood why&#xD;
      specific populations are at higher risk for disease state progression outside of traditional&#xD;
      parameters such as age and pre-existing co-morbid health states. Furthermore, we lack a&#xD;
      priori ways of identifying which SARS-COv2 infected patient may ultimately develop a&#xD;
      &quot;hyperactive&quot; immune response that leads to the &quot;cytokine storm&quot; or &quot;cytokine release&#xD;
      syndrome&quot;, and the resultant cell, tissue, and organ system dysfunction.(1) Hypotheses in&#xD;
      this area may include viral load phenomenon, aberration in immune/inflammatory regulatory&#xD;
      check-points (JAK-STAT, JNK etc.), or underlying case dependent genetic factors (HLA etc.)&#xD;
      influencing the immune system (2). Once the cytokine storm drives the clinical endpoint&#xD;
      above, an affected patient who survives will become high risk for secondary pathogenic&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous remdesivir (3) along with dexamethasone (4, 5) have become standard of care&#xD;
      therapeutics. The FDA recently provided emergency use authorization (EUA) for a novel&#xD;
      SARS-COV2 neutralizing monoclonal antibody cocktail targeting the spike protein that docks&#xD;
      with the ACE2 receptor on susceptible cells (Regeneron) (5). Rapid development of robust&#xD;
      viral treatment strategies and vaccine development are the key strategies to managing&#xD;
      SARS-COV2 in the long term. To this end, the FDA will be reviewing an EUA application for&#xD;
      Pfizer's mRNA vaccine in early December, with similar review expected for Moderna's mRNA&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, promising these developments are, thousands of patients are dying from cytokine&#xD;
      storm mediated endpoints on a daily basis in the United States and across the world during&#xD;
      the ongoing third wave/surge of COVID-19. There is broad recognition of this cytokine&#xD;
      phenomenon, and in this era of targeted interleukin therapy for autoimmune disease states, a&#xD;
      multitude of FDA approved monoclonal antibodies targeted to specific interleukins exist. Many&#xD;
      institutions adopted IL-6 as a target for mitigation of the cytokine storm, and are utilizing&#xD;
      tocilizumab (Actemra ®, Roche/Genentech) as a treatment (6) Sarilumab (Kevzara ®,&#xD;
      Sanofi/Regeneron), another monoclonal Ab to IL-6, underwent rapid assessment for use in&#xD;
      COVID-19(7). Both therapeutics did not meet primary specified endpoints in broader, Phase 2-3&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies targeted the Th2/Tfh cytokine IL-6, as it plays a role in cytokine mediated&#xD;
      inflammation in the lungs (9, 10) There is evidence that Il-6 can be induced within several&#xD;
      hours by certain viral species (11) perhaps providing another reason why this was chosen as a&#xD;
      target. Finally, this cytokine may serve as a target based on existing protocols to treat&#xD;
      macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and based on early evidence of cytokine expression&#xD;
      patterns in patients infected with SARS-COV2 in Wuhan, PRC (2, 12-14). Classically, however,&#xD;
      Th2/Tfh related cytokines are associated with antibody mediated immune memory and response,&#xD;
      and though Th2/Tfh cytokines play a crucial role in acute inflammation, we have not seen&#xD;
      protocols that target differentiating cytokines that drive Th0 to Th1 maturation, or Th1&#xD;
      specific cytokines. The Th1 cytokine profile is more consistently demonstrated in almost all&#xD;
      early viral infection, and therefore, we view these cytokines as potential targets for&#xD;
      therapy to prevent or mitigate the cytokine storm (Figure 1) (2, 12). Cytokine storm is a&#xD;
      downstream manifestation of the viral induced host response that represents either failure of&#xD;
      the initial host response to mitigate viral load, an uncontrolled late cytotoxic T-cell&#xD;
      activity, or both. There is no evidence that targeted therapy against Th1 cytokines impairs&#xD;
      the host response with strong clinical evidence supporting use in other EBV mediated&#xD;
      secondary HLH syndromes (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cytokine environment in which antigen primed T cells differentiate determines the subset&#xD;
      that develops. In particular, IL-4 is essential for the development of Th2 response and&#xD;
      IFN-gamma, IL-12 and IL-18 all are important in the development of Th1 cells. Th1 cells&#xD;
      produce IL-2 and IFN-g, which in turn, promote the differentiation of fully cytotoxic T cells&#xD;
      from CD8+ precursors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent report published in Nature Medicine by Long et al. demonstrated a multi-fold higher&#xD;
      expression of Th-1 cytokines, in particular, TNF alpha and IL-2, and significant expression&#xD;
      of the IL-2 receptor subunit alpha in symptomatic COVID 19 patients in Wuhan.(16) A&#xD;
      subsequent report published in Science Immunology by Lee et al. (17) demonstrated similar&#xD;
      results through transcriptional and immuno-profiling techniques, and most recently a report&#xD;
      in Nature (18) did the same. Therefore, among all immunomodulatory therapies, we view that&#xD;
      targeting the Th1 response to be a key strategy. We propose targeting the IL-2R with&#xD;
      Basiliximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basiliximab (Simulect ®) is a monoclonal antibody against a subunit of IL-2 and is FDA&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of acute renal transplant rejection, and is used off label in many&#xD;
      other cases of transplant rejection mitigation.(2, 12) This agent has a long track record of&#xD;
      safety and we believe among Th1 cytokine targets, to be a safe target for inhibition in&#xD;
      SARS-COV2 induced cytokine storm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional novel methodologies, including treatment with orally approved FDA approved&#xD;
      JAK-STAT inhibitors (2) sirolimus (19-21) or calcineurin inhibitors (12) may serve as a&#xD;
      broader opportunity to maintain suppression of inflammation following acute phase cytokine&#xD;
      storm intervention with Basilixamab. One new area of interest is in complement mitigation,&#xD;
      and inhibitors (eciluzimab) targeting this more teleologically more primal cascade may have a&#xD;
      role (12, 22).&#xD;
