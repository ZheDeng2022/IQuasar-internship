      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group,&#xD;
      active-controlled Phase III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LXI-15028&#xD;
      50mg comparing with Lansoprazole 30 mg after the treatment of duodenal ulcer in Chinese&#xD;
      patients for up to 6 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Screening-eligible subjects will be randomized into LXI-15028 50 mg group or Lansoprazole 30&#xD;
      mg group at Visit 1 at the ratio of 1:1 and receive study treatment continuously for 4 or 6&#xD;
      weeks.Subjects will take the first dose of the investigational drug on the morning of the&#xD;
      randomization day or on the next morning of the randomization day, and start to complete the&#xD;
      subject's diary from the day of study treatment initiation(Day 1). After 4 weeks treatment,&#xD;
      subjects will return to the study institution for Visit 3. For the subjects who achieve&#xD;
      endoscopic healing at Visit 3,the study treatment will be terminated.The subjects who fail to&#xD;
      achieve endoscopic healing at Visit 3 will receive newly dispensed investigational products&#xD;
      for another 2 weeks' treatment and then complete Visit 4.All subjects will receive telephone&#xD;
      follow-up (Visit 5) on Day 28 ± 3 after the last dose of the investigational products.&#xD;
