  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High rates of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and high saturated fatty acid (SFA) fraction in the&#xD;
      liver both have been associated with poor metabolic health and hepatic insulin resistance.&#xD;
      Interestingly, the end product of DNL is mainly SFA. So far it is unknown whether it is the&#xD;
      process of DNL or the accumulation of SFA per se that leads to hepatic insulin resistance.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is of interest to compare the effect of a diet that modifies directly hepatic&#xD;
      SFA content (4-week high SFA diet) and a diet that changes SFA indirectly by modifying rates&#xD;
      of DNL (4-week high fructose diet). To this end, 18 overweight/obese, but otherwise healthy,&#xD;
      males and females will take part in the randomized dietary interventions. The primary outcome&#xD;
      is hepatic insulin sensitivity (suppression of EGP during clamp) upon a 4-week high SFA diet&#xD;
      versus a 4-week fructose diet.&#xD;

      Rationale: High rates of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and high saturated fatty acid (SFA)&#xD;
      fraction in the liver both have been associated with poor metabolic health and hepatic&#xD;
      insulin resistance. Interestingly, the end product of DNL is mainly SFA. So far it is unknown&#xD;
      whether it is the process of DNL or the accumulation of SFA per se that leads to hepatic&#xD;
      insulin resistance. This is a clinically relevant question, as it will give novel insights&#xD;
      towards the best strategy for prevention and treatment of hepatic insulin resistance.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is of interest to compare the effect of a diet that modifies directly hepatic&#xD;
      SFA content (high SFA diet) and a diet that changes SFA indirectly by modifying rates of DNL&#xD;
      (high fructose diet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the effect of a 4-week high SFA diet compared to a 4-week high&#xD;
      fructose diet on hepatic insulin sensitivity, on hepatic SFA fraction and DNL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a randomized intervention study comparing the effects of a 4-week high&#xD;
      SFA diet compared to a 4-week high fructose diet on hepatic insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 24 overweight/obese, but otherwise healthy, males and females (BMI 27-38&#xD;
      kg/m2), 45-75 years, will participate in the study. Of these 24 included participants, 18 are&#xD;
      expected to meet the study criteria and take part in the measurements following the&#xD;
      screening, of these 14 need to complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants follow a 4-week high SFA diet and a 4-week high fructose diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is hepatic insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      (suppression of EGP during clamp) upon a 4-week high SFA diet versus a 4-week fructose diet.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are DNL upon 4-week high SFA versus 4-week high fructose, and delta&#xD;
      (baseline-end intervention) hepatic SFA fraction upon 4-week high SFA versus 4-week high&#xD;
      fructose.&#xD;
