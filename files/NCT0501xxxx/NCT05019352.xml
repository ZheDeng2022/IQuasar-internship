  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CYTOHEP study is a prospective, randomized, single center, open-label, controlled&#xD;
      intervention trial to assess the benefit of extracorporeal hemoadsorption using the CytoSorb&#xD;
      device in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. The primary goal for this trial is to&#xD;
      assess whether the CytoSorb device used in addition to continuous renal replacement therapy&#xD;
      (CRRT) will be able to significantly reduce bilirubin in the patient blood as compared to the&#xD;
      control group treated with CRRT alone (i.e., without extracorporeal hemoadsorption).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this study is based on considerations about the role of systemic&#xD;
      inflammation in acute decompensation of liver cirrhosis and ACLF, in-vitro data of the&#xD;
      effectiveness CytoSorb for the removal of molecules with a pathophysiological role in&#xD;
      acute-on-chronic liver failure, and recent reports on the successful use of extracorporeal&#xD;
      hemoadsorption in combination with CRRT in critically ill patients with acute liver&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver cirrhosis is a major healthcare problem. The clinical course of cirrhosis can be&#xD;
      separated in compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. Patients with compensated cirrhosis are&#xD;
      largely asymptomatic and the development of decompensating events is a major hallmark in the&#xD;
      course of the disease as median survival decreases from 12 years to less than 2 years. The&#xD;
      development of extrahepatic organ complications in decompensated cirrhosis has been&#xD;
      identified as a major prognostic milestone and has been described as acute-on-chronic liver&#xD;
      failure (ACLF). ACLF is understood as a dynamic process and may evolve within days leading to&#xD;
      multi-organ failure with renal failure being the most common organ involvement (56%),&#xD;
      followed by liver and coagulation failure (44% and 28%, respectively). ACLF is associated&#xD;
      with a high 28-day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During recent years, systemic inflammation has been recognized as a major driver of hepatic&#xD;
      decompensation and progression of liver cirrhosis to ACLF. Importantly, systemic inflammation&#xD;
      was described as an important trigger for development of extrahepatic organ failures, such as&#xD;
      renal failure, development of hepatopulmonary syndrome, cirrhotic cardiomyopathy and hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy. Systemic inflammation is particularly relevant in the pathogenesis of acute&#xD;
      hepatic decompensation and is also associated with reduced survival. Therefore, elimination&#xD;
      of drivers of inflammatory response and inflammatory cytokines in addition to established&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches aiming at a reduction of bacterial translocation and mitigation of&#xD;
      portal hypertension may help control excessive inflammatory activity and thus support hepatic&#xD;
      recompensation. Previous in-vitro examinations and studies in non-cirrhotic inflammatory&#xD;
      disorders have shown that proinflammatory cytokines and other factors can effectively be&#xD;
      removed by extracorporeal hemoadsorption in the CytoSorb adsorber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CYTOHEP study is designed as a prospective, randomized, single center, open-label,&#xD;
      controlled intervention trial to assess the benefit of extracorporeal hemoadsorption using&#xD;
      the CytoSorb device in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. The primary goal for&#xD;
      this pilot trial is to assess whether the CytoSorb device used in addition to CRRT will be&#xD;
      able to significantly reduce bilirubin in the patient blood as compared to the control group&#xD;
      treated with CRRT alone (i.e., without extracorporeal hemoadsorption).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this trial, CRRT will be initiated early, i.e., in patients with acute kidney injury&#xD;
      (AKI) Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) stage 3. For safety assessment, a&#xD;
      third group will be assessed without early initiation of CRRT and extracorporeal&#xD;
      hemoadsorption. After trial inclusion, all patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion in&#xD;
      one of the study groups.&#xD;
