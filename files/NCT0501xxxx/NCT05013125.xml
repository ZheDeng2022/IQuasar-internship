      This study hypothesizes that more adenomas will be detected using the ENDO-AID assisted&#xD;
      Colonoscopy compared to conventional colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-centre, randomized, same-day, back-to-back tandem colonoscopy trial comparing&#xD;
      Adenoma Missed Rate and Adenoma Detection Rate in ENDO-AID assisted colonoscopy and&#xD;
      conventional colonoscopy.&#xD;

      Colorectal cancer is the third common cancer in the world and the commonest cancer in Hong&#xD;
      Kong. Most sporadic colorectal cancers arise from benign polyps via adenoma-carcinoma&#xD;
      sequence or the serrated polyp-carcinoma sequence. There are reports of unexpectedly high&#xD;
      risk of interval carcinomas, as high as up to 9%, raising concerns about the effectiveness of&#xD;
      colonoscopy in preventing colorectal cancers. Different techniques have been described to&#xD;
      improve the area of mucosa visualised but lesions may still be missed due to failure of&#xD;
      identification by the endoscopist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer Aided diagnosis (CAD) assisted colonoscopy is becoming increasingly popular to&#xD;
      address human error. Deep learning technology has surpassed human learning and advancement in&#xD;
      technology now allows real-time Artificial Intelligence to assist colonoscopists in polyp&#xD;
      detection.&#xD;
