      Demonstrate safety and efficacy of TAPS delivered by a Cala device as a treatment for action&#xD;
      tremor in subjects with Parkinson's disease hand tremor&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 patients with PD with at least mild postural tremor were enrolled in a four-week,&#xD;
      prospective, single-arm, open-label study of twice daily TAPS therapy. Due to the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic, TAPS devices were shipped to patients to run the study remotely. Unsupervised&#xD;
      motion assessments were captured at home, and at the beginning and end of the four weeks by&#xD;
      telemedicine.&#xD;

          -  Clinically significant postural tremor as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Dominant hand/arm exhibiting postural tremor ≥ 2 (while in the off state) as&#xD;
                  assessed by the MDS-UPDRS postural tremor score&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable dose of Parkinson's disease medications, if applicable, for 30 days prior to&#xD;
             study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to comply with study protocol requirements including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Having the ability to do telemedicine or video calls for study visits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  remaining on a stable dosage of Parkinson's medications, if applicable, during&#xD;
                  the duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  no significant caffeine consumption within 8 hours of study visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Implanted electrical medical device, such as a pacemaker, defibrillator, or deep brain&#xD;
             stimulator&#xD;
