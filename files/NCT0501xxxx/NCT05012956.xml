  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To measure abdominal wall compliance (AWC) during gynaecologic laparoscopy and assess its&#xD;
      relation to the pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) score of the same individual,&#xD;
      and determine a relationship if present.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To characterize abdominal wall compliance (AWC), sterile reflective markers are attached to&#xD;
      the abdominal wall by means of surgical tape, and the movement of these markers will be&#xD;
      tracked with an optical tracker device. As during normal surgery, the intra-abdominal&#xD;
      pressure (IAP) measured by the insufflator device will be recorded and stored on a secure&#xD;
      computer with dedicated software. The pelvic organ quantification (POP-Q) score for each&#xD;
      patient is determined pre-surgery as part of the standard of care. A biomechanical model will&#xD;
      use reflective marker displacement (RMD) and IAP to calculate AWC. The POP-Q score will then&#xD;
      be used to investigate a relation between AWC and degree of prolapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to state that the trial does not intervene with the standard of care before-&#xD;
      and during surgery. The used equipment is non-invasive and only requires about 5 minutes to&#xD;
      be set up before the start of surgery. This set up comprises placing the optical tracker in&#xD;
      the operating room such that it has a line of sight on the patient's abdomen and attaching&#xD;
      the sterile markers to the abdominal wall. Therefore the trail does not add any additional&#xD;
      risk to the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient scheduled for gynecologic laparoscopy will be asked to participate in the study.&#xD;
      If the patient wants to participate, she is presented the informed consent form (ICF). If&#xD;
      both patient and clinician in charge sign the ICF, the patient is included in the study. The&#xD;
      table below shows the patient specific information stored as part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation is based on a previous study (S61346), where we measured vaginal wall&#xD;
      stiffness (the inverse of compliance) in patients with varying degrees of prolapse. 20 POP&#xD;
      patients and 20 control group patients will be included.&#xD;
