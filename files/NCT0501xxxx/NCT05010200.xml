      This proof of concept study is designed to test the safety and tolerability of PGV001-based&#xD;
      personalized multi-peptide vaccines in combination with CDX-301 in subjects with a history of&#xD;
      aggressive prostate cancer, in the tumor free adjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also assess the capacity of PGV001-based a multi-peptide therapeutic vaccines&#xD;
      to produce a robust tumor antigen-specific T lymphocytic response in the peripheral&#xD;
      circulation when combined with CDX-301, and it will expand the collective body of knowledge&#xD;
      regarding the identification, selection and use of mutation-derived tumor antigens for&#xD;
      personalized immunotherapy in prostate cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed trial will be to assess the following hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mutation-derived tumor antigens (MTA) may arise as a result of somatic non-synonymous&#xD;
      variations-including nucleotide substitutions, as well as small insertions and&#xD;
      deletions-which occur during tumorigenesis. Somatic mutations may be characterized through&#xD;
      the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies, and the resulting sequence data used to&#xD;
      identify TSA. Sequence data can inform the design of patient-specific immune-based therapies,&#xD;
      which may be capable of inducing quantitative changes in the concentration of circulating&#xD;
      antigen-specific T lymphocytes directed against TSA, which may in-turn lead to&#xD;
      immune-mediated elimination of residual malignant cells.&#xD;
