  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if Multiple Myeloma (MM) cells are sensitive to the&#xD;
      chemotherapy used in transplant or not. The main chemotherapy agent utilized in stem cell&#xD;
      transplant is melphalan. The study will utilize 1/10 of the dose used in transplant to study&#xD;
      sensitivity of the tumor to melphalan. Melphalan is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for transplant for MM patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no method to predict whether a patient will have benefit from stem cell&#xD;
      transplant or not. The usual approach is to proceed to stem cell transplant as long as a&#xD;
      patient with MM has adequate organ function, meaning heart, kidney, lungs and other organs&#xD;
      can tolerate the complications from transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, all participants will already have had pre-collection bone marrow aspirate as&#xD;
      standard of care that will be available for minimal residual disease (MRD) testing by NGS&#xD;
      platform. Participants will receive only one, low-dose of melphalan (Evomela) intravenously.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to return to clinic for a follow-up visit at one week and two&#xD;
      weeks after the infusion. Another bone marrow aspirate will be performed after 2 weeks from&#xD;
      the day of Evomela administration. After the study, participants will have a standard-of-care&#xD;
      (SOC) autologous stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the impact of a test dose of low dose melphalan (16&#xD;
      mg/m2) before autologous hematopoietic cell transplant on disease volume measured by Next&#xD;
      Generation Sequencing (NGS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess safety of low dose melphalan after CD34 (cluster of differentiation 34)&#xD;
           collection and before high-dose melphalan-based autologous stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the impact of a test dose of low dose melphalan (16 mg/m2) before autologous&#xD;
           hematopoietic cell transplant on disease volume measured by peripheral blood Mass&#xD;
           Spectrometry.&#xD;
