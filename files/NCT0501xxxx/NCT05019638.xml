      Pain control is a chief domain in patient-centered care and may play a key role in&#xD;
      outcome-driven reimbursement as a focus on payment strategies shifts in this direction. The&#xD;
      Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services has developed the Total Performance Score for&#xD;
      Hospitals, which is factored into the reimbursement for provided services. Pain Management is&#xD;
      one of the main contributors to the score. Moreover, pain control has been shown to improve&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, which is of increasing importance in medicine today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic where we consume 80% of the world's&#xD;
      narcotics with only 5% of the world's population. Prescription opioids may play a major role&#xD;
      in up to 40% of opioid overdose deaths. Orthopedic surgeons are the top prescribing surgical&#xD;
      specialists and the fourth-largest overall prescriber of narcotic medication, representing&#xD;
      7.7% of total opioid prescriptions. Given the magnitude and implications of the opioid&#xD;
      epidemic, orthopedic surgeons have been tasked with delivering adequate pain control while&#xD;
      avoiding excessive narcotic prescriptions that can lead to opioid addiction and&#xD;
      opioid-related deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthesia has been extensively studied for operatively managed rotational ankle&#xD;
      fractures. Foot and ankle surgery patients receiving regional anesthesia have been reported&#xD;
      to have lower pain scores and less narcotic usage for up to 8 weeks post-operatively. In a&#xD;
      prospective cohort study of ankle fracture patients, Investigators have demonstrated improved&#xD;
      pain management in patients who received single-shot regional anesthesia as compared to&#xD;
      control patients. In a blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial, it was reported&#xD;
      lower pain scores and longer analgesia in patients receiving peripheral nerve block as&#xD;
      compared to control patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local multimodal analgesia has been used extensively in the setting of total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty. Numerous studies have investigated the effect of these injections and shown a&#xD;
      decrease in perioperative pain and the use of perioperative narcotics. A team of&#xD;
      investigators looked at multimodal analgesia injections in femur fractures of all kinds. They&#xD;
      found that in patients receiving the injection, their pain was decreased over the first&#xD;
      postoperative day along with consuming fewer narcotics over the same time frame.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the randomization in this study resulted in an unequal distribution of&#xD;
      injuries that may have biased the results. It was noted, &quot;further investigations are required&#xD;
      to establish the efficacy of this multimodal protocol for the individual surgical procedures&#xD;
      considered.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several aspects of the proposed study are innovative and the results of which will provide&#xD;
      evidence for significant change. The proposed studies focuses on one of the most common&#xD;
      skeletal injuries treated with surgical intervention by orthopaedic surgeons. These&#xD;
      investigators are thus focusing on an area with widespread implications where a small change&#xD;
      in practice could result in extensive change through the system. The overarching goal for&#xD;
      this investigation is to optimize postoperative pain control delivery while limiting narcotic&#xD;
      medication consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no studies that compare the effectiveness and cost between local&#xD;
      multimodal analgesia and regional anesthesia as it relates to rotational ankle fractures.&#xD;
      Despite extensive use in arthroplasty, local multimodal analgesia has limited usage in the&#xD;
      setting of fracture or acute injury. This represents a significant area of innovation and&#xD;
      growth in the realm of orthopaedic traumatology. Given the commonplace nature of ankle&#xD;
      fractures and the ability to perform regional anesthesia given the lack of compartment&#xD;
      syndrome risk, these injuries represent the ideal candidate to explore a new mode of&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia. Additionally, incorporating an anti-inflammatory medication into the&#xD;
      local multimodal injection cocktail is novel. While a stigma associated with&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medications and impaired bone healing exist, single usage should be&#xD;
      relatively low risk while providing significant local pain relief. The ability of local&#xD;
      multimodal analgesia to provide similar pain control as regional anesthesia would expand the&#xD;
      possibility of using local multimodal analgesia in locations that do not have an&#xD;
      appropriately trained anesthesiologist for regional anesthesia. It may also improve the&#xD;
      workflow and open the possibility of investigation as it relates to other common fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that ankle fracture patients with post-operative local multimodal analgesia&#xD;
      will have similar Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores as patients with post-operative&#xD;
      regional anesthesia at 24 hours post-surgery. Secondary analyses will compare VAS pain scores&#xD;
      at 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours post-operatively in addition to post-operative narcotic usage between&#xD;
      the two groups.&#xD;
