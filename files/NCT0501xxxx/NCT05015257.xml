  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Burkina Faso the number of severely acute malnourished (SAM) children successfully treated&#xD;
      has increased since the implementation of community-based management of acute malnutrition.&#xD;
      SAM children with oedema have a higher risk of dying than SAM without oedema; they require&#xD;
      inpatient care. Several theories have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of oedema&#xD;
      in SAM, but its etiology remains unclear. Knowledge on the nutritional adequacy of&#xD;
      therapeutic regimens in kwashiorkor is limited. The World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      recommends to use in the treatment of complicated SAM a therapeutic milk 'F75' in the&#xD;
      stabilization phase; F75+ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF) or F100 at the transition&#xD;
      phase. Alternatively the local formulas (maize flour, milk powder, oil, sugar,&#xD;
      mineral-vitamin complex CMV) can be used in case of shortage or intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Nutritional Rehabilitation and Education Center of the University Hospital of Bobo&#xD;
      Dioulasso it was found that some SAM children whose oedema resolved under F75 in the&#xD;
      stabilization phase, re-developed oedema as they entered the transition phase with RUTF. RUTF&#xD;
      has the same nutritional value as F100 but contains iron unlike F100 (&lt;0.07 mg/100 mL). It&#xD;
      was observed that RUTF in some cases may be associated with higher mortality, probably due to&#xD;
      high iron content (10-14 mg/100 g), which may increase the risk of infections and the&#xD;
      formation of free radicals, thereby increasing damage to the body's cells. Clinical trials&#xD;
      evaluating the current guidelines for the treatment of SAM with oedema are scarce. A better&#xD;
      understanding of the risk factors affecting the effectiveness of the nutritional therapeutic&#xD;
      protocol for children with Kwashiorkor will be useful to improve their care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine whether the use of transition phase diets&#xD;
      (Plumpy-Nut®+F75 or F100 or alternative F75+/- CMV+ Plumpy-Nut®) affect oedema resolving in&#xD;
      Kwashiorkor children and to investigate the underlying factors for the relapse or&#xD;
      non-responsiveness to the therapeutic treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is a life threatening condition that requires urgent&#xD;
      attention and appropriate management to reduce mortality and promote recovery among children.&#xD;
      SAM is defined by 1) a weight-for-height Z-score more than three standard deviations (SD)&#xD;
      below the median based on the 2006 WHO growth standards, 2) a mid-upper arm circumference&#xD;
      (MUAC) of less than 115 mm or 3) by the presence of nutritional edema. Signs such as edema,&#xD;
      mucocutaneous changes, hepatomegaly, lethargy, anorexia, anemia, severe immune deficiency and&#xD;
      rapid progression to mortality characterize a state commonly coined as &quot;complicated SAM&quot;.&#xD;
      Kwashiorkor (SAM with edema) is one of the forms of complicated SAM commonly distinguished by&#xD;
      the unmistakable presence of bipedal edema. Kwashiorkor is characterized by the following&#xD;
      clinical signs: 1) edemas symmetrical, painless, soft, bilateral, ascending, pitting; 2)&#xD;
      lesions of the skin and integuments; 3) ulcerations and depigmentation; 4) alopecia; 5)&#xD;
      constant weight loss marked by edema; 6) hepatomegaly; 7) clinical anemia; 8) intestinal&#xD;
      transit disorders: persistent diarrhea, vomiting; 9) anorexia and behavioral disorders&#xD;
      (apathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe acute malnutrition results in high mortality rates of up to half a million child&#xD;
      deaths annually. Undernourished children are at higher risk of mortality ranging from&#xD;
      three-times more risk among children with moderate malnutrition to 10-times in SAM children&#xD;
      compared to well-nourished children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine whether the use of different transition phase&#xD;
      diets affect oedema resolving in Kwashiorkor children and to investigate the underlying&#xD;
      factors for the relapse or non-responsiveness to the therapeutic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses to be tested&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first hypothesis is that RUTF (Plumpy-Nut®) because of its content in iron may&#xD;
           compromise the effectiveness of the transition phase in children with kwashiorkor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second hypothesis is that underlying factors including co-morbidities and&#xD;
           epigenetics may explain a difference in response to therapeutic regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of four used&#xD;
      transition phase diets in Kwashiorkor children in their transition to the rehabilitation&#xD;
      phase. The four dietary regimens that will be tested are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. F100;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RUTF+F75;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. RUTF+alternative F75 with complex mineral-vitamin (CMV); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. RUTF+alternative F75 without CMV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When it is decided to move to the transition phase, the child will be assigned to one of the&#xD;
      treatments depending on the treatment received during the stabilization phase and the results&#xD;
      of the appetite test. That is a child who accepts the Plumpy Nut will receive it in&#xD;
      combination with their regimen they had during the stabilization phase. If a child does not&#xD;
      accept Plumpy Nut, then they will received F100 regardless of their initial therapeutic food&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For those who received F75 in the stabilization phase, they will receive standard F75 +&#xD;
           Plumpy Nut&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For those who received alternative F75 with CMV in the stabilization phase, they will&#xD;
           receive alternative F75 with CMV + Plumpy Nut®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For those who received alternative F75 without CMV in the stabilization phase, they will&#xD;
           receive alternative F75 without CMV + Plumpy Nut®.&#xD;
