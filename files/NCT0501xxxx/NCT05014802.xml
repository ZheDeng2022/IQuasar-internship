  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate and compare the incidence of atrial arrhythmias (including&#xD;
      Post-Operative Atrial Fibrillation (POAF), atrial flutter, and atrial tachycardia) stratified&#xD;
      by baseline Utah fibrosis stages and overall fibrosis (%) of the left atrial wall area. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that patients with a higher baseline Utah fibrosis staging will&#xD;
      experience a higher incidence of POAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also aims to evaluate and compare the in-hospital mortality, length-of-stay (LOS),&#xD;
      complication rates (strokes, pneumonia, respiratory failure etc.) of the different Utah&#xD;
      fibrosis stage cohorts. Perform cost analysis and compare between patients with POAF and&#xD;
      patients without POAF. The investigators hypothesize that patients experiencing POAF will&#xD;
      have a higher mortality rate, longer LOS, greater complications, and therefore, additional&#xD;
      hospital costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a a prospective, observational cohort study. 50 patients undergoing cardiac&#xD;
      surgery (Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG), valvular etc.) without a history of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation will be given a baseline Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) upon which patients&#xD;
      will be assigned Utah stages I-IV based on their left atrial fibrosis pattern. Overall&#xD;
      fibrosis (%) of the left atrial wall area will also be collected. Patients will then undergo&#xD;
      their planned surgeries receiving management adherent to current guidelines and standard of&#xD;
      care procedures. Atrial arrhythmia incidence after surgical procedure will be collected using&#xD;
      in-hospital telemetry or serial Electrocardiogram (ECG) from all patients in their respective&#xD;
      cohorts. Cardiac surgery type, duration and any intraoperative complications will be&#xD;
      recorded. Other clinical and relevant demographical data will be collected at admission and&#xD;
      throughout patients' hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cardiac surgeries will be performed by experienced surgeons at Tulane Medical Center,&#xD;
      Washington University Medical Center Barnes Jewish Hospital, and University Medical Center&#xD;
      New Orleans, adhering to all relevant standard-of-care guidelines. MRI imaging will be&#xD;
      performed by experienced technicians and operators at Tulane Medical Center, Washington&#xD;
      University Medical Center Barnes Jewish Hospital, and University Medical Center New Orleans.&#xD;
      MRI Utah fibrosis staging will be performed and assessed by experienced operators at MARREK,&#xD;
      Inc., by using the Corview processing software with de-identified images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect a total recruitment of 50 subjects over a period of 6 months from&#xD;
      the Tulane Medical Center Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery Clinics, Washington&#xD;
      University Medical Center Barnes Jewish Hospital Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery&#xD;
      Clinics, as well as University Medical Center New Orleans Cardiology and Cardiothoracic&#xD;
      Surgery Clinics in order to complete the study. They expect to recruit 40 patients from&#xD;
      Washington University Medical Center and 10 patients from either Tulane Medical Center or&#xD;
      University Medical Center New Orleans.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of any atrial arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia etc.) from after their surgical procedure to their discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
Atrial arrhythmia is defined as any abnormal atrial rhythm episode continuing for more than 30 seconds, starting immediately after the patient arrives at the post-operation ICU. All atrial arrhythmia starting after the operation will be monitored and recorded. This will be measured using continuous telemetry and/or serial ECG monitoring.</description>

    <measure>Rate of in-hospital mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In-hospital mortality is defined as patient death during any point of hospital stay following cardiac surgery. This will be measured through patients medical chart review.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>LOS is defined as duration from admission to discharge in days in the hospital and ICU. This will be measured through patients medical chart review.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of acute respiratory failure</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Acute respiratory failure is any decrease in respiratory function resulting in hypoxemia (low arterial oxygen levels), hypercapnia (elevated levels of carbon dioxide gas) or a combination of the two. This will be measured through patients medical chart review.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
