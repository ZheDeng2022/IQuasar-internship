    <textblock>
      Prospective longitudinal multicentre observational study carried out on a population of&#xD;
      patients undergoing minimally invasive spine surgery and divided into two parallel cohorts&#xD;
      according to the presence or absence of a Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be assessed during 4 visits: At inclusion before surgery, at D0 (day of&#xD;
      surgery), at D1 (postoperative visit) and at M1 (follow-up visit).&#xD;

      On a population of patients undergoing minimally invasive lumbar spine surgery divided into&#xD;
      two cohorts of equal size according to the presence or absence of a Enhanced Recovery After&#xD;
      Surgery (ERAS) programme:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective To compare the percentage of therapeutic success achieved in each group one&#xD;
      month after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: to compare between groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative pain intensity at D1 and M1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analgesic consumption (in stages) at D1 and M1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain-free walking distance at M1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery conditions (duration of operation, duration of hospitalisation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of adverse events related to surgery (infection rate, 1 month recovery rate,&#xD;
           transfusion requirements)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emotional impact of the management&#xD;

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (Appendix 1) (also known as the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability) is the gold standard tool for assessing functional disability related to low back pain and functional recovery after surgery. It consists of ten questions rated from 0 to 5 (from most to least favourable). The result is expressed as a percentage according to the following formula [score obtained / (maximum score)] X 100. The maximum score is 50 if all the questions have been filled in, 45 if one question has not been filled in etc..... The disability rate, corresponding to the percentage, obtained is considered minimal between 0 and 20%, moderate between 21 and 40% and severe above 41%.&#xD;
Therapeutic success defined as an improvement ≥30% in the Oswestry Disability Index between initial and final visit is the primary endpoint</description>

    <measure>Evolution of Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale score and sub-scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>The emotional impact of the disease will be more precisely evaluated by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaire, a screening tool for the most common manifestations of anxiety and depressive disorders to be completed by the patient. The scale comprises 14 questions, with 7 items assessing anxiety and 7 items assessing depression.&#xD;
A minimum score of 10 on one of the sub-scores was retained as a criterion for detecting depressive or anxious manifestations. The HAD questionnaire will be completed by the patient at the inclusion visit (V1) and at the end of the study (V4).</description>
