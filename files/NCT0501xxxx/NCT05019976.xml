  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on using shortened courses of radiation for participants with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory Hodgkin/Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment radiation over 5-6 weeks is often&#xD;
      standard of care for many people with lymphoma, but doctors leading this study aim to find&#xD;
      out if using radiation for a shorter period of time can be safe for treating lymphoma and if&#xD;
      so, what is the safest shortened dose of radiation for participants.&#xD;
