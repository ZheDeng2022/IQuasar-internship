        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. 18≤ age ≤75 years at the screening visit, male or female;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosed with atopic dermatitis (according to the American Academy of Dermatology's&#xD;
             Guidelines of Care for The Management of Atopic Dermatitis, 2014[1]) at the screening&#xD;
             visit and:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. The subject has been suffering from the disease for more than 1 year at the time of&#xD;
             screening, and according to the judgment of the investigator, the subject has had poor&#xD;
             response to topical drugs such as corticosteroids, phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors&#xD;
             or calcineurin inhibitors (TCI), or it is not medically suitable for the subject to&#xD;
             receive topical drug treatment (e.g., there are important side effects or safety&#xD;
             risks);&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Poor response is defined as any of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. The patient has not achieved and maintained response or reached a low disease&#xD;
             activity state (equivalent to IGA 0=asymptomatic to 2=mild) despite regular use of&#xD;
             topical therapy during the 1 year before baseline; ii. The patient has received&#xD;
             systemic treatment for AD despite regular use of topical therapy during the 1 year&#xD;
             before baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
             b. At the screening and baseline visit, Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score&#xD;
             ≥3 (according to the validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis&#xD;
             [vIGA-AD™] scale, see Section 17.4 Appendix D), Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)&#xD;
             score≥16 (see Section 17.5, Appendix E), and≥10% body surface area (BSA) of AD&#xD;
             involvement(see Section 17.6, Appendix F); c. The average score of the maximum&#xD;
             pruritus intensity in the Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS) ≥4 (see&#xD;
             Section 17.1, Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: The baseline average score of maximum pruritus intensity in the PP-NRS will be&#xD;
             calculated based on the average value of the maximum pruritus intensity in the PP-NRS&#xD;
             score [daily score range 0-10] every day within 7 days before randomization. In these&#xD;
             7 days, the scores of at least 4 days are required for the calculation of the baseline&#xD;
             average score. If the patient's reporting days are less than 4 days in the 7 days&#xD;
             before the planned date of randomization, randomization should be postponed until the&#xD;
             requirements are met, but it is not allowed to exceed the maximum screening period of&#xD;
             28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;

             twice a day starting from at least 7 days before baseline and continue to use it&#xD;
             during the study period (see Section 8.1.1.2 Emollients).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) and male subjects who have not&#xD;
             undergone vasectomy must take highly effective contraceptive measures during the&#xD;

             [FSH]) and women with a record of surgical sterilization (i.e., tubal ligation or&#xD;
             hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) before the screening visit can be considered&#xD;
             infertile.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             i. Abstinence (acceptable only if it is part of the subject's routine lifestyle); ii.&#xD;
             Hormones (oral, patch, ring, injection, implant) combined with male condoms. This&#xD;
             measure must be used at least 30 days before the first study drug administration.&#xD;
