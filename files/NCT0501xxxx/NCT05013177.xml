      The study aims to investigate (1) if COVID-19 vaccine impacts on blood pressure, (2) the&#xD;
      extent of impact on blood pressure (if any), and (3) which groups of subjects are more&#xD;
      susceptible to be affected by COVID-19 vaccine on blood&#xD;

      Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has elicited global pandemic since January 2020. Until the end of&#xD;
      June 2021, the virus has caused 182 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 3.95 million deaths&#xD;
      worldwide. To stop the spread of virus, there has been rapid development of vaccine against&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2. Currently there has been 9 vaccines authorized for emergency use, and 8 vaccines&#xD;
      received full approval for use in various countries. Extensive studies have been showing the&#xD;
      efficacy of different types of vaccines against COVID-19 and its variants. Safety of COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccines has been a concern. Despite safety profile of different vaccines demonstrated in&#xD;
      phase 2/3 trials, there has been evolving evidence on adverse effects of some particular&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccines. One of the mostly known example is vaccine-induced thrombotic&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (VITT). Case series report4 and observational studies on ChAdOx1 nCoV-19&#xD;
      vaccine showed high level of autoantibodies to platelet factor-4 (PF4) which could contribute&#xD;
      to microvascular damage, micro-bleeding and platelet activation and therefore causes event of&#xD;
      thrombosis. Apart from the thrombotic risk of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, there has been studies&#xD;
      providing the preliminary data on effect of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine on blood pressure.&#xD;
      Yet there remains lack of evidence and detailed description on effect of COVID-19 vaccines&#xD;
      and blood pressure along the time. Given the vast population of hypertensive patients&#xD;
      worldwide, the increasing number of people being vaccinated and the importance of blood&#xD;
      pressure level to various human organs, it is essential to investigate the short- and&#xD;
      long-term effect of COVID-19 vaccine on blood pressure.&#xD;
