      The goal of this study is to learn more about how a nutritional supplement &quot;ketone ester&quot;&#xD;
      (deltaG Â®) has an effect on brain and heart function and on alcohol consumption in&#xD;
      individuals with and without alcohol use disorder. The study will use Fluorodeoxyglucose&#xD;
      (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) scans after a single dose of&#xD;
      ketone ester or Placebo in 10 people with alcohol use disorder and 10 healthy control&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study how a nutritional ketone ester may affect brain and&#xD;
      heart function in individuals who consume alcohol on a regular basis, and in healthy&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will see how the brain and heart responds, once after drinking the ketone ester and&#xD;
      once without drinking the ester (baseline) using a test called an FDG PET/CT scan. PET/CT&#xD;
      scans use small amounts of a radioactive imaging drug, a special camera and a computer to&#xD;
      evaluate organ and tissue functions. FDG PET/CT scans are routinely done for evaluation of&#xD;
      heart diseases. The study will test how the brain and heart function at rest and while&#xD;
      viewing pictures of alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves 4 or more visits: (1) a consent/screening visit, which can be completed in&#xD;
      a single day or divided over multiple days. Portions of the screening may occur using&#xD;
      telephone or video conference. (2) In-person MRI (if one hasn't been completed in the past&#xD;
      year). (3) In-person study visit that includes the drinking of the ketone ester, a FDG PET/CT&#xD;
      scan, and (4) a second in-person visit that a FDG PET/CT scan without drinking the ketone&#xD;
      ester. Depending on the scheduling for each of these visits, study involvement will last&#xD;
      approximately 8 weeks depending on scheduling restrictions. Following completion of the scan&#xD;
      visits (next business day), study staff will follow-up with individuals by phone to ask about&#xD;
      any changes to your health and to ensure that they did not experience any side effects from&#xD;
      the ketone ester, MRI scan or FDG PET/CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent will happen before any study related procedures are performed. Staff&#xD;
           will answer all questions during the process. The following will occur at the screening&#xD;
           session:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic information, such as date of birth, age, biological sex, race, and ethnicity&#xD;
           will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current address and contact information in order to register people into the University&#xD;
           of Pennsylvania electronic medical record system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of a urine sample of about 30 mL (approximately 2 tablespoons) to be used for&#xD;
           urinalysis, drug screening and pregnancy in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breathalyzer test to measure breath alcohol concentration (BrAC). A 0.000% BrAC is&#xD;
           required to continue with the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitals (blood pressure and pulse), weight and height. A doctor or nurse practitioner&#xD;
           will do a brief physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief psychiatric assessments called the 'MINI' and 'CSSRS'. During these interviews,&#xD;
           questions will be asked about current and past depressed mood symptoms, as well as other&#xD;
           psychiatric symptoms, including suicidal thinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a brief mental ability test called the 'Shipley Institute of Living Scale'.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short interview regarding alcohol and smoking history, behaviors, and mood and any drug&#xD;
           or alcohol use, and questions about any substance cravings or withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological questionnaires related to substance use, cravings, risk behaviors, mental&#xD;
           health, personality, depression and anxiety, quality of sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete questions about any current medication, recreational drugs or supplements use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a questionnaire about the presence of metal in the body to determine if it is&#xD;
           safe to undergo an MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A small amount of blood (approximately 2.75 tablespoons) will be drawn for screening lab&#xD;
           tests (a blood count and chemistry panel), genetics and metabolite analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete an oral swab rapid HIV test. If the test is positive, study staff will draw a&#xD;
           tablespoon of blood to conduct a confirmatory HIV blood test (i.e., to confirm the&#xD;
           positive oral test). If the blood test are positive for HIV, we will provide a referral&#xD;
           for medical care and a copy of the test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete several computer-based tasks on a laptop that will be provided by the study&#xD;
           team. These tasks will test the following brain cognition measures including: visual&#xD;
           memory, willingness to delay a reward offered, response time in reacting to specific&#xD;
           information on the screen, verbal learning and memory, impulsiveness, and reaction time&#xD;
           and accuracy when asked to match up a series of test pictures that are different shapes&#xD;
           and colors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the screening visit, will be available within 2 weeks to confirm if eligibility to&#xD;
      continue with the study and schedule the rest of the study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Brain MRI scan visit (1 hour):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scheduled if there was not an MRI in the past year. An MRI is a test that uses a magnetic&#xD;
      field and pulses of radio wave energy (pulse sequences) to make pictures of your brain. A&#xD;
      small meal will be provided before the MRI. MRI images are collected in a Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Imaging scanner. The MRI scan will be done to understand brain anatomy (the structure of the&#xD;
      brain) and the function of the brain during rest and when looking at pictures of alcohol. The&#xD;
      MRI will last up to 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a MRI safety form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remove any metal from the body&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Earplugs are provided for the noise from the MRI scanner, and subjects will be&#xD;
           positioned on the imaging table with head in the scanner, held comfortably in a special&#xD;
           head holder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undergo several scans (up to 60 minutes in total). Subjects will be instructed not to&#xD;
           move the head and to lie as still as possible during the scan (up to 60 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a Cue Reactivity task during the scan. In this task involves viewing pictures&#xD;
           of various items such as food or alcohol on the screen. Subjects will rate the items by&#xD;
           pressing a button. The task will take up to 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET Scanner Visits (this will last 3-4 hrs):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are asked to fast for 6 hours prior to the PET scanning visits. On the day of the&#xD;
      study visits the following will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meet a study team member at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take a Breathalyzer test to measure breath alcohol concentration. Must have a 0.000%&#xD;
           BrAC to continue with the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete questions about recent use drugs, alcohol, nicotine, and substance use and then&#xD;
           asked to give a urine sample. This will be used for a rapid urine drug test. Positive&#xD;
           test will be reviewed by the study doctor to determine if visit may continue. Woman of&#xD;
           childbearing potential will receive a urine pregnancy test. The result of the pregnancy&#xD;
           test must be negative to continue to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trained staff will placed two IVs to draw blood and give the FGD tracer. Staff will&#xD;
           measure vitals (blood pressure and pulse), weight and height.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A list of current medications and vitamins will be reviewed to determine any changes in&#xD;
           medications, dosage or frequency of use of any medications or vitamins since the&#xD;
           screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A ketone ester drink will be given on one of the 2 scan visits. There will be two study&#xD;
           visits that have the same procedures, except that on one study day subjects are asked to&#xD;
           drink a drink with the ketone ester, and on the other visit not drink the ketone ester.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Staff will perform an Echocardiography. This is an ultrasound of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the Echocardiography is complete, subjects will undergo a Positron Emission&#xD;
           Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) with FDG scan for approximately 60 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging of FDG is done with specialized cameras that can pick up the tiny radiation&#xD;
           signals given off by the radiotracer and determine where the signals come from. In this&#xD;
           way, we can form a picture of where the radiotracer goes after it is injected. The type&#xD;
           of scan is called a PET/CT scan, which uses a large doughnut shaped detection device to&#xD;
           provide a map of where radiotracers go in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject will be asked to remove any metal objects before entering the scanner. The FDG&#xD;
           tracer will be injected using the IV after positioning on the scanner. Subjects will lie&#xD;
           face up on the scanner table for about 1 hour, while the PET/CT machine collects imaging&#xD;
           information over the body. Blood samples will be drawn before the injection and at 5&#xD;
           other time points during the scan. Approximately 45 mL (about 9 teaspoons) of blood will&#xD;
           be collected during the scan. The blood will be used to measure radioactive counts&#xD;
           and/or test how the tracer is being metabolized by the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Staff will call to ask about any uncomfortable symptoms at any time during the&#xD;
      imaging scan process or in the 24 hours (day or night) following the study visits.&#xD;
