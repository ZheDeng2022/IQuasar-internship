  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to prevent changes in the vision of astronauts during prolonged&#xD;
      residence on the International Space Station or a mission to Mars. This project will provide&#xD;
      data about the efficacy of lower body negative pressure to mimic daily upright posture by&#xD;
      intermittently lowering central venous pressure while in simulated microgravity (3 days of&#xD;
      bed rest). The investigators expect that 3 days of bed rest will increase choroid thickness,&#xD;
      and choroid area. The investigators hypothesize that nightly LBNP (-20mmHg) will prevent&#xD;
      these changes.&#xD;

      The visual impairment observed in many astronauts after long duration spaceflight aboard the&#xD;
      International Space Station is considered the most important mission-threatening medical&#xD;
      problem identified in the last decade of the space program. Between 2012 and 2014, NASA and&#xD;
      NSBRI have spent $3-4 million/year investigating the clinical course and underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms of this condition, termed the Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure Syndrome&#xD;
      (VIIP) because of its theoretical association with elevated intracranial pressure and central&#xD;
      venous pressure. During the previous funding cycle, the investigators for this application&#xD;
      performed the first invasive measures of intracranial pressure during acute (head down tilt&#xD;
      bedrest and parabolic flight) and chronic (24 hours HDT bedrest) changes in gravitational&#xD;
      gradients simulating spaceflight in healthy humans. Novel observations made from those&#xD;
      studies determined that 1) there is a large range of central venous pressure experienced&#xD;
      normally during changes in posture in daily life; 2) these changes occur within seconds of&#xD;
      postural transients from upright to supine and then are stable over time in that position; 3)&#xD;
      with acute assumption of simulated microgravity (HDT bedrest), intracranial pressure and&#xD;
      central venous pressure goes up slightly from the supine position, but over the next 24&#xD;
      hours, returns toward, and sometimes below the supine value because of spatial compensation&#xD;
      within the brain; 4) during true microgravity (parabolic flight), the acute reduction in&#xD;
      central venous pressure reduces cerebral outflow resistance and ICP decreases compared to the&#xD;
      supine position, though remains above the upright position in 1G.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current hypothesis is that the VIIP syndrome is Not due to a pathologically elevated&#xD;
      central venous or intracranial pressure. However, because there is not the usual reduction in&#xD;
      pressure typically seen in the upright position on earth, the incessant, low level elevation&#xD;
      in ICP (i.e., greater than upright, but less than supine) leads to adaptive changes in the&#xD;
      eye which ultimately result in globe flattening, choroidal folds, and visual impairment.&#xD;
      Preliminary data suggest that the use of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) can lower ICP&#xD;
      while in the head down position, towards the values observed upright. The investigators&#xD;
      propose that applying LBNP during sleep in space would be a practical strategy to restore a&#xD;
      relevant (though reversed) circadian variability in central venous pressure that would then&#xD;
      prevent adaptive changes in the eye. The investigators propose the following hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Repeated administration of LBNP at night will cause a safe, sustained reduction&#xD;
      in central venous pressure while asleep. This restoration of effective circadian variability&#xD;
      in central venous pressure will prevent structural changes in the eye induced by&#xD;
      microgravity. To test this hypothesis, the long-term efficacy of nightly LBNP (6-8 hrs) to&#xD;
      simulate the upright position and prevent structural changes in the eye during four days of&#xD;
      bedrest. Comprehensive, non-invasive state-of-the-art imaging will be used to examine the&#xD;
      structure of the visual apparatus, using optical coherence tomography combined with invasive&#xD;
      direct measurement of CVP.&#xD;
