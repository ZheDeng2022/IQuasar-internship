  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether a picture narrative format is more successful,&#xD;
      than text with pictures or text alone, in communicating lung screening information (primarily&#xD;
      defined by positive attitudes towards the design and increase in knowledge) to people likely&#xD;
      to be invited to lung screening where available.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Population screening is key to detecting lung cancer early at a more treatable stage. Uptake&#xD;
      of screening should be equitable (i.e., screening benefits all eligible members of the&#xD;
      population and does not contribute further to health disparities) and informed (i.e.,&#xD;
      participants have been involved in the decision to take part and their decision aligns with&#xD;
      their values and circumstances). Print decision support materials are the primary mechanism&#xD;
      for encouraging engagement with cancer screening and supporting decision making. It is&#xD;
      essential that we identify print communication techniques that are effective in informing&#xD;
      invitees about lung screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention, picture narrative information about lung screening, was previously&#xD;
      developed through codesign and prototype testing with people likely to be eligible for lung&#xD;
      screening (50 to 75 years old, past or current heavy smokers). Participants will be&#xD;
      randomised to one of three groups: Picture narrative format, Text with pictures (control 1)&#xD;
      or, Text-only (control 2). This study will assess whether presenting lung screening&#xD;
      information in a picture narrative format can improve lung cancer screening knowledge,&#xD;
      eligibility self-assessment and attitudes. It will also assess whether perceptions of the&#xD;
      information designs can explain any impact of the intervention on these outcomes and whether&#xD;
      there are differences across socioeconomic groups.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants are randomly assigned to one of three groups. They will receive the same lung screening information but the format of this information will be determined by which group they have been randomised to. All participants will complete a questionnaire immediately after viewing the lung screening information.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>The investigators will be blind to intervention allocation because the intervention and questionnaire is to be undertaken independently and remotely by the participants. Although the intervention is not masked from participants, they will not be informed of the purpose of the study or the different conditions until after they have completed all study measures.</masking_description>
