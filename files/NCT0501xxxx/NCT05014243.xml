  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the study is to investigate the dietary differences between children with&#xD;
      well-controlled inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and those with active disease by using&#xD;
      targeted food metabolomics. The utilization of the application of targeted metabolomics&#xD;
      allows for the investigation of specific components of foods and their effects in IBD and&#xD;
      inflammation, which may inform future dietary recommendations for IBD patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators overall hypothesis is that higher intake of animal origin foods lead to&#xD;
      higher concentrations of TMAO and its precursors (TMA, choline and carnitine), which causes&#xD;
      gut microbiota dysbiosis, ultimately resulting in elevated inflammatory markers (systemic&#xD;
      and/or fecal) in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two primary aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Examine the relationship between IBD activity, dietary patterns, and diet-derived&#xD;
      potential biomarkers in serum and urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Investigate the association between IBD activity, dietary patterns, gut microbiome,&#xD;
      and diet-derived potential biomarkers in stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will also explore the integrated relationship between disease activity, diet,&#xD;
      gut microbiome, diet-derived potential biomarkers, and inflammatory markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will recruit 100 subjects with known IBD of &gt; 6 months duration. Subjects will&#xD;
      be asked to complete dietary questionnaires, and provide stool, urine, and blood samples.&#xD;

    <description>BLOCK includes 77 food items. Individual portion size is asked, and pictures are provided to enhance accuracy of quantification. BLOCK will be analyzed for each subject and raw data for nutrient intake. The number of servings of food groups will be assessed, and specific nutrient intake will be calculated and reported as mean intake.</description>
