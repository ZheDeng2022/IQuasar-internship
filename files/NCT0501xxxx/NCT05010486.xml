  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexual dysfunction after rectal surgery varies widely in the literature. Prevalence of sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction before surgery and desire of patient to treat this condition is also not well&#xD;
      established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of this prospective cohort study were to determine prevalence of sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction with a questionnaire before and after surgery. Patient's satisfaction and quality&#xD;
      of life were also collected regarding preoperative information given.&#xD;

    <description>Prevalence of sexual dysfunction will be determined with a validated questionnaire on erectile dysfunction (ED). The International Index of Erectile Dysfunction-5 (IIEF-5) focuses on ED; therefore, it only includes the first 5 questions of the IIEF-15. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert-type ascending scale with a total score between 1 and 25, where a score of 22 and above corresponds to normal erectile function.</description>

    <description>Patient satisfaction regarding pre-operative information about the possible side-effects of surgery was assessed with a phone call 1 month after surgery. The quality of the information and the importance given to the possible side-effects of surgery, such as ED, were measured according to the patients' perspective on a 1 to 5 Likert-type ascending scale and a &quot;yes or no&quot; type of response.</description>

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was measured by the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction (LES) Questionnaire Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF), a 16-item derivative from the Q-LES-Q, a 93-item questionnaire. Patients' satisfaction was evaluated by a 5-point Likert-type ascending scale. The first 14 questions were scored from 14 to 70 points in total, while the last two items addressing medication and overall quality of life were represented by two independent scores of 5 points. Q-LES-Q-SF scores were measured at baseline during the first clinical visit as well as 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after the surgery.</description>
