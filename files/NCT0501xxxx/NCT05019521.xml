  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose finding study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of danicopan in participants with GA secondary to AMD. The study consists of a Screening&#xD;
      Period of up to 4 weeks, a 104-week masked Treatment Period, followed by an Open-label&#xD;
      Extension (OLE) Period starting at Week 104 and lasting for up to 1 year. This study will&#xD;
      have 4 treatments arms: 100 milligrams (mg) twice daily (bid), 200 mg bid, 400 mg once daily&#xD;
      (qd), and matching placebo. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presentation of GA secondary to AMD in at least 1 eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study eye must have the specified visual acuity (range of 84 to 4 letters; 20/20 to&#xD;
             20/800) using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts at a starting distance&#xD;
             of 4 meters.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  GA area of 0.5 to 17.76 square millimeter (~0.25 to 7 disc area) per eye measured by&#xD;
             FAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  GA in either eye due to cause other than AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have previously received intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
             injections in study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have previously received any complement/stem cell/gene therapy for any&#xD;
             ophthalmological condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous participation in interventional clinical studies for treatment of drusen,&#xD;
             nascent GA or GA (except vitamins or minerals) irrespective of route of administration&#xD;
             (ocular or systemic) in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of active ocular diseases in either eye that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator compromises or confounds visual function or interferes with study&#xD;
             assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected complement deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or presence of any clinically relevant co-morbidities or any uncontrolled&#xD;
             conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to fluorescein sodium for injection, the investigational drug&#xD;
             (danicopan) or any of its excipients.&#xD;
