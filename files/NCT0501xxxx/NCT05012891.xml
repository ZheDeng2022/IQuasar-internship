    <textblock>
      OneStep technology is a smartphone application, utilizing smartphone sensors to provide&#xD;
      ongoing gait diagnostics. In this longitudinal study, 50 consecutive patients with&#xD;
      lower-extremity disability or chronic pain, will be using the One-Step App, downloaded to&#xD;
      their personal smartphones, in parallel with the usual rehabilitation treatments, during a&#xD;
      one-month period. Analyzed gait data from the App will be linked with clinical data collected&#xD;
      by a team of experts, in order to evaluate the potential use of this App as an objective&#xD;
      means to characterize and quantify patients' gait characteristics along the follow-up period,&#xD;
      and to objectively assess the patients' adherence and compliance with the rehabilitation&#xD;
      regime.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient adherence is a crucial determinant of the rehabilitation process. After injury or&#xD;
      surgery, many patients are given specific exercises to conduct unsupervised on their own to&#xD;
      aid their recovery. Evidence suggests that noncompliance with the prescribed exercise regime&#xD;
      is associated with poor rehabilitation outcomes. OneStep technology is a smartphone&#xD;
      application (App), which uses smartphone sensors to provide ongoing gait diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To analyze gait-related parameters collected via the OneStep App in patients with lower&#xD;
           extremity disability or chronic pain over a 4-week follow-up period during in-hospital&#xD;
           physiotherapy sessions, self-exercises at home, and other daily activities,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To objectively assess the patients' adherence and compliance with the prescribed&#xD;
           rehabilitation regime. For the purposes of this research, adherence refers to the&#xD;
           quantity and frequency of completed home exercises, while compliance refers to the&#xD;
           quality of meeting the physiotherapists' walking-related recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess gait parameters measured simultaneously on both feet, during standard&#xD;
           walking-related tests, (performed under similar conditions on days 1, 14, 28, while&#xD;
           using the OneStep App), for between and within-subject comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare between patients' subjective self-reports on performed physiotherapy workouts&#xD;
           at home, the physiotherapists' own subjective assessments on their patients' adherence&#xD;
           and compliance, and the objective data collected using the OneStep App&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty consecutive patients with lower-extremity disability or pain, will be using the&#xD;
      One-Step App, downloaded to their personal smartphones, in parallel with the usual&#xD;
      rehabilitation treatments, during a one-month period. The study participants will be asked to&#xD;
      carry the smartphone with the preinstalled app on them at all times, specifically on their&#xD;
      injured foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will also be required to undertake standard walking tests at the study&#xD;
      initiation day (day 1) and on days 14 and 28 under similar conditions for between and&#xD;
      within-subject comparison. Only during these tests will the subjects be using two smartphones&#xD;
      preinstalled with the OneStep App, one attached to each leg, for a more accurate gait&#xD;
      symmetry assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During these 3 sessions, the study participants, as well as their physiotherapists, will be&#xD;
      asked to fill in the study questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected using the OneStep App will allow an accurate and informative follow-up on&#xD;
      patients' adherence and compliance with the rehabilitation regime and assist the&#xD;
      physiotherapists in improving the efficacy of the rehabilitation process.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at days 1, 14 and 28 of the follow-up period</time_frame>
    <description>The test measures, in seconds, the time taken by an individual to stand up from a standard armchair walk a distance of 3 meters, turn, walk back to the chair, and sit down again. The subjects are asked to wear their regular footwear and use their customary walking aids. No physical assistance is given. The subjects start the test with their back against the chair, their arms resting on the armrests, and their walking aid at hand. They are instructed that on the word &quot;go&quot; they are to get up and walk at a comfortable and safe pace to a line on the floor 3 meters away, turn, return to the chair and sit down again. Each subject walks through the test once before being timed in order to become familiar with the test. Each subject will take this test 3 times (days 1, 14, and 28). During these tests, the study participants will be using 2 phones, each preinstalled with the OneStep app and placed on each foot for simultaneous data collection, for within and between-subject comparison.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at days 1, 14 and 28 of the follow-up period</time_frame>
    <description>The test is used to measure gait speed (in meters per second) of individuals with gait limitations. A 10-meter straight course will be marked at its beginning and end with tape on the floor. The study participant will be positioned 2 meters behind the first tape line. The subject will then be instructed to walk at a comfortable rate until one passes the second tape line. The timer is started when one crosses the first tape line and stopped when one crosses the second tape line. The 2-meter distances before and after the course serve to minimize the effect of acceleration and deceleration. The test is repeated 3 times and the average time is calculated. Each study subject will take these tests on 3 occasions (days 1, 14, and 28). During these tests, the study participants will be using 2 phones, each preinstalled with the OneStep application and placed on each foot for simultaneous data collection, for within and between-subject comparison.</description>

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at days 1, 14 and 28 of the follow-up period</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a multidimensional measurement tool, which contains a figure of the body on which patients can mark their painful sites. The 4-item BPI Pain Severity Subscale is used to measure overall pain: at its worst, at its least, on average (all - over the last 24 hours) and at present, using a 0-10 numeric rating scale, where 0 indicates no pain and 10 corresponds to &quot;severe or excruciating pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. The BPI has seven Numeric Rating Scales (NRS) that show how the pain interferes with function, mood, and enjoyment.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at days 1, 14 and 28 of the follow-up period</time_frame>
    <description>The LEFS is a 20-item self-report measure of physical function. Each item is rated on a five-point scale (0-4), with lower scores representing greater difficulty. Total scores can range from 0 to 80. Function is defined as follows: extreme difficulty or unable to perform activity (0-19 points), quite a bit of difficulty (20-39 points), moderate difficulty (40-59 points), a little bit of difficulty (60-79 points), and no difficulty (80 points).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>ABC Confidence Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at days 1 and 28 of the follow-up period</time_frame>
    <description>Self administered 16 question assessment in which subjects are instructed to answer each question with a percentage of confidence that they will not fall while performing a given task from 0%-100%, with 0% being &quot;not confident&quot; and 100% being &quot;confident&quot;. Scores 80% or higher indicate a high level of physical functioning, 50-80% indicate a moderate level of physical functioning and scores less than 50% indicate a low level of physical functioning.</description>
