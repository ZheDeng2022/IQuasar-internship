  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With over 72,000 overdose deaths in 2017, of which 47,600 are attributable to opioid&#xD;
      overdose, the opioid epidemic has become North America's most widespread behavioral public&#xD;
      health problem. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly&#xD;
      efficacious. The Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS), comprised of a healthcare team&#xD;
      portal connected to a patient mobile application, provides opioid-related education, promotes&#xD;
      connectedness with clinicians, and tracks MAT treatment progress. This study will conduct&#xD;
      interviews with patients that will inform optimal design of OARS, assess the efficacy of OARS&#xD;
      in improving MAT outcomes in primary care settings, and evaluate the sustainability and&#xD;
      return on investment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It joins an outstanding scientific team at University of California, Los Angeles and a small&#xD;
      business that has developed, Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS) -- a software platform&#xD;
      that by integrating with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) improves clinical management of&#xD;
      patients by primary care providers (PCPs) treating patients with OUD using MAT. OARS platform&#xD;
      uses a dashboard to show the real-time measurement of patient achievements in recovery. It&#xD;
      provides opportunities for patients to interact with their PCPs, allowing for better&#xD;
      connection to and support from their PCPs. OARS platform features artificial intelligence to&#xD;
      analyze information from the EHR and from patients to provide a relapse risk assessment for&#xD;
      patients receiving MAT for OUD, an innovation that sets OARS apart from other software&#xD;
      solutions. The goal of Phase 1 was to modify the OARS platform for use in primary care&#xD;
      settings by conducting interviews with Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) (N=20) and their&#xD;
      patients with OUD (N=40) in primary care settings to collect data on feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of engaging with OARS to inform the user-centered design of OARS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of Phase 2 of this study are to: (1) to assess the effectiveness of OARS in&#xD;
      improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes across 6 treatment programs (N=200 treated&#xD;
      patients) and (2) evaluate the sustainability and return on investment of OARS implementation&#xD;
      across 6 treatment programs. A commercialization plan documents progress to date for the OARS&#xD;
      platform and presents a market plan to improve both the scale and quality of MAT services&#xD;
      delivered by PCPs in primary care, which is a major contribution to addressing the ongoing&#xD;
      opioid epidemic.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Using a &quot;stepped wedge&quot; effectiveness design, evaluate OARS platform in 6 treatment programs (N=200 treated patients) data before and after implementation along MAT outcomes. Each clinic, once randomized to begin using OARS, will have a minimum of 4 months and a maximum of 12 months to collect baseline data on the number of PCPs who have DATA-2000 waivers, on the number of patients each PCP treats and on relevant patient outcomes to MAT (e.g., length of time in treatment, visits kept with PCP and psychosocial providers, number of drug-free urine tests). There will be four months of baseline data available for PCPs and patients defined as treatment as usual (TAU) for clinics 1 and 2, eight months of baseline data available for PCPs and patients defined as TAU for clinics 3 and 4 and 12 months of baseline data available for PCPs and patients defined as TAU for clinics 5 and 6. In the final 3 months, we will finish data analyses, prepare papers for dissemination in peer-reviewed journals.</intervention_model_description>
