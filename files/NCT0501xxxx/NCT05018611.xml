  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LifeSkills Mobile app will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among&#xD;
      5,000 young transgender women (YTW), ages 16-29 in the United States (U.S.). Study findings&#xD;
      will demonstrate if the intervention will reduce HIV incidence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LifeSkills Mobile is an mHealth intervention to promote biobehavioral HIV prevention&#xD;
      strategies based on empowerment theory and was developed using a community-based&#xD;
      participatory research approach. An RCT assesses the efficacy of the LifeSkills Mobile&#xD;
      intervention in comparison to a standard of care (SOC) condition among 5,000 YTW recruited&#xD;
      online. At baseline and every 6 months through 12-48 months (depending on when the&#xD;
      participant enrolled), enrolled participants will complete an online survey sent via a link&#xD;
      to their mobile phone and will be mailed an OraQuick In-Home HIV Test kit. We will also&#xD;
      estimate the total and incremental costs of the LifeSkills Mobile intervention relative to&#xD;
      SOC, from healthcare sector and societal perspectives.&#xD;
