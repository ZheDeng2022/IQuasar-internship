      Ahmed Glaucoma Valve Implantation with Ologen augmentation in secondary pediatric glaucomas:&#xD;
      A 2-year randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have investigated the clinical benefits of Ologen for trabeculectomy. However,&#xD;
      its benefits for Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation have not been widely investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to compare the 2-year outcomes of AGV implantation with and without&#xD;
      Ologen adjuvant for the treatment of children with 2ry pediatric glaucoma. Design: This is a&#xD;
      single-center, randomized, controlled study. Participants: Consecutive children with&#xD;
      refractory pediatric glaucoma requiring AGV implantation were enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refractory pediatric glaucoma was defined by at least 2 repeated IOP measurements greater&#xD;
      than 21 mmHg and accompanying signs of buphthalmos, corneal edema, Haabs striae, or optic&#xD;
      nerve cupping despite maximal tolerated medical therapy. The primary outcome measure was AGV&#xD;
      success. Complete success was defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) between 6 and 20 mmHg&#xD;
      without glaucoma medications and additional IOP-lowering surgeries. Qualified success was&#xD;
      defined as above, except IOP control maintained with glaucoma medications. In Ologen eyes, a&#xD;
      round 12 × 1 mm circular Ologen disc will be placed over the FP7 or FP8 AGV-plate immediately&#xD;
      before conjunctival closure. Control eyes received conventional FP7 or FP8 AGV surgery&#xD;
      without Ologen augmentation.&#xD;

      Ahmed Glaucoma Valve Implantation with Ologen augmentation in secondary pediatric glaucomas:&#xD;
      A 2-year randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of secondary pediatric glaucoma is challenging in terms of maintaining&#xD;
      lifelong vision and avoiding an aggressive scarring course after surgery. Secondary Pediatric&#xD;
      glaucoma includes a variety of ocular conditions that lead to high intraocular pressure (IOP)&#xD;
      and progressive optic neuropathy. Glaucoma is a well-known complication of congenital&#xD;
      cataract extraction and is the most frequent long-term complication of lensectomy with or&#xD;
      without intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. The reported incidence in the literature is&#xD;
      between 15% and 45%4. Another cause is aphakic glaucoma.Management of secondary pediatric&#xD;
      glaucoma is mainly surgical, and medical therapy is used either as a temporizing measure or&#xD;
      as an adjunctive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, &quot;staged approach&quot; has been favored by many ophthalmologists. This involves&#xD;
      starting with angle surgeries and their repetition in the case of failure, proceeding with&#xD;
      trabeculectomy or combined trabeculotomy-trabeculectomy for refractory patients, and drainage&#xD;
      device or cyclodestruction for very advanced patients.The poor clinical outcomes prompted&#xD;
      surgeons to adapt glaucoma drainage devices (GDDs) as a mainstay of treatment for refractory&#xD;
      glaucoma in both pediatric and adult populations.In children, Ahmed glaucoma valves (AGV)&#xD;
      have greater than 80% success rate at 1- year, but success decreases to less than 50% by 5&#xD;
      years2. In order to improve long-term IOP control, mitomycinC (MMC) has been used as an&#xD;
      adjuvant during implant placement. While MMC is a commonplace in trabeculectomy, its use with&#xD;
      GDDs is controversial due to increased complications such as bleb leaks and endothelial cell&#xD;
      damage. More recently, Ologen, a biodegradable Type-I collagen matrix, has been used in&#xD;
      glaucoma surgeries. Ologen is safe and effective in enhancing trabeculectomy surgery in&#xD;
      adults and children,.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have investigated the clinical benefits of Ologen for trabeculectomy. However,&#xD;
      its benefits for Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation have not been widely investigated. Reports&#xD;
      in adult patients have shown that Ologen may increase AGV success and decrease hypertensive&#xD;
      phase incidence. Many studies have investigated the clinical benefits of Ologen for&#xD;
      trabeculectomy. However, its benefits for Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation have not been&#xD;
      widely investigated. As glaucoma drainage devices are being increasingly used for pediatric&#xD;
      glaucoma,investigators decided to report the results and safety of Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV)&#xD;
      implantation in a series of secondary pediatric glaucoma as well as the clinical benefits of&#xD;
      concomitant use Ologen as an adjuvant for for Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to compare the 2-year outcomes of AGV implantation with and without&#xD;
      Ologen adjuvant for the treatment of children with 2ry pediatric glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, randomized, controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive children with refractory pediatric glaucoma requiring AGV implantation were&#xD;
      enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refractory pediatric glaucoma was defined by at least 2 repeated IOP measurements greater&#xD;
      than 21 mmHg and accompanying signs of buphthalmos, corneal edema, Haabs striae, or optic&#xD;
      nerve cupping despite maximal tolerated medical therapy. The primary outcome measure was AGV&#xD;
      success. Complete success was defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) between 6 and 20 mmHg&#xD;
      without glaucoma medications and additional IOP-lowering surgeries. Qualified success was&#xD;
      defined as above, except that IOP control was maintained with glaucoma medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 7-0 silk traction suture was placed through the clear cornea.A conjunctival incision was&#xD;
      made 4 mm posterior to the limbus in the supratemporal quadrant. After dissecting conjunctiva&#xD;
      and Tenon's primed FP7 or FP8 AGV was inserted into the subconjunctival space and sutured to&#xD;
      sclera using two interrupted 7-0 silk sutures 8-10 mm posterior to the limbus. A 23-gauge&#xD;
      needle was used to enter the anterior chamber from the surgical limbus. The tube then was cut&#xD;
      beveled up and inserted into the anterior chamber through the tunnel. In Ologen eyes, a round&#xD;
      12 × 1 mm circular Ologen disc will be placed over the FP7 or FP8 AGV-plate immediately&#xD;
      before conjunctival closure. Control eyes received conventional FP7 or FP8 AGV surgery&#xD;
      without Ologen augmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, conjunctiva and Tenon were approximated using a running 8-0 Vicryl suture.At the&#xD;
      close of surgery, subtenon antibiotic and steroids were injected in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative data including age at the time of surgery, sex,laterality, type of glaucoma,&#xD;
      prior ocular history, prior surgical treatment, number of glaucoma medications, IOP, cup to&#xD;
      disc ratio, and central corneal thickness (CCT) were extracted from patients' record.&#xD;
      Postoperative data included follow-up durations; IOP at months 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36; cup to&#xD;
      disc ratios at months 12, 24,; and intraoperative and postoperative complications. In all&#xD;
      cases, IOPs were measured by Tono-Pen (Mentor, Woburn, MA, USA) under anesthesia. In the&#xD;
      clinic, IOPs were measured by ICare (ICare Finland Oy, Helsinki, Finland) and Goldmann&#xD;
      applanation tonometer (Haag-Streit, Köniz, Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analysis was accomplished using IBM SPSS version 20. Assessment of the data&#xD;
      normality was done using both Histogram plot and Shapiro-Wilk's test. Wilcoxon test was used&#xD;
      to compare the preoperative and postoperative variables in each group. The comparison between&#xD;
      the two groups was done using Mann-Whitney test for numerical variables and Chi-square test&#xD;
      for categorical variables. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted to estimate the mean&#xD;
      survival time and probabilities of failure at different follow-up stages in the both groups.&#xD;
      For all tests, P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.&#xD;
