  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a heart rhythm disorder associated with debillitating symptoms,&#xD;
      psychological distress and heart failure. It can also significantly increase an individuals&#xD;
      stroke risk. Catheter ablation (CA) for AF is the most effective way to restore normal heart&#xD;
      rhythm. However, AF can recur in up to 50% of patients after their first CA procedure and a&#xD;
      second 'top-up' procedure may be needed to maximise effect. Early detection of recurrences&#xD;
      can enable planning and treatment and repeat CA procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-CA follow-up strategies rely on episodic rhythm monitoring (Holter monitor tests) that&#xD;
      usually last between 1 and 7 days. However, AF recurrences can be intermittent and may not&#xD;
      occur during these short monitoring episodes. A greater duration of monitoring has been shown&#xD;
      to yield greater detection of AF recurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relying on symptoms alone to detect recurrence is also sub-optimal. AF recurrences can also&#xD;
      be insidious. Similar symptoms may be reported from ectopy, atrial tachycardias or atrial&#xD;
      flutter. These may require different management approaches, necessitating rhythm&#xD;
      characterisation before considering a repeat CA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Apple Watch (AW) is a wristwatch that is able to monitor a wearer's heart rate and rhythm&#xD;
      regularity as well as facilitating an immediate, real-time single-lead ECG recording. This&#xD;
      non-invasive device that can be purchased over- the-counter has demonstrated feasibility in&#xD;
      detecting AF and may offer a potential non-invasive, alternative long-term rhythm&#xD;
      surveillance strategy to diagnose AF in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a single-centre, randomised controlled study to compare the&#xD;
      standard follow-up strategy after index AF CA versus one supplemented with an AW-led&#xD;
      prolonged monitoring strategy to determine if the latter will improve the expediency and rate&#xD;
      of AF recurrence detection. Whether this will lead to improved downstream decision-making,&#xD;
      reduction in symptomatic events and a lower prevalence of AF in the longer term will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;

    <description>For the duration of the study, participants in the active arm will be asked to make ECG recordings in three circumstances:&#xD;
Routinely once per day from the day of randomisation till the 12-month visit after AF CA (they will be encouraged to do so at the same time each day with the option to set a reminder on the watch).&#xD;
If the AW requests them to do so (the automatic AF-notification algorithm will be active throughout the study period and if AF is suspected based on the tachogram, it will trigger notification for the participant to make an ECG recording). This will be till the 12-month time point.&#xD;
If the patient has symptoms of palpitations, pre-syncope or syncope. This will be till the 12-month time point. Monitoring should continue even if AF has been diagnosed to characterise arrhythmia burden and profile. Participants will be given the contact details of a dedicated email inbox to which to send ECGs recorded through the AW.</description>

             continuous episode lasting longer than 7 days or requiring intervention to restore&#xD;
             sinus rhythm after this time.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one episode of AF must have been documented by ECG or Holter within 12 months&#xD;
             of inclusion in the study.&#xD;

             failed or will never be attempted.&#xD;
