    <description>Safety assess: to standardize reporting, the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI CTCAE), version 5, was used to grade AEs and SAEs. Grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 represented mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening toxicity, respectively. Grade 5 represented toxicity resulting in death. Descriptive analyses were conducted to assess the safety in each grade and summarized as the number of events and rate per subject.</description>
