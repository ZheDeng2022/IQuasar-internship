      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of training given with the Roy adaptation&#xD;
      model on the self-care agency and coping strategies of patients with plaster casts.&#xD;

      According to Global Burden of Disease data, fractures, which 436 million people suffer from&#xD;
      each year, are the second most common musculoskeletal system disorder. Plaster casts have&#xD;
      been used in treatment of fractures since 1850, and they play an important role in extremity&#xD;
      injuries and the healing of operative repairs. In fractures treated with plaster, the bone&#xD;
      alignment is corrected and this alignment is maintained with limited mobility. However, if&#xD;
      plaster casts are incorrectly applied or not properly taken care of, this may prevent the&#xD;
      healing of fractures and can threaten the safety of patients. Failure to comply with&#xD;
      plaster-casting and cast-care principles can cause patients a range of immediate and delayed&#xD;
      complications, including severe pain, edema, compartment syndrome, tissue necrosis, malunion,&#xD;
      delayed union, nonunion, contracture, neurological problems, paralysis and pressure sores.&#xD;
      Orthopedic patients, and especially those with plaster casts, are susceptible to the side&#xD;
      effects arising from immobility. They thus need quality care and information to prevent or&#xD;
      manage these side effects. Nurses play an important role in prevention or early recognition&#xD;
      of complications arising from plaster-casting and in providing the patient with information.&#xD;
      Orthopedic nursing requires special skills, knowledge and clinical judgement to provide the&#xD;
      plaster cast-patient with safe, quality-care and to prevent complications. Patient education&#xD;
      and information are very important for those patients whose treatment continues at home after&#xD;
      casting, in order that they can maintain their care and prevent complications.In this study,&#xD;
      the sample size was determined with an effect size of 0.43 using the power analysis Gpower&#xD;
      3.1.9.7 program. Accordingly, it was calculated that 29 patients were included in the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups with a 5% margin of error and 80% power. Ä°t was decided to&#xD;
      include at least 66 people in each working group with 10% surplus, considering that they&#xD;
      might be lost in data collection.&#xD;
