    <textblock>
      This a single-center prospective spread-evaluation study where the primary objective is to&#xD;
      assess the spread of local anesthesia in an ESPB using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will include 10 healthy volunteers from the hospitals internal website. All volunteers&#xD;
      will receive a one-sided Erector Spinae Plane (ESP) block. After the block sensitivity to&#xD;
      cold and pinprick will be assessed before an MRI is performed. An radiology specialist will&#xD;
      evaluate the MR images pertaining to the spread of the local anesthesia.&#xD;

      Healthy volunteers working at Ostfold Hospital will be recruited by a message put up on the&#xD;
      hospitals intranet front page. As participants makes contact, they will receive a mail sent&#xD;
      by a study nurse. The mail will include the patient information sheet and a consent form.&#xD;
      There will be offered compensation in the form of a gift card of 1000 NOK to cover any travel&#xD;
      expenses. Any travel expenses exceeding 1000 NOK will not be covered. If the volunteer&#xD;
      fulfills the eligibility criteria and consent is obtained, the study nurse will contact the&#xD;
      volunteer per phone or mail to set up an intervention date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to enroll 10 healthy volunteers and perform the intervention within six months. The&#xD;
      planned project end is during December 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All volunteers will be given the choice of procedural pain relief in the form of rapifen&#xD;
      0,5-1 mg. All volunteers included will receive an unilateral ESPB at the T7 level with 30 ml&#xD;
      of 2,5 mg/ml ropivacaine and a total of 0,3 mmol gadolinium. The intervention will be&#xD;
      performed by the PhD candidate connected to the study. The ESPB will be performed under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance, where the needle target is the transverse process of the Th7 vertebra,&#xD;
      under the musculus (m.) erector spinae. All volunteers will be tested for cold and pinprick&#xD;
      sensation 30 minutes after block completion, and the results plotted on a dermatome map&#xD;
      before they undergo an MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging study A 3T MRI examination (Magnetom Skyra, Siemens) will be&#xD;
      performed 60 minutes after the injection, covering spine levels Th3 to Th12. 3D T1-weighted&#xD;
      sequences with fat suppression as well as a T2-weighted sequence will be performed. The&#xD;
      distribution pattern of the ropivacaine-gadolinium solution will be evaluated in the&#xD;
      following structures: superficial, paravertebral and intercostal musculature, neural foramina&#xD;
      and epidural space. All images will be reviewed and analyzed by the same radiologist.&#xD;
