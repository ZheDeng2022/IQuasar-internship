    <textblock>
      The HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine&#xD;
      and the Alliance for Positive Change will test two healthcare models that integrate PrEP into&#xD;
      OBGYN services. Model 1 is OBGYN-PrEP with 4 parts: (1) prioritize PrEP; (2) train providers&#xD;
      in PrEP and intervention; (3) identify PrEP-appropriate women through a risk screen; and (4)&#xD;
      monitor progress and fidelity to protocol. Model 2 is NP-PC PrEP in which PrEP provider&#xD;
      burden is shifted to a Nurse Practitioner (NP) who will use a sex-positive approach to&#xD;
      deliver PrEP services via telemedicine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Einstein), the HIV Center for Clinical and&#xD;
      Behavioral Studies (HIV Center), the Montefiore Medical Center Department of Obstetrics and&#xD;
      Gynecology (OBGYN, Implementing Partner) and the Alliance for Positive Change (Alliance,&#xD;
      Implementing and Community Partner) will compare two healthcare models that integrate PrEP&#xD;
      into OBGYN services. Both models are acceptable standards of care and represent&#xD;
      evidence-based approaches to the provision of care. This study is the first example of&#xD;
      comparing these interventions in a head-to-head, comparative-effectiveness model. Both groups&#xD;
      will benefit from maintained access, enhanced assessment with the PrEP screening tool, and&#xD;
      physicians will all receive an evidence-based PrEP education seminar with supporting&#xD;
      materials and ongoing access to education and resources. MODEL 1, OBGYN-PrEP is based on&#xD;
      PC4PrEP (R01MH107297) that has four steps: announce the policy that PrEP counseling is the&#xD;
      responsibility of OBGYN providers to address the &quot;purview paradox&quot;; train providers to manage&#xD;
      patients on PrEP; use a screening tool to identify women appropriate for PrEP; and&#xD;
      implementation coaching to monitor and encourage PrEP counseling. The goal is that PrEP be&#xD;
      provided by a trusted provider with whom the patient has an ongoing relationship. In MODEL 2,&#xD;
      NP-PC PrEP, all the same provisions and practices present in Model 1 will be present however,&#xD;
      a telehealth opportunity with a Nurse Practitioner (NP) will be provided. A skilled and&#xD;
      PrEP-trained NP will deliver PrEP services via telemedicine visits&#xD;

    <description>We will compare the patients in the NP-PC PrEP and OBGYN-PrEP arms on number of PrEP prescriptions written per 100 patients. The proportion of prescriptions written for PrEP eligible patients will be compared between the two groups (NP-PC vs OBGYN) via chi-square test.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability of intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability will be assessed through qualitative in-depth interviews (IDIs) with OBGYN providers and PCs at Alliance at the end of the interventions to identify factors that facilitate or hinder the implementation of the intervention and to assess its acceptability. We will also conduct IDIs with 10 patients in each intervention arm.</description>
