  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to reveal the fundamental neural mechanisms that underlie&#xD;
      comprehension across human spoken languages. An understanding of how speech is coded in the&#xD;
      brain has significant implications for the development of new diagnostic and rehabilitative&#xD;
      strategies for language disorders (e.g. aphasia, dyslexia, autism, et alia). The basic&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying comprehension of spoken language are unknown. Researchers are only&#xD;
      beginning to understand how the human brain extracts the most fundamental linguistic elements&#xD;
      (consonants and vowels) from a complex and highly variable acoustic signal. Traditional&#xD;
      theories have posited a 'universal' phonetic inventory shared by all humans, but this has&#xD;
      been challenged by other newer theories that each language has its own unique and specialized&#xD;
      code. An investigation of the cortical representation of speech sounds across languages can&#xD;
      likely shed light on this fundamental question. Previous research has implicated the superior&#xD;
      temporal cortex in the processing of speech sounds. Most of this work has been entirely&#xD;
      carried out in English. The recording of neural activity directly from the cortical surface&#xD;
      from individuals with different language experience is a promising approach since it can&#xD;
      provide both high spatial and temporal resolution. This study will examine the mechanisms of&#xD;
      phonetic encoding, by utilizing neurophysiological recordings obtained during neurosurgical&#xD;
      procedures. High-density electrode arrays, advanced signal processing, and direct&#xD;
      electrocortical stimulation will be utilized to unravel both local and population encoding of&#xD;
      speech sounds in the lateral temporal cortex. This study will also examine the neural&#xD;
      encoding of speech in patients who are monolingual and bilingual in Mandarin, Spanish, and&#xD;
      English, the most common spoken languages worldwide, and feature important contrastive&#xD;
      differences of pitch, formant, and temporal envelope. A cross-linguistic approach is critical&#xD;
      for a true understanding of language, while also striving to achieve a broader approach of&#xD;
      diversity and inclusion in neuroscience of language.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Experimental approaches with significantly greater spatial and temporal resolution are&#xD;
      necessary to directly resolve, both local- and population- level, the contrastive encoding of&#xD;
      speech sounds. This study proposes an innovative methodological approach using customized&#xD;
      intracranial high-density electrode arrays to record neural activity directly from nonprimary&#xD;
      auditory cortex in patients undergoing clinical neurosurgical procedures (acute&#xD;
      intraoperative and chronic extraoperative). This approach overcomes obstacles in traditional&#xD;
      neuroimaging by offering high signal-to-noise recordings, unprecedented detailed&#xD;
      spatiotemporal resolution, and a large number of simultaneously recorded cortical sites in&#xD;
      awake, behaving subjects. The research study team will leverage the diversity of languages&#xD;
      spoken by patients that are treated at the large volume epilepsy and tumor brain mapping&#xD;
      programs at the University of California, San Francisco. They will examine cortical responses&#xD;
      to speech stimuli (natural speech corpora and control tokens) in Spanish, Mandarin, and&#xD;
      English speakers (monolingual and bilingual). They will also focus on encoding models in&#xD;
      three fundamental domains of acoustic-phonetic cues that are present in all languages: pitch,&#xD;
      formants, and amplitude envelope. The aims of this study seeks to determine how pitch cues&#xD;
      encode lexical tone processing in Mandarin (Aim 1), the cortical representation of vowels in&#xD;
      Spanish and English (Aim 2), and the encoding of the speech amplitude envelope in Spanish and&#xD;
      English (Aim 3). Together, these aims will elucidate mechanistic principles of speech&#xD;
      encoding in the human auditory cortex to understand what is shared and different across human&#xD;
      spoken languages. Abnormalities in these fundamental processes have been implicated in a host&#xD;
      of communication disorders such as dyslexia, developmental language disorder, central hearing&#xD;
      loss, and aphasia. These results should heavily impact current theories of speech processing&#xD;
      and, therefore, will have significant implications for understanding and remediating human&#xD;
      disorders across different languages.&#xD;
