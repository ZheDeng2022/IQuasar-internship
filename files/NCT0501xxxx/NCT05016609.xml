  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The QuickStart study aims to assess the impact of three models of HCV care on HCV treatment&#xD;
      uptake and cure among people who inject drugs. Rapid point-of-care (POC) HCV testing and&#xD;
      test-and-treat strategies will be utilised in primary health care settings across Australia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The QuickStart Study will explore models of point-of-care HCV testing and a same-day test and&#xD;
      treat model to determine the impact of these models on HCV treatment initiation and cure. The&#xD;
      study is a cluster cross-over randomised controlled trial. Sites are primary care services in&#xD;
      Australia who provide services to people who inject drugs (PWID) and who routinely prescribe&#xD;
      treatment for hepatitis C. Clinical services with a primary care practitioner and/or nurse&#xD;
      experienced in providing DAA treatment to high numbers of PWID will be recruited to the&#xD;
      study. A total of 30 services will be recruited with each service enrolling approximately 60&#xD;
      participants across an intervention and control period. Key participant eligibility include a&#xD;
      history of injecting drug use and no previous treatment for HCV with direct acting&#xD;
      antivirals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each site will partipate in a control comparison period in addition to one of three&#xD;
      interventions. The three interventions involve:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) A rapid HCV antibody test using a fingerprick sample and for anybody subsequently&#xD;
      diagnosed with hepatitis C, management and treatment will be according to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) A rapid HCV antibody test followed by a POC HCV RNA test for those who return a reactive&#xD;
      antibody result. Both these will use a fingerprick sample and for anybody diagnosed with&#xD;
      hepatitis C, management and treatment will be according to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) A rapid HCV antibody test using a fingerprick sample and for participants who return a&#xD;
      reactive result, an initial starter pack of DAA prior to a confirmed HCV RNA diagnosis.&#xD;

    <description>This group will receive POC HCV antibody testing via fingerprick using the OraQuick HCV antibody test (OraSure) in addition to the standard-of-care whole-blood conventional laboratory-based HCV PCR viral load testing. Follow up and management of any treatment will be through usual standard-of-care.
