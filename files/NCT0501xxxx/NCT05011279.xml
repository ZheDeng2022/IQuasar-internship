      The purpose of this study is to develop and test a mobile app for Black/African American&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors and their relatives, called Move Together, that promotes sitting less&#xD;
      and moving more for better health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional descriptive study using structured interviews and qualitative data&#xD;
      analysis to develop an intervention, followed by a pilot test of the intervention with pre-&#xD;
      /post- measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In study phase 1,involved qualitative interviews with 5 community leader key informants,&#xD;
           9 breast cancer survivors and 6 first degree relatives of a survivor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This part of the research study is a Pilot Study, which means it is the first time that&#xD;
           researchers are studying usability and acceptability of the Move Together app.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants in the pilot study will participate as members of family-based dyads&#xD;
                (n=10 dyads). One member of each dyad will be a breast cancer survivor and one will&#xD;
                be a blood relative&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study involves screening for eligibility, interviews, questionnaires, Use of Move&#xD;
                Together app with Garmin activity tracker watch&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participation on the trial will be for 5 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About 20 people (10 survivors with 10 relatives) will participate in this part of the&#xD;
           study, and a total of 58 people in the whole study.&#xD;
