      The objective of the study was to determine the effectiveness of Kinesio Taping (KT) for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with acute low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study a total of 56 patients with acute low back pain were randomly allocated to the&#xD;
      experimental group, KT along with conventional Physical therapy (PT), or the control group,&#xD;
      conventional PT alone.&#xD;

      conventional PT alone. 28 Patients received KT in addition to conventional PT while 28&#xD;
      patients received conventional PT alone for two weeks. Oswestry disability index (ODI) and&#xD;
      numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) were used for the measurement of outcomes.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain was measured on numerical pain rating scale. it is a scale with score from 0 to 10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is maximum pain. The minimum score mean better outcome while higher score mean worse outcome. simply lesser the score better would be the outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional disability was measured using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI. ODI score was converted to percentage so the score ranges from 0% to 100%. Where 0% mean no disability and 100 mean very severe (maximum) disability. The minimum score mean better outcome while higher score mean worse outcome. simply lesser the score better would be the outcome.</description>

    <description>Both groups received conventional physical therapy treatment consisting of therapeutic exercise, heat therapy and manual therapy. All the patients received manual therapy techniques that including joint mobilization and therapeutic exercise that including piriformis stretching as well as bridging exercises to strengthen the core stability muscles (i.e., strengthening of transverses abdominis, erector spinae and lumbar multifidus).&#xD;
The KT was applied to the back once a week with a treatment duration of 2 weeks. Each KT was applied for continuous three days and the next KT was applied after a break of two days. Each participant in the experimental group was assessed for any allergy reaction of the skin to KT.</description>
