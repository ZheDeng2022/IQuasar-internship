  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a progressive condition characterized by decline in muscle strength and muscle&#xD;
      mass. Although the mechanism of sarcopenia has not been fully elucidated, it may be caused by&#xD;
      protein-poor diet, vitamin D deficiency, hormonal changes, increase in inflammatory cytokine&#xD;
      level and oxidative stress. For this reason, it is thought that determining the prevalence of&#xD;
      sarcopenia in rheumatological diseases with chronic inflammation and protecting patients from&#xD;
      possible comorbidities with appropriate interventions may be an important factor in&#xD;
      maintaining and improving the functional levels and quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence and its associated factors of&#xD;
      sarcopenia in individuals with primary Sjögren's Syndrome.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Mass</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle mass will be calculated via bioimpedance analysis method. Fat Free Mass will be recorded using TANITA BC 532 Bioimpedance Device and Skeletal Muscle Mass and Skeletal Muscle Mass will be calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Grip strength will be evaluated with JAMAR dynamometer. The patient is positioned in a chair with the elbow flexed to 90 degrees and the wrist in a neutral position, and he/she is asked to grip as strong as he/she can do for 3 seconds. The test is repeated 3 times and the highest value is recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will be asked to walk 4-meters for two times. The shortest time to walk through this distance will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>5 Times Sit to Stand Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>This test includes the calculation of the time it takes to sit and get up from the chair 5 times while the arms are crossed over the shoulders.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>ESSDAI was developed to determine the disease activity level specifically for Sjogren's Syndrome. It includes 12 domains (ie, organ systems: cutaneous, respiratory, renal, articular, muscular, peripheral nervous system (PNS), central nervous system (CNS), haematological, glandular, constitutional, lymphadenopathic, biological). Each domain is divided into 3-4 levels of activity. A score less than 5 indicates a low level of disease, a score between 5 and 13 indicates a moderate level, and a score of more than 14 indicates a high level of active 14. It is a scoring system that evaluates every domain between 0 and 3.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is asked to define the level of fatigue, pain and dryness symptoms with a score between 1 and 10, and the average of the score obtained from these three questions are recorded. An ESSPRI score of less than 5 was considered an acceptable disease state, while a score of 5 or above was considered a sign of high activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Malnutrition Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of malnutrition in the participants will be evaluated with the Mini Nutritional Assessment Form (Short Form). This form consists of 6 questions including loss of appetite, weight loss, mobility, stress or acute illness, dementia or depression, and body mass index. The total score ranges from 0 to 14, with 12 and above meaning &quot;normal nutritional status&quot;, 8 to 11 &quot;malnutrition risk&quot; and 0 to 7 meaning malnutrition.</description>
