      Evaluation of the efficacy of the AstrazenicaCovid 19 vaccine to develop IgG antibody and its&#xD;
      level based on th12 weeks program. Also to follow the changes of markers of coagulation&#xD;
      (D-dimer) after vaccination compared to the basic level. A cardiology consultant will follow&#xD;
      D-Dimer results to be managed properly if there is a need. As it is expected to receive&#xD;
      Sinopharm vaccine there will be comparison between results of the two types of vaccine. To&#xD;
      our knowledge this will be the first study done on Egyptian population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 has been in the human population for more than a year now, causing severe disease&#xD;
      in some and resulting in a pandemic that continues to put severe strain on economies and&#xD;
      healthcare infrastructures worldwide. Vaccination is considered as one of the greatest&#xD;
      successes in medical history. Based on prior experience with the development of SARS-CoV&#xD;
      vaccines, all COVID-19 vaccines must be subjected to the tests for protective effects and&#xD;
      harmful risks derived from antibody-dependent enhancement that may contribute to augmented&#xD;
      infectivity and/or eosinophilic infiltration. The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is now being developed&#xD;
      urgently in several different ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UK, the first three vaccines have emergency use authorization, and a national rollout&#xD;
      is in progress. Many other countries are also instigating large scale vaccination programmes.&#xD;
      Assessment of the safety and efficacy of vaccines against the severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in different populations is essential .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UK government recently decided to extend the interval between the first dose of the&#xD;
      Pfizer BioNTech and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines from 3 weeks to 12 weeks to maximise the&#xD;
      number of people receiving the initial dose, despite the trials only providing vaccine&#xD;
      efficacy data based on a schedule of 21 days between doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many reports were raised claiming Astrazenica vaccine for the development of vascular&#xD;
      thrombosis and studies are not finalized regarding this issue .&#xD;
&#xD;
      China is regarded as one of the world's leading countries in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development,&#xD;
      up to date the last inactivated vaccine international clinical (Phase III) trial was launched&#xD;
      in the United Arab Emirates by Sinopharm China National Biotec Group (CNBG).The ability to&#xD;
      track and trace vaccines through the vaccine supply chain down to persons vaccinated has to&#xD;
      be enhanced.&#xD;
