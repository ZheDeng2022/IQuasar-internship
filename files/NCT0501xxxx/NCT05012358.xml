      This study is an observational longitudinal study involving the use of MRIs and video&#xD;
      recordings taken at home of patients completing basic tasks. Once consent is obtained,&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to schedule an appointment with radiology to undergo the listed MRIs&#xD;
      of the heart and/or muscle. Subjects will also be given instructions on how to use the video&#xD;
      recording app on their personal devices, or study provided device. The subjects will be&#xD;
      followed regularly over the course of two years, submitting video recordings of their&#xD;
      movements and reporting to Mayo Clinic for MRIs as scheduled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial myopathy follows a slowly progressive disease course of gradual worsening of&#xD;
      muscle weakness and fatigability. Progressive mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to result&#xD;
      in structural muscle deterioration (eventually muscle fiber atrophy/necrosis) and underlie&#xD;
      these symptoms. Therefore, the study hypothesis is that longitudinal imaging of muscle will&#xD;
      capture mitochondrial (using muscle MRS) and structural (using muscle MRI) abnormalities to&#xD;
      inform objectively disease progression by capturing structural and biochemical changes in&#xD;
      muscle over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional multivariate analysis tools such as partial least squares-discriminant analysis&#xD;
      (PLS-DA) and principal component analysis (PCA) will be used to assess variables of&#xD;
      importance in discrimination of 3 subgroups based on underlying molecular defect&#xD;
      (mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and deletions, and nuclear gene mutations (nDNA)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be followed by implementation of Collaborative Laboratory Integrated Reports (CLIR)&#xD;
      software, a multivariate pattern recognition software that generates post-analytical&#xD;
      interpretive tools. This study proposes to quantitatively measure MRS analytes (i.e. lactate,&#xD;
      adenosine triphosphate (ATP), etc.) and structural muscle changes by MRI (edema, fat content,&#xD;
      etc.). The capability for interactive data analysis would be necessary because of the nature&#xD;
      of mitochondrial myopathy (MM) progression. One of the functionalities of CLIR is the&#xD;
      creation of post-analytical tools applicable to either diagnosis of one condition - single&#xD;
      condition tool; or differential diagnosis between two conditions with overlapping phenotypes&#xD;
      (mtDNA deletions, mtDNA mutations, nDNA mutations) - dual scatter plots. The advantages of&#xD;
      CLIR are (1) integration of primary markers with all informative permutations of&#xD;
      ratios/biomarkers. Ratios calculated between markers not directly related at the biochemical&#xD;
      level are particularly helpful to correct for pre-analytical factors and potential analytical&#xD;
      bias (2) adjusted for multiple covariates (age, sex) (3) generating individual plots of&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an observational longitudinal study involving the use of MRIs and video&#xD;
      recordings taken at home of patients completing basic tasks. Subjects will be approached at&#xD;
      outpatient appointments, or via phone/mail. Once consent is obtained, subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to schedule an appointment with radiology to undergo the listed MRIs of the heart and/or&#xD;
      muscle. Subjects will also be given instructions on how to use the video recording app on&#xD;
      their personal devices, or study provided device. The subjects will be followed regularly&#xD;
      over the course of two years, submitting video recordings of their movements and reporting to&#xD;
      Mayo Clinic for MRIs as scheduled. Patients may withdraw from the study at any time without&#xD;
      repercussion.&#xD;
