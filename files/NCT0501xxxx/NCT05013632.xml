      The objective of the COVID-19 International Drug Pregnancy Registry (COVID-PR) is to evaluate&#xD;
      obstetric, neonatal, and infant outcomes among women who required at least one in-hospital or&#xD;
      ambulatory medication for mild to severe COVID-19 at any time during pregnancy or within 90&#xD;
      days prior to the first day of the last menstrual period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale and background: Medicine developers, academic labs, and other organizations&#xD;
      globally are developing medical products to treat COVID-19. Potential treatments include&#xD;
      medications currently used or studied to treat other diseases (&quot;repurposed&quot; treatments), as&#xD;
      well as medications newly identified or designed to treat COVID-19. Pregnant women will be&#xD;
      treated with these medications which, for the most part, lack scientific evidence regarding&#xD;
      safety for the mother and the developing offspring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of the COVID-19 International Drug Pregnancy Registry (COVID-PR) is&#xD;
      to estimate the effect that medications indicated for mild to severe COVID-19 have on&#xD;
      obstetric, neonatal, and infant outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Primary Endpoints: Risk of obstetric outcomes (gestational diabetes, hypertensive&#xD;
      disorders during pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage, Cesarean section, preterm delivery),&#xD;
      neonatal outcomes (major congenital malformations, low birth weight, small for gestational&#xD;
      age), and infant outcomes until 1 year of age (physical and cognitive developmental&#xD;
      milestones).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: Risk of obstetric outcomes (miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal death,&#xD;
      maternal death), neonatal outcomes (number of days in NICU), infant outcomes until 1 year of&#xD;
      age (COVID-19, severe infections), and maternal outcomes until the infant's 1 year of age&#xD;
      (e.g., depression, COVID-19 re-infection and other infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The COVID-PR is an international, noninterventional, post-marketing cohort&#xD;
      study designed to collect prospective safety data among pregnant women treated&#xD;
      pharmacologically for mild to severe COVID-19 at any time during pregnancy or within 90 days&#xD;
      prior to the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP). It includes maternal and offspring&#xD;
      follow-up until the infant's one year of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: The study population includes women 18 years of age and older who required&#xD;
      in-hospital or ambulatory pharmacological treatment for mild to severe COVID-19 at any time&#xD;
      during pregnancy or within 90 days prior to the first day of the LMP. Registration and&#xD;
      participation via website especially developed for the COVID-PR are voluntary. Eligible women&#xD;
      can enroll at any time during pregnancy and up to 30 days after the end of pregnancy.&#xD;
      Postpartum mothers and their live offspring are followed-up to the infant's one year of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure: Women are considered exposed if they received at least one dose of a medication&#xD;
      indicated for the treatment of mild to severe COVID-19 at any time during pregnancy or within&#xD;
      90 days prior to the first day of the LMP. The reference groups include pregnant women&#xD;
      treated with another therapy for mild to severe COVID-19 (active comparator) and pregnant&#xD;
      women hospitalized but not treated with a medication specifically indicated for the treatment&#xD;
      of mild to severe COVID-19 (unexposed comparator for hospitalized exposed patients), matched&#xD;
      based on calendar time, country of residence, gestational week of COVID-19 infection (+ / - 2&#xD;
      weeks), and severity of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Pregnancy data are collected at enrollment, monthly, and at the end of&#xD;
      pregnancy. Data on mothers and liveborn infants are collected at birth and then every three&#xD;
      months until the infant's 12 months of age. Information is obtained directly from the&#xD;
      participant. Detailed information is collected on COVID-19 symptoms, severity markers, and&#xD;
      treatments. Additionally, a COVID-PR research scientist calls the mother within 90 days after&#xD;
      birth to answer any questions she may have about the registry and to request any missing&#xD;
      information. The COVID-PR collects data on potential confounding factors (such as maternal&#xD;
      sociodemographic characteristics, behaviors, reproductive history, use of assisted&#xD;
      reproductive techniques, pre-pregnancy history of COVID-19 and test results, chronic&#xD;
      conditions, use of medications, and measures of healthcare utilization) and detailed&#xD;
      information associated with the obstetric, neonatal, and infant outcomes. Given the&#xD;
      international nature of the COVID-PR, the questionnaires are available in the languages&#xD;
      spoken where it is conducted. Likewise, the phone call is conducted in the language spoken by&#xD;
      the mother. Participant confidentiality and anonymity are strictly upheld.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Exposure to medications indicated for mild to severe COVID-19 during specific&#xD;
      etiologically relevant periods will be considered when estimating the risk for each outcome&#xD;
      (e.g., first trimester for miscarriages and malformations). Relative risks and their 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval (CI) will be presented unadjusted and adjusted using propensity scores&#xD;
      (PS) to account for imbalances in disease severity, comorbidities, and other characteristics&#xD;
      between the exposed and the reference groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study size: Medications indicated for mild to severe COVID-19 will be analyzed separately by&#xD;
      brand. Efforts will be made to collect at least 100 pregnancies treated with specific&#xD;
      medications during the first trimester and at least 100 exposed thereafter during pregnancy.&#xD;
      For each exposed pregnancy, one pregnancy treated with another therapy for mild to severe&#xD;
      COVID-19 (active comparator) and one pregnancy hospitalized but not treated with a medication&#xD;
      specifically indicated for the treatment of mild to severe COVID-19 (unexposed comparator for&#xD;
      hospitalized exposed patients) will be matched based on calendar time, country of residence,&#xD;
      gestational week of COVID-19 infection (+ / - 2 weeks), and severity of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Milestones: The total duration of the study will be 5 years. Obstetric, neonatal, and infant&#xD;
      outcomes will be assessed on an ongoing basis as data become available. The first two years&#xD;
      will include, primarily, enrollment of pregnancies; the third and fourth years will involve&#xD;
      follow-up of pregnancies and newborns; and, the final year, will be for data analyses and&#xD;
      publications. Annual interim reports will be submitted to the Scientific Advisory Committee&#xD;
      (SAC) for their review and feedback as well as abbreviated semiannual progress reports&#xD;
      summarizing cumulative results on key outcomes. A final report will be prepared at the end of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Governance: The COVID-PR is conducted by Pregistry and includes an internal Safety Management&#xD;
      Team (SMT) of experienced pharmacovigilance professionals and a dysmorphologist that meet&#xD;
      regularly to review individual cases and safety signals. Additionally, the COVID-PR is in&#xD;
      consultation with experts from relevant fields, such as maternal-fetal medicine, infectious&#xD;
      diseases, epidemiology, and biostatistics from academic institutions and private practice.&#xD;
      These individuals constitute the SAC and provide an independent review of the COVID-PR data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sponsors: Pharmaceutical companies that hold the marketing authorization of medications for&#xD;
      mild to severe COVID-19 are invited to sponsor the COVID-PR.&#xD;
