    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trail is to investigate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 antibody&#xD;
      Tislelizumab plus TP regimen (taxane combined with platinum) as neoadjuvant therapy for&#xD;
      patients diagnosed as local advanced cervical carcinoma (FIGO staging IB2-IIB).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This phase I study is being conducted to establish efficacy and safety of Tislelizumab plus&#xD;
      TP regimen (taxane combined with platinum) as neoadjuvant therapy for patients diagnosed as&#xD;
      local advanced cervical carcinoma (FIGO staging IB2-IIB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will receive same intervention. Treatment naïve patients who are&#xD;
      diagnosed as local advanced cervical squamous cell carcinoma will receive Tislelizumab plus&#xD;
      TP regimen before surgery for 3 cycles. After treatment, radiographic evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed to assess clinical efficacy. Patients who have objective response will undergo&#xD;
      radical surgery. Patients who are disease stable or progression will undergo radical&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy. The primary endpoint is major pathological response rate (MPR).&#xD;
