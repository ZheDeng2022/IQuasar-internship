  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternity waiting homes (MWHs) were identified as a solution to improve pregnancy outcomes by&#xD;
      bringing women living in geographically isolated areas closer to a healthcare facility.&#xD;
      Literature shows that MWHs contribute significantly to the reduction of maternal death and&#xD;
      stillbirth among users. Despite its importance in improving maternal &amp; neonatal health&#xD;
      outcomes, the utilization of MWHs is very low in Ethiopia. It is important to investigate&#xD;
      what strategies could be effective in improving MWH utilization. Therefore, in this study&#xD;
      cluster-randomized controlled trials will be conducted to evaluate the effect of male partner&#xD;
      involvement on MWH utilization and pregnancy outcomes in Ethiopia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary cause of adverse maternal health outcomes has been identified to be the delay in&#xD;
      reaching care. This is often attributed to the long distances women need to travel to gain&#xD;
      access to health facilities. Literature shows that maternity waiting homes contribute&#xD;
      significantly to the reduction of maternal death and stillbirth among users. Despite its&#xD;
      importance in improving maternal &amp; neonatal health outcomes, the utilization of MWHs is very&#xD;
      low in Ethiopia. So, it is important to investigate what strategies could be effective in&#xD;
      improving MWH utilization in Ethiopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of male partner involvement on MWH&#xD;
      utilization in Hadiya Zone, Southern Ethiopia. A cluster-randomized controlled trial will be&#xD;
      performed. The intervention will have two arms, i.e., intervention and control. It will be a&#xD;
      behavioral intervention. The interventions will be health education, home visit, and phone&#xD;
      counseling. Health education will be delivered to &quot;husband-expectant wife&quot; pairs at the&#xD;
      baseline. Then home visits will be conducted at the beginning of every month. Phone&#xD;
      counseling will be conducted in the mid of every month. The study participants will be&#xD;
      pregnant women in their second trimesters who live with their male partners at the time of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be conducted at the cluster level. Clusters will be health care&#xD;
      facilities. Study participants and assessors will be masked. The total sample size will be&#xD;
      388 [194 in each arm]. Data analysis will be conducted by STATA Version 14.0 using an&#xD;
      Intention-To-Treat Approach. The duration of the intervention will be six months.&#xD;
