      Long term Surgical Outcomes of Viscotrabeculotomy in Pediatric Glaucoma Following Cataract&#xD;
      Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare outcomes of single-site rigid probe viscotrabeculotomy (VT) to&#xD;
      two-site VT in pediatric secondary glaucoma following cataract surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a comparative study was performed on patients aged ≤ 12 years and required surgery&#xD;
      for glaucoma following congenital cataract surgery (GFCS) with or without intraocular lens&#xD;
      (IOL) implantation. Eyes in which the trabeculotomy involves &lt;180° of Schlemm's canal ,eyes&#xD;
      that have synechial angle closure over ≥ 90° and eyes that have previous procedures other&#xD;
      than lensectomy or IOL implantation are excluded from the study. Eyes are then randomized to&#xD;
      undergo single-site VT or two-site VT using a random table. The two-site VT by the rigid&#xD;
      probe trabeculotome is performed through a superonasal and an inferotemporal triangular&#xD;
      scleral flap. Intraocular pressure (IOP), anti-glaucoma medications, complications and&#xD;
      success rates at dates of follow up are all reported. Success is defined as IOP between 6-20&#xD;
      mmHg or 35% IOP reduction with or without topical anti-glaucoma medications and without&#xD;
      visually-devastating complications or additional glaucoma surgery.&#xD;

      Long term Surgical Outcomes of Viscotrabeculotomy in Pediatric Glaucoma Following Cataract&#xD;
      Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite advances in congenital cataract management, secondary glaucoma (SG) remains a major&#xD;
      postoperative sight-threatening complication, with open-angle glaucoma being the predominant&#xD;
      type in both aphakic and pseudophakic children . Although the pathogenesis of glaucoma after&#xD;
      cataract surgery remains unclear, several risk factors have been identified. These include&#xD;
      early surgery, chronic postoperative inflammation , primary posterior capsulotomy ,&#xD;
      persistence of fetal vasculature , and microphthalmia .&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the pathogenesis of the classic, open-angle type of glaucoma that develops on&#xD;
      average 1.3-12.2 years following uneventful cataract surgery is still obscure. Mechanical&#xD;
      collapse of the trabecular meshwork due to the loss of ciliary body tension could be one of&#xD;
      the possible reasons. Some speculate that obstruction of the trabecular meshwork by&#xD;
      inflammatory cells, lens remnants and vitreous-derived factors may result in delayed&#xD;
      elevation in IOP. Arrest of postnatal angle maturation secondary to the surgical intervention&#xD;
      could be a contributing factor, especially that aphakic glaucoma is more likely to occur in&#xD;
      patients who had lensectomy at a younger age, usually the first year of life. The incidence&#xD;
      of secondary pediatric glaucoma after cataract surgery is not yet precisely identified. It&#xD;
      ranges from 3%-41% depending on the follow-up period and the criteria chosen to define&#xD;
      glaucoma . Management of paediatric glaucoma following cataract surgery (GFCS) is&#xD;
      challenging. Trabeculectomy has a poor success rate and precludes the use of contact lenses,&#xD;
      especially in the presence of thin, avascular, cystic blebs . Glaucoma drainage devices have&#xD;
      a higher chance of success than trabeculectomy, but aphakic eyes have relatively higher rates&#xD;
      of complications, especially suprachoroidal haemorrhage, if hypotony occurs particularly if&#xD;
      buphthalmic. GDD-implanted eyes also carry a life-long risk of developing keratopathy&#xD;
      secondary to endothelial decompensation from the tube end .Cyclodestructive procedures&#xD;
      provide a temporizing treatment with occasional longterm control after multiple treatments.&#xD;
      Yet, it is difficult to titrate with marked inflammation and a risk of phthisis, especially&#xD;
      in microphthalmic eyes. Furthermore, it may be associated with chronic hypotony and may&#xD;
      prejudice future surgery to failure. Angle surgery was first described as a surgical option&#xD;
      in GFCS by Chen et al., yielding promising results in terms of IOP lowering and surgical&#xD;
      success. Unlike bleb-based procedures, angle surgery addresses the more physiological outflow&#xD;
      pathway through the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal. Hence the risk of bleb-based&#xD;
      complications such as infection, bleb leak, overfiltration and bleb dysthesia is reduced.&#xD;
      With the growing evidence that circumferential trabeculotomy yields superior results to&#xD;
      conventional 180° angle surgery in primary congenital glaucoma16, Freedman et al.&#xD;
      retrospectively reported the results of microcatheter-assisted circumferential trabeculotomy&#xD;
      in GFCS, achieving a 72% success rate. several reports in treatment of pediatric glaucoma&#xD;
      have concluded that the use of viscoelastic materials during trabeculotomy may increase the&#xD;
      success rate of the procedure by preventing ocular decompression, postoperative hemorrhage,&#xD;
      anterior chamber shallowness, and adhesion of the incision lips or fibroblastic&#xD;
      proliferation18.The purpose of the present study was to compare outcomes of single-site rigid&#xD;
      probe viscotrabeculotomy (VT) Versus two-site VT in pediatric secondary glaucoma following&#xD;
      cataract surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a comparative study , performed on patients aged ≤ 12 years and required surgery for&#xD;
      glaucoma following congenital cataract surgery (GFCS) with or without intraocular lens (IOL)&#xD;
      implantation. The study will be conducted at the outpatient clinic of Mansoura Ophthalmic&#xD;
      Center of Mansoura University in Mansoura, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eyes in which the trabeculotomy involves &lt;180° of Schlemm's canal ,eyes that have synechial&#xD;
      angle closure over ≥ 90° and eyes that have previous procedures other than lensectomy or IOL&#xD;
      implantation are excluded from the study. Eyes are then randomized to undergo single-site VT&#xD;
      or two-site VT using a random table. The two-site VT by the rigid probe trabeculotome is&#xD;
      performed through a superonasal and an inferotemporal triangular scleral flap. The primary&#xD;
      outcome of this study is compare the success rate in lowering IOP between the 2 surgical&#xD;
      options; the single-site VT versus two-site VT. Success is defined as IOP between 6-20 mmHg&#xD;
      or 35% IOP reduction with or without topical anti-glaucoma medications and without&#xD;
      visually-devastating complications or additional glaucoma surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary clinical outcomes will include Intraocular pressure (IOP) control values,&#xD;
      horizontal corneal diameter, axial length, cup- disc ratio, antiglaucoma medication,&#xD;
      refractive error and postoperative complications in these 2 surgical procedures. Data will be&#xD;
      analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analysis was accomplished using IBM SPSS version 20. Assessment of the data&#xD;
      normality was done using both Histogram plot and Shapiro-Wilk's test. Wilcoxon test was used&#xD;
      to compare the preoperative and postoperative variables in each group. The comparison between&#xD;
      the two groups was done using Mann-Whitney test for numerical variables and Chi-square test&#xD;
      for categorical variables. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted to estimate the mean&#xD;
      survival time and probabilities of failure at different follow-up stages in the both groups.&#xD;
      For all tests, P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.&#xD;
