  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fluorescein Corneal Staining (FCS) Score From Baseline to Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FCS indicates the damage to the corneal epithelium. The degree of staining of the cornea after blue fluorescein staining under the slit lamp illumination of a cobalt blue light source was evaluated according to the National Eye Institute/Industry grading system.&#xD;
Per the National Eye Institute/Industry Workshop report, the cornea was divided into 5 fractions, each of which was given a staining score from 0 to 3, and the total score was calculated(0-15)(0 is better).</description>

    <measure>Fluorescein Corneal Staining (FCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of staining of the cornea after blue fluorescein staining under the slit lamp illumination of a cobalt blue light source was evaluated according to the National Eye Institute/Industry grading system.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lissamine Green Conjunctival Staining (LGCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>After lysamine green staining under slit lamps, the conjunctival staining was evaluated according to the National Eye Institute/Industry grading system.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unanesthetized Schirmer's test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>After the eyes were wiped and the Schirmer test paper was inserted into the right eye at 1/3 of the lower eyelid without eye anesthesia and inserted into the left eye. After 5 minutes with the eyes closed, the Schirmer test paper was removed from the right side in the order of insertion and the left side removed. The wet length was measured in millimeters and the length of the midpoint was measured when the wet border was oblique.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tear Film Break-up Time (TBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>After blinking blue fluorescein staining of the cobalt blue light source, it was observed from the blinking point that there was a black spot, a streak pattern or a fluorine defect in the fluorescein-tear layer Was measured in seconds. The measurement results were repeated three times and average values were used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ocular surface disease index was assessed for ocular surface disease, including visual function (five items), eye symptoms (four items), and environmental factors (three items) , 0 point for none of the time, 1 point for some of the time, 2 points for half of the time, 3 points for most of the time, and 4 points for all of the time.</description>
