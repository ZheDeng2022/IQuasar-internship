  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cluster B personality disorders (borderline, narcissistic, antisocial and/or histrionic) are&#xD;
      an important clinical consideration because of their high prevalence and associated&#xD;
      morbidity. Although many studies examine borderline personality disorder, few of them explore&#xD;
      cluster B personality disorders as a whole. In clinical practice, personality disorders are&#xD;
      frequently comorbid. Patients who receive services in specialized clinics for these disorders&#xD;
      often have a complex diagnosis that include many cluster B personality disorders. Therefore,&#xD;
      our study globally examines patients with cluster B personality disorders even though&#xD;
      borderline personality disorder is empirically the most studied psychopathology. Previous&#xD;
      data suggests that borderline personality disorder has a prevalence of 2% in the general&#xD;
      population, of 25% in the clinical psychiatric population and of 15% in all visits to the&#xD;
      emergency room. Furthermore, it is associated with social costs estimated from 15,000$ to&#xD;
      50,000$ USD per patient per year. In Quebec, this psychopathology is associated with an&#xD;
      increased mortality rate compared to the general population, totaling a loss of nine years&#xD;
      for women and 13 years for men of life expectancy. Other studies suggest that borderline&#xD;
      personality disorder is often comorbid with other personality disorders, including those in&#xD;
      cluster B. The population with comorbid personality disorders have a worse prognosis and a&#xD;
      lower chance of reaching symptomatic remission, which is the reason why it is crucial to&#xD;
      better understand and study patients with cluster B personality disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study compares the effectiveness of two psychotherapies for borderline personality&#xD;
      disorder, mentalization-based therapy and a modified version of Linehan's dialectical&#xD;
      behavior therapy, in a retrospective naturalistic study of patients with at least one cluster&#xD;
      B personality disorder who have undergone either treatment. The scarcity of data on cluster B&#xD;
      personality disorders and on the comparison between MBT and DBT further highlights the&#xD;
      necessity of a naturalistic study like ours to examine both aspects and bring research closer&#xD;
      to the clinical setting. Based on clinical observations, the investigators believe that there&#xD;
      will be no statistically significant difference between either treatment.&#xD;

    <description>An empirically-validated intervention for personality disorders based on the attachment theory and on knowledge from developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience (Bateman and Fonagy, 2004). Patients assist psychoeducative group meetings beforehand, along with a pretreatment of four to six individual meetings (over four to eight weeks), followed by bi-weekly individual follow-ups and weekly group follow-ups. The treatment lasts two years. Patients have an assessment meeting with their individual therapist and one of the group therapists at the end of each session. Psychiatric follow-up appointments are on an as-needed basis and every patient has a treatment contract with specific and measurable treatment objectives.</description>

    <description>A psychotherapy developed by M. Linehan for patients with borderline personality disorder that combines cognitive behavioral therapy techniques (emotional regulation, practical exercises) with Buddhist meditation principles (stress tolerance, acceptance, open-mindedness) (Linehan, M. M. &amp; Dimeff, L., 2001). As opposed to Linehan's model, individual meetings are bi-weekly, no emergency phone service is offered, the mindful meditation module is reorganized into life habits modules, and every module includes mindfulness exercises. Patients assist psychoeducative group meetings beforehand, along with a pre-treatment of 4-6 individual meetings (over 4-8 weeks), followed by bi-weekly individual follow-ups and weekly group follow-ups. The treatment lasts one year, but can be extended to two years for eligible patients who are interested. Psychiatric follow-up appointments are on an as-needed basis. Every every patient has a treatment contract with specific and measurable treatment objectives.</description>
