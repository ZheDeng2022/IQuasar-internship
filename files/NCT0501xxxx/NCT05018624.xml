  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the effectiveness of chat-based intervention on reducing risky&#xD;
      alcohol consumption to inform clinical practice for providing ABI to risky drinkers attending&#xD;
      AED in Hong Kong.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use is a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases and 6th leading cause of&#xD;
      death and disability-adjusted life years. The prevalence of alcohol consumption has increased&#xD;
      since 2008 after introduction of zero tax on alcohol with strength &lt;30% (e.g., wine and beer)&#xD;
      and due to promoting the city as Asia's wine hub. ABI reduced alcohol intake by about&#xD;
      20g/week at 12-month follow-up in primary healthcare populations. Given the relatively low&#xD;
      prevalence of risky alcohol drinkers in Hong Kong, testing ABI in clinics may face&#xD;
      difficulties in recruitment. Alcohol use is associated with problems such as injury and&#xD;
      violence requiring accident and emergency department (AED) services, thus AEDs in Hong Kong&#xD;
      are more feasible places to recruit subjects for delivering ABI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis: The Intervention group has significantly larger reduction of weekly&#xD;
      alcohol consumption compared with the Control group at 12-month follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses: Compared with the Control group, the Intervention group has lower AUDIT&#xD;
      scores, fewer episodes of heavy/binge drinking, lower re-attendence at AED and reduced&#xD;
      alcohol-related harms at 6-month and 12-month follow-up.&#xD;

The participant is asked to indicate his/her health state by checking the box next to the most appropriate response level. Responses are coded as single-digit numbers expressing the severity level selected in each dimension. Extreme problem is coded as 5, severe problem is coded as 4, moderate is coded as 3, slight problem is coded as 2 and no problem is coded as 1.</description>

    <description>The chat-based IM support is the extension of baseline ABI and regular e-messages, which aims to provide real-time behavioral and psychosocial support to reduce or quit drinking. It will be personalized according to the subjects' characteristics (gender, drinking pattern and alcoholic drinks preferences), intention to drink and specific questions regarding drinking. Through real-time chatting (text and/or voice), drinkers can acquire information on consequences of drinking and gain social support immediately to reduce intention to drink and alcohol consumption.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HK resident able to read/communicate in Cantonese/Putonghua. This may exclude&#xD;
             potential subjects from other countries with higher alcohol consumption than local&#xD;
             Chinese, but quality of the chat-based intervention is important for the research&#xD;
             hypothesis, and it will not be feasible to recruit other language speakers (e.g.,&#xD;
             English) in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged ≥18 with proficiency in using IM Apps (e.g., WhatsApp, WeChat). Those aged &lt;18&#xD;
             are excluded as other studies suggest they have different patterns of alcohol drinking&#xD;
             and reduction from adult drinkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those unable to understand or receive face-to-face ABI due to severe traumatic injury,&#xD;
             unconscious, or drunk patients unable to follow commands&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticipated to be admitted to in-patient department for &gt;1 week, which will interfere&#xD;
             with the chat-based intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having psychiatric/psychological diseases or receiving regular psychotropic medication&#xD;
