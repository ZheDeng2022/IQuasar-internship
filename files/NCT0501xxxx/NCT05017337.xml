      BASILICA is a UK NIHR Biomedical Research Centre funded study recruiting patients at The&#xD;
      Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. The study aims to obtain blood and tissue samples from&#xD;
      patients with breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), capsular&#xD;
      contracture and implant-naïve patients undergoing primary implant insertion surgery for&#xD;
      translational scientific analysis.&#xD;

      BASILICA is a translational research study being undertaken at The Royal Marsden NHS&#xD;
      Foundation Trust that aims to investigate aetiology of breast implant-associated anaplastic&#xD;
      large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), capsular contracture (CC) as well as the immune changes that&#xD;
      occur in implant-naïve patients undergoing primary implant insertion surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIA-ALCL is a rare tumour seen in a very small number of women with textured breast implants.&#xD;
      Overall incidence is estimated at 2 per 1,000,000 women/year with a lifetime risk of 1 in&#xD;
      30,000 for textured breast implants. It presents commonly with a sudden seroma around an&#xD;
      implant or, occasionally, as a soft tissue mass adjacent to the implant capsule. In 2016, the&#xD;
      disease was classified by the WHO as a CD30+ ALK- non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma. Surgery (en&#xD;
      bloc capsulectomy) is curative for the majority of cases. Scientific appreciation of&#xD;
      aetiology is limited but current thinking implicates chronic inflammation as a protagonist&#xD;
      for pathogenesis through hypertonic antigen presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CC is the fibrotic tightening of a capsule that forms around a breast implant and leads to&#xD;
      palpable hardening, pain and visible distortion. The biggest risk factor is radiotherapy with&#xD;
      quoted incidence rates as high as 50% in some series. Management is a significant clinical&#xD;
      challenge with limited options and high recurrence rates. The most common surgical approaches&#xD;
      are to remove the capsule (capsulectomy) or exchange and change the anatomical plane of&#xD;
      implant placement. The only definitive surgical management is to explant the implant and&#xD;
      perform autologous breast reconstruction, if feasible, or, no reconstruction at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASILICA will obtain pathological capsular tissue (CC and BIA-ALCL) and non-pathological&#xD;
      capsule tissue (control tissue) as well as blood samples from patients undergoing any form of&#xD;
      implant-related surgery. The investigators aim to use these tissues to perform translational&#xD;
      analyses investigating the aetiology of each pathology and the physiological immunological&#xD;
      response to silicone implant insertion. They hypothesise that 1) specific differences exist&#xD;
      in the immunological and matrisomal profiles of CC and BIA-ALCL that drive the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of each clinical entity, and that 2) insertion of a silicone prosthesis causes changes in the&#xD;
      composition of the humoral and cellular components of the circulating immune system.&#xD;
