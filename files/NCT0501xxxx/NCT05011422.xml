      efficacy of a familial mismatched or haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;

    <description>Once pheresed, the product will be washed to remove platelets and the cell concentration will be adjusted per laboratory and ClinicMACS technology recommendations. It is then labeled using the CliniMACS αβ-TCR Biotin Kit and CD19+ immunomagnetic microbeads. After labeling, the cells are washed to remove unbound microbeads. The partially processed product is loaded on the CliniMACS device where labeled cells are depleted and the negative fraction is eluted off the device. The negative fraction is centrifuged and volume reconstituted to obtain the final product</description>

&#xD;
          -  Presence of significant anti-donor HLA antibodies per institutional standards.&#xD;
