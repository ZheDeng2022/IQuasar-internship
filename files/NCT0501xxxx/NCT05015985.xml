  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety, fright, stress and pain have always been sources of emotional distress for patients&#xD;
      undergoing invasive procedures in clinical settings. Experts have long used traditional&#xD;
      methods such as analgesics and anxiolytics to address these issues. But, backed by a movement&#xD;
      aiming at reducing the use of pharmacological products, alternative interventions, including&#xD;
      music therapy, have gained some steam in recent years. These interventions may have the&#xD;
      ability to reduce pain and anxiety while increasing relaxation, coping skills and the overall&#xD;
      experience of the procedure. For orthopedic surgery, anesthetics could propose general&#xD;
      anesthesia or locoregional anesthesia. The upper limb orthopedic surgery is often performed&#xD;
      under locoregional anesthesia and in the ambulatory procedure. However, with the known&#xD;
      exacerbating effects of stress and anxiety on pain, the affective experience of the patient&#xD;
      can be negatively influenced. In order to mitigate these problems, various types of sedatives&#xD;
      and anxiolytics and even low-dose propofol can be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Montpellier Regional University Hospital, along with the Music Care Company developed a&#xD;
      software so as to standardize this technique around these recommendations. This model&#xD;
      demonstrated its efficacy in both acute and chronic pain settings. Indeed, a single music&#xD;
      therapy session was found to be effective for decreasing anxiety and promoting relaxation, as&#xD;
      indicated by decreases in heart rate, blood pressure, BIS and respiratory rate over the&#xD;
      intervention period in intubated patients during weaning phase. Also, a patient-controlled&#xD;
      music intervention administered by Music Care has shown to alleviate negative psychological&#xD;
      (e.g., depression) and physiological (e.g., pain and discomfort) outcomes and, very&#xD;
      importantly, to reduce the consumption of medication in patients with chronic pain due to&#xD;
      lumbar pain, fibromyalgia, inflammatory or neurological diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the recent availability of a standardized and proven delivery method of music therapy&#xD;
      (i.e. MUSIC-CARE), the principal aim of this randomized clinical trial is to assess the&#xD;
      effect of this music therapy program delivered by application compared to usual playlist&#xD;
      music on drug consumptions and physiological parameters, pain, anxiety levels in patients&#xD;
      undergoing forearm orthopedic surgery under locoregional anesthesia.&#xD;

      This is a randomized controlled clinical study on patients who were followed during their&#xD;
      forearm orthopedic surgery. The research has been submitted and approved by the Institutional&#xD;
      review Board (IRB) at the American Hospital of Paris. Before their inclusion in the study,&#xD;
      after to give their consentment, patients were verbally given details about the methods and&#xD;
      techniques of the music session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled to undergo forearm orthopedic surgery (SR) under regional anesthesia are&#xD;
      recruited in this study. They are assigned to one of 2 groups in a randomized manner.&#xD;
      Excluding criteria are age less 18 years or up 80 years, patients who do not like music for&#xD;
      cultural reason, having serious psychiatric disorder, or with not paired deafness or paired&#xD;
      one with devices that were incompatible with wearing a headset. After randomization, patients&#xD;
      are placed in the control group, using a music support from playlist, or assigned to the&#xD;
      MUSICARE group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both group, after per os hydroxyzine premedication, each patient received a regional&#xD;
      anesthesia using mepivacaine 2%, at least 20 minutes before skin incision under tourniquet.&#xD;
      The regional anesthesia is performed using either an axillary plexus block or mild-arm trunk&#xD;
      nerve block with electrical nerve stimulation and ultrasound nerve localization. The music&#xD;
      support is started before to do the regional anesthesia and continued during all the&#xD;
      orthopedic procedure. According to the anxiety level and patient request, an intravenous&#xD;
      titration of midazolam was infused 1 mg per 1 mg to get a sedative score less or equal to 1.&#xD;
      If this target is not met after 3 mg of midazolam, the anesthetist could infuse a low dose of&#xD;
      propofol (20 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During all the procedure, the anesthetist performing the regional anesthesia and the&#xD;
      intravenous hypnotic administration, is blinded about the patient group and musicThe&#xD;
      Music-Care app is a receptive music intervention, allowing the patient to freely adjust the&#xD;
      length of and choose the preferred style between different sequences of instrumental music.&#xD;
      All musical pieces were recorded in high-quality recording studios with professional&#xD;
      musicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music-Care utilizes the &quot;U&quot; technique, designed to gradually relax the listener. In the&#xD;
      current study, music sequences during patients' sessions were based on the mount &quot;U&quot;, and&#xD;
      instrumental musical works were selected for a varying numbers styles (classical, jazz, world&#xD;
      music, etc.) and adapted to the patient's style via patient request. The &quot;U&quot; technique is&#xD;
      implemented using a musical sequence of 20 minutes that was divided into 5 different musical&#xD;
      pieces at 3 to 4 minutes each. Initially, the objective is to represent the patient's state&#xD;
      of tension by stimulating musical rhythm of 80-95 beats per minute (bpm). From there, the&#xD;
      remaining 4 sub-pieces are presented in a blended fashion in an attempt for the patient to&#xD;
      gradually fall into a relaxed state via a gradual reduction in musical tempo (40-80 bpm),&#xD;
      orchestral size, frequencies, and volume (descending arm of the &quot;U&quot;). The music session then&#xD;
      reaches a phase of maximum relaxation (downward phase of the &quot;U&quot;) before a phase that&#xD;
      gradually returns to baseline dynamics (ascending arm of the &quot;U&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, a music program from an established playlist with various instrumental&#xD;
      music is chosen by the patient and delivered by the same tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      program. The primary study end points were the consumptions in sedatives (midazolam and&#xD;
      propofol), from 10 minutes prior to the procedure until its end. Secondary study end points&#xD;
      were pain and anxiety scores as measured the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and the Amsterdam&#xD;
      Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS), collected before and right after the end&#xD;
      of the procedure in the recovery room. We also evaluated the physiological parameters, such&#xD;
      as sedation score ( 0: awake; 1: unconsciousness but reactive to verbal stimulation; 2:&#xD;
      unconsciousness but reactive to nociceptive stimulation; 3: areactive to stimulation) , heart&#xD;
      rate, arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation at different time points between T0 (10&#xD;
      minutes prior to the beginning of the procedure) and T45 (45 minutes after it). Satisfaction&#xD;
      was also collected using a scale from 0 to 5, with a higher score for a high satisfaction,&#xD;
      right after the end of the procedure in the recovery room.&#xD;
