    <description>The HairCheck Trichometer will be used to measure hair caliber and hair density together and expresses them as a single number called the Hair Mass Index (HMI) or &quot;Hair Number.&quot; The hair mass index (HMI) is ratio of the cross-sectional area of an isolated bundle of hair and the pre-measured area of skin from which it was taken using the trichometer device.&#xD;
The Folliscope (LeadM Corp, Seoul, South Korea)a phototrichogram device.5 will be used to measure density and hair diameter (per/cm2).</description>
