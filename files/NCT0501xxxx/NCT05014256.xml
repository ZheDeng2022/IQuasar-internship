  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will study how kidney care for everyone despite race can reduce racial&#xD;
      differences in care and improve access to kidney transplants, and specifically living donor&#xD;
      kidney transplants (LDKT), for individuals with chronic kidney disease. A study focused on&#xD;
      equality and patient needs (called 'STEPS') will 1) create a program to identify people who&#xD;
      may need a kidney transplant ('STEPS Surveillance') and find people in health systems who may&#xD;
      be able to receive kidney transplants early in their care and (2) study how well the 'STEPS&#xD;
      Outreach' program works (comprised of transplant social workers and transplant coordinators&#xD;
      who focus on equality and patient needs) compared to usual care to improve access to kidney&#xD;
      transplants among Black and non-Black individuals as well as to improve access to transplants&#xD;
      for everyone.&#xD;
