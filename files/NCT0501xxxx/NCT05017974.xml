  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal is to utilize a randomized control design to examine acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility, and adherence of mindfulness-based stress reduction plus prenatal sleep&#xD;
      supplement (MBSR+PS) compared to treatment as usual among pregnant people with poor sleep&#xD;
      quality (n=50).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor sleep quality is highly prevalent during pregnancy, with important implications for&#xD;
      maternal and infant health and well-being. Despite this, there is limited research on&#xD;
      interventions to improve prenatal sleep, and prior research did not target the specific&#xD;
      factors contributing to poor sleep quality in this population. Specifically, pregnant people&#xD;
      report that physical symptoms, including discomfort and pain, disturb their sleep. In&#xD;
      non-pregnant populations, this pain-sleep relationship is bidirectional, and maladaptive&#xD;
      psychological responses to pain further exacerbate poor sleep. Theory and empirical evidence&#xD;
      indicate that mindfulness-based interventions may be effective for targeting these&#xD;
      psychological responses. The overarching goal is to utilize a randomized control design to&#xD;
      examine acceptability, feasibility, and adherence of mindfulness-based stress reduction plus&#xD;
      prenatal sleep supplement (MBSR+PS) compared to treatment as usual among pregnant people with&#xD;
      poor sleep quality (n=50). Participants will be recruited to complete study questionnaires at&#xD;
      two timepoints during pregnancy. Participants randomized to MBSR+PS will receive usual care,&#xD;
      will be asked to attend 8 weekly group MBSR sessions (in addition to the MBSR orientation&#xD;
      session, 1:1 interview with the instructor, and daylong retreat) and 6-8 PS sessions&#xD;
      individually or in small groups, and will complete daily sleep and home practice diaries.&#xD;
      Participants randomized to treatment as usual will receive usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine acceptability of MBSR+PS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine feasibility of MBSR+PS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine adherence to MBSR+PS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To explore evidence of change in psychological mediators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To explore between-group differences in sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To explore group differences in other critical clinical outcomes (e.g. depressive&#xD;
           symptoms, anxiety symptoms, stress).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is strong conceptual basis to predict the potential benefit of this approach for&#xD;
      pregnant people. Targeting psychological responses to poor sleep during pregnancy may have&#xD;
      significant public health benefits.&#xD;

    <description>The study intervention is standard mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), which will be delivered through 8 weekly 2.5-hour sessions via video conferencing to groups of 20-30 pregnant and non-pregnant people. MBSR also consists of a 2.5-hour orientation session, a 30-minute private interview with the instructor, and an all-day retreat, all conducted via video conferencing. The supplemental prenatal sleep content will be delivered through 6-8 30-minute sessions via video conferencing either individually or to small groups, and draws material from mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia, mindfulness-based childbirth and parenting program, and cognitive behavior therapy for prenatal insomnia.</description>
