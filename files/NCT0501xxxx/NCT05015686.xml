      This study is a randomized, blind, controlled phase # clinical trial in population aged ≥13&#xD;
      years old. The experimental vaccine will be manufactured by Sinovac (Dalian) Vaccine&#xD;
      Technology Co., Ltd.A total of 2400 subjects aged 13 years and older will be enrolled&#xD;
      with1200 subjects in 13 ~ 17 years old group and1200 subjects in 18 years and older group.960&#xD;
      subjects in each age group will be randomly divided into experimental group and control group&#xD;
      according to 1:1 ratio,and subjects will receive two doses of vaccine with the immunization&#xD;
      course of 0,28 days, 0,42 days or 0,56 days. An additional 240 subjects in each age group&#xD;
      will be randomly divided into experimental group and control group according to 2:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive two doses of the experimental vaccine or placebo with the immunization course of 0,&#xD;
      70 days.In addition,400 subjects including 320 people of experimental group in different&#xD;
      immunization course according to the difference of age and 80 people of placebo group&#xD;
      according to the difference of age will be selected to collect blood about 3ml each time to&#xD;
      evaluate immunity persistence of live attenuated varicella vaccines at 3 and 5 years after&#xD;
      the whole immunization.&#xD;
