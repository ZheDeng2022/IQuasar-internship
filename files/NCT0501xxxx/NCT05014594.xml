  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of ascites is a landmark event in the natural history of cirrhosis and&#xD;
      signifies a grim prognosis. Portal hypertension and splanchnic arterial vasodilatation are&#xD;
      the major contributors in the development of ascites. Vasodilatation with the consequential&#xD;
      decrease in effective circulating volume leads to the activation of sympathetic nervous&#xD;
      system and renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), leading to antinatriuretic effects&#xD;
      and retention of sodium and water. This results in the formation of ascites. Management of&#xD;
      ascites primarily consists of salt restrictrion and diuretics. Liver transplant is the&#xD;
      ultimate panacea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dapaglifozin, a Sodium glucose linked transporter-2(SGLT-2) inhibitor, is a part of the&#xD;
      routine armamentarium for treatment of patients with Diabetes Mellitus type-2. Its safety is&#xD;
      well established in non-diabetic patients too where it has been shown to improve&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes. The risk of hypoglycemia is negligible as its action is independent&#xD;
      of insulin. By virtue of its natriuretic effect, it has been shown to reduce hospitalisations&#xD;
      in patients with heart failure irrespective of the presence of diabetes. We hypothesise that&#xD;
      a similar natriuretic effect may help in suppressing the renin-angiotensin axis with improved&#xD;
      mobilization of ascites in patients with cirrhosis. Pharmacokinetic data on the use of&#xD;
      Dapaglifozin suggest that there is no need for dose modification in cirrhosis. The AUC and&#xD;
      Cmax for Dapaglifozin in Child Pugh C cirrhosis is 67% and 40%, respectively. In a recent&#xD;
      small case series, SGLT-2 inhibitors including dapaglifozin led to improvement in fluid&#xD;
      retention and serum sodium, without acute kidney injury or encephalopathy, in patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis. However, SGLT-2 inhibitors have not been evaluated in randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials. In this pilot study, we plan to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dapaglifozin in&#xD;
      cirrhotics patients with recurrent ascites.&#xD;
