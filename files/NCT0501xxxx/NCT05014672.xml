    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-D itch scale is a validated multidimensional measure validated for use in patients with chronic pruritus. The measure comprises 5 domains: degree, duration, direction, disability, and distribution. The degree, duration, and direction domains each include 1 item measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores indicate more severe itching.</description>

It contains 11 short vertical ticks labeled 0 to 10, where 0=no itch and 10=maximum itch. Maximum itch is defined as a severe, intolerable itch that is continuous, day and night. Participants will be asked to write a number from 0 to 10 below the horizontal scale, with no decimal.</description>
