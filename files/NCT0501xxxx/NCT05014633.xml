      Abstract Background: Emergency Medicine Wards (EMWs) are among the most stressful wards of&#xD;
      hospitals. Emotional Intelligence (EI) seems to be one of the factors that can aid&#xD;
      individuals in overcoming environmental stresses. Therefore, the present study aimed at&#xD;
      evaluating the role of training in improving EI skills and addressing its indirect effect on&#xD;
      reducing job stress of emergency medical assistants in the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: In the present study, 20 emergency medical assistants were trained in&#xD;
      EI skills while 22 assistants received no training. Then, all participants' EI level and job&#xD;
      stress were assessed and compared before and after the intervention using the Bar-On&#xD;
      Emotional Quotient Inventory(EQ-i) and the Osipow job stress questionnaire, respectively.&#xD;

      Individuals in the control group did not receive any training while individuals in the&#xD;
      intervention group received the pertinent training. The duration of the training for the&#xD;
      intervention group was 16 hours (four four-hour sessions). The whole training process lasted&#xD;
      for one month. EI training sessions were held and managed by two experienced instructors&#xD;
      selected from medical education specialists with sufficient experience in conducting EI&#xD;
      training. Both instructors attended the sessions, presented the content, videos, slides, and&#xD;
      brochures with the help of each other, and managed related scenarios in each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that the instructors as well as the participants had no information about&#xD;
      the initial scores of EI and job stress recorded before the training intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the first session, the basic definitions and concepts of EI were&#xD;
      discussed, and the common environmental stressors were described from the perspective of&#xD;
      emergency medical assistants. Moreover, a succinct description of the benefits of EI training&#xD;
      and practice was provided. After the initial introduction, a number of EI skills were taught&#xD;
      in each session by presenting videos, slides, and brochures. Then, participants were engaged&#xD;
      in discussions by presenting scenarios related to EI skills in the concluding hours of each&#xD;
      session to offer more content load. These scenarios recounted the situation of an individual&#xD;
      facing a problem and encompassed a list of suggested reactions including the reasons behind&#xD;
      each reaction that an observer was supposed to indicate. Scenarios were generally implemented&#xD;
      in smaller groups in such a way that some scenarios were distributed and discussed among all&#xD;
      participants. The assistants were questioned about identifying the source of the concern, the&#xD;
      cause of the concern, potential environmental factors, and how a personal perspective affects&#xD;
      their response to the situation. Other scenarios were distributed among the smaller groups&#xD;
      and discussed by each groups' representative. Each group presented their analysis and&#xD;
      argumentation of the scenario, and then the relevant questions were answered by providing the&#xD;
      reasons. The sessions ended with the instructor summarizing different opinions on each of the&#xD;
      scenarios (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be mentioned that to prevent fatigue and obtain better efficiency, participants&#xD;
      (emergency medical assistants) were served twice during each session. Moreover, considering&#xD;
      the possibility of the interference of emergency medical assistants' work shifts, it was&#xD;
      planned in coordination with the Deputy Minister of Education that the emergency medical&#xD;
      assistants would not have any work shifts and would not even be on duty over the four days of&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes At the end of the last training session, two questionnaires of EQ-I and Osipow were&#xD;
      filled out by the participants of the intervention group. In addition, the participants of&#xD;
      the control group were contacted and asked to fill out these two questionnaires by visiting&#xD;
      them in person (on the last day of the training session related to the intervention group).&#xD;
      If the participant in the control group did not meet the conditions for the face-to-face&#xD;
      visit, the questions were read to them on the phone and their choice was recorded.&#xD;
