  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, non-interventional real-world study. In a real-world&#xD;
      environment, in line with the current status of the domestic diagnosis and treatment process,&#xD;
      and on the premise of not increasing the burden of patients and medical resources, we explore&#xD;
      the best indicators for predicting the outcome of patients with Clinical Research Coordinator&#xD;
      (CRC) after surgery. The inclusion criteria for patients are perioperative patients with CRC.&#xD;
      Real-world data analysis were conducted to determine whether immunization interventions&#xD;
      versus non-interventions were able to improve patients' clinical outcomes (OS, PFS).&#xD;
