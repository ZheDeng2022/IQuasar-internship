    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose of gilteritinib given together with ASTX727 and&#xD;
      venetoclax and the effect of ASTX727, venetoclax, and gilteritinib in treating patients with&#xD;
      FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia that is newly diagnosed, has come back (relapsed) or does&#xD;
      not respond to treatment (refractory) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. Chemotherapy&#xD;
      drugs, such as ASTX727, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;
      Venetoclax may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer&#xD;
      cell survival. Gilteritinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving ASTX727, venetoclax, and gilteritinib may help to&#xD;
      control the disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of decitabine and&#xD;
      cedazuridine (ASTX727), venetoclax and gilteritinib in patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      FLT3- mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).&#xD;
      (Phase I) II. To determine the complete response (CR)/incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi)&#xD;
      rate of the regimen in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory FLT3-mutated AML&#xD;
      or high-risk MDS. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess other efficacy endpoints (CR rate, minimal residual disease negativity by flow&#xD;
      cytometry, relapse-free survival, overall survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess proportion of patients proceeding to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      (HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the safety of the combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the impact of baseline genomic alterations on response and survival of the&#xD;
      combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the impact of baseline FLT3 allelic ratio on response and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate clonal evolution from diagnosis to relapse using single-cell sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate potential role of minimal residual disease (MRD) detection by sensitive&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/next generation sequencing (NGS) assays for FLT3 mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate leukemia stem cell populations over the course of treatment with the&#xD;
      combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the impact of baseline apoptotic protein levels as assessed by mass&#xD;
      cytometry (CyTOF) on response and resistance to the regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of gilteritinib followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION (CYCLE 1): Patients receive decitabine and cedazuridine orally (PO) once daily (QD)&#xD;
      on days 1-5, venetoclax PO QD on days 1-28, and gilteritinib PO QD on days 1-28 in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION (CYCLES 2-24): Patients receive decitabine and cedazuridine PO QD on days 1-5,&#xD;
      gilteritinib PO QD on days 1-28, and venetoclax PO QD on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 23 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE (CYCLES 24+): Patients receive gilteritinib PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 6 months&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
