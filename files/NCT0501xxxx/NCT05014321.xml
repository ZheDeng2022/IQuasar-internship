      CRYO (N° 21D588A0001) study aims to evaluate the tolerance and adjust the mode of&#xD;
      administration of a cyto-selective difluoroethane-based cryotherapy in the treatment of brown&#xD;
      spots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a proof of concept on a small panel of subjects and has been designed to be&#xD;
      interventional, monocentric, randomized and double blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include three device prototypes and a CE marked device (trademark URGO&#xD;
      CRYOBEAUTY MAINS-BRAS-JAMBES) used as reference.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Solar lentigo is a harmless patch of darkened skin. It results from exposure to ultraviolet&#xD;
      (UV) radiation, which causes local proliferation of melanocytes and accumulation of melanin&#xD;
      within the skin cells (keratinocytes). Solar lentigos or lentigines are very common,&#xD;
      especially in people over the age of 40 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRYONOVE PHARMA develops and manufactures cryotherapy-based devices to improve skin&#xD;
      appearance and treat lentigo spot. The mode of action of CRYONOVE devices consists to&#xD;
      &quot;provoke a selective cell death (melanocyte &amp; melanosome) by thermic shock induced by a rapid&#xD;
      decrease in skin temperature via the diffusion of difluoroethane gas to the skin&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proof of concept study, the sponsor aims to assess the tolerance and the&#xD;
      admininistration mode of cryogenic spray which could be used for lentigo treatment on the&#xD;
      face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is exploratory, interventional, monocentric, randomized and double blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three prototypes of devices for face are compared to a CE marking device (trademark URGO&#xD;
      CRYOBEAUTY MAINS-BRAS-JAMBES) used as reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve subjects with at least 4 spots on face are expected to be included, in order to&#xD;
      evaluate a minimum of 48 brown spots. Volunteers are treated at T0 only with the reference&#xD;
      device and at T0, T2, T4, T6 weeks with the prototype devices. The patient follow-up include&#xD;
      10 visits from D0 to D56.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Each spot will be treated by a defined prototype / device (always the same prototype / device on the same spot all along the study - one unique prototype/device per spot). The application order of the different device prototypes (810A-v1), (810B-v1), (810C-v1) will be defined by randomization except for CNV Body that will always be applied last.&#xD;
Each prototype will be identified by a 3 characters internal code (00-x) corresponding to the treated spot with &quot;00&quot; corresponding to the subject number from 01 to 12 and &quot;x&quot; corresponding to the selected spot from A to D.</masking_description>

    <measure>TOLERABILITY : Post-treatment pain assessement</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Time1 defined as 15 minutes post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The pain of the treatment will be assessed by the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale). Pain intensity is measured in millimeters by the distance from the position of the mark to the &quot;no pain&quot; extremity.&#xD;
Based on the distribution of pain VAS scores in postoperative patients, the following bounds were recommended for the assessment of this scale: no pain (0-4mm), mild pain (5-44mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm) and severe pain (75- 100 mm).&#xD;
The expected outcomes are pain score &lt; 44 mm (mild pain) for CNV Body and score &lt; 4 mm (no pain) for each prototype.</description>

    <measure>TOLERABILITY : Appearance of edemas, blisters, bubbles or scars.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical evaluation of treated lentigo spot will be performed by a Dermatologist by scoring with standardized position and lighting.&#xD;
The evaluation will be performed visualy on the selected lentigo spots and surrounded spotless skin area around the spot skin.&#xD;
A scale in 5 points (0 to 4) will be used : 0=none; 1=very mild; 2=mild; 3=moderate; 4=severe.&#xD;
The expected score is &lt; 1.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PERFORMANCE : Skin color evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical evaluation of each treated lentigo spot and spotless area (one on face and far from a lentigo spot) will be performed in blinded conditions by a trained assessor by scoring using L'OREAL ColorChart* in standardized position and lighting.&#xD;
The score delta between Day 56 post treatment and D0 pre-treatment will be calculated.&#xD;
The expected results is a score delta (D56-D0) &lt; -1 for lighteness of lentigo spot.&#xD;
