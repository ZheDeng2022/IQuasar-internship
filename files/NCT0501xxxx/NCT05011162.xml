  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the clinical impact of a digital therapy for the&#xD;
      management of fibromyalgia. Study participants receive 12 weeks of Digital Acceptance and&#xD;
      Commitment Therapy (ACT) in addition to their standard care for fibromyalgia. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at week 12. This is a virtual,&#xD;
      single-arm, pragmatic, non-significant risk study.&#xD;
