  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is investigating an intravenous (IV) medication called 9-ING-41 in combination&#xD;
      with chemotherapy (carboplatin) for the treatment of advanced salivary gland cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drug(s) involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  9-ING-41 (a GSK-3β inhibitor)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carboplatin chemotherapy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, open-label, non-randomized, single institution study investigating the&#xD;
      novel glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) inhibitor 9-ING-41 in combination with&#xD;
      carboplatin chemotherapy in patients with incurable, recurrent or metastatic salivary gland&#xD;
      carcinomas (SGC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved 9-ING-41 as a treatment for any&#xD;
      disease. Carboplatin is used as a treatment for salivary gland cancers, and is approved by&#xD;
      the FDA for many cancer types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9-ING-41 has been identified in other studies as a therapy to block the over-expression of&#xD;
      the glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) protein, which is thought to be important in&#xD;
      signaling cancer growth and to have immune properties. It is believed that GSK-3β is&#xD;
      over-expressed in salivary gland cancers and by blocking the action of GSK-3β protein with&#xD;
      9-ING-41 it could slow salivary cancer cell growth that have developed resistance to prior&#xD;
      chemotherapy exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow-up visits roughly every 3-weeks while on therapy, for up to one year&#xD;
      as long as disease does not get worse and the drug therapy remains safe and tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 33 people treated will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actuate Therapeutics is supporting this research study by providing the study drug (9-ING-41)&#xD;
      and funding some of the logistics of the trial that are beyond what would be considered&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy&#xD;
        test within 14 days of study registration. Female subjects of childbearing potential should&#xD;
        have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test repeated within 72 hours prior to receiving&#xD;
        the first dose of study medication. WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for&#xD;
        a period of 90 days after the last dose of investigational product. &quot;Women of childbearing&#xD;
        potential (WOCBP)&quot; is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not&#xD;
        undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not&#xD;
        postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over&#xD;
        45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the&#xD;
        age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level greater&#xD;

             a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP will&#xD;
             be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 90 days after the last dose&#xD;
             of investigational product. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are&#xD;
             postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) do not require&#xD;
             contraception. See Appendix B for further guidance on contraception.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Metastatic disease impinging on the spinal cord or threatening spinal cord&#xD;
             compression. Patients that have had previous treatment of disease with impinging on&#xD;

             at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment), and have no evidence&#xD;
             of new or enlarging brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent administration of other cancer specific therapy or investigational agents&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;
             Exceptions include: basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer, and&#xD;
             low-risk prostate adenocarcinoma being managed with active surveillance. A history of&#xD;
             another separate malignancy in remission without evidence of active disease in the&#xD;
             last 2 ears is permitted.&#xD;
