    <textblock>
      This feasibility study is a prospective, single arm, single center study with a run-in phase,&#xD;
      followed by a 48-hour supervised phase, followed by a 4-week at home study with sequential&#xD;
      interventions (new feature use). Approximately 30 subjects, both male and female, aged 14 and&#xD;
      up, will participate in the study, using new features each week with the t:slim X2 insulin&#xD;
      pump with Control-IQ technology.&#xD;
