      Evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention including the clinical assessment carried out&#xD;
      with the (Multidimensional Inventory of Development, Sex, and Aggression) MIDSA and the&#xD;
      review of the results with the professional in charge of the subject on the adherence and&#xD;
      commitment to the care of the sexual offenders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention of MIDSA (Multidimensional Inventory of Development, Sex, and Aggression), a&#xD;
      multidimensional investigation tool for issues related to sexuality and violence, could be&#xD;
      prove very useful by providing AICS patients as well as the professionals who take care of&#xD;
      them with a complete clinical assessment which enlightens the patient on his&#xD;
      psychopathological functioning and / or his disorders, and which guides the care through the&#xD;
      axes of intervention to be implemented in response to the criminological and&#xD;
      non-criminological needs of the patient. This should allow the latter a better awareness&#xD;
      (awareness) of his difficulties in the relationship with the other, facilitate his adherence&#xD;
      to care, obtain a better commitment on his part in the process of change and consequently,&#xD;
      bring him change their lifestyle and gradually adopt proactive attitudes and behavior that&#xD;
      ultimately reduce the risk of recidivism of sexual and general violence. However, recourse to&#xD;
      MIDSA as a &quot;change operator&quot; in a patient's trajectory is only possible if it is accompanied&#xD;
      by a resumption of his clinical assessment by a professional who supports the change process&#xD;
      by strengthening his motivation to change their criminal behavior.&#xD;
