  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VYF03 is a phase II, randomized, parallel-group prevention study with 2 arms,&#xD;
      active-controlled (Stamaril), observer-blind, multi-center study to assess the&#xD;
      non-inferiority of the immune response, in terms of seroconversion rates of the&#xD;
      investigational vaccine candidate vYF to the licensed Stamaril, in adults aged 18 years up to&#xD;
      60 years in Europe (EU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and immunogenicity profile of vYF in a cohort of Asian population of Chinese&#xD;
      origin outside of China will also be described. The study will also assess the immunogenicity&#xD;
      profiles and the safety profiles of vYF and Stamaril.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single subcutaneous injection of&#xD;
      either the vYF vaccine (380 participants in EU and 80 participants of Chinese origin in Asia)&#xD;
      or Stamaril (190 participants in EU and 40 participants of Chinese origin in Asia), on Day&#xD;
      01.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of each participant's participation will be approximately 5 years.&#xD;
