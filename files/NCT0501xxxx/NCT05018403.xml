  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic parameters after single ascending intravenous doses of AON-D21 in healthy&#xD;
      male subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will potentially include 5 sequential cohorts with 8 subjects per cohort, then 40&#xD;
      enrolled subjects in total. Within each dose group 6 subjects will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      AON-D21 and 2 subjects will be randomly assigned to placebo.&#xD;
