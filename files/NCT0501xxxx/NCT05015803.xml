  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial on 65+ aged and independent-living healthy individuals with&#xD;
      symptoms of insomnia will attempt to improve sleep and health outcomes related to sleep with&#xD;
      enhancement of the standard clinical intervention, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia&#xD;
      (CBTi).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telehealth-delivered enhanced CBTi (integrated with a sleep diary app, a therapist dashboard,&#xD;
      and data from IoT devices) will be compared to standard telehealth CBTi and to a passive&#xD;
      control (sleep hygiene education). The investigators will determine effects on insomnia&#xD;
      (primary outcome) and on clinical sleep metrics (secondary outcome), among other outcomes&#xD;
      including cognitive performance, blood biomarkers of ADRD, and therapeutic adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initial consent, screening qualification, informed consent, and adherence evaluation&#xD;
      with ambulatory devices (1wk), study participants are pseudo-randomized into one of 3 study&#xD;
      arms (2:2:1, Enhanced CBTi : Standard CBTi : Sleep Hygiene). The living space of participants&#xD;
      is equipped with IoT data collection and therapy-facilitating devices. Participants take&#xD;
      surveys related to sleep, have blood drawn, wear ambulatory devices, complete cognitive&#xD;
      evaluations, and interact with nearable living space devices and an iPhone interface during a&#xD;
      pre-study week leading up to an intake telehealth appointment. Participants then adhere to&#xD;
      behavioral therapy directives prescribed at weekly telehealth sessions with a clinically&#xD;
      qualified therapist, take surveys related to sleep, complete cognitive evaluations, wear&#xD;
      ambulatory devices, and interact with nearable living space devices and an iPhone interface&#xD;
      throughout the study intervention period of 6 weeks. During the final week (coinciding with&#xD;
      the 6th intervention week), participants have a second blood draw and return all study&#xD;
      equipment/devices at the conclusion of participation.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly (each of study weeks 1-8)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective patient completion of the Insomnia Severity Index survey. Sum of survey item responses; Minimum score: 0; Maximum score: 28. Higher sum score indicates a greater number of, or more severe, insomnia symptoms; reduction in sum score suggests improvement of insomnia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sleep Maintenance Efficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>Nightly (each night throughout study weeks 1-8)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective ambulatory activity (actigraphy) and other biometric data will be collectively used to determine sleep state. From sleep state data, Sleep Maintenance Efficiency will be calculated (i.e. percentage of time between sleep onset and awakening for the main sleep period that is spent in the sleep state). Minimum score: 0% (i.e. no sleep); Maximum score: 100% (i.e. no awake time during the sleep window). Higher percentage score indicates that a greater proportion of the rest interval was spent actually asleep; increase in percentage score suggests improvement in sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Total Sleep Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Nightly (each night throughout study weeks 1-8)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective ambulatory activity (actigraphy) and other biometric data will be collectively used to determine sleep state. From sleep state data, Total Sleep Time will be calculated (i.e. total minutes of nocturnal sleep). An increase in sleep time indicates improvement in sleep quantity.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this study arm will experience an attempted enhancement of standard video conferencing CBTi, that is facilitated with electronic device-based intervention (IoT) and data resources to the clinician. Noninvasive ambulatory worn and nearable devices deliver real-time feedback of objective data to the clinician on an application interface. Subjective data collected using the application are available live to both the clinician and patient. This information will be used to inform the therapeutic approach. Environmental cues and notifications are programmed into IoT devices to remind patients of their behavioral prescription, to permit live clinician updates and clinician-patient communication, and to create a living-space environment that is conducive to effective therapy.</description>
