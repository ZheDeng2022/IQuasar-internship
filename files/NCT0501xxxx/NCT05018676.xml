  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single arm, phase 2 study of ARX788 in unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer with&#xD;
      low expression of HER2. Subjects should received ≥2 lines of systemic chemotherapy regimens&#xD;
      for recurrent or metastatic disease, and for HR positive subjects, also need to have received&#xD;
      ≥2-line endocrine therapy ± targeted therapy (including neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy). HER2&#xD;
      low expression is defined as HER2 IHC 1+ or HER2 IHC 2+ and FISH negative. The ARX788 will be&#xD;
      administered every 3 weeks (Q3W) intravenous (IV) infusion.&#xD;
