  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary supplementation is widely used to alleviate various symptoms of PMS and menstruation&#xD;
      such as bloating and cramping. Providing a combination of synergistic dietary supplements is&#xD;
      hypothesized to significantly reduce self-reported PMS and menstrual discomfort when compared&#xD;
      with a baseline without the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label observational trial to study the effectiveness of a commercial dietary&#xD;
      supplement and its effect on common symptoms of normal menstrual discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the dietary supplement marketed as Semaine PMS &amp; Period Support will&#xD;
      improve subjective wellbeing and biomarkers in trial participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 58 participants will be recruited for the trial following screening, with the&#xD;
      expectation that at least 51 will complete the trial. The trial will be fully remote, and all&#xD;
      participants will undergo a menstrual cycle without intervention to establish a baseline, and&#xD;
      then will be given the intervention (dietary supplement) for a second menstrual cycle. For&#xD;
      both menstrual cycles the participants will complete a subjective wellbeing survey and&#xD;
      provide a blood sample for biomarker analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biomarker analysis will be performed through an at-home fingerprick blood test. To&#xD;
      maximize consistency, the tests should be performed on the same days of each cycle -&#xD;
      preferably on days 4 or 5. If absolutely necessary, however one day of buffer on either side&#xD;
      will be allowed.&#xD;

    <description>Perceived discomfort caused by several of the most common menstrual symptoms Cramping Bloating Gastrointestinal issues (diarrhea or constipation) Feeling tired Feeling down emotionally Feeling anxious Headache&#xD;
Each endpoint will be reported by the participant on a scale of perceived discomfort at the end of each menstrual cycle. Participants will complete the surveys for each menstrual cycle. The study uses a questionnaire including a scale from 0-7 to assess the severity of symptoms(0=no symptoms and 7=very severe symptoms).&#xD;
To ensure consistency between participants, each survey will be completed on days 7 or 8 after they stop hormonal contraception usage (or begin placebo pills).</description>
