  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome, representing the final evolution of many&#xD;
      cardiac diseases that may differ for etiology and pathophysiology. In pediatric population,&#xD;
      it is particularly challenging to manage because of the heterogeneity in age, primary cardiac&#xD;
      disease, and the broad range of clinical signs and symptoms. Frequent hospitalizations are&#xD;
      current problem. Hospitalization within the first year since the first episode, lack of&#xD;
      adherence to medical therapy and diet difficulties are the main issues in this population of&#xD;
      patients, and they rebounds on prognosis and public health costs. Actions aimed to prevent&#xD;
      and manage these matters will improve outcome in patients with chronic heart failure.&#xD;
      Telemedicine proved its usefulness in adult population, but, nowadays, no studies have been&#xD;
      conducted in children. From the beginning of 21th century, remote monitoring attempts have&#xD;
      been adopted, initially by phone calls. Currently, the e-care monitoring fits in the context&#xD;
      of telemedicine 2.0 based on new communication models. The aim of this study is to affirm the&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy of a new model of tele monitoring in pediatric population. High-risk&#xD;
      patients need a strict clinical control normally difficult to adopt. A telematics system&#xD;
      capable to detect vital parameters as heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, breathe frequency, weight, arrhythmias and cardiac index may offers to physician&#xD;
      valuable information able to strictly monitoring the clinical status of patients. All of&#xD;
      these data permits to physician to early detect critical signals of a deteriorated status,&#xD;
      modify adherence to care and implement therapeutic strategies in order to prevent frequent&#xD;
      hospitalizations. Our project provides a system of continuous tele-monitoring of vital&#xD;
      parameters through a patch applied on the chest of the baby. Data are sent to a service&#xD;
      center, &quot;virtual clinic&quot; and daily analyzed in multiparametric system by a specialized nurse.&#xD;
      On the basis of pre-established alarms, the virtual clinic will notify to physician.&#xD;
      Feasibility and tolerability of this new monitoring system will be evaluated after a 3 months&#xD;
      period on a cohort of 20 patients affected by chronic, high-risk, heart failure.&#xD;
