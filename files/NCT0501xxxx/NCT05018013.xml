  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Montgomery Asperger Depression Scale (MADRS) score at the end of treatment (week 6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale to assess depressive symptomatology during the preceding week. Participants are rated on 10 items (feelings of sadness, lassitude, pessimism, inner tension, suicidality, reduced sleep or appetite, difficulty concentrating, and lack of interest) each on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (symptoms of maximum severity). The total score ranges from 0 to 60 with a higher score indicating more depression. A negative change score indicates improvement.&#xD;
Change = (Week 6 post-dose score - baseline week 0 score). at the end of treatment (week 6)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) at week 1, 2, 4, 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 1, 2, 4 and 6</time_frame>
    <description>The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale that assesses depressive symptoms. The HAMD-17 consists of 17 symptoms, each of which is rated from 0 to 2 or 0 to 4, where 0 is none/absent. The HAMD-17 total score is calculated as the sum of the 17 individual symptom scores; the total score can range from 0 to 52. Higher HAMD-17 scores indicate more severe depression.&#xD;
Change = (Week 1, 2, 4 and 6 post-dose score - baseline week 0 score).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Hamilton Anxiety Inventory (HAMA) scores at week 1, 2, 4, 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 1, 2, 4 and 6</time_frame>
    <description>The HAMA is used as a rating measure of anxiety severity. The scale consists of 14 items. Each item is rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The HAMA total score is the sum of the 14 items and the score ranges from 0 to 56, 0 is considered the best outcome.&#xD;
Change = (Week 1, 2, 4 and 6 post-dose score - baseline week 0 score).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in CGI-S score at week 1, 2, 4, 6,7</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment. The CGI-S will provide an overall clinician-determined summary measure that takes into account all available information including knowledge of the participant's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the participant's ability to function.&#xD;
Change = (Week 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 post-dose score - baseline week 0 score).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The percentage of subjects with a MARDS score reduction â‰¥ 25%</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>The score reduction rate is defined as (screening period MARDS scale score - post-dose MARDS scale score)/screening period MARDS scale score x 100%.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study period,an average of 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The AEs will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE v5.0.</description>
