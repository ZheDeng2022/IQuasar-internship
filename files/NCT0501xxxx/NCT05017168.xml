  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CT-P63 is a monoclonal antibody targeted against SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD as a treatment for SARS&#xD;
      CoV 2 infection. CT-P63 is currently being developed by the Sponsor as a potential treatment&#xD;
      for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of CT-P63&#xD;
      will be evaluated in healthy subjects.&#xD;

             examination, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body&#xD;
             temperature measurements, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory&#xD;
             tests prior to the study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject with a body weight of ≥ 50 kg and a body mass index between 18.0 and 29.9&#xD;

                  SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, subject who received any investigational or approved&#xD;
                  SARS-CoV-2 vaccine cannot be enrolled, regardless of the timing of administration&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Treatment with any monoclonal antibody, fusion protein, or blood transfusion&#xD;
                  within 6 months or 5 half lives (which is longer) prior to the study drug&#xD;
                  administration or current use of biologics&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Prescription medication (excluding hormonal birth control), over-the-counter&#xD;
                  drug, dietary supplements or herbal remedies within 7 days or 5 half-lives&#xD;
                  (whichever is longer) prior to the study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Treatment with any other investigational drug within 6 months or 5 half lives&#xD;
                  (which is longer) prior to the study drug administration&#xD;
