  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single blind (outcomes assessor), randomized, 2 cell, full face study to evaluate&#xD;
      changes in mild malar melasma through use of a cosmetic facial serum formulation or marketed&#xD;
      2% hydroquinone. This study will accept up to fifty participants per cell (100 participants&#xD;
      overall) who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria to ensure that at least forty participants&#xD;
      per cell complete the study. Participants will be randomized to receive either the cosmetic&#xD;
      product or the hydroquinone product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study schedule will be different depending which product the subject is allocated to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If accepted onto the study, all participants will be provided with a marketed face wash and&#xD;
      moisturiser to use for one week before the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit, following collection of baseline measures subjects will be allocated&#xD;
      to either the cosmetic product or 2% hydroquinone. Products will be applied only to lesional&#xD;
      areas on the face twice daily. Participants will also be provided with a sunscreen for use&#xD;
      throughout the test phase of the study. They will continue to use the face wash and&#xD;
      moisturiser with which they have previously been provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants allocated to the cosmetic product will be asked to return to the study centre&#xD;
      for assessments at weeks 4, 8, 12 and regression (8 weeks after stopping product&#xD;
      application).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants allocated to 2% hydroquinone will be asked to return to the study centre 3 days,&#xD;
      1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after baseline and regression 8 weeks after stopping product&#xD;
      application).&#xD;

    <time_frame>0 - 12 weeks + regression (8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Melasma severity on four facial areas (forehead, right malar region, left malar region and chin) is assessed based on three variables: percentage of the total area involved (A), darkness (D), and homogeneity (H).&#xD;
Area (A): a numerical value is assigned to % area involved as follows. 0=no involvement; 1=&lt;10% ; 2=10-29%; 3=30-49%; 4=50-69%; 5=70-89%; and 6=90-100%.&#xD;
Darkness of melasma (D) is graded on a scale of 0 to 4: 0=normal skin color without evidence of hyperpigmentation; 1=barely visible hyperpigmentation; 2=mild hyperpigmentation; 3=moderate hyperpigmentation; 4=severe hyperpigmentation.&#xD;
Homogeneity of hyperpigmentation (H) is graded on a scale of 0 to 4 as follows: 0=normal skin color without evidence of hyperpigmentation; 1=specks; 2=small patchy areas &lt;1.5 cm diameter; 3= &gt;2 cm diameter; 4=uniform skin involvement without any clear areas.&#xD;
The sum of D and H is multiplied by A and by the percentages of the four facial areas (10-30%).&#xD;
Total score is 0-48.</description>
