  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious social and public health issue. In the U.S.,&#xD;
      more than 1 in 3 women experience physical or sexual violence, and/or stalking by an intimate&#xD;
      partner during their lifetime. IPV has significant physical and mental health consequences&#xD;
      such as injury, chronic pain, and depression. Chinese immigrants have been overlooked and&#xD;
      underserved and represent an especially vulnerable group of IPV victims, as they are less&#xD;
      likely to seek help through IPV service agencies, women's shelters, hospitals, or law&#xD;
      enforcement. Effective IPV intervention programs that are culturally appropriate, accessible,&#xD;
      and acceptable are essential to this underserved population. However, no studies have been&#xD;
      conducted with abused Chinese immigrant women to help them deal with IPV and reduce mental&#xD;
      health consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the study adapted a structured IPV intervention from the Domestic Violence&#xD;
      Enhanced Home Visitation Program (DOVE) as well as incorporate self-compassion and relaxation&#xD;
      techniques for Chinese immigrant women experiencing IPV. The intervention is called&#xD;
      Self-Compassion, Health, and Empowerment (SHE). The study will test the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the SHE to reduce IPV and improve mental health well-being for abused&#xD;
      Chinese immigrant women residing in the US.&#xD;

    <description>The SHE intervention includes 8 weekly sessions and 24-hour access to the intervener for any additional support needed. The first and last sessions will be delivered over the phone with the woman based on a brochure. The brochure describes the four major components: a) IPV information, b) Danger Assessment, c) Safety Planning, and d) Resources. It will be discussed with the woman in an interactive manner so that the woman is encouraged to describe her experiences and choose her options as they proceed. Session 2-7 focus on providing mental health self-care resources, which are deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, general introduction and overview of self-compassion, mindfulness, and loving-kindness.</description>
