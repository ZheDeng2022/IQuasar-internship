  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to compare the incidence of retrograde ejaculation at 6&#xD;
      months in patients undergoing Holep surgery for prostatic adenoma according to two randomized&#xD;
      surgical techniques: conventional surgical procedure of removal of the 3 prostatic lobes&#xD;
      versus preservation of the median lobe.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A prospective randomised multicentre single-blind comparative study of two parallel groups of patients scheduled for HoLEP prostate resection:&#xD;
Group 1 Conventional HoLEP prostate resection procedure with enucleation of all three lobes (3-lobe, 2-lobe or monobloc technique).&#xD;
Group 2 Enucleation of the lateral lobes and preservation of the medial tissue between the bladder neck and Veru montanum Each patient will be evaluated five times during the study (D0, M1, M3, M6, M12) The total duration of the study is 2 years (1 year of recruitment and 1 year of follow-up).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Men Sexual Health Questionnaire (MSHQ) assesses a patient's ability to have sex. It consists of 25 questions that explore the ability to have erections, the quality of ejaculations and the satisfaction felt during intercourse and sexual desire.&#xD;
The total score (16 to 125 points maximum) is broken down into 6 sub-scores that explore erection (0 to 15 points), discomfort with erection problems (1 to 5 points), ejaculation (1 to 35 points), discomfort with ejaculation problems (1 to 5 points), satisfaction (6 to 30 points), sexual activity and desire (7 to 35 points)</description>
