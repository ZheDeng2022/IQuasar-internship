  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in patient selection, organ procurement and preservation, surgical technique,&#xD;
      immunosuppression, and infection prevention have conferred significant decrease in rejection,&#xD;
      infection, and subsequently improve cause-specific graft failure rates after kidney&#xD;
      transplantation (KT). However, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remained the main burden&#xD;
      impairing both short-and long-term survival. Compared with the general population,&#xD;
      conventional CVD risk factors, including obesity, liver and muscle insulin resistance,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, are all highly prevalent in this&#xD;
      population. Risk factors of these metabolic disorders are generally reported, including&#xD;
      common risk factors and those specifically for kidney transplants, including long-term&#xD;
      exposure to steroids and calcineurin inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies demonstrated that adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase&#xD;
      (AMPK) is a central regulator of multiple metabolic pathways and a key player in regulating&#xD;
      cellular energy metabolism. Activation of AMPK by pharmacological agents may hold a&#xD;
      considerable potential to reverse the metabolic abnormalities in chronic metabolic diseases.&#xD;
      Metformin, a widely used antidiabetic drug, have been reported to act as an AMPK activator by&#xD;
      inhibiting complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in many tissues, including&#xD;
      adipose, skeletal muscle, and heart. A recent small clinical trial observed that metformin&#xD;
      administration did improve some of the metabolic profiles for glucocorticoid-treated patients&#xD;
      with inflammatory disease but without pre-existing diabetes. In addition, another&#xD;
      antidiabetic drug sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors can improve metabolic&#xD;
      parameters and cardiovascular risk in patients with or without diabetes in preclinical and&#xD;
      clinical studies. A small clinical trial reported that compared to metformin, significant&#xD;
      improvement in anthropometric parameters and body composition, in overweight and obese women&#xD;
      with polycystic ovary syndrome after 12 weeks of treatment with empagliflozin. Hence,&#xD;
      metformin and SGLT2 agents may be used as potential adjuvant therapies to improve metabolic&#xD;
      disorders after KT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, both metformin and SGLT-2 inhibitors were not recommended in patients with impaired&#xD;
      kidney function considering their elimination and action mechanism. Although several&#xD;
      preliminary clinical trials showed that metformin and SGLT-2 inhibitors can be used safely&#xD;
      and improve glucose control after KT, but they are small-sample sized and only include&#xD;
      patients with diabetes. We will conduct a prospective clinical trial with the first aim of&#xD;
      exploring the safety of metformin and SGLT-2 inhibitors in kidney transplant recipients with&#xD;
      or without diabetes, and the second aim of exploring their roles in improving metabolic&#xD;
      profiling.&#xD;

    <description>Based on previous study, visceral-to-subcutaneous fat area ratio, evaluated by CT, was generally reported as a surrogate for metabolic risk and was markedly raised in patients with long-term exposure to steroids. Hence, the primary outcome was the differences in the visceral-to-subcutaneous fat area ratio over 12 months among three groups.</description>
