  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The best treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is facilitated by early detection, when&#xD;
      the progression of the disease can be slowed down or stopped. Early treatment focuses on&#xD;
      diet, exercise, lifestyle changes, treating risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, etc.) and&#xD;
      administration of medications supporting kidney functions. However, once the glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate dropped below 15 ml/min/1.73m2, treatment with dialysis or a kidney&#xD;
      transplant is required. Dialysis treatments come with a huge lifestyle management and&#xD;
      economic burden to the patients as well as the healthcare systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenges may be facilitated by usage of mobile applications that help the&#xD;
      patients/caregivers and multidisciplinary team to manage the complexity of Peritoneal&#xD;
      Dialysis (PD) treatment. Even though several mobile applications currently exist, they focus&#xD;
      on certain limited aspects of health monitoring like diet or vitals and medical adherence&#xD;
      like medication reminders. An application which would take a comprehensive all-in-one&#xD;
      solution approach targeted towards managing kidney health is needed. The platform developed&#xD;
      by AWAK Technologies consists of a Admin Portal, web-based Clinic Portal and a Patient Mobile&#xD;
      Application. The App would allow patients/caregivers to enter treatment data related to their&#xD;
      dialysis therapy, medication, symptoms and vital monitoring. It also allows them to&#xD;
      communicate with their healthcare team via messaging and teleconsult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to evaluate the feasibility of using this mHealth platform in the clinical&#xD;
      setting. Additionally, the clinical investigation seeks to obtain data for further&#xD;
      development of the mHealth platform that will better fulfil the needs of patients and&#xD;
      healthcare professionals.&#xD;
