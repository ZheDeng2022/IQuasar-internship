    <textblock>
      At the completion of primary follow-up of various Medeor Transplant studies (called parent&#xD;
      studies), subjects receiving Medeor's cellular immunotherapy products will be followed&#xD;
      annually for up to an additional 84 months (7 years), in order to evaluate for long-term&#xD;
      safety.&#xD;

      Study MDR-105-SAE is intended to be the long-term safety monitoring extension of Medeor's&#xD;
      cellular immunotherapy, kidney transplant clinical studies. This Master Protocol has been&#xD;
      created in order to establish a single database for all long-term safety data for those&#xD;
      subjects that have received Medeor's cellular products. This Master Protocol will provide up&#xD;
      to 84 months (7 years) of additional follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term safety of subjects treated with Medeor's cellular immunotherapy has not been&#xD;
      assessed. This study will collect the data into a centralized database allowing for&#xD;
      continuous monitoring of any important safety signals.&#xD;
