      This randomized evaluation used behaviorally-informed letters to increase health insurance&#xD;
      take-up on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplaces.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During Open Enrollment Periods for the ACA Marketplaces, qualifying individuals can purchase&#xD;
      health insurance plans through the Federal Health Insurance Marketplace (FHIM). As of early&#xD;
      February 2015, many people had visited HealthCare.gov and started an online account, but not&#xD;
      yet selected a plan. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in collaboration with&#xD;
      the Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES), developed and sent letters to assist these&#xD;
      individuals with completing their enrollment before the deadline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of the letters, the team used a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
