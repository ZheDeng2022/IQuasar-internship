  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic is causing unprecedented morbidity and mortality.The safe and effective&#xD;
      Novel coronavirus vaccine is an effective means to block the transmission of the virus by&#xD;
      building up the immune barrier of the population.Clinical studies have shown that elderly&#xD;
      people are at high risk of severe COVID-19 infection and have poor clinical&#xD;
      prognosis.Considering the current situation of aging population in China, the elderly people&#xD;
      should be given priority to vaccinate to obtain protection and reduce the risk of novel&#xD;
      coronavirus infection.However, the current data on vaccines are mostly from young and&#xD;
      middle-aged healthy people, while there is little research data on COVID-19 vaccination in&#xD;
      the elderly.This study mainly studied the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in the&#xD;
      elderly population and explored its potential immune mechanism.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, multicenter, controlled , open-label and phase I clinical trial.&#xD;
      Older adults in the study included healthy people between the ages of 60 and 80 group. Those&#xD;
      who is in line with the inclusion criteria and who is not in conformity with the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine at 0 days (baseline) and 21 days,&#xD;
      respectively, and were followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after completion of&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
