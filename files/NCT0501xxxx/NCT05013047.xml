  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which began spreading on January 24, 2020 in France, has required&#xD;
      a profound and rapid reorganization of the health system, based in particular on internal&#xD;
      hospital reorganizations of front-line establishments, deprogramming of non-urgent&#xD;
      activities, and transfers of non-covid19 patients to 2nd line facilities. Beyond the&#xD;
      immediate impact on the management of patients infected with COVID-19, this reorganization&#xD;
      may have reduced the capacity of management for patients requiring urgent or semi-urgent&#xD;
      intervention, or may have postponed some necessary care. The isolation of patients at home&#xD;
      may also have resulted in lower compliance to therapy and medical treatments and may have&#xD;
      contributed to decompensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of this crisis, the different organizational responses in France should be&#xD;
      evaluated to identify the consequences and the areas for improvement in order to be prepared&#xD;
      for future exceptional health situations. This investigation on healthcare systems confronted&#xD;
      to an exceptional health situation thus seeks to determine if the profound reorganizations&#xD;
      implemented during this health crisis have indirect effects on the performance of care, in&#xD;
      particular if there is a destabilization of the care systems (emergency, semi-emergency and&#xD;
      chronic), a loss of chance for the patients and if innovative care paths have emerged.&#xD;
