  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In routine practice, pressure is often attempted to be adjusted by palpation of the cuff&#xD;
      pilot balloon of the endotracheal tube. The aim of our study is to investigate the variation&#xD;
      of the reliability of the palpation method, which is widely used in cuff pressure measurement&#xD;
      in the absence of a manometer, with clinical experience. Our recommendation is to use an&#xD;
      accessible manometer if available.&#xD;

      After the patients were premedicated with an appropriate dose of midazolam, anesthesia was&#xD;
      induced with propofol, fentanyl and rocuronium. Endotracheal intubation was performed after&#xD;
      ensuring appropriate anaesthesia depth for intubation, by relaxation of the jaw and loss of&#xD;
      eyelash reflex. We used 7.5 and 8.0 sizes of sterile ETTs are made of polyvinyl chloride and&#xD;
      have a high-volume low-pressure cuffed design that conforms to the shape of the trachea. ETTs&#xD;
      for female and male patients and before intubation Tracheal tubes (Tyco Healthcare©, Wollerau&#xD;
      Switzerland) cuffs were tested for leakage. The researchers were divided into two groups of&#xD;
      20, with anaesthesia residents (anesthesia experience between 1 months and 1 year, Group J)&#xD;
      and those with more than 4 years (Group S). The ETT was placed using the conventional&#xD;
      intubation technique with a Macintosh laryngoscope after ensuring appropriate anaesthesia&#xD;
      depth for intubation, by relaxation of the jaw and loss of eyelash reflex.. It was asked to&#xD;
      swell with air up to cmH2O and a 10 ml injector was used for this. Then Direct pressure&#xD;
      measurement was achieved by a cuff manometer calibrated in cmH2O, which was attached to the&#xD;
      ETT pilot balloon. The participant was not informed about the actual pressure of cuff. Then&#xD;
      the air in the cuff was completely evacuated and the same procedure was repeated with the&#xD;
      participant from the other group, the agreement of the two groups to the target value of 25&#xD;
      cmH2O was compared. The order of priority among the groups was randomized according to the&#xD;
      closed-envelope method. Controlled positive pressure ventilation was started after the&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases in which the cuff pressure was above 30 cmH2O or below 20 cmH2O, the pressure was&#xD;
      regulated back to normal limits. During the study, patients were in a supine, head and neck&#xD;
      neutral position. Anesthesia was maintained as in our routine clinical practice.&#xD;

    <description>After intubation, first the assistant doctor with 0-1 year training period and then the assistant doctor with 4-5 years training period will be asked to inflate the cuff to approximately 25 cm H2O cuff pressure by palpation, and the pressure will be measured with a manometer and recorded.</description>
