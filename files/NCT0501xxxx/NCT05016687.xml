  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate CUR-N399, a PI4KB inhibitor, in a first-in-human&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics profile of single and&#xD;
      multiple ascending doses in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SAD part of the trial, single oral doses of CUR-N399 will be administered in 5&#xD;
      sequential cohorts. In all cohorts, safety and PK will be assessed before and after dose.&#xD;
      Exploratory nasopharyngeal swab for assessment of airway infectants will be performed before&#xD;
      dose and in the morning of Day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In SAD part Cohort 4: A urine sample will be taken from the first morning void on Day 1 and&#xD;
      urine will be collected for potential quantification of CUR-N399 (and metabolites) during the&#xD;
      first 24 hours post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MAD part of the trial will explore multiple ascending dosing of CUR-N399. The initial&#xD;
      dose, dose escalation and dosing schedule will be based on emerging knowledge of safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and PK of CUR-N399 observed in the SAD part of the trial. CUR-N399 will be&#xD;
      administered in 3 sequential cohorts. An additional MAD cohort will evaluate CUR-N399 in&#xD;
      older adults ≥65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All SAD and MAD cohorts will evaluate 8 subjects. Within each cohort, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive CUR-N399 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) in a blinded fashion.&#xD;
