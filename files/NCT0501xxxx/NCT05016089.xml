    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the efficacy of the simplified Pilates exercise programme&#xD;
      developed by a group of Pilates and rehabilitation experts in Hong Kong to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      falling (the physical and psychological risk factors) of Hong Kong's older adults who might&#xD;
      be prone to falling. It is hypothesized that a simplified Pilates exercise programme is&#xD;
      efficacious in reducing the risk of falling (the physical and psychological risk factors) in&#xD;
      Hong Kong's older adults who are at a medium to high risk of falling. There is no updated&#xD;
      research that has specifically investigated an expertly designed simplified Pilates exercise&#xD;
      programme and no research investigated it in Hong Kong as well. Therefore, this study is&#xD;
      novel and important in investigating the efficacy of an expertly designed simplified Pilates&#xD;
      exercise programme in Hong Kong's older population specifically developed for reducing the&#xD;
      risk of falls. It could increase the intelligent choices of efficacious and&#xD;
      easy-to-comply-with fall prevention exercise programmes (the 16-style simplified Pilates&#xD;
      exercise programme) for older adults and reduce the impact of falls in the older population.&#xD;
      The more the choices of simple and efficacious fall prevention programmes that are available&#xD;
      for older adults, the more likely it is that they will be interested in complying with the&#xD;
      programme. Consequently, this research could provide evidence of Pilates being used in fall&#xD;
      prevention of older adults locally and globally.&#xD;

      This study will be a randomised controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      simplified Pilates exercise programme (developed by a group of Pilates and rehabilitation&#xD;
      experts in Hong Kong in our completed pilot study) by comparing it with the wait-list&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 older adults will be recruited from different collaborating community elderly&#xD;
      and rehabilitation centres in Hong Kong using convenience sampling. The inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be the following: (1) age 65 or above and (2) score of less than 24/28 in the Tinetti&#xD;
      Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA). The exclusion criteria will be the&#xD;
      following: (1) total score of less than 24 in the Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State&#xD;
      Examination (MMSE-C), (2) presence of any untreated cerebral vascular disease, Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease, or any other major neurological deficit, (3) presence of any unstable medical&#xD;
      condition that can affect safety during the exercise training, and (4) inability to sit and&#xD;
      lie down on a Pilates exercise mat on the floor even with assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants (N = 60) will be randomly assigned using concealed block randomisation by an&#xD;
      independent person through a sealed and opaque envelope system to either the simplified&#xD;
      Pilates exercise group (SPEG; n = 30) or the wait-list control group (WLCG; n = 30). A&#xD;
      computerised random-number generator will be utilised to prepare an allocation schedule. The&#xD;
      participants in the SPEG will partake in exercise sessions (about 60 minutes each) in a group&#xD;
      (about 10 participants in each group) twice a week for 12 weeks. Each participant will&#xD;
      undertake a total of 24 exercise sessions. All the training sessions will be conducted in&#xD;
      Hong Kong by two experienced and certified Pilates trainers under the supervision of a&#xD;
      registered physiotherapist. The participants in the SPEG will practise the 16-style&#xD;
      simplified Pilates exercise programme. The WLCG will participate in the 16-style simplified&#xD;
      Pilates exercise programme after two scheduled assessment sessions and a waiting period of 12&#xD;
      weeks in between.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the efficacy of the exercise programme, the participants of both the SPEG and WLCG&#xD;
      will undergo two assessment sessions before training at baseline (T0) and just after the&#xD;
      completion of all the exercise sessions (T1). In the baseline assessment (T0), a structural&#xD;
      questionnaire will be used to ask the participants for their demographic information,&#xD;
      detailed information regarding any previous falls, detailed medical history, use of&#xD;
      prescribed drugs, social history, and socio-economic status. Following this, a series of&#xD;
      assessments will be conducted to examine their balance ability, which will be measured by the&#xD;
      Berg Balance Scale (BBS; primary outcome measure), and other physical and psychological fall&#xD;
      risk factors (secondary outcome measures) in the two assessment sessions (T0 &amp; T1). Any&#xD;
      adverse events will be reported and tracked. Participants will also be asked to prospectively&#xD;
      record the number of falls they have experienced during the time between T0 and T1 using a&#xD;
      structural calendar. The frequency of falls (secondary outcome measure) will then be&#xD;
      collected at T1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance ability (primary outcome measure) will be assessed using the BBS. Regarding the other&#xD;
      physical fall risk factors (secondary outcome measure), flexibility will be measured using&#xD;
      the 'sit-and-reach' (S&amp;R) test. A functional gait and balance assessment will be conducted&#xD;
      using the POMA and Timed Up and Go (TUG) tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, for the assessment of the psychological fall risk factors (secondary&#xD;
      outcome measure), the MMSE-C will be used as a screening tool to examine the preliminary&#xD;
      cognitive function at the beginning of training. Depression levels will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Chinese version of the 4-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-4C). Anxiety levels will be&#xD;
      measured using the valid and reliable Chinese version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory&#xD;
      (STAT-SC &amp; STAI-TC). The valid and reliable Chinese version of the Falls Efficacy Scale&#xD;
      International [FES-I (Ch)] will be utilised to assess the fear of falling. The valid and&#xD;
      reliable Chinese version of the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale [ABC (Ch)] will&#xD;
      be used to evaluate balance confidence.&#xD;
