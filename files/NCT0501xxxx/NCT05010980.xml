      Due to a lack of therapeutic options, the diagnosis of cardiac (wt)-ATTR amyloidosis was for&#xD;
      a long time overshadowed by other diseases and therefore was or still is often diagnosed with&#xD;
      considerable delay. On the one hand, it was assumed that the number of cases was&#xD;
      significantly lower than the latest studies showed, and on the other hand, until the&#xD;
      introduction of new therapeutic agents, there was no approved therapeutic option available,&#xD;
      so that the corresponding diagnosis did not result in any therapeutic consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This has changed fundamentally in recent years. For example, analyses of patients who&#xD;
      underwent interventional aortic valve replacement (TAVI) as a result of high-grade AS&#xD;
      demonstrated cardiac amyloidosis in up to 16% of these patients. Patients with (paradoxical)&#xD;
      low flow low gradient (lflg) AS, which is echocardiographically characterized by a low stroke&#xD;
      volume index (SVI), are particularly frequently affected. In light of these data, recent&#xD;
      publications recommend the use of a low SVI, in conjunction with ECG criteria (low&#xD;
      Sokolow-Lyon index) relative to echocardiographically determined left ventricular myocardial&#xD;
      mass (SLI/ LVM) as a screening tool for the presence of amyloidosis in the patient population&#xD;
      with high-grade aortic valve stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with mild-to-moderate AS, the prevalence of amyloidosis and the validity of these&#xD;
      methods has not yet been clarified. However, identification of these would be, of particular&#xD;
      interest, especially in view of the new therapy options, since with the modern therapy&#xD;
      methods can only improve prognosis if the diagnosis is made early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When cardiac amyloidosis is suspected, three procedures are currently used in clinical&#xD;
      practice&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. myocardial biopsy (BX)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. cardiac MRI (CMR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. scintigraphy with 99mTc phosphates as tracer (scintigraphy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial biopsy is not suitable as a broad screening method due to cost, effort, and&#xD;
      limited feasibility at designated centers. It's rather a goldstandard for confirming&#xD;
      nonconclusive findings or for further differential diagnosis or prognostic assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scintigraphy and CMR are the established and regularly used methods for the detection of&#xD;
      cardiac amyloidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scintigraphy is a cost-effective examination that can be performed on an outpatient basis&#xD;
      with low radiation exposure and high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of cardiac&#xD;
      (ATTR) amyloidosis, especially in (still) asymptomatic patients. Scintigraphy is already&#xD;
      recommended for the screening of ATTR amyloidosis. Besides scintigraphy, the CMR also offers&#xD;
      good sensitivity (80%) and specificity (94%) for the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis, CMR&#xD;
      also offers the advantage of a comprehensive cardiac differential diagnosis with possible&#xD;
      exclusion of amyloidosis. It can also be performed on an outpatient basis, does not require a&#xD;
      radiation-based procedure and can diagnose cardiac amyloidosis with high reproducibility,&#xD;
      both with and without contrast medium. Which of the latter two examinations is more suitable&#xD;
      for amyloidosis screening has not been conclusively determined. Although CMR and scintigraphy&#xD;
      are regulary used for amyloidosis screening, it is not yet known, which of the two&#xD;
      examinations is more suitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to estimate the prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis in mild-to-moderate&#xD;
      AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, a screening algorithm based on echocardiographic parameters should be developed,&#xD;
      to facilitate the early detection of cardiac amyloidosis: This would allow earlier initiation&#xD;
      of therapy and thus better therapeutic success in patients with cardiac amyloidosis.&#xD;
      Accordingly, a better quality of life as well as a prolonged survival of these severely&#xD;
      affected patients could be expected Furthermore, the evaluation of follow-up investigation&#xD;
      should clarify whether patients with cardiac amyloidosis suffer a faster progression of their&#xD;
      AS than those without amyloidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparison of the imaging modalities (CMR and SZG) will provide clues for further&#xD;
      delineation of the indication. of these in order to develop targeted diagnostic algorithms&#xD;
      that are as efficient as possible.&#xD;
