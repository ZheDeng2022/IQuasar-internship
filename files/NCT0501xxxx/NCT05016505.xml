    <textblock>
      Smoke-free housing policies in multiunit housing are promising and increasingly widespread&#xD;
      interventions to reduce smoking and secondhand smoke exposure. Little research has identified&#xD;
      factors that improve compliance with smoke-free housing policies in low-income multiunit&#xD;
      housing and test corresponding solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed RCT addresses key gaps in knowledge and capitalizes on key scientific&#xD;
      opportunities by: 1) leveraging the federal mandate to ban smoking in a public housing system&#xD;
      of more than sufficient size to conduct an adequately powered RCT; 2) expanding our&#xD;
      understanding of smoke-free policy compliance beyond policy implementation by testing two&#xD;
      novel treatments: a) in-residence smoking cessation and b) resident endorsement, while 3)&#xD;
      addressing population and location-specific tobacco-related disparities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the relocation/cessation plus resident endorsement&#xD;
      intervention will yield significantly larger reductions in personal smoking and secondhand&#xD;
      smoke exposure, compared to standalone interventions and the standard approach.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction The broad objective of this study is to address this gap in knowledge by&#xD;
      conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of resident-centered interventions that&#xD;
      support smoke-free housing policy compliance in public housing communities. The study will&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of much needed compliance support interventions on smoking and&#xD;
      secondhand smoke outcomes in randomly selected NYCHA buildings. To date, no RCTs have been&#xD;
      conducted in public housing to test the effects of compliance strategies on resident smoking&#xD;
      behavior and secondhand smoke exposure despite tobacco-related health disparities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the pre-intervention phase, key informant interviews (n=20) and focus groups with 6-8&#xD;
      residents in 8 non-study NYCHA buildings will be conducted to probe for recommended changes&#xD;
      in the physical and social environments of the building including designated smoking areas&#xD;
      and the information and support needed to support the implementation of the smoke-free&#xD;
      policy. Building walkthroughs will also be conducted at baseline and follow-ups to record&#xD;
      signs of active smoking and/or tobacco/marijuana odor. Initial baseline assessments salivary&#xD;
      cotinine concentrations as well as questionnaires will be administered to study participants&#xD;
      in order to establish baseline data before interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant contact will be done face-to-face with systematic questionnaires and potentially&#xD;
      identifying information will be asked or recorded for study participants (although NO&#xD;
      birthdates, photos, or video recordings, will be taken of participants). Consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study will be asked before the actual study begins and individuals who&#xD;
      refuse will not take part in the study. The investigators will simply explain the study, its&#xD;
      intent, its burden, and ask if the investigators can proceed. Informed consent documents and&#xD;
      study materials will be translated (forward and back translated) and administered in Spanish&#xD;
      where needed. All identifying information for each participant will be destroyed at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waiver of written documentation of informed consent has been obtained through the Columbia&#xD;
      University Medical Center IRB. The research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to&#xD;
      subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of&#xD;
      the research context. A waiver of documentation of consent is appropriate, because the only&#xD;
      link between the subject and the study would be the consent document and the primary risk is&#xD;
      a breach of confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will establish excellent rapport with respondents and assure them that the&#xD;
      investigators are researchers with a private, local university and in no way representing law&#xD;
      enforcement or government agencies. No analyses, reports, or peer-reviewed articles will&#xD;
      identify any participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will record information about the participant during initial participant&#xD;
      recruitment that will allow us to recontact that same individual for follow-up surveys at 3&#xD;
      and 12-months post- intervention. With the participant's consent, this information may&#xD;
      include address and/or telephone number so that the investigators can recontact them to&#xD;
      schedule subsequent follow-up. Participants will also be informed that any other identifying&#xD;
      information that is recorded - such as names, birthdates, etc. -will be destroyed at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study interventions will be assessed at 3- and 12-months following baseline. Once buildings&#xD;
      are screened for participation, buildings will be assigned codes for purposes of evaluation.&#xD;
      All questionnaires and data collection protocols will be adapted from established&#xD;
      questionnaires and protocols used in tobacco control and public housing research and will be&#xD;
      pilot tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to baseline data collected on building characteristics through KI interviews and&#xD;
      initial walkthroughs, a walkthrough will also be conducted at the final 12-month, in-person&#xD;
      assessment period.. The presence of cigarettes, cigars, ashtrays with/out ashes, matches or&#xD;
      lighters will be documented within apartments and around the building premises including&#xD;
      stairwells, elevators, hallways, laundry rooms, in/outdoor community spaces, playgrounds and&#xD;
      the perimeter of the buildings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use mobile devices to monitor of evidence of smoking or secondhand&#xD;
      smoke. The team will make notes about visual evidence (cigarette butts, wrappers) or sight or&#xD;
      smell of smoking behavior. Other issues in/around the building such as trash, holes in the&#xD;
      walls or floors, broken stair railings, loitering, loud music and quality of life concerns&#xD;
      will be recorded to document other issues that contribute to general non-compliance with&#xD;
      building rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual Questionnaires: Questionnaires will capture smoking behavior among smokers and&#xD;
      secondhand smoke exposure among non-smokers. Specifically, questionnaires will include&#xD;
      questions about sociodemographic data (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education), time spent at&#xD;
      home, smoking history (including use of cigarettes, marijuana and other tobacco products e.g.&#xD;
      waterpipes and e-cigarettes, and photos of cigarette packs and tobacco products used by&#xD;
      smokers), and secondhand smoke exposure (including exposure duration at different public and&#xD;
      private indoor and outdoor environments), a brief medical history, and exposure to tobacco&#xD;
      control measures such as cessation services, smoke-free interventions and tobacco marketing&#xD;
      and promotion. The investigators will also ask participants to indicate where they smoke,&#xD;
      interest in quitting smoking and if/when they plan to quit. Crucially, questionnaires will&#xD;
      also include questions about participant involvement in or exposure to NYCHA's smoke-free&#xD;
      programming, including interactions with NYCHA Smoke-Free Liaisons. Questionnaires will be&#xD;
      administered to participants in each arm at baseline, follow-up and final assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salivary Collection / Self-Report: Baseline and 12-month final assessment Exposure to smoke&#xD;
      either directly among smokers or indirectly through secondhand smoke will be assessed through&#xD;
      self-report and salivary collection. A self-report questionnaire will be administered to&#xD;
      assess any exposure in the last week. Self-report has been demonstrated to be a reliable&#xD;
      method for assessing exposure. The investigators will randomize whether participants will&#xD;
      partake in salivary collection. For 25% of participants, saliva will be collected at baseline&#xD;
      and at 12 months via passive drool collection. Saliva cotinine will be measured at the&#xD;
      Columbia University Biomarker Core Laboratory using cotinine ELISA Kits (Salimetrics, State&#xD;
      College, PA). The Salimetrics ELISA kit is an enzyme immunoassay used to measure primary or&#xD;
      secondhand exposure to nicotine via cotinine. It is not intended for diagnostic use. It is&#xD;
      intended only for research use among humans and some animals. The assay is non-invasive,&#xD;
      involves no genetic sequencing, and is not used as a diagnostic procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Procedures Qualitative Data Analysis: Focus group and key informant interview&#xD;
      transcripts will be analyzed as textual data along with the visual data and fieldnotes from&#xD;
      the sensory inspections using ATLAS.ti. At least two members of the research team will engage&#xD;
      in a two-phase inductive analytical process informed by phenomenology. The first phase of&#xD;
      analysis will involve &quot;open coding&quot; in which all transcripts and visual documents will be&#xD;
      coded based on a descriptive assessment of the information appearing in the data. A codebook&#xD;
      will be subsequently developed that outlines and defines each code; the data will be&#xD;
      reanalyzed to systematically apply codes from the codebook and identify emergent topics that&#xD;
      characterize and explain the nature of smoking in the buildings. The second phase will entail&#xD;
      &quot;axial coding&quot; in which the codes will be thematically grouped and patterns in the data will&#xD;
      be assessed to reflect causal relationships, contextual factors, intervening conditions,&#xD;
      strategies and consequences. This preliminary phase will help refine subsequent resident&#xD;
      engagement and data collection efforts, and intervention protocols as done previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: The investigators will conduct intent-to-treat (ITT) and&#xD;
      contamination-adjusted intention-to-treat (CA-ITT) analyses to estimate the effects of the&#xD;
      smoking relocation/cessation and resident endorsement interventions compared to the standard&#xD;
      program implemented by NYCHA (no treatment). CA-ITT analyses will account for unanticipated&#xD;
      contamination between trial arms and be completed via two-stage instrumental variables&#xD;
      regressions using the original random allocation codes per assigned unit. Preliminary data&#xD;
      analysis will include examination of distribution and summary statistics of all variables by&#xD;
      intervention groups at each time point. The continuous variables with skewed distribution&#xD;
      will be properly transformed, if necessary, to reduce impact of extreme values or improve&#xD;
      model fitting. The investigators will use box-plots to examine how distribution of a&#xD;
      quantitative variable varies by categories of a categorical variable, and use scatter plots&#xD;
      and Spearman correlation coefficient to examine bivariate associations between quantitative&#xD;
      variables. Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests will be used to detect group differences in&#xD;
      categorical and quantitative baseline variables, respectively. For successful randomization,&#xD;
      the investigators expect no difference in the distribution of all baseline variables among&#xD;
      the four arms. The baseline variables that differ by intervention groups and are related to&#xD;
      outcomes of interest will be controlled in the aim specific models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim-specific analysis: The investigators will use generalized linear models with repeated&#xD;
      measures (GLMRM) for each aim where outcome variables may have different form (continuous,&#xD;
      binary or count) and the measurements are likely to be correlated due to residing in the same&#xD;
      building or being from the same participant over time. The investigators will use the&#xD;
      generalized estimation equation method to estimate model parameters and make statistical&#xD;
      inference since it takes into account intra-cluster (within-building or within-person)&#xD;
      correlations and uses all available data.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For focus groups, we will recruit NYCHA residents via door knocking and lobby&#xD;
             intercepts. We will differentiate eligibility by smoker or non-smoker and maintain&#xD;
             database information collected from focus group participants so as not to contaminate&#xD;
             interventions by recruiting the same participants later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Focus Group Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  None&#xD;
&#xD;
        Building Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NYCHA buildings in Manhattan &amp; the Bronx (stratified evenly by borough) with more than&#xD;
             50 units, not undergoing major renovations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Randomization: In each borough, 8 buildings will be randomly assigned to receive one&#xD;
             of the 4 intervention arms. Dr. Valeri, the study biostatistician, will generate the&#xD;
             randomization list and inform the investigators to which arm each building has been&#xD;
             randomized once eligibility for participation has been confirmed, the baseline data&#xD;
             and interviews have been completed, and the building and investigators are ready to&#xD;
             begin in each building.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Building Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Buildings in a borough that is not in Manhattan or the Bronx&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Buildings smaller than 50 units&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Buildings undergoing major renovations&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recruit NYCHA residents via door knocking and lobby intercepts until we reach our&#xD;
             targeted number per group (4 smokers, 4 non-smokers in each building).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Residents will be screened for smoking status. Both smokers and non-smokers to be&#xD;
             recruited but only one participant- smoker or a non-smoker- will be recruited per&#xD;
             apartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smoking will be defined as those that report using a cigarette or other combustible&#xD;
             tobacco product (e.g., little cigar, cigarillo) at least 5 days in the past month.&#xD;
             Non-smokers include never smokers and former smokers who had quit 12 months ago or&#xD;
             earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additional eligibility criteria include individuals above 18 years old living in the&#xD;
             building at least 5 days/week and 9 months/year, not planning on moving in the next 2&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will exclude those with severe physical or mental medical conditions (i.e.&#xD;
             cognitive disability) or other factors that could limit participation or ability to&#xD;
             give informed consent in the study at baseline or during follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will also exclude those who participated in the earlier focus groups.&#xD;
