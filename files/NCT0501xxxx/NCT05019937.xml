  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a two-armed randomized-controlled trial exploring the effectiveness and&#xD;
      mechanisms of change of two different implementation strategies for implementing the&#xD;
      Guideline for the prevention of mental ill-health at the workplace. The project will be&#xD;
      conducted among public primary and secondary schools belonging to four municipalities in&#xD;
      Sweden. Data will be collected with mixed-methods at baseline and different time-points of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need for more knowledge on effective implementation strategies, as&#xD;
      two-thirds of implementation efforts fail to achieve the intended change, and half have no&#xD;
      effect on outcomes of interest. These implementation failures are partly due to the limited&#xD;
      understanding of how implementation strategies work-the mechanisms of change through which&#xD;
      implementation strategies affect implementation. This project will fill this research-gap by&#xD;
      exploring mechanism of change during a cluster randomized controlled trial that compares the&#xD;
      effectiveness of two implementation strategies for implementing the Guideline for the&#xD;
      prevention of mental ill-health at the workplace in schools. Schools are chosen as the&#xD;
      setting for implementation given the high prevalence of mental ill-health among teachers.&#xD;
      Moreover, schools lack a structured approach to the prevention of mental ill-health. The aim&#xD;
      of the project is to investigate how implementation strategies affect the defined mechanisms&#xD;
      and guideline implementation. Mechanisms that will be tested include hypothesized mediators&#xD;
      originating from the individual behavior change theory COM-B. The project will be conducted&#xD;
      in public primary and secondary schools in four municipalities in Sweden. Data will be&#xD;
      collected with mixed-methods from school-management and personnel at baseline, and different&#xD;
      time-points during follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Change from baseline in organisational readiness to implement the guideline during 12-, and 24-months follow-up. Organisational readiness to implement will be assessed with the Leader Readiness to Implement Tool (LRIT) developed and validated by Cook et al. manuscript submitted. With the tool a total readiness index will be calculated, but also a change efficacy score and a change commitment score indicating the confidence and commitment to implement the guideline within the organisation (school).</description>

Implementation leadership will be assessed with items from the S-ILS (Aarons, Ehrhart, &amp; Farahnak, 2014; Lyon et al., 2018). The S-ILS assesses the degree to which a leader is Proactive, Knowledgeable, Supportive, and Perseverant in implementing evidence-based practice (the guideline). Scores for the subscales will be calculated and a total score for the S-ILS is calculated by taking a mean of the scale scores.</description>

Moreover, the concept of Plan-Do-Study-Act will be introduced and how it can be used to implement the guideline recommendation(s). During each workshop, the implementation team will share with the group their developed PLAN and barriers and facilitators that have influenced the execution of the PLAN.</description>

    <description>Each municipality assigns one or more internal facilitators, for example HR-strategist. The internal facilitator will meet their local implementation teams during the educational meeting and workshops. Further meeting can be scheduled based on the needs of each implementation team. The internal facilitator will create a supportive environment within which knowledge is exchanged, barriers to implementation identified, and processes or solutions to overcome those barriers developed, applied, and refined. Moreover, the internal facilitator will establish ongoing audit and feedback processes.</description>
