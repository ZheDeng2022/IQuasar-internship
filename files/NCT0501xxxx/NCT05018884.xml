  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections (SSI) constitute an important health concern in low and middle&#xD;
      income countries, leading to prolonged hospital stay and increased costs. Previous studies&#xD;
      indicate that in Africa up to 1/3 of patients undergoing surgery may be affected by a&#xD;
      postoperative infection. The development and implementation of context-specific SSI&#xD;
      prevention guidelines is important to reduce this complication. To deploy efficient&#xD;
      context-specific measures, data on epidemiology and microbiology of these infections are&#xD;
      needed. This means to adapt the prevention measures to the context-specific risk factors for&#xD;
      surgical site infections in resource-limited settings, and to give locally adapted&#xD;
      recommendations on antimicrobial therapy based on local resistance patterns. However, data in&#xD;
      this respect are scarce in low and middle income countries. This present study will&#xD;
      contribute to the needed epidemiology and microbiology data on SSI in Cameroon. It will be&#xD;
      carried out as a prospective cohort study at the Mbouo Protestant hospital in the West Region&#xD;
      of Cameroon. The incidence, microbial spectrum and respective antimicrobial resistance of SSI&#xD;
      as well as the risk factors of SSI will be systematically investigated. The study will&#xD;
      include 300 patients at the Hôpital Protestant de Mbouo (HPM) who underwent surgery and gave&#xD;
      their informed consent for inclusion, the timeframe is 04/2021 - 11/2021. An active SSI&#xD;
      surveillance system will be put in place for 30 postoperative days to diagnose SSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of SSI is likely to be higher than 10%. Concerning risk factors, preoperative&#xD;
      bodywashing and perioperative antibioprophylaxis is expected to be protective against SSI. Up&#xD;
      to 1/3 of SSI are expected to occur after hospital discharge. For the microbial spectrum, a&#xD;
      high proportion of Staphylococcus aureus is likely to be found. For the antimicrobial&#xD;
      resistance no estimation can be give as data is non-existent in that region from the&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
