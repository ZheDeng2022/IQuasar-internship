      Randomized controlled trial to evaluate safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of three&#xD;
      different doses (10, 25 and 50 mcg) of a novel vaccine compared with placebo in adult&#xD;
      volunteers previously immunized against Covid-19 with other vaccines [Corona Vac (Sinovac),&#xD;
      ChAdOx1 (AZ 1222, Astra Zeneca) or Ad26.Co2.S (Janssen)].&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity&#xD;
      and efficacy of an investigational vaccine against Covid-19 in adult volunteers previously&#xD;
      fully immunized against Covid-19 with other vaccines [Corona Vac (Sinovac), ChAdOx1 (AZ 1222,&#xD;
      Astra Zeneca) or Ad26.Co2.S (Janssen)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different antigen doses of a vaccine composed of a recombinant S1 antigen, a subunit of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 virus S protein, will be compared against placebo to evaluate its efficacy,&#xD;
      immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy. The study will consist of three cohorts and a total&#xD;
      of 360 participants. Each cohort will be consisted of 120 individuals, who will be randomized&#xD;
      in a 2:1 fashion for a vaccine composed of a recombinant S1 antigen or placebo. In the first&#xD;
      cohort, participants will be randomized to two applications of 10mcg of a vaccine composed of&#xD;
      a recombinant S1 antigenor placebo 28 days apart. In the first week of the study, only three&#xD;
      volunteers will be enrolled in order to assess the safety of the vaccine after 7 days by an&#xD;
      independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The other 117 participants will be&#xD;
      randomized only if there were no safety concerns on these three first enrolled volunteers.&#xD;
      After the enrollment of the first 60 participants, 7-day safety data will be reviewed by the&#xD;
      DSMB, who will decide on trial continuation sequence. If there were no safety concerns, the&#xD;
      second cohort will start. In the second cohort, participants will be randomized to two&#xD;
      applications of 25mcg of a vaccine composed of a recombinant S1 antigen or placebo 28 days&#xD;
      apart. This cohort will have the same design and evaluation of safety performed on the first&#xD;
      cohort. Again, after the enrollment of the first 60 participants, 7-day safety data will be&#xD;
      reviewed by the DSMB, who will decide on trial continuation sequence. If there were no safety&#xD;
      concerns, the third cohort will start. In the second cohort, participants will be randomized&#xD;
      to two applications of 50mcg of a vaccine composed of a recombinant S1 antigen or placebo 28&#xD;
      days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of safety will be evaluated on day 7 after the first and second&#xD;
      application of the vaccine. Therefore, all participants will have this endpoint assessed 36&#xD;
      days after the enrollment. The secondary endpoints will be immunogenicity, evaluated at days&#xD;
      29 (I.e., 28 days after the first dose) and 43 (I.e., 14 days after the second dose), and&#xD;
      efficacy, evaluated as the incidence of symptomatic laboratory confirmed cases of Covid-19&#xD;
      from 14 days after the second dose until 12 months after enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size was calculated based on the probability of adverse events. Assuming a 2.5%&#xD;
      incidence of adverse events, a study with 240 participants receiving the active drug would&#xD;
      have a probability higher than 99% to recognize at least one adverse event. Assuming a 5%&#xD;
      incidence of adverse events, a study with 80 participants receiving the different doses (10,&#xD;
      25 and 50mcg) of the active drug would have a probability of 98% to recognize at least one&#xD;
      adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned before, an independent DSMB will review safety after the enrollment of the first&#xD;
      three participants in each cohort and again after the enrollment of the first 60 participants&#xD;
      in each cohort. Pre-specified guidelines will be established to recommend early stopping of&#xD;
      the trial for evidence of harm.&#xD;
