  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphoma diagnosis often involves removal and biopsy of one or more lymph nodes. Many (around&#xD;
      half) of these diagnostic procedures show that no cancer is present, hence unnecessary&#xD;
      removal results in numerous side effects and complications. The procedure is also highly&#xD;
      invasive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have already shown that it is possible to tell the difference between&#xD;
      healthy and diseased tissue in the laboratory by looking at the light emitted by tissue when&#xD;
      a low power laser is shone on to it. The investigators intend to use this technique, known as&#xD;
      &quot;Raman Spectroscopy&quot; (RS) to tell if tissue in the node is cancerous or healthy. By combining&#xD;
      RS with a fine needle, the technique can target tissues below the skin with minimal invasion.&#xD;
      Our needle will provide the clinician with instant diagnosis without the delay and cost of a&#xD;
      laboratory analysis by pathologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have designed a probe that slides through a fine needle, guided by&#xD;
      ultrasound, to the lymph node. The space between the two needles provides space for cell&#xD;
      aspirate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to measure spectra from excess lymph node biopsy samples taken&#xD;
      during standard routine diagnostic biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are also interested to see if they can successfully extract a fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration (FNA) biopsy sample using the device, as well as record a RS measurement. If&#xD;
      successful this would ease clinical adoption as the study could run in parallel with existing&#xD;
      standard routine clinical practice, using just one device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the new device on half a lymph node that will be excised and&#xD;
      snap-frozen during a routine surgical biopsy, to gather data for submission of approvals for&#xD;
      an in-vivo study to follow.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surplus lymph node tissue collected from patients undergoing routine surgical treatment for&#xD;
      head &amp; neck disease will be investigated using vibrational spectroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will develop a combined FNA/Raman spectroscopy needle probe. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate this device on excised lymph node tissue to gather data for submission of approvals&#xD;
      for an in-vivo study to follow. Raman &amp; FTIR (fourier transform infrared) spectra will be&#xD;
      correlated with routine histopathology results using multivariate analysis methods. Cytology&#xD;
      samples taken using the device will be compared with histopathology results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate that the FNA/Raman spectroscopy probe device, developed as part of this&#xD;
      project, can:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safely perform measurement of Raman spectra on excised lymph node tissue Safely perform FNA&#xD;
      (fine needle aspiration) biopsies on excised lymph node tissue To evaluate the performance of&#xD;
      a Raman needle probe to detect lymphoma &amp; malignancy in excised head &amp; neck lymph nodes and&#xD;
      differentiate from benign nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop the investigators understanding of vibrational spectroscopy signal characteristics&#xD;
      in head &amp; neck lymph nodes (through Raman &amp; FTIR mapping measurements of tissue sections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To test a new combined FNA and spectroscopic device on ex vivo tissue in&#xD;
      preparation for an in vivo study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures The FNA/Raman spectroscopy probe device can be used safely on&#xD;
      excised lymph nodes to measure tissue spectra and collect FNA biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic performance of vibrational spectroscopy for differentiation of lymphoma &amp;&#xD;
      malignant nodes from benign nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures Evaluation of the performance of a Raman needle probe to detect&#xD;
      lymphoma &amp; malignancy in excised head &amp; neck lymph nodes and differentiate from benign nodes.&#xD;
      To develop the investigators understanding of vibrational spectroscopy signal characteristics&#xD;
      in head &amp; neck lymph nodes (through Raman &amp; FTIR mapping measurements of tissue sections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the performance of a Raman needle probe to measure head &amp; neck lymph nodes&#xD;
      (ergonomic design, ease of use etc.).&#xD;
