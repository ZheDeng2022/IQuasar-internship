  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of proanthocyanidins as an adjunctive&#xD;
      periodontal therapy in patients with periodontitis. Recently proanthocyanidins were proposed&#xD;
      as a viable adjunct to periodontal treatment. Preclinical studies have shown high&#xD;
      antibacterial and anti-inflammatory capacities of proanthocyanidins, that could reduce&#xD;
      periodontal inflammation and promote periodontal tissues regeneration. In addition,&#xD;
      proanthocyanidins demonstrate a specific antibacterial characteristic to attack&#xD;
      periodonto-pathogenic bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis) but save the oral commensal&#xD;
      bacteria (Streptococcus salivarius). Patients with periodontitis (stage III-IV) were included&#xD;
      in this study. Healthy individuals were also enrolled as no-treatment control. Patients with&#xD;
      periodontitis received two different treatment modalities: subgingival instrumentation only&#xD;
      (SI group) or subgingival instrumentation and subgingival application of collagen hydrogels&#xD;
      with proanthocyanidins (SI+PACNs group). Clinical periodontal parameters (PPD, BOP, PI) were&#xD;
      evaluated before treatment and after 6 weeks. Concentrations of immunological markers MMP-3&#xD;
      and TIMP-1 in saliva were investigated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ethical permission was issued by the Regional Biomedical Research Ethics Committee (No.&#xD;
      BE-2-38). All included patients must have signed an informed consent form, were willing and&#xD;
      able to show up for follow-up appointments and agreed to coded data collection. Patients were&#xD;
      given enough time to analyze protocol of the study and were free to exit the study at any&#xD;
      time without a specific reason. The study was performed according to CONSORT guidelines for&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with periodontitis (stage III-IV) were included in the study. The inclusion criteria&#xD;
      in treatment groups were periodontitis patients with two or more periodontal pockets in&#xD;
      different quadrants (bleeding on probing (BOP)&gt;15% and probing pocket depth (PPD) ≥5mm. The&#xD;
      no-treatment control group consisted of systemically healthy individuals with healthy&#xD;
      periodontal state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were allocated by the same examiner to two groups: the first group received&#xD;
      subgingival instrumentation only (SI group), the second group- subgingival instrumentation&#xD;
      and subgingival application of collagen hydrogels with PACNs (SI+PACNs group). The same&#xD;
      examiner performed the coding and randomization of the participants in the treatment groups&#xD;
      with a computer-generated randomization table. A no-treatment control group of individuals&#xD;
      with healthy periodontal state was composed for biochemical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trial protocol included several appointments. At the baseline all patients received&#xD;
      periodontal examination, the collection of saliva samples was performed. Both groups received&#xD;
      full-mouth subgingival instrumentation procedure by single periodontist. In addition,&#xD;
      patients in SI+PACNs group received collagen hydrogel chips with proanthocyanidins, placed&#xD;
      subgingivally in periodontal pockets with PPD≥4mm. Postoperative care instructions were given&#xD;
      (no flossing or use of chemical control materials).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After subgingival instrumentation procedure patients returned for the next appointment (6&#xD;
      weeks after baseline). Periodontal reevaluation of encoded patients was performed by a single&#xD;
      examiner. Saliva sample were collected in the same manner as mentioned before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship of clinical periodontal parameters and MMP-3 and TIMP-1 levels were analyzed&#xD;
      to assess the efficacy of proanthocyanidins in periodontal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated regarding the primary outcome variable. According to the&#xD;
      calculation, it was determined that 16 patients would be necessary in each group (a clinical&#xD;
      difference- 0.5 mm in the PPD between both treatment methods, 95% confidence interval (α =&#xD;
      0.05, SD 1mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS 26 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) statistic&#xD;
      software package. Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to assess if clinical periodontal measures&#xD;
      and biochemical measures followed a normal distribution. Accordingly, if the data followed a&#xD;
      normal distribution, paired-samples t-test was done to obtain before and after treatment&#xD;
      comparisons within the groups. If the assumption of normality was violated related samples&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed ranks test was done to obtain before and after treatment comparisons within&#xD;
      the groups. The between group comparisons of measures were determined by either independent&#xD;
      samples t-test in case the specific measure followed a normal distribution or Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      test in case the specific measure followed a non-normal distribution. The statistical&#xD;
      significance level was considered at the 0.05 level.&#xD;

    <description>For MMP-3/TIMP-1 detection, the collection of saliva samples was performed using Salivette (SARSTEDT AG and Co, Germany) saliva sample collection kit. Saliva samples were collected at the baseline for all patients and 6 weeks after treatment. Samples were centrifuged at 3500 rpm (2 min), aliquoted and protease inhibitors cocktail (1 mg/ml) was added to each sample. All samples were stored at -80oC. MMP-3, TIMP-1 concentration in saliva samples was examined using commercial ELISA kits (Elabscience, USA) and Multiskan Microplate Photometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 450 nm wavelength. Saliva MMP-3/TIMP-1 samples were collected before treatment and 6 weeks after treatment.</description>
