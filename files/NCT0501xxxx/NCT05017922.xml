      The study is aimed to explore the efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined&#xD;
      with endoscopic therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) complicated with&#xD;
      esophagogastric varices (EGV) and seek out predictors associated with survival.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>transarterial chemoembolization combined with endoscopic therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>TACE: The tip of the catheter was advanced into tumor-feeding artery based on the tumor location and size. 5-Fu was injected. Then the chemolipiodolization was performed, using oxaliplatin, epirubicin and lipiodol. If stagnant flow did not realized, then injected pure lipiodol. If the tumor-feeding artery still cannot be completely embolized, several absorbable gelatin sponge particles would be injected. Endoscopic therapy: After the site of esophageal varices was identified by the gastroscopy, spiral ligation using the EVL device (COOK, MBL-6-F) was performed and ensure the varices were fully inhaled, 1-3 rubber bands were used totally. After EVL, water was sprayed to the ligation sites to check for bleeding. If gastric varices were found, EIS was performed using the 'sandwich method' of hypertonic glucose-tissue adhesive-normal saline. Make sure the needle entered the varieose vein before inject drugs, and repeated the injection if necessary.</description>
