    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused pandemic since&#xD;
      outbreak in 2020.Patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) are at higher risk of mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity due to COVID-19. Despite there is a large number of clinical trials of COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccines, only a few participants with chronic liver diseases were included.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, single-arm, open-label clinical trial. A total of 300 patients&#xD;
      with different cancers including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis .All of the patients will&#xD;
      further accept 12 months follow-up study after vaccination. Safety and immunogenicity will be&#xD;
      carefully recorded and detected.&#xD;
