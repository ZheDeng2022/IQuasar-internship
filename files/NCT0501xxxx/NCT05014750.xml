  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the rapid development of medical and nursing technology, the prognosis of valvular&#xD;
      heart disease has been greatly improved. However, compared with young patients, the mortality&#xD;
      and adverse event rate of elderly patients with valvular heart disease are still high,&#xD;
      surgical complications are more frequent and hospitalization time is longer. The complexity&#xD;
      of valvular heart disease and the poor prognosis in the elderly forces us to continue to look&#xD;
      for other potential prognostic factors. In addition to the adverse outcomes caused by disease&#xD;
      factors, elderly patients with valvular heart disease also have the gradual decline of&#xD;
      physiological and psychological reserve function caused by age factors. These adverse&#xD;
      outcomes include osteopenia, disability, prolonged hospitalization and even death are all&#xD;
      closely related to frailty. Frailty is 'a biologic syndrome of decreased reserve and&#xD;
      resistance to stressors, resulting from cumulative declines across multiple physiologic&#xD;
      systems, and causing vulnerability to adverse outcomes. The essence of frailty is the decline&#xD;
      of individual resistance, which eventually leads to the increase of individual brittleness&#xD;
      and susceptibility to adverse health outcomes. At present, the research in the field of&#xD;
      elderly vulnerable groups of cardiovascular disease in China started late, mostly focusing on&#xD;
      the study of pathological mechanism, the introduction of evaluation tools, conceptual&#xD;
      analysis and so on. Almost all of the existing studies are about the debilitation status of&#xD;
      elderly patients with heart valve disease, and most of them mainly try to find the&#xD;
      influencing factors of debilitation from the aspects of patients' physical diseases, ignoring&#xD;
      the impact of factors such as the mental health status of the elderly on debilitation, there&#xD;
      are few reports of short-term adverse events in elderly patients with valvular heart disease.&#xD;
      This study will analyze the influencing factors of the weakness of elderly patients with&#xD;
      valvular diseases from the multi-dimensional aspects of demographic data, physical diseases,&#xD;
      psychology and society, and track the short-term prognosis of patients with death, fall and&#xD;
      unconventional rehospitalization, so as to provide a research basis for relevant research in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;
