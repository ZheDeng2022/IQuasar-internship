  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Isolation lung cysticercosis reports are rare in literature. Most lung lesions were&#xD;
      characterized by nodules. The investigators access one case which was characterized with&#xD;
      pulmonary cavity and pleural effusion by Gupta N, et al in 2015 from PUBMED and Medline. But&#xD;
      pleural effusion and exudative lesions is reported for the first time.&#xD;

      Cysticercosis is an important public health problem in developing countries. The major&#xD;
      involvement sites are the central nervous system and the eyes，although striated muscles and&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissues are frequently involved in the disseminated form of disease. Pulmonary&#xD;
      involvement in cysticercosis is very rare and ill-defined nodular shadows distributed&#xD;
      throughout the lung is the usual radiological presentation. Only one case of cysticercosis&#xD;
      presenting as lung cavity with pleural effusion has been reported so far in literature. The&#xD;
      investigators describe two cases in which pleural effusion due to cysticercosis were detected&#xD;
      on X and CT.&#xD;
