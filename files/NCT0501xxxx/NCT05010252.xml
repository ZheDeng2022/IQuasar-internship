  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irregular lighting and lack of light in premature infants will affect their health, produce&#xD;
      negative effects such as physiological and visual development, and also affect the mother's&#xD;
      sleep and quality of life. This study is to verify the effect and delay effect of two-week&#xD;
      premature infants' light intervention on their physiological indicators and visual&#xD;
      development, mother's sleep quality and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to be in the Neonatal Moderate to Severe Ward of National Taiwan University&#xD;
      Children's Hospital, and the subjects are premature babies born 32 weeks old. Divided into&#xD;
      two groups of light intervention group and control group, longitudinal tracking intervention&#xD;
      effect and six-week and three-month delay effect.&#xD;

      Background Dim, irregular lighting and lack of periodic light in the care environment for&#xD;
      premature babies in Taiwan are currently common conditions. Irregular lighting and lack of&#xD;
      light in premature infants will affect their health, produce negative effects such as&#xD;
      physiological and visual development, and also affect the mother's sleep and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose To verify the effect and delay effect of two-week premature infants' light&#xD;
      intervention on their physiological indicators and visual development, mother's sleep quality&#xD;
      and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The preliminary plan of this study is to carry out empirical evidence and expert&#xD;
      advice to confirm precise lighting and develop care intervention strategies for preterm&#xD;
      infants based on evidence. It is planned to be in the Neonatal Moderate to Severe Ward of&#xD;
      National Taiwan University Children's Hospital, and the subjects are premature babies born 32&#xD;
      weeks old. Divided into two groups of light intervention group and control group,&#xD;
      longitudinal tracking intervention effect and six-week and three-month delay effect.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in mean daily Heart Rate during the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 42 days</time_frame>
    <description>This is to evaluate the effect of cycled light intervention on Heart Rate (beats/min) in preterm infants. Heart Rate is recorded every 5 minutes. Take the daily average of the Heart Rate, and then analyze its daily change before discharge. The intervention time is after the parents of premature infants agree to participate and before premature infants are discharged from the hospital.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in mean Respiratory Rate during the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 42 days</time_frame>
    <description>This is to evaluate the effect of cycled light intervention on Respiratory Rate (breaths/min) in preterm infants. Respiratory Rate is recorded every 5 minutes. Take the daily average of the Respiratory Rate, and then analyze its daily change before discharge. The intervention time is after the parents of premature infants agree to participate and before premature infants are discharged from the hospital.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in mean daily oxygen saturation during the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 42 days</time_frame>
    <description>This is to evaluate the effect of cycled light intervention on oxygen saturation SpO2 (%) in preterm infants. Oxygen saturation SpO2 is recorded every 5 minutes. Take the daily average of the oxygen saturation SpO2, and then analyze its daily change before discharge. The intervention time is after the parents of premature infants agree to participate and before premature infants are discharged from the hospital.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in daily body weight during the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 42 days</time_frame>
    <description>This is to evaluate the effect of cycled light intervention on body weight (kilograms) in preterm infants. Body weight is recorded every day during hospital stay after intervention, and then we analyze its daily change before discharge. The intervention time is after the parents of premature infants agree to participate and before premature infants are discharged from the hospital.</description>

    <description>Measured by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI). Effect of light intervention in premature infants on mother's sleep quality. Data will be collected for the first time (O1) before the experiment, post-test (O2) will be performed six weeks after the intervention, and post-test (O3) will be performed three months after the intervention.</description>

    <description>The measurement was conducted by the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief (WHOQoL-BREF) questionnaire. Effect of light intervention in premature infants on mother's quality of life. Data will be collected for the first time (O1) before the experiment, post-test (O2) will be performed six weeks after the intervention, and post-test (O3) will be performed three months after the intervention.</description>

    <measure>Severity of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)</measure>
    <time_frame>O1 (before intervention); O2 (at the sixth week after birth); O3 (at the third month after birth)</time_frame>
    <description>ROP is described by its location in the eye (the zone), by the severity of the disease (the stage) and by the appearance of the retinal vessels (plus disease). The first stage of ROP is a demarcation line that separates normal from premature retina. Stage 2 is a ridge which has height and width. Stage 3 is the growth of fragile new abnormal blood vessels. The severity of ROP is judged by the doctor.</description>
