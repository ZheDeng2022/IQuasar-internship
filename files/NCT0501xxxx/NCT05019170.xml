  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking during pregnancy increases risk for catastrophic pregnancy complications,&#xD;
      growth retardation, other adverse infant health problems, and later-in-life chronic&#xD;
      conditions. One group that is particularly at risk for these complications are Alaska Native&#xD;
      (AN) women. Prevalence of smoking during pregnancy is disproportionally high among AN women&#xD;
      compared to US pregnant women overall (i.e., ~36% and ~13%, respectively) and few&#xD;
      smoking-cessation interventions have been evaluated among this population. A substantive&#xD;
      barrier to offering evidence-based interventions to AN women is the geographic remoteness of&#xD;
      Alaska. The most effective intervention for promoting smoking cessation during pregnancy is&#xD;
      financial incentives in which participants earn incentives (e.g., cash) contingent on&#xD;
      objective evidence of smoking abstinence. This intervention has been adapted to be delivered&#xD;
      entirely through a smartphone meaning that the geographic remoteness of Alaska will not be a&#xD;
      barrier with this intervention. Participants submit videos of themselves completing breath&#xD;
      and saliva tests, and incentives are then delivered through the application if the tests&#xD;
      indicate smoking abstinence. Through a collaboration between the University of Vermont and&#xD;
      the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, the goal of this study is to examine the&#xD;
      preliminary feasibility and efficacy of this smartphone-based incentives intervention among&#xD;
      AN women. Pregnant AN women will be recruited through ads posted on social media. Eligible&#xD;
      participants who complete the informed consent process will be randomized to either: Best&#xD;
      Practices or Best Practices + Incentives. In the Best Practices condition, participants will&#xD;
      receive three brief educational sessions and a referral to the Alaska state quitline. In the&#xD;
      Best Practices + Incentives condition, participants will receive the same education sessions&#xD;
      and quitline referral, plus financial incentives contingent on the smartphone-based testing&#xD;
      of breath and saliva specimens indicating abstinence from recent smoking. Outcomes will&#xD;
      include point prevalence smoking abstinence at assessments conducted in late pregnancy and&#xD;
      4-, 8-, 12-, and 24-weeks postpartum, continuous abstinence during antepartum and postpartum,&#xD;
      and perceived barriers and facilitators of treatment engagement. Overall, this project has&#xD;
      the potential to address disparities in access to efficacious, evidence-based smoking&#xD;
      cessation treatments among AN pregnant women.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators are proposing a two-condition, parallel groups, randomized controlled pilot study of a smartphone-based financial incentives intervention for AN pregnant smokers. The experimental group will receive financial incentives (money loaded onto a debit card) contingent on the remote submission of breath carbon monoxide and saliva cotinine tests indicating smoking abstinence in addition to best practices for promoting smoking cessation (Best Practices + Incentives). The control group will receive best practices alone (Best Practices). The use of a best practices group reflects a real-world comparison condition in that all women will receive the treatment that practitioners in the community are instructed to provide (the 5As + quitline referral) thereby enhancing the ecological validity of the study. Additionally, the investigators will minimize between-subject variability in the participant's exposure to these practices by implementing these treatment components themselves.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Financial Incentives - Beginning on the quit date and extending for one week, participants will be required to submit twice daily CO samples. All samples &lt; 6 ppm will be considered negative and those &gt; 6 ppm will be considered positive. Participants will earn incentives for breath tests indicating smoking abstinence, and incentive values will increase with each consecutive negative sample. Following the initial quit week, the schedule of monitoring will be reduced, and incentives will be contingent on submitting a negative saliva cotinine test.</description>
