  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, phase 2 study of ARX788 in HER2-positive, metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer patients whose disease is resistant or refractory to TKI. The ARX788 will be&#xD;
      administered every 3 weeks (Q3W) intravenous (IV) infusion. In this study, Simon's two-stage&#xD;
      design is used. Subjects received treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxicity,&#xD;
      withdrawal from the study, or discontinuation judged by the investigator. Drug efficacy and&#xD;
      safety data will be collected.&#xD;
