  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was to explore the efficacy of ALK-TKI in lung squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma.Approximately 5% of lung adenocarcinomas have oncogenic fusions of EML-4 and ALK a&#xD;
      mutation associated with tumorigenesis and migration. Several studies have shown that in&#xD;
      patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cells, the use of ALK inhibitors can achieve better&#xD;
      efficacy and significantly prolong overall survival. However few of them performed Fish or&#xD;
      NGS tests. Our data demonstrates that lung squamous cell carcinoma with ALK rearrangement&#xD;
      responds well to ALK-TKI, and correspondingly has a significant improvement in survival time&#xD;
      and prognosis, providing a basis for the treatment of ALK-positive patients with lung&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma. At the same time, we believe that genetic testing is also required&#xD;
      for lung squamous cell carcinoma to achieve more accurate medication.&#xD;
