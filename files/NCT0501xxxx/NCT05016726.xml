      To evaluate intra-procedural and long-term effects of intravascular lithotripsy with the&#xD;
      ShockWave System and/or non-balloon mechanical debulking devices, prior and/or after coronary&#xD;
      stenting in an angiographically well-defined group of patients with complex calcified&#xD;
      coronary artery lesions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      At present age, there are few real-world data published about the use of intravascular&#xD;
      lithotripsy. Its safety and possible procedural complications remain unclear, and the effects&#xD;
      of combination with other plaque-modification devices are unknown. Finally, there are few&#xD;
      data about long-term outcomes in the real-life setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population: Subjects ≥ 18 years of age with de novo, calcified coronary artery&#xD;
      lesions presenting with Stable CAD or Acute Coronary Syndromes, that are suitable for&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Approximately 400 subjects at 20 sites will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Subjects will be followed through discharge, 30 days, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
