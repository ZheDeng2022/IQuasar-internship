    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction play a key role in the development of tumors. The&#xD;
      aim of the study is to investigate the predictive value of SII and PALBI grade for the&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic cancer surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The systemic immune-inflammation index(SII), based on the counts of platelets, neutrophils,&#xD;
      and lymphocytes,was first found to be related to the prognosis of patients in melanoma12, and&#xD;
      was subsequently confirmed in malignant tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma13,and lung&#xD;
      cancer12. A retrospective multicenter cohort study showed that bilirubin levels can interfere&#xD;
      some inflammation index'prognosis of PDAC7.The platelet-albumin-bilirubin&#xD;
      (platelet-albumin-bilirubin, PALBI) grade as a prognostic indicator of inflammation has been&#xD;
      found in recent years, and its role has been confirmed in patients with liver cirrhosis14,15&#xD;
      and hepatocellular carcinoma 16, but there is no research to verify its role in patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer. This study aims to verify the predictive value of systemic immune&#xD;
      inflammation index (SII) and platelet-albumin-bilirubin grade (PALBI) for the prognosis of&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic cancer surgery, and to explore the significance of other&#xD;
      inflammatory indicators in the overall survival(OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).&#xD;
