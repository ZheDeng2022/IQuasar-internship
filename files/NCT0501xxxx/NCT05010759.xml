      Stage 2B: NanoTherm ablation of focal prostate cancer in small lesions in Gleason 3+3 and&#xD;
      Clean 3+4 disease. The outcome of this ablation is validated by a transperineal biopsy at 4&#xD;
      months after ablation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Presently, patients having intermediate-risk prostate carcinoma have to make a very difficult&#xD;
      decision regarding treatment, as active surveillance will not immediately alter the current&#xD;
      quality of life. However, because there is a risk of progressive disease or due to patient&#xD;
      anxiety due to an untreated tumor, many patients opt for active treatment, often using&#xD;
      radiation or prostatectomy, and sometimes in combination with androgen deprivation.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, radiation, surgery, and androgen deprivation have multiple and potentially&#xD;
      profound side effects including sexual, urinary, and bowel complications. As a small fraction&#xD;
      of men dies from this disease, the number of men needed to treat to prevent one death is&#xD;
      large, resulting in many men with side effects or complications to help prevent the one&#xD;
      death. It is for these reasons that there is a major need for focal therapy for this group of&#xD;
      patients who most commonly are treated actively with surgery or radiation; such focal therapy&#xD;
      could ablate the detected tumor(s) within the prostate, control the disease while avoiding&#xD;
      side effects of whole gland therapies and controlling tumor growth within the prostate&#xD;
      detected by (multiparameter-) MRI and histopathologically confirmed by biopsy. MagForce&#xD;
      NanoTherm® Therapy offers this option by noninvasive ablation of small tumors in a 1-2 ml&#xD;
      target volume of the prostate, a treatment that is not possible with any other technology on&#xD;
      the market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the use of NanoTherm ablation as a method of treating these intermediate&#xD;
      grade lesions allowing patients to return to active surveillance without definitive treatment&#xD;
      such as external beam radiation or prostatectomy.&#xD;
