  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will test the feasibility of N-of-1 trials for deprescribing&#xD;
      beta-blockers in patients with Cardiac Amyloidosis. To achieve this objective, 16 N-of-1&#xD;
      trials (on vs. off) will be conducted and subsequently interview participants to better&#xD;
      understand feasibility and pragmatism. Each subject can participate in a total of up to 4&#xD;
      periods lasting between 2-6 weeks each based on each patients' health profile. The N-of-1&#xD;
      trials will be iteratively refined in real-time based on feedback.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an unblinded NIH Stage I of Behavioral Intervention Development trial, using a&#xD;
      Crossover Intervention model. The study team will enroll 16 subjects using a two-arm&#xD;
      crossover titration/reversal design (On [A] vs. Off [B]) with up to 4 periods. Subjects will&#xD;
      begin the study in the OFF (B) period. They will follow a pre-determined sequence: off&#xD;
      beta-blocker, on beta-blocker, off beta-blocker, on beta-blocker. Each period will last up to&#xD;
      6 weeks, allowing for sufficient time for up-titration of beta-blocker and onset of drug&#xD;
      action, and down-titration and washout. Each subject will have the option to participate in&#xD;
      up to 4 periods, depending on whether they need additional information to make an informed&#xD;
      decision about continuing or discontinuing their beta-blocker at the end of the trial. The&#xD;
      intervention drug will be beta-blockers, previously prescribed to the subjects by their&#xD;
      physician. The study team has developed a titration algorithm, where the participant's dose&#xD;
      of each beta-blocker will be reduced by 50% every week.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in exercise capacity when on beta-blocker and off-beta blocker, as measured by peak oxygen consumption (VO2) during cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of intervention Period 1 (Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) and Period 2 (Weeks 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12)</time_frame>
    <description>To understand the changes in exercise capacity between the On and Off phase via a Peak oxygen consumption (VO2) Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) measures breath-by-breath oxygen production during symptom-limited exercise on a stationary bike or treadmill. This permits calculation of peak oxygen consumption (VO2). Percent predicted peak VO2 for body weight will also be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Change in lower extremity function when on beta-blocker and off beta-blocker, as measured by a Short Physical Performance Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; End of intervention Period 1 (Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6), Period 2 (Weeks 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12), Period 3 (Weeks 14, 15, 16,17, or 18), and Period 4 (Weeks 20, 21, 22, 23, or 24)</time_frame>
    <description>To understand the changes in lower extremity function between the On and Off phase via a Short physical performance battery test (lower extremity function). The Short Physical Performance Battery assesses gait speed, core strength when rising from a chair without using upper extremities, and balance while standing without a cane or walker. Total score range from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating better physical performance.</description>

    <measure>Change in patient-reported quality of life when on beta-blocker, as measured by the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System-29 (PROMIS-29)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Weekly over 24 weeks; Month 6, Month 9, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System-29 (PROMIS-29) is a health-related quality of life survey, with questions from 6 domains: depression, anxiety, physical function, pain interference, sleep disturbance, and ability to engage in social roles and activities. Questions are ranked on a 5-point Likert scale, with higher scores at times indicating better quality of life, and at other times indicating poorer quality of life. There is a pain rating scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher pain level. Scores are reported for each domain, as well as for pain rating.</description>

    <description>This arm will follow an Off On Off On sequence. This is the only arm in the study. Subjects will begin in the Off phase (Period 1), downtitrating their beta-blocker by 50% each week until they are completely off the drug for a total of two weeks. At the end of Period 1, Subjects will have the opportunity to crossover into Period 2, where they will begin the On phase. Subjects will restart their beta-blocker by starting a low dose and then doubling this dose every week until reaching their original dose. They will then have the opportunity to continue to Period 3 (Off phase) and Period 4 (On phase).</description>
