      Substudy 1: An evaluation of the effect of intravenous dexamethasone on postoperative nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the operating room, participants will be initially placed in a ramped position and then&#xD;
      moved into a reverse Trendelenburg position to achieve a 30-degree incline of the thorax&#xD;
      before preoxygenation. Each participant will be randomly assigned 1:1, stratified by presence&#xD;
      of diabetes mellitus, to one of each of the following two interventions: dexamethasone (8 mg&#xD;
      intravenously) and placebo (0.9% sodium chloride). The envelopes of group allocation will be&#xD;
      opened just before the induction of general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After preoxygenation using facemask with pure oxygen 10 l·min-1 until end-tidal fractional&#xD;
      oxygen concentration in the expired air (EtO2) ≥ 80%, general anesthesia will be induced with&#xD;
      propofol 1.5-2.0 mg·kg-1 ideal body weight and fentanyl 1-2 μg·kg-1 total body weight.&#xD;
      Tracheal intubation will be facilitated with rocuronium 0.8-1.0 mg·kg-1 ideal body weight.&#xD;
      After induction, a radial artery catheterization will be performed for continuous monitoring&#xD;
      of arterial pressure and measurement of serum glucose. In the designated patients, 8 mg of&#xD;
      dexamethasone or placebo will be given intravenously within 10 minutes after the induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia. Anesthesia will be maintained with 2-3 vol% sevoflurane and 60% oxygen in&#xD;
      nitrogen, whereas the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 0.8-1.0 will be used during&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum to ensure oxygen saturation higher than 92%. If the value of surgical pleth&#xD;
      index (CARESCAPE B650 Monitor, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) is more than 50 or heart rate&#xD;
      or blood pressure increases by more than 20% from baseline values during surgery, an&#xD;
      intravenous bolus of fentanyl 25 or 50 μg will be given. Besides, the concentration of&#xD;
      sevoflurane can be adjusted as clinically appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, all participants will receive supplemental oxygen, and pain will be relieved&#xD;
      with ketorolac 15 to 30 mg. The need for postoperative opioids will be at the discretion of&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist, and the dose will be adjusted according to clinical needs. Participants&#xD;
      who request rescue antiemetic therapy or who have an emetic episode will be given droperidol&#xD;
      1.25 mg. If symptoms persist, metoclopramide 10 mg will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is the incidence of PONV, which includes any nausea, emetic episodes&#xD;
      (retching or vomiting), or both during the first 24 postoperative hour. At the 2nd and 24th&#xD;
      postoperative hours, trained investigators who are blinded to the group allocation will&#xD;
      record the number of emetic episodes, the time each one occurs, and self-reported worst&#xD;
      nausea episode during the preceding duration on an 11-point scale (0: no nausea and 10: the&#xD;
      most severe nausea).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 2: An investigation of the threshold inspiratory pressure for gastric insufflation&#xD;
      using ultrasonography of gastric antrum&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure the antral area of each participant lying in supine position&#xD;
      on the operating table, using a portable ultrasound device (LOGIQ™, GE Healthcare, Chicago,&#xD;
      IL, USA, fitted with a 1.5 to 5.0 MHz convex transducer). The investigators will determine&#xD;
      the longitudinal (D1) and anteroposterior (D2) diameters of the cross-section of antrum in&#xD;
      the sagittal plane passing through abdominal aorta.50 To obtain a standardized scanning&#xD;
      level, the aorta and left lobe of the liver are employed as internal landmarks. The relaxed&#xD;
      diameters of the antrum are measured between antral contractions. The area of gastric antrum&#xD;
      is calculated using the formula: antral area = D1×D2×π / 4. In addition, the gastric fluid&#xD;
      volume will be calculated with a validated model based on the cross-sectional area of the&#xD;
      gastric antrum, described previously.51 Participants will be randomized into one of the four&#xD;
      groups defined by the applied inspiratory pressure (10, 15, 20, or 25 cmH2O) using blocked&#xD;
      randomization. During induction of anesthesia, normal saline 20 ml will be immediately&#xD;
      infused after the administration of rocuronium 0.8-1.0 mg·kg-1 ideal body weight.52 After&#xD;
      loss of eyelash reflex, a Guedel oropharyngeal airway (Biçakcilar, Istanbul, Turkey) will be&#xD;
      placed into the oral cavity to assure adequate mouth opening. A facemask will be applied&#xD;
      firmly to the patient's face to ensure an adequate seal. A two-handed head-tilt jaw-thrust&#xD;
      maneuver will be performed to establish an open airway. Once apnea determined by end-tidal&#xD;
      capnography occurs, a mechanical ventilation with the assigned peak inspiratory pressure will&#xD;
      be initiated. The pressure-controlled mode will be used with an inspiratory-to-expiratory&#xD;
      ratio of 1:2 and no positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), at a frequency of 15&#xD;
      breath·min-1 and with 100% oxygen, by the ventilator (Carestation 620, Datex-Ohmeda, Inc.,&#xD;
      Madison, WI, USA).53 Real-time ultrasonography of the antrum will be performed by the same&#xD;
      anesthesiologist who performs the preoperative ultrasonography. Another anesthetist will&#xD;
      perform continuous auscultation over epigastric area. The investigators performing&#xD;
      ultrasonography and auscultation are blinded one to another regarding the detection of&#xD;
      gastric insufflation and the inspiratory pressure of pressure-controlled ventilation. The&#xD;
      ultrasonography screen will be concealed from the anesthetist performing the auscultation.&#xD;
      Facemask ventilation will be continued for 2 min. The trachea will be thereafter intubated,&#xD;
      and the antral area will be measured again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is the episode of gastric insufflation. The ultrasonographic diagnosis of&#xD;
      gastric insufflation is defined as the presence of an acoustic shadow phenomenon and/or a&#xD;
      comet-tail artifact into the antrum.14 A typical whoosh sound with gurgling while&#xD;
      auscultating over the epigastrium defines the diagnosis of gastric insufflation by&#xD;
      auscultation method.54&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 3: A comparison of video intubation stylet and video laryngoscope in tracheal&#xD;
      intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomly allocated 1:1:1, stratified by body mass index &gt; 50&#xD;
      kg·m-2, to group 1 (video intubating stylet), group 2 (video laryngoscopy), or group 3&#xD;
      (direct laryngoscopy). Tracheal intubation will be performed by experienced attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologists who have performed at least 100 cases each with Trachway® video intubating&#xD;
      stylet, GlideScope® video laryngoscopy, and Macintosh direct laryngoscopy. The&#xD;
      anesthesiologist performing tracheal intubation is blinded to all preoperative evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group 1, a tracheal tube (ConvaTec, Berkshire, England, UK) in appropriate sizes is&#xD;
      preloaded over the Trachway® video intubating stylet (TVI-4050, Markstein Sichtec Medical&#xD;
      Corp, Taichung, Taiwan), which is introduced into oral cavity to visualize the epiglottis and&#xD;
      guided to glottis via a monitor after full neuromuscular blockade is achieved. In group 2, a&#xD;
      tracheal tube is preloaded over a GlideRite® stylet, which is specifically designed to work&#xD;
      with GlideScope® video laryngoscope (Verathon Medical, Bothell, WA, USA). GlideScope® blade&#xD;
      size 3 (GS-3) or 4 (GS-4) is used in all participants. In group 3, tracheal tubes are&#xD;
      prepared with a hockey stick-shaped stylet, and direct laryngoscopy is performed using a&#xD;
      size-3 or -4 Macintosh blade (Rüsch Inc., Duluth, GA, USA). In all participants, backward,&#xD;
      upward, and rightward pressure on the larynx and Sellick maneuvers are allowable to obtain&#xD;
      the best glottic view.55,56 If the initial intubation attempt fails or is terminated for&#xD;
      desaturation (defined as SpO2 &lt; 92%) or need to change the patient's position, the intubation&#xD;
      device will be removed, and manual bag mask ventilation will be performed. Intubation failure&#xD;
      is defined as more than three intubation attempts or need to change intubation devices. Any&#xD;
      intubation rescue techniques will be used at the discretion of the staff anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is the best glottis visualization, graded according to Cormack and Lehane's&#xD;
      classification with external laryngeal pressure applied.57 Glottic views graded as III or IV&#xD;
      are regarded as difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 4: An investigation of the putative benefits of goal-directed hemodynamic therapy&#xD;
      targeting cardiac index in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the operation room, the investigators will apply the Masimo Radical 7 pulse oximetry&#xD;
      (Masimo Corp., Irvine, CA, USA) to the fingers of all enrolled patients to measure perfusion&#xD;
      index and SpO2 throughout the surgery. After the placement of a tracheal tube, patients will&#xD;
      receive ventilator support with the tidal volume 6-8 ml·kg-1 ideal body weight, a respiratory&#xD;
      rate of 10-15 min-1 and PEEP 5 cmH2O applied by the ventilator.60 The FiO2 will be set at&#xD;
      0.3-0.7 to maintain SpO2 ≥ 98% throughout the surgery. Each patient will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to one of each of the following two groups: goal-directed hemodynamic therapy and&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, intraoperative maintenance rate of crystalloid fluids is 3 ml·kg-1·hr-1 ideal&#xD;
      body weight. ProAQT®-derived hemodynamic data and peripheral perfusion index and SpO2 will be&#xD;
      acquired at the following time points: 5 min after induction of anesthesia, 5 min after start&#xD;
      of pneumoperitoneum and head-up tilting, 5 min after end of pneumoperitoneum, cessation of&#xD;
      volatile anesthetics, and 5 min after extubation. Subjects of the GDHT group will be managed&#xD;
      according to the ERAS algorithm utilizing ProAQT® parameters to maintain the cardiac index ≥&#xD;
      2.5 l·min-1·m-2.61 In brief, if cardiac index &lt; 2.5 l·min-1·m-2, a bolus of 150 ml of&#xD;
      crystalloid fluid will be given until the stroke volume variation is &lt; 10%. If cardiac index&#xD;
      &lt; 2.5 l·min-1·m-2 despite the stroke volume variation of ≥ 10% following fluid challenge,&#xD;
      continuous intravenous infusion of dopamine 5-10 μg·kg-1·min-1 will be administered. If mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure is &lt; 70 mmHg despite cardiac index ≥ 2.5 l·min-1·m-2, intravenous infusion&#xD;
      of norepinephrine 2-10 μg·min-1 will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects allocated to the control group are hemodynamically managed as per anesthesiologist&#xD;
      preference. Typically, isolated hypotension (20% decrease in mean arterial pressure below&#xD;
      baseline or &lt; 60 mmHg) is treated by single or consecutive boluses of norepinephrine 5 or 10&#xD;
      μg. If hypotension persists, repeat boluses of ephedrine 4 mg will be administered until mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure is above 60 mmHg. If hypotension is accompanied by signs of hypovolemia&#xD;
      (urine output &lt; 0.5 ml·kg-1·hr-1 and/or an increase in heart rate &gt; 20% above baseline),&#xD;
      crystalloid or colloid fluids will be given until urine output and/or heart rate are&#xD;
      normalized. If hypotension persists despite volume challenge, norepinephrine will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, the fluid, inotrope, and vasopressor responsiveness, ProAQT® parameters&#xD;
      (cardiac index, stroke volume variation, systemic vascular resistance, and mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure), and the signals of pulse oximetry (perfusion index and SpO2) will be evaluated and&#xD;
      recorded for each 15-min interval throughout the surgery. In control group, the ProAQT®&#xD;
      monitoring will be concealed from the anesthetist in charge. Artifact-free signals are&#xD;
      considered valid for statistical analysis. At the end of surgery, all participants will&#xD;
      receive a manual recruitment maneuver of 30 to 40 cmH2O for 10 s three times. In all&#xD;
      patients, cessation of volatile anesthetics will be timed to facilitate early awakening after&#xD;
      wound closure. All patients will be decurarized from rocuronium-induced neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockade with sugammadex dosed at 2 mg·kg-1 ideal body weight + 40%.62 Primary outcome is a&#xD;
      composite of major complications according to the European Perioperative Clinical Outcome&#xD;
      definitions within 30 days after surgery, including myocardial ischemia or infarction,&#xD;
      arrhythmia, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, anastomotic breakdown, surgical&#xD;
      site infection, and hospital-acquired pneumonia.63&#xD;

If hypotension persists, repeat boluses of ephedrine 4 mg will be administered until mean arterial pressure is above 60 mmHg. If hypotension is accompanied by signs of hypovolemia (urine output &lt; 0.5 ml·kg-1·hr-1 and/or an increase in heart rate &gt; 20% above baseline), crystalloid or colloid fluids will be given until urine output and/or heart rate are normalized. If hypotension persists despite volume challenge, norepinephrine will be used.</description>

    <description>A two-handed head-tilt jaw-thrust maneuver will be performed to establish an open airway. Once apnea determined by end-tidal capnography occurs, a mechanical ventilation with the assigned peak inspiratory pressure will be initiated. The pressure-controlled mode will be used with an inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio of 1:2 and no positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), at a frequency of 15 breath·min-1 and with 100% oxygen, by the ventilator (Carestation 620, Datex-Ohmeda, Inc., Madison, WI, USA).</description>

    <intervention_name>Tracheal intubation using video intubating stylet, video laryngoscopy, or direct laryngoscopy</intervention_name>
    <description>In video intubating stylet group, a tracheal tube (ConvaTec, Berkshire, England, UK) in appropriate sizes is preloaded over the Trachway® video intubating stylet (TVI-4050, Markstein Sichtec Medical Corp, Taichung, Taiwan), which is introduced into oral cavity to visualize the epiglottis and guided to glottis via a monitor after full neuromuscular blockade is achieved. In video laryngoscopy group, a tracheal tube is preloaded over a GlideRite® stylet, which is specifically designed to work with GlideScope® video laryngoscope (Verathon Medical, Bothell, WA, USA). GlideScope® blade size 3 (GS-3) or 4 (GS-4) is used in all patients. In direct laryngoscopy group, tracheal tubes are prepared with a hockey stick-shaped stylet, and direct laryngoscopy is performed using a size-3 or -4 Macintosh blade (Rüsch Inc., Duluth, GA, USA).</description>

    <intervention_name>Goal-directed hemodynamic therapy targeting cardiac index</intervention_name>
    <description>Subjects of the GDHT group will be managed according to the ERAS algorithm utilizing ProAQT® parameters to maintain the cardiac index ≥ 2.5 l·min-1·m-2. In brief, if cardiac index &lt; 2.5 l·min-1·m-2, a bolus of 150 ml of crystalloid fluid will be given until the stroke volume variation is &lt; 10%. If cardiac index &lt; 2.5 l·min-1·m-2 despite the stroke volume variation of ≥ 10% following fluid challenge, continuous intravenous infusion of dopamine 5-10 μg·kg-1·min-1 will be administered. If mean arterial pressure is &lt; 70 mmHg despite cardiac index ≥ 2.5 l·min-1·m-2, intravenous infusion of norepinephrine 2-10 μg·min-1 will be used.</description>
