  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the registry is to collect data on the performance of the focused ultrasound&#xD;
      (FUS) technology and health outcomes. A wide variety of approaches exist for using FUS on&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer patients, and the primary goal is to capture this broad spectrum of&#xD;
      approaches and their impact on patients overall health. This information will help provide a&#xD;
      better understanding of current care, and may possibly direct further, more specific&#xD;
      investigations that will follow this registry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-group, multi-center, observational log-in study. Patients will be screened&#xD;
      for clinically diagnosed pancreatic cancer and are scheduled to receive focused ultrasound&#xD;
      therapy at National Taiwan University Hospital to determine their eligibility for&#xD;
      participation. After confirming that the patient has agreed, the patient will be followed up&#xD;
      for 12 months to observe safety, tumor response, changes in clinical manifestations, and&#xD;
      changes in the process of focused ultrasound treatment and quality of life after treatment.&#xD;
      The overall survival and disease progression time will be tracked within 3 days before and&#xD;
      after the 7th day of focused ultrasound treatment to death or 12 months, with the earlier&#xD;
      occurrence being the priority. The patient's survival status will be tracked for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical condition will be evaluated by laboratory tests during the baseline screening,&#xD;
      the next day after treatment, and 7 days, 14 days, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and&#xD;
      12 months. Including blood tests, serum biochemical tests, tumor indicators, etc.; quality of&#xD;
      life assessment, including pain index score (VAS) and SF-36 life scale (The MOS item&#xD;
      short-form health survey, SF-36) will be one after treatment Evaluation starts in the&#xD;
      following month; MRI imaging examination, all examinations, and treatments have been carried&#xD;
      out in the 201701032DIPD clinical trial case. This case is only an observational clinical&#xD;
      trial case for data registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline screening before treatment will be carried out between the -3 days and the 0&#xD;
      days before the treatment. The overall survival time (OS) will be tracked for 1 year; the&#xD;
      time to disease progression (TTP) and progression-free survival (PFS) will continue to be&#xD;
      tracked during the trial until the patient dies or undergoes other curative procedures&#xD;
      (tracking should be carried out every 3 months) once). Concomitant drugs/treatments and&#xD;
      adverse events will be tracked continuously during the trial period.&#xD;

        The registry will be implemented at approximately 10 sites internationally. In order to&#xD;
        achieve the target registry population of 30 participants over 12 months in the NTUH site,&#xD;
        participants who receive focused ultrasound for pancreatic cancer. Participant enrollment&#xD;
        will be evaluated on a site by site basis throughout the enrollment period to provide&#xD;
        diversity of participant and system representation.&#xD;
