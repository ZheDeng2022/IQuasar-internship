    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2 study evaluating FOR46 in combination with enzalutamide in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after prior progression on&#xD;
      abiraterone. FOR46 is designed to target and bind to CD46, a transmembrane cellular protein&#xD;
      expressed at moderate or high levels in numerous cancer types. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the combination of FOR46 plus enzalutamide will achieve a clinically significant&#xD;
      composite response rate with sufficient durability of response in mCRPC patients.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      FOR46 in combination with enzalutamide in patients with mCRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the composite response rate of FOR46 plus enzalutamide, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Decline in serum PSA &gt;= 50% (PSA50) from baseline, confirmed by repeat measurement at&#xD;
           least 4 weeks later, and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1&#xD;
           criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b and Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the PSA50 response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the objective response rate by RECIST 1.1 criteria among patients with&#xD;
      measurable soft tissue by RECIST 1.1 criteria at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the median duration of objective response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIII. To determine the median time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression by Prostate&#xD;
      Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the median radiographic progression-free survival by PCWG3 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the median overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To determine the safety of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may continue study treatment from the time of treatment initiation until&#xD;
      confirmed radiographic disease progression per PCWG3 / RECIST 1.1 criteria, unequivocal&#xD;
      clinical progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for overall survival every 90 days (+/- 30 days) from last dose of&#xD;
      study treatment, until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first.&#xD;
