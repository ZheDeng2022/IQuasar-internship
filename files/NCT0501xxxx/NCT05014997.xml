  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that the frequency of cardiometabolic diseases are increased in patients&#xD;
      with Klinefelter Syndrome. The triglyceride-glucose index (TyG index) is a simple surrogate&#xD;
      marker of insulin resistance and is also associated with various cardiometabolic diseases.&#xD;
      The aim of this study to investigate the TyG index levels and its relationship with insulin&#xD;
      resistance and endothelial dysfunction in patients with KS.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From the patient database of our Endocrinology department we randomly included a total of 30&#xD;
      patients with KS and 32 healthy controls in the study. All the recorded data in the database&#xD;
      were registered under the approval of Local Ethical Committee of Gulhane School of Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical and laboratory parameters, TyG index, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA),&#xD;
      homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and high-sensitivity C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (hs-CRP) levels were gathered from the database and the triglyceride-glucose index&#xD;
      was calculated by the help of pre-measured laboratory parameters.&#xD;
