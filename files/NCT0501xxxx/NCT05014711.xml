  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To verify whether remifentanil is more beneficial to reduce the duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, shorten the interval from SBT to extubation, reduce the incidence of adverse&#xD;
      events, reduce the workload of nursing staff, reduce the dosage of sedatives and ICU&#xD;
      hospitalization costs, shorten the length of ICU hospitalization, and reduce the short-term&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioids are widely used for analgesia in the ICU, of which, fentanyl and remifentanil are the&#xD;
      most commonly used. Compared with the two analgesics, fentanyl is relatively cheap, but it is&#xD;
      metabolised by liver. Long-term infusion makes its half-life extended, and side effects&#xD;
      increase significantly. Respiratory depression is the most serious side effect and may lead&#xD;
      to re-intubation and even sudden death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remifentanil is a strong selective μ-opioid receptor agonist, rapidly metabolized by&#xD;
      non-specific plasma and tissue esterases into inactive metabolites; it has very short&#xD;
      context-sensitive half-life even after prolonged infusion or in patients with organ failure.&#xD;
      Remifentanil is easy to titrate and provides excellent analgesia: it allows higher doses&#xD;
      administration than are normally used with traditional opioids without concerns about&#xD;
      accumulation or delayed recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feature is helpful for patients with mechanical ventilation to weaning and extubate&#xD;
      early. Previous studies comparing the two drugs mainly focus on short-term postoperative&#xD;
      application, and theoretically long-term use can better reflect the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      advantages of Remifentanil. So we designed this study.&#xD;
