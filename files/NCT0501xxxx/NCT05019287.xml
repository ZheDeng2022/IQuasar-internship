    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), severe cases of COVID-19 infection will be treated&#xD;
      with secretome of menstrual blood stem cells. The improvement in the clinical, laboratory and&#xD;
      radiological manifestations will be evaluated in treated patients compared with the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The devastating effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS COV-2)&#xD;
      infection is caused by a robust cytokine storm that leads to lung tissue damage. Several&#xD;
      studies have found that the severity of the disease is correlated with the release of&#xD;
      excessive proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-γ, and TNF-α,&#xD;
      preferentially targeting lung tissue. This finding was confirmed by the high level of plasma&#xD;
      cytokines found in the most severe COVID-19 patients associated with extensive lung damage.&#xD;
      As a result, it is essential to find an effective treatment option to control the devastating&#xD;
      cytokine storm of COVID-19 and regenerate the damaged lung. Although mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      are a powerful tool for clinical applications, they have limits in terms of administration,&#xD;
      safety, and variability of therapeutic response. It is interesting to note that the MSC&#xD;
      secretome composed of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteins, and extracellular&#xD;
      vesicles could be a valid alternative to their use. It is not only easier to preserve,&#xD;
      transfer and produce the secretome, but also safer to administer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies reported that the hypoxic condition of MSCs could enhance the release of&#xD;
      their active soluble molecules known as Secretome-MSCs (S-MSCs), such as IL-10 and TGF-β that&#xD;
      useful in alleviating inflammation. Moreover, they could also increase the expression of&#xD;
      growth factors such as VEGF and PDGF that accelerate lung injury improvement. These active&#xD;
      molecules could potentially serve as a biological therapeutic agent for treating the severe&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to recent studies, we successfully isolated the S-MSCs from&#xD;
      their culture medium using tangential flow filtration (TFF) strategy with several molecular&#xD;
      weight cut-off category. This study investigated the clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19&#xD;
      patients with several comorbidities treated with S-MSCs in Indonesia.&#xD;
