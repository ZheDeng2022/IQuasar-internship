  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the growing research on Benign Paroxysmal Positioning Vertigo (BPPV), the impact and&#xD;
      treatment efficacy on balance, physical activity (and consequently) frailty in elderly is&#xD;
      lacking. Also, the added value of the video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) in this population has&#xD;
      never been studied before. With insights gained from this research, we hope to contribute to&#xD;
      an efficient treatment of BPPV in this growing population and to minimize its impact and&#xD;
      healthcare burden.&#xD;

    <measure>The mini Balance Evalutation System test (miniBEStest)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The MiniBEStest is a 14-item test that measures 4 different balance control systems: anticipatory postural adjustments, reactive postural control, sensory orientation and dynamic gait. Items are scored on a 3-level ordinal scale.&#xD;
The CTSIB is used to assess sensory contributions to postural control during 6 sensory conditions: stand on firm surface with eyes open, stand on foam surface with eyes open, stand on firm surface with visual conflict dome, stand on foam surface with visual conflict dome, stand on firm surface with eyes closed and stand on foam surface with eyes closed.</description>
