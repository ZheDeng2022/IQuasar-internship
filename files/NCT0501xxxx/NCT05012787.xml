      This study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the investigational CpG&#xD;
      1018/Alum-adjuvanted recombinant SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S-protein subunit vaccine (SCB 2019)&#xD;
      compared with control. Approximately 300 study participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA),&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) will be&#xD;
      randomized according a 1:1 ratio to receive SCB-2019 or control vaccine.&#xD;
