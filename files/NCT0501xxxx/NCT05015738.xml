  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19, a global epidemic that affects the world, has created significant changes in many&#xD;
      areas, especially in the health system. One of the most affected areas is nursing education.&#xD;
      The content of nursing education focuses on cognitive, psychomotor and affective areas. In&#xD;
      order for nursing education to be successful, important initiatives should be provided in the&#xD;
      education of these areas. However, difficulties were encountered in the distance education&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted to evaluate the delivery of diabetes education in nursing with&#xD;
      animation and gamification.&#xD;

      This study was conducted with a randomized-controlled experimental design. This study was&#xD;
      conducted between October and November 2020 in the Department of Nursing at the Faculty of&#xD;
      Health Sciences in Turkey. The inclusion criteria were as follows: being 18 years old or&#xD;
      over, studying in the second year, volunteering to take a diabetes course, not attending any&#xD;
      course for diabetes before, have a remote access tool (internet connection, personel comuter&#xD;
      eg.), not to be absent on the date when the data of the research will be collected. The&#xD;
      second-year nursing students were selected for the study since participants have not taken&#xD;
      diabetes nursing courses before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the randomization part of the study, the students were assigned to the experiment (n=35)&#xD;
      and control (n=35) groups according to their number in the class list using the random&#xD;
      numbers table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were callacted with &quot;Structured Student Identification Form&quot;, &quot;Diabete Nursing Knowledge&#xD;
      Test&quot;, &quot;Instructional Materials Motivation Survey&quot; and &quot; Opinion Form on Diabetes Education&#xD;
      Program supported by digital tools&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Diabetes Nursing course is 2 hours per week fow 10 week. After students were assigned to&#xD;
      groups with randomization, the application process of the research was explained to the&#xD;
      students. The control group was taught with the traditional method and the experimental group&#xD;
      was taught with learning activities based on animation and gamification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct lecture, question-answer teaching methods were used through Microsoft Power Point&#xD;
      presentation to the control group of Diabetes Nursing course. At the end of the lesson,&#xD;
      &quot;Diabete Nursing Knowledge Test&quot; and &quot;Instructional Materials Motivation Survey&quot; were used in&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An animated video was watched at the beginning of each lesson in the experimental group.&#xD;
      Later, lecture and question-answer teaching methods were used through Microsoft Power Point&#xD;
      presentation. At the end of each lesson, Web 2.0 (Kahoot) application was used to reinforce&#xD;
      students' knowledge.At the end of the lesson, &quot;Diabete Nursing Knowledge Test&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;Instructional Materials Motivation Survey&quot; and &quot; Opinion Form on Diabetes Education Program&#xD;
      supported by digital tools&quot;were used in intervention group.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study was conducted between Octorber and November 2020 on 70 volunteer students studying in the Department of Nursing at the Faculty of Health Sciences in Turkey. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) being 18 years old or over, (b) studying in the second year, (c) volunteering to take a diabetes course (d) not attending any course for diabetes before e) have a smart phone f) no internet connection problem g) not to be absent on the date when the data of the research will be collected. The second-year nursing students were selected for the study since they have not taken diabetes courses before. The students included in the study were randomly divided into two groups.The control group was taught with the traditional method and the experimental group was taught with learning activities based on animation and gamification.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The scale was prepared in a 5-point Likert type, 36 items. The highest score that can be obtained from the entire scale is 165, and the lowest score is 33. The increase in the score obtained from the scale is interpreted as an increase in the motivation towards the teaching material.</description>

    <description>The subjects and activities were applied to the control group, who received traditional diabetes education, between 8:00 and 10:00 with the classical method, which lasted 2 hours, for 10 weeks. The training was completed by the researcher with the verbal narration method. &quot;Diabetes Achievement Assessment Test&quot; with question and answer method was administered to the students at the beginning and end of the application. These questions were the same questions asked to the experimental group. Interaction of groups with each other was limited. Students were informed about this and their consent was taken.At the end of the course, students' opinions were taken through the form developed by the researchers. Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) was used to measure to student' motivation levels.</description>

    <description>The subjects included in the course content were given between 10:00-12:00 with the animation supported method, which lasted for 2 hours. The animations were created by the researchers to reflect all guidelines for diabetes. The scenario of the animation video was prepared in line with the training content. Storyboards in videos and animations were created with the collaboration of researchers and experts in their fields (software specialists, computer programmers). The animation video was voiced in Turkish by a professional actor. Animations are 2 minutes each and a total of 18 minutes long. The 'Kahoot' application, a Web 2.0 tool, was used to apply Diabetes Achievement Evaluation Test. At the end of the course, students' opinions were taken through the form developed by the researchers. Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) was used to measure to student' motivation levels.</description>
