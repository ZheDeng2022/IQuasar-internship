      This study was conducted in the University Malaya Medical Centre. The study design was a&#xD;
      parallel-group, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. The trial will be registered at&#xD;
      the Clinical Trials registry and was conducted in accordance to the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
      The investigators recruited patients by screening patients under the care of the palliative&#xD;
      care team at University Malaya Medical Centre. Patients fulfilling the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be approached and included in the study if give informed consent to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage III and IV cancer patients aged 18 years and above&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The overall suffering score of 4/10 and above based on The Suffering Pictogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are confused based on The Confusion Assessment scoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are non-communicative verbally&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with psychiatric illness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were eligible were informed about the nature of the study. The study was&#xD;
      voluntary and patients could withdraw from the study at any time. Patients who were&#xD;
      interested to participate was randomly allocated to either the intervention group (MBST) or&#xD;
      the control group (supportive listening) based on computer generated random numbers.&#xD;
      Allocation concealment will be performed using sealed envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group received a 30-minute MBST session by a palliative care&#xD;
      physician trained in mindfulness practice. The MBST consisted of a session that involvesd&#xD;
      interviewing patients with open-ended questions on suffering experiences. During the session,&#xD;
      the practitioner practiced mindful breathing simultaneously while listening to patients. The&#xD;
      practitioner acknowledged the distress of patients when it was appropriate, but without&#xD;
      losing their attention on mindful breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control group received a 30-minute supportive listening session by a&#xD;
      palliative care physician who has no experience in mindfulness practice. The session involves&#xD;
      interviewing patients with the same open-ended questions on suffering experiences. The&#xD;
      practitioner acknowledged the distress of patients when it was appropriate. Outcomes will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline and at minute 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes (patients): Suffering was measured using the Suffering Pictogram. It is a&#xD;
      brief and validated instrument used to measure the experience of suffering in palliative&#xD;
      care. Patients were required to rate overall suffering at the centre of the pictogram with a&#xD;
      numerical scale of 0 to 10 (0 = no suffering, 10 = worst possible suffering). The pictogram&#xD;
      contains eight items rated on a Likert scale - discomfort, worry, fear, anger, sadness,&#xD;
      hopelessness, difficulty in acceptance and emptiness. The total suffering score of the eight&#xD;
      items ranged from 0 to 32, with higher score reflecting more suffering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological distress was examined using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).&#xD;
      The HADS consisted of 14 items rated on a Likert scale yielding a score of total score&#xD;
      (0-42), an anxiety score (0-21) and a depression score (0-21), with higher score reflecting&#xD;
      higher distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life (QOL) was assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy&#xD;
      (FACIT-Sp). It contained 39 items (range from 0 to 4, with higher scores reflecting higher&#xD;
      QOL) forming an overall total score and five subscales scores: physical, social, emotional,&#xD;
      functional and spiritual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's perception of practitioner empathic engagement was measured with the Jefferson&#xD;
      Scale of Patient's Perceptions of Physician Empathy. It was a 5-item instrument (range from 1&#xD;
      to 5, with higher scores reflecting a greater degree of physician's empathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes (practitioners): Secondary outcomes were measured by the Perceived Stress&#xD;
      Scale (PSS) and the Frieburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI).&#xD;
