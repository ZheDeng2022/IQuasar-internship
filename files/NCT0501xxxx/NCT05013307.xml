    <textblock>
      The Clinical Assessment for Sports Exertion (CASE) addresses the physical performance of&#xD;
      athletes by quantifying physiological and symptomatic responses to dynamic exertion. The CASE&#xD;
      is highly sport-specific as it tests multiple body positions that mimic requirements typical&#xD;
      of individual and contact sports activities including soccer, gymnastics, cheerleading,&#xD;
      swimming, and basketball. It was developed by clinicians at the Baylor Scott and White Sports&#xD;
      Concussion Program in an effort to identify specific system impairments in athletes who were&#xD;
      unable to successfully demonstrate readiness for return to play protocols. Like the other&#xD;
      published forms of concussion exertion testing described above, the CASE is a provocative&#xD;
      exercise test that may also prove to be useful in making informed return-to-play decisions&#xD;
      based upon the athlete's symptomatology.&#xD;

    <description>In this prospective study the investigators aim to quantify participants' responses to physical activity and cognitive testing. Participants will be asked to undergo cognitive testing prior to engaging in physical activity, to identify any provocation of symptoms in adolescents ranging from ages 10 to 22 years. Responses to physical activity will be measured through metabolic testing (heart rate reserve and relative VO2 max) and physiologic markers (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, rate of perceived exertion, dyspnea). Additionally, participants will be monitored for any changes in symptoms that occur during or after physical activity as measured by the modified PCSS symptom inventory.</description>

    <description>Cognitive testing will be completed on iPad. Across all tasks, users are instructed to respond to visual and audial stimuli by touching the screen in the correct location within preset time constraints. The assessment will consist of seven tasks designed to measure core cognitive function.&#xD;
