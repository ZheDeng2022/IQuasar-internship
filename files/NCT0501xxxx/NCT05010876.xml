  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of human C1 inhibitor,&#xD;
      administered alone or in combination with icatibant (a specific bradykinin B2 receptor&#xD;
      antagonist) on the pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 infections.&#xD;

      Prospective, prospective, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, multi-centre study of three&#xD;
      parallel groups of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (n=15): standard of care + C1 inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (n=15): standard care + icatibant + C1 inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 (n=15): standard support + placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 4-day (96-hour) therapeutic part during which the patient will be evaluated nine times&#xD;
           (H0, H4, H12, H24, H36, H48, H60, H72 and H96).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A follow-up part of 6 days with at least two assessments (D7 and D10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum duration of patient participation in the study will be 10 days.&#xD;
