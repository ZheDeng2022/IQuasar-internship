  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol focuses on Phase 1 of a planned two-phase research project. Phase 1 aims to&#xD;
      test and adapt a prototype ASTHMAXcelED application for the ED. Phase 2 will be an RCT to&#xD;
      test the efficacy of a refined ASTHMAXcelED app after being modified based on the results of&#xD;
      Phase 1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The original ASTHMAxcel app was developed by Dr. Jariwala, which delivers asthma education&#xD;
      and promotes patients' adherence to the national asthma guidelines. The app was developed in&#xD;
      accordance with Montefiore Medical Center's regulatory/compliance (determined by the&#xD;
      Montefiore Legal department and Einstein-Montefiore Office of Biotechnology) and security&#xD;
      (determined by Montefiore IT) policies. Over the last several years the app has been&#xD;
      iteratively improved based on patient feedback and has been shown to improve asthma&#xD;
      knowledge, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life among asthma clinic patients.&#xD;
      This version of the app has been tailored to the ED, requiring less physician directed&#xD;
      education and focusing on common triggers and symptom management. Research associates will&#xD;
      ask each patient to download the ASTHMAXcelED app and RA's instruct them on use of the&#xD;
      application. RA's will also show every patient a video using the ASTHMAXcelED mobile&#xD;
      application in which the investigators demonstrate correct use of an inhaler and discuss&#xD;
      asthma triggers.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Recall over 2 week period</time_frame>
    <description>Based on the 32 item AQLQ, the mini AQLQ is a 15-item self-administered tool constructed to meet the efficiency needs of large-scale clinical trials. The instrument was constructed for adults, and shown to have good reliability, responsiveness, construct and criterion validity. It captures functional impairments most relevant to adult asthma patients over a 2 week recall period. The tool is scored on a 7 point Likert scale, with increasing values corresponding with worsening quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unified Theory of Acceptance and use of Technology</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 4 weeks after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>UTAUT explains user intention and behavior regarding the adoption of new technology. It explains user interaction using 4 domains: 1) performance expectancy, 2) effort expectancy, 3) social influence, and 4) facilitating conditions. The model explained 70% of the variance in Behavioral Intention to Use (BI) and about 50% in actual use, and has been validated against eight similar models and across nine culturally diverse nations.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Open Ended Questions for ASTHMAXcelED Application Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 4 weeks after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>In order to iteratively improve the app and develop themes regarding user adoption, participants will be asked the following open ended questions and their answers transcribed in their entirety.&#xD;
How do you feel about using the app? Have you run into any issues using the app? Is it getting easier/harder to use the app over time? Which app features do you like? Which app features do you dislike? Which app features do you find difficult to use? How can the app be improved?</description>
