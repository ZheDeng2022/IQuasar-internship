  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-carbohydrate diets are often used as weight-loss strategies by obese individuals and&#xD;
      athletes. This diet has effects on oxidizing fat and suppressing appetite. But short term&#xD;
      evidences are still few. In combat sports such as taekwondo, athletes prefer rapid weight&#xD;
      loss to achieve a desired weight category. The purpose of this study was to investigate the&#xD;
      impact of the low carbohydrate diet combined with strict calorie restriction on body&#xD;
      composition and exercise performance in taekwondo athletes.&#xD;

      This study used a randomized cross-over design. Each participant completed a low carbohydrate&#xD;
      and a high carbohydrate trial in a random order, separated by a 30-day wash-out period. Each&#xD;
      trial comprised of a 7-day weight loss period, followed by an 18-hr recovery period. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 7-day caloric restriction with low- or&#xD;
      high-carbohydrate diet, combined with an 18-hr recovery period, on body weight loss and&#xD;
      taekwondo-specific performance.&#xD;

    <measure>Taekwondo-specific reaction time in seconds assessed by Electromyography (EMG) signals</measure>
    <time_frame>1 min</time_frame>
    <description>The reaction time (sec) was measured before and after weight loss to assess the difference in exercise performance. The participants were asked to make the fist on the left hand as soon as they see a light signal, then start the taekwondo-specific movement. The reaction time was calculated as the time from the beginning of the light signal to the start of electromyography (EMG) signal of the left thenar muscles. The movement was performed 5 times. The average reaction time was used to arrive at one reported value.</description>
