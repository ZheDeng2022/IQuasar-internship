  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine if HCQ in a dose of 400mg daily and&#xD;
      indapamide in a dose of 2.5mg daily can help in reducing the progression of disability in&#xD;
      people with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of participants in this study will be 35. A maximum of 42 people with SPMS will be&#xD;
      included. The trial is funded through internal funding through the University of Calgary.&#xD;
      There is no sponsorship from any pharmaceutical industry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with SPMS, there is ongoing slow and continuous loss of nerve cells, which causes&#xD;
      damage to the brain and spinal cord. This ultimately becomes noticeable as slowly and&#xD;
      continuously worsening disability. While the cause of this ongoing damage is unknown, it&#xD;
      appears that at least part of the damage may be caused by cells in the brain called&#xD;
      &quot;microglia&quot; (a type of immune cell that resides in the brain and spinal cord). These&#xD;
      microglial cells can have beneficial roles, for instance when they clear away debris, but&#xD;
      they can also cause damage to brain cells. In SPMS, microglial cells are often found to be in&#xD;
      a state of activation, and it is currently believed that this constant activation of&#xD;
      microglial cells is likely an important cause of the ongoing damage to brain cells. Another&#xD;
      harmful process affecting patients with SPMS is &quot;oxidative stress&quot;. Oxidative stress occurs&#xD;
      when immune cells in the brain and spinal cord are activated and produce substances that may&#xD;
      damage nerve cells.Current treatments for MS mostly are meant to prevent relapses and are&#xD;
      beneficial in relapsing-remitting MS, but so far there are no treatments that benefit people&#xD;
      with SPMS who do not experience relapses. We need better therapies for SPMS, and we believe&#xD;
      that treatments that reduce the activation of microglial cells and oxidative stress may be&#xD;
      useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medication Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) reduces the activity of human microglia in laboratory&#xD;
      experiments. Animal experiments also showed that treatment with HCQ reduces disease severity&#xD;
      in an animal model of MS. HCQ, therefore, may also reduce the activity of microglia in people&#xD;
      with SPMS, and hopefully prevent or slow down the progression of disability in SPMS. HCQ is&#xD;
      currently approved in Canada to treat malaria and rheumatic diseases Systemic Lupus&#xD;
      Erythematosus (SLE) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). HCQ is available as a tablet that is&#xD;
      usually taken two times per day. Doses up to 600mg per are used in clinical practice, but we&#xD;
      estimate that a dose of only 400mg daily, given as two doses of 200mg, will be sufficient to&#xD;
      decrease the activity of microglia in patients with SPMS. HCQ is usually well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indapamide (IND) is a medication to treat high blood pressure that can reduce oxidative&#xD;
      stress and improve the survival of nerve cells in laboratory studies. IND is currently&#xD;
      approved to treat high blood pressure. IND is available in tablet form and is usually taken&#xD;
      once a day, the most typical dose is 2.5mg. We estimate that a dose of 2.5mg per day will be&#xD;
      sufficient to treat oxidative stress in SPMS. IND is usually well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a MinMax Simon-2-stage design, the study will require 35 patients with a complete&#xD;
      18 month follow-up. Presuming 20% drop-out, the investigators anticipate recruiting up to 42&#xD;
      patients. The trial will be conducted as follows: patients will continuously enter into the&#xD;
      study until 35 patients have completed 18 months of follow-up with at least 75% adherence&#xD;
      which will be measured by study drug count.&#xD;
