  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Executive functions are defined as the mental functions necessary for an individual to adapt&#xD;
      to a complex or new environment that requires freedom from automatic and routine behavior.&#xD;
      Deficits in executive functions are described under the term &quot;dysexecutive syndrome&quot;, and&#xD;
      call into question the quality of social and professional life as well as the autonomy of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual methods of identifying dysexecutive syndrome are based essentially on batteries of&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests known as &quot;paper and pencil&quot;. However, these tests may lack&#xD;
      sensitivity, in that they assess the patient in a very structured setting, very different&#xD;
      from real life conditions, which are full of distractions and choices to be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations on real tasks are more rarely used but have the advantage of observing the&#xD;
      difficulties encountered by a patient in everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two tests of this type have been set up in the Neurology Department of the Hôpital&#xD;
      d'Instruction des Armées Percy, and are integrated into the routine care of patients with a&#xD;
      dysexecutive syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, a room in the department has been set up as a studio in order to reproduce&#xD;
      as much as possible an everyday life environment, in which executive functions, fine motor&#xD;
      skills, neurovegetative functions, emotional state, posture, locomotor skills and visual&#xD;
      information capture can be measured ecologically.&#xD;
