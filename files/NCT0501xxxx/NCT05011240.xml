  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to adverse environments such as socioeconomic disadvantage and psychosocial&#xD;
      deprivation are risk-factors for neurodevelopmental problems in childhood. Children exposed&#xD;
      to such environments may benefit from interventions that target social-communication&#xD;
      abilities, since these skills act as protective factors for healthy neurodevelopment in&#xD;
      vulnerable children. One early childhood intervention that has shown efficacy in improving&#xD;
      early social-communication development is Paediatric Autism Communication Therapy (PACT).&#xD;
      However, there are no studies testing the efficacy of PACT in Latin American countries where&#xD;
      environmental risk factors are common. This randomized controlled trial will test the&#xD;
      efficacy of PACT in improving social-communication development in young children at risk for&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental difficulties due to living in socio-economically disadvantaged regions of&#xD;
      São Paulo, Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Participants will be 160 children aged 2 years 0 months to 4 years 11 months with&#xD;
      low social-communication abilities and their primary caregivers. Child-caregiver dyads will&#xD;
      be recruited from public early childhood education centers in impoverished urban regions of&#xD;
      the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Low social-communication abilities will be defined by Standard&#xD;
      Scores &lt;84 on the Socialization and/or Communication domains of the Vineland Adaptive&#xD;
      Behavior Scales. Child-caregiver dyads will be randomized to receive 12 sessions (five&#xD;
      months) of the PACT intervention (N=80) or five months of community support as usual plus&#xD;
      psychoeducation (N=80). The primary outcome (parent-child interaction) and secondary outcomes&#xD;
      (social-communication abilities assessed with the Vineland, neurophysiological activity&#xD;
      during a live social interaction) will be measured pre- and post-intervention. All procedures&#xD;
      will be performed in accordance with the CONSORT declaration for non-pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the Control group will receive psycho-educational support via monthly sessions led by researchers with experience in child development. In each session, a presentation will be delivered to provide parents with information about child development and environmental factors that contribute to healthy child development, including sensitive parenting styles, frequent positive social interactions between parents and children and cognitive stimulation. The presentations will be followed by group discussions. Children will also continue to receive Community Assistance as Usual via their normal early education centers. These centers offer daily activities designed to promote children's learning, autonomy, movement, integration and socialization. Children attend their educational center five days per week between the hours of 8am and 5pm.</description>

    <description>PACT is a parent-mediated therapy that aims to improve children's social-communication development. During PACT, a therapist uses video-feedback of parent-child play interactions to coach the parent in how to improve their sensitivity and responsiveness to their child's social-communication and interaction behaviours and to implement evidence-based strategies that facilitate social-communication development.</description>
