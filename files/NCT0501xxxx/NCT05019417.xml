      Rationale: Thyroid hormone (TH) is crucial for normal brain development. The transporter&#xD;
      monocarboxlate transporter 8 (MCT8), located at various organs including brain neurons, is&#xD;
      crucial for cellular transport of TH, mainly T3 . A defect in this transporter causes&#xD;
      Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), which characterized by severe motor and cognitive&#xD;
      retardation. Serum TH tests typically show low T4, high T3 and mildly elevated TSH. The&#xD;
      neurological phenotype entails diminished TH transport into the brain. On the other hand,&#xD;
      elevated serum T3 leads to hypermetabolic status in peripheral tissues. Subsequently, AHDS&#xD;
      patients have a low body weight and muscle mass. Currently, no effective treatment is&#xD;
      available. Over the last decade, several studies focused on the effect of T3 analogues, that&#xD;
      their trans-membrane transport is not mediated by MCT8. Two analogues were studied:&#xD;
      Diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) and tetraiodothyroacetic acid (Triac). Both agents have&#xD;
      demonstrated improvement in serum TH levels (mainly T3 and TSH) but no change in the&#xD;
      neurocognitive status of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, several studies have demonstrated that sodium phenylbutyrate (PB) acting as a&#xD;
      chaperon and increase the expression of MCT8 in the cell membrane. Subsequently, cells&#xD;
      transfected with various mutations in MCT8 have shown remarkable improvement in T3 transport&#xD;
      into the cytoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that treatment of AHDS patients with glycerol phenylbutyrate (GPB) will&#xD;
      improve thyroid function and neurodevelopmental parameters and relieve symptoms resulting&#xD;
      from toxic T3 levels in peripheral tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To test safety and efficacy of PB treatment in AHDS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of PB treatment on serum levels of TH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effect of PB on T3-associated hyperthyroid state in peripheral tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effects of PB treatment on the neurodevelopmental status. Study design:&#xD;
           therapeutic prospective trial. Study population: Up to 6 AHDS patients with genetically&#xD;
           proven ADHD. Intervention: all participants will receive an escalating dose of PB in the&#xD;
           form of Glycerol-PB (commercial name Ravicti) until individual serum T3 levels have been&#xD;
           normalized or dose limiting toxicities occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment: 12 months including the wash-out period of 1 month from the current&#xD;
      Triac therapy&#xD;

      1. Introduction and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thyroid hormone (TH) is crucial for the development and metabolic state of virtually all&#xD;
           tissues. TH signaling is regulated at the tissue level by intracellular conversion of&#xD;
           the prohormone thyroxine (T4) to receptor-active 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) or&#xD;
           receptor-inactive 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (rT3) by deiodinases. Since T3 receptors are&#xD;
           located in the nucleus, TH transport across the plasma membrane is required for both TH&#xD;
           metabolism and action. This process is facilitated by TH transporters, the most specific&#xD;
           of which is monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) which is encoded by SLC16A2 gene&#xD;
           located at chromosome X. MCT8 is critical for the transport of TH in a number of&#xD;
           tissues, in particular the brain. Hemizygous mutations of MCT8 in males cause the&#xD;
           Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder that is&#xD;
           accompanied by abnormal TH levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The neurological phenotype is characterized by severe neurodevelopmental retardation&#xD;
           starting at the first few month of life. Initially, AHDS patients also have peripheral&#xD;
           hypotonia but this usually progresses to spastic quadriplegia. Brain MRI of AHDS&#xD;
           patients shows delayed myelination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The remarkable clinical spectrum of AHDS is probably derived from the defect in T3 entry&#xD;
           in MCT8-expressing neurons and, thus, deprivation of TH in specific brain regions. The&#xD;
           endocrine profile of patients with AHDS is characterized by moderately low T4, high T3&#xD;
           (usually more than twice the upper limit) and normal or mildly elevated TSH. The&#xD;
           elevated serum T3 levels are toxic for peripheral tissues in which MCT8 is not important&#xD;
           for TH transport, resulting in hyperthyroid symptoms such as low body weight,&#xD;
           tachycardia, insomnia and muscle wasting. This peripheral phenotype is progressive with&#xD;
           age.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Currently, no effective therapy is available for AHDS patients. Over the last decade,&#xD;
           the main research efforts focused on thyromimetic agents that are not relied on MCT8 but&#xD;
           might enter the central nervous system (CNS) neurons through alternative membrane&#xD;
           transporters. Studies in Mct8 KO mice with the T3 analog 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid&#xD;
           (DITPA) demonstrated T3-like effects in the brain and a decrease in serum T3 levels,&#xD;
           which attenuated the thyrotoxic state of peripheral tissues. It should be emphasized&#xD;
           however that although mice model mimics the thyroid function profile typical to AHDS, it&#xD;
           has normal neurological development. This study prompted a study in 4 AHDS patients.&#xD;
           DITPA treatment normalized the elevated serum levels of T3 and TSH, while T4 and rT3&#xD;
           levels were increased to normal lower range. There was improvement neither in&#xD;
           neurodevelopmental functions nor in peripheral phenotype of the patients. Following the&#xD;
           limited effects of DITPA treatment, an alternative thyromimetic agent was suggested:&#xD;
           tetraiodothyroacetic acid (Triac [Tiratricol,Téatrois]). In a report of multicenter&#xD;
           international studies published in The lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology (2019),&#xD;
           escalating dose schedule of Triac yielded reduced levels of T3 to the normal range and&#xD;
           similar reduction in T4 and TSH. Yet, there no improvement of motor and cognitive skills&#xD;
           was observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Over the last couple of years, a different potential therapeutic approach was suggested,&#xD;
           by using chemical chaperons. The chaperons are molecules that are capable of altering&#xD;
           stability of misfolded proteins and improving trafficking to the cell membrane. Several&#xD;
           in-vitro studies have shown that the chemical chaperon sodium phenylbutyrate (PB) was&#xD;
           able to rescue protein expression and the T3-transport function of various pathogenic&#xD;
           MCT8 mutants. PB is routinely used in patients with urea-cycle disorder aiming at&#xD;
           reducing their hyperammonemia, mainly in the form of glycerol-phenylbutyrate (GPB), a&#xD;
           more palatable version of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators aim to perform a therapeutic study in order to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
           GPB on the abnormal TH profile, the peripheral thyrotoxic effect of TH and the&#xD;
           neurodevelopment status of AHDS patients with MCT8-confirmed mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will determine the effect of GPB on the abnormal TH profile, the peripheral&#xD;
      thyrotoxic effect of TH and the neurodevelopment status of AHDS patients with MCT8-confirmed&#xD;
      mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) To evaluate the effect of GPB treatment on serum levels of T3 and other TH levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effect of GPB on hematological and biochemical parameters in AHDS&#xD;
           patients and to recognize side effects of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effect of GPB on T3-associated hyperthyroid state in peripheral&#xD;
           tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the effects of GPB treatment on the neurodevelopmental status of the&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a therapeutic prospective study in up to 6 AHDS with&#xD;
      genetically-confirmed MCT8 mutation. Subjects will be recruited in our clinic and&#xD;
      collaborating clinics. All participating patients will receive the investigational treatment&#xD;
      glyceol-phenybuturate (GPB) in an individualized dose-escalation scheme for up to 4 months.&#xD;
      There will be no control group or blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Population AHDS patients with genetically-confirmed MCT8 mutations will be recruited in&#xD;
           our clinic (The Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot, Israel)&#xD;
           and collaborating clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inclusion criteria AHDS with characteristic clinical phenotype and with genetically&#xD;
           confirmed mutation in the MCT8 gene SLC16A2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inability to get the study medication GPB per-os (in cases without gastrotstomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Known contra-indication for GPB&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with AHDS but without confirmed mutation in the MCT8 gene&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigational product/treatment Name of the Investigational Medicinal product:&#xD;
           Glycerol phenylbutirate [GPB] (Ravicti oral liquid 1.1 gr/1 ml; manufacturer Horizon&#xD;
           Pharma USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dosage of GPB will follow the dosage in use for children with urea cycle disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The initial dose will be 5.0 gr (4.5 ml)/ meter square divided by three time a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An escalating schedule dose of GPB will be used until normal serum T3 levels are&#xD;
           reached. The dose raising will be stopped if one of the following condition is reaches:&#xD;
           1. Clinically significant side effects 2. Reaching the PAA serum toxic threshold of 500&#xD;
           µg/ml 3. Reaching the maximal dose of GPB that is in use in urea cycle disorder: 12.4 gr&#xD;
           (11.2 ml)/ meter square divided by three times a day. The maximal daily dose should not&#xD;
           be above 19.0 gr (17.5 ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Unlike urea cycle disorder where GPB dose is titrated by the serum ammonia levels, in&#xD;
           AHDS patients ammonia levels are within normal limits, therefore, the titration should&#xD;
           be based on the measurement of PAA in the serum, a derivative of GPB that is associated&#xD;
           with neurotoxicity at high concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Safety profile of GPB Phenylbutirate is a pre-drug that undergoes hydrolysis by&#xD;
           pancreatic lipases into phenylbutiric acid (PBA). Following first phase metabolism in&#xD;
           the liver, PBA undergoes beta-oxidation into phenylacetic acid (PAA), the active&#xD;
           metabolite of the drug. PAA then undergoes conjugation in the liver and the kidney into&#xD;
           phenylacetylglutamin (PAGN) and secreted in the urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sodium phenylbutirate (NaPB) is currently in use for patients with hyperammonemia due to&#xD;
           urea cycle disorders. Unlike sodium phenybutirate, the glycerol phenylbutirate (GPB)&#xD;
           lacks taste and odor and is more palatable, therefore, it is preferred for therapeutic&#xD;
           use. The potency ratio between the two derivatives is: NaPB x 0.86 = GPB. Based on the&#xD;
           wide experience with GPB in children with urea cycle disorder, we will use this product&#xD;
           in the study, with escalating dose that follow the therapeutic range in urea cycle&#xD;
           disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The safety profile was evaluate in healthy adults and in patients with cirrhosis. The&#xD;
           side effects of a single dose of GPB was evaluated in 24 healthy individuals and the&#xD;
           effect of several doses in 8 healthy individuals and 24 patients with cirrhosis. By&#xD;
           comparison to NaPB, the maximal concentrations of the metabolites of GPB were lower and&#xD;
           appeared later. The degradation to PAGN was slower (as measured in urine). The&#xD;
           degradation to PAGN in healthy individuals and patients with cirrhosis was similar. Side&#xD;
           effects that were reported in this study were dizziness, headache and nausea.&#xD;
           Hematological and biochemical parameters (including liver function tests) and&#xD;
           coagulation factors were within normal limits. Similarly, no significant changes were&#xD;
           recorded in the EKG. Since PAA is a GPB derived metabolite with neurotoxic effect, the&#xD;
           toxic level of PAA was calculated and found to be much higher that the maximal serum&#xD;
           concentration of PAA observed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin : rash (10%) Reduced appetite (7%) GI tract: diarrhea (10%), vomiting (7%), abdominal&#xD;
      pain, flatulence, dyspepsia Neurology: Dizziness (10%), headache (10%), weakness (7%)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurotoxicity (dizziness, hypaucusis, dygeusia. These side effects were reported in&#xD;
      association with high levels of PAA in the serum&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced levels of branched-chain amino-acids: leucine, isoleucine, valine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A washout time of at least 4 weeks (without any medication such as Triac, DITPA or TH)&#xD;
           will precede the initiation of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are three clinic visits in the study, over 4 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Initiation visit, 2 months, 4 months (final visit)&#xD;
