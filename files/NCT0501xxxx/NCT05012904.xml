      This study aims to determine whether parental support reduces venipuncture pain and anxiety&#xD;
      in children with cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized controlled trial with parallel groups in which 60 children aged 6-12&#xD;
      diagnosed with cancer were randomly allocated to a parent support group (n = 30) and a&#xD;
      control group (n = 30). Children reported their anxiety using the Children's Fear Scale and&#xD;
      their pain using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale before, during, and after&#xD;
      venipuncture. Children's heart rate and oxygen saturation were measured with a pulse oximeter&#xD;
      before, during, and after venipuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (n = 30): Routine venipuncture procedure was performed on the control group.&#xD;
      From 10 minutes before the procedure until 10 minutes after the procedure, the parent was&#xD;
      present in their child's room but did not participate in the procedure. The standard parent&#xD;
      presence procedure was coordinated by the nurse involved in conducting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent support group (n = 30): From 10 minutes before the procedure until 10 minutes after&#xD;
      the procedure, a parent provided support to their child. To provide support, parents held&#xD;
      children on their laps, holding the extremity from which the blood was drawn, holding the&#xD;
      children's hands, and communicating with their children during the process in the child's&#xD;
      room. The parent support intervention was coordinated by the nurse involved in conducting the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Randomization was done using the closed envelope method. A total of 60 cards, half labeled &quot;parent support&quot; and half &quot;control,&quot; were placed in sealed envelopes by the nurse involved in conducting the study. The children were asked to choose one of these envelopes and placed in the selected group. Children were randomized into two groups: a parent support group (n = 30) and a control group (n = 30).</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>3 MONTHS</time_frame>
    <description>The Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WB-FACES) is used to evaluate the child's pain levels. This scale includes six faces, ranging from 0 (no hurt=very happy) to 10 (hurts worst). As the score obtained from the scale increases, pain tolerance decreases, and the decrease in score increases the tolerance.</description>

    <measure>Children's Fear Scale (CFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 MONTHS</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Fear Scale (CFS) is used to measure the child's anxiety level. The Children's Fear Scale shows five facial expressions that range from a face with a neutral expression (0 = no anxiety) to a frightened face (4 = severe anxiety).</description>

    <time_frame>3 MONTHS</time_frame>
    <description>The heart rate and oxygen saturation values of the children in both groups were measured and recorded by the researcher using a pulse oximeter device one minute before venipuncture, during the procedure, and one minute after venipuncture.</description>
