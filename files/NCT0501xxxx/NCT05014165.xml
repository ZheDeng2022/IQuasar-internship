  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comprehensive mechanistic and epidemiological study to obtain banked cord blood samples&#xD;
      from consecutive childhood leukemia patients enrolled in the COG Project:EveryChild&#xD;
      (APEC14B1) study. Will attempt to backtrack the initiating genomic alteration identified in&#xD;
      the matched diagnostic leukemia sample and molecularly characterize pre-leukemic cells. The&#xD;
      ultimate goal of this research is to pinpoint the cell of origin of leukemogenic alterations&#xD;
      formed in utero, elucidating the etiology of these initiating mutations (as opposed to frank&#xD;
      leukemia), and devising a test for circulating pre-leukemia that can be applied on a&#xD;
      population-wide basis.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1: To obtain stored cord blood and dried bloodspots of pediatric leukemia&#xD;
      patients in Project:EveryChild.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 2: To conduct preliminary backtracking and characterization of ALL- and&#xD;
      AML-typical somatic mutations in cord blood and dried bloodspots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrue patients with ALL and AML who indicate having banked cord blood at birth through the&#xD;
      APEC14B1 intake questionnaire&#xD;

    <description>Determine the prenatal origins across childhood leukemia subtypes, we will perform backtracking experiments using patient-specific ddPCR probes in matched tumor and CB samples from childhood ALL and AML patients in APEC14B1 with available stored CB. To identify the cells of origin of preleukemic alterations across childhood ALL and AML subtypes, we will perform single-cell sequencing analyses in flow-sorted CB cells from patients in which a prenatal lesion has been confirmed by backtracking.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute&#xD;
             myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stored diagnostic pre-treatment samples corresponding to the patient's original&#xD;
             diagnosis of leukemia must be available for request from either the COG Biopathology&#xD;
             Center or a treating institution&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be enrolled on APEC14B1 with consent to future contact and indicate&#xD;
             that cord blood was stored at birth in the APEC14B1 registry intake data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must also have been registered with COG by a North American (limited to&#xD;
             the U.S. and Canada) member institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  â‰¤ 25 years old at the time of original diagnosis with ALL or AML&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be able to understand written and spoken English or Spanish&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must provide their consent/assent, as appropriate, and for patients under&#xD;
             the age of majority at least one parent or legal guardian must provide consent as well&#xD;
