    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 1-Month follow-up (with secondary 2-month follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Two self-report questionnaires were developed to assess psychological and brain influences on pain. The 4-item psychological attribution scale assesses patients' beliefs that their thoughts and feelings and psychological therapy impacts pain, and the 3-item brain attribution scale assesses patient's beliefs that their pain is brain-based. Mean scores will be computed for both scales separately (0-4; higher scores indicating greater belief that pain is a brain-related [brain attribution] construct and that pain is affected by thoughts, feelings, and psychological interventions [psychological attribution])</description>
