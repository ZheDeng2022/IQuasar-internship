  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our aim in this study is to translate the Inflammatory Arthritis Facilitators and Barriers to&#xD;
      Physical Activity (IFAB) Questionnaire which was developed to determine the factors that&#xD;
      facilitate and prevent individuals for physical activity for patients with inflammatory&#xD;
      arthritis into Turkish language. Also, our aim is to evaluate the validity and reliability of&#xD;
      the IFAB Questionnaire in the Turkish population, and to perform a cultural adaptation if&#xD;
      necessary at the same time. Determining the factors that facilitate and prevent individuals&#xD;
      for physical activity interventions with rheumatic diseases and then designing physical&#xD;
      activity programs considering these factors may play an important role in reducing the&#xD;
      symptoms caused by the disease and increasing their quality of life.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Inflammatory Arthritis Barriers and Facilitators to Physical Activity Questionnaire (IFAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The IFAB Questionnaire was developed by Davergne et al. in 2020 and aims to evaluate the factors that facilitate or prevent physical activity in individuals with inflammatory arthritis. The IFAB questionnaire consists of 10 items. Of these 10 items, 4 were identified as potential barriers or facilitators, 3 as only barriers and 3 as only facilitators. The participant is asked to rate how much the item facilitates or prevents from physical activity between 0 and 10, &quot;0&quot; has no effect on physical activity, and &quot;10&quot; has maximum (negative or positive) effect on physical activity. A high score from the questionnaire indicates that the facilitators are at a high level and the barriers are at a low level.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Exercise Benefits or Barriers Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Exercise Benefits and Barriers Scale has been developed by Sechrist et al. and the Turkish validity and reliability studies were conducted by Ortabağ et al. This scale will be used to evaluate criterion validity which evaluates the benefits and barriers of exercise perceived by the individual on a 4-point Likert-type scale with 43 questions. Scoring is performed as barrier score, benefit score and total score. A low score means less perceived barriers to exercise and greater benefits.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The physical activity level reported by the participants will be evaluated with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form questions the time spent walking, moderate and vigorous activities, and sitting with 7 questions. The duration (minutes) and frequency (days) of each activity are questioned. The physical activity levels of the participants will be classified as inactive, minimally active and very active according to the results.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS scale was developed to assess anxiety and depression in individuals without psychiatric illness. Of the 14-item questionnaire, 7 questions assess depression and 7 questions assess anxiety and each response consists of a four-point rating scale (0 to 3); a higher score indicates a worse condition.For each subscale the total score is at most 21.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire evaluates the level of functional disability in patients with rheumatological disease over 20 questions. It determines the level of difficulty of the person during the activities that are most frequently performed in daily life such as dressing, eating, hygiene, walking, sitting up, reaching and grasping. A high score indicates a low level of functionality.</description>
