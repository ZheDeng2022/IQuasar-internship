  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) is a rare cancer of the nasal cavity. At diagnosis, it is&#xD;
      usually locally advanced. It tends to spread to the neck. Sometimes it spreads to the lungs&#xD;
      and bones. Researchers want to find a better way to treat it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if giving immunotherapy drug bintrafusp alfa can help ONB shrink or disappear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People aged 18 years and older diagnosed with recurrent or metastatic ONB that has not&#xD;
      responded to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, blood and urine tests, and physical&#xD;
      exam. Their ability to perform their normal activities will be assessed. They will have an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram to evaluate their heart. They will have imaging scans and/or a nuclear bone&#xD;
      scan, as needed. For some scans, they may receive a contrast dye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some screening tests will be repeated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive bintrafusp alfa once every 2 weeks for 26 doses. They will get it&#xD;
      intravenously over 60 minutes. They may get other medicines to prevent side effects. They&#xD;
      will complete health questionnaires. Visits will last 4-6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have optional tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an end of treatment visit within 7 days after they stop taking the&#xD;
      study drug. About 28 days after treatment ends, they will have a safety visit. They will have&#xD;
      follow-up visits every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months for years 2-5, and&#xD;
      then once a year after that for the rest of their life. If their disease progresses, they may&#xD;
      be eligible for re-treatment with the study drug&#xD;

      PRECIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB, also known as esthesioneuroblastoma), is a rare malignant&#xD;
      neoplasm of the nasal cavity. At diagnosis, ONB is often locally advanced. It tends to invade&#xD;
      locally and has high rates of regional spread to the neck, and distally to the lungs and&#xD;
      bones. The 10-year survival rate for ONB is reported at 46%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care treatment is surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation. In advanced&#xD;
      unresectable or metastatic cases, systemic chemotherapy is used off label, with agent&#xD;
      selection based on published case series. Genomic profiling of ONB has not yet informed the&#xD;
      utilization of an appropriate molecularly targeted treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry was shown in ONB tumor samples, providing a&#xD;
      rationale for immune checkpoint blockade in ONB. In addition, high expression of transforming&#xD;
      growth factor beta (TGF-beta) ligands has been identified in ONB, implying that additional&#xD;
      benefit may be achieved by combination of checkpoint blockade with TGF-beta inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bintrafusp alfa is a novel bifunctional fusion protein composed of a blocking monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody against PD-L1 fused with the soluble extracellular domain of the human TGF-beta&#xD;
      receptor II (TGF-betaRII), acting as a decoy target for TGF-beta. The safety profile of&#xD;
      bintrafusp alfa in clinical trials to date has been shown to be manageable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the objective response rate (ORR) to bintrafusp alfa in participants with&#xD;
      recurrent/metastatic ONB, immune checkpoint-naive (CN)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must have histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic ONB, not amenable to&#xD;
      potentially curative local therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants should have received at least one line of systemic therapy including a platinum&#xD;
      agent, with evidence of disease progression clinically or radiographically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence of &gt;= 1 lesion measurable by RECIST 1.1 criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;= 18 years, men and women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate organ function, and without serious comorbidity (e.g., autoimmune disease), that&#xD;
      would preclude concurrent systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-institution, single-arm Phase II trial to determine ORR in participants with&#xD;
      recurrent/metastatic ONB treated with bintrafusp alfa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be treated with bintrafusp alfa 1200 mg every 2 weeks for 26 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will initially enroll 12 checkpoint-naive (CN) participants; if responses are&#xD;
      observed in one or more participants, the second stage will enroll another 9 CN participants&#xD;
      to define the response rate to bintrafusp alfa, for a total of 21 CN participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional cohort of checkpoint-resistant (CR) participants will be enrolled and evaluated&#xD;
      separately. Initially 5 CR participants will be enrolled; if responses are observed in one or&#xD;
      more participants, the second stage will enroll another 3 participants, for a total of up to&#xD;
      8 CR participants. Accrual for CR participants will end when the preset number of CN&#xD;
      participants has been accrued.&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because the study&#xD;
             medications have not been tested in pregnant women and there is potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the&#xD;
             study medications, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on&#xD;
             this protocol.&#xD;
