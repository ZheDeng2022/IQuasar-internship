  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Candidiasis is an infection caused by a yeast (a type of fungus) called Candida. Candidiasis&#xD;
      in the vagina is commonly called a &quot;vaginal yeast infection.&quot; Another names for this&#xD;
      infection is &quot;vaginal candidiasis&quot;. The symptoms of vaginal candidiasis include: Vaginal&#xD;
      itching or soreness, Pain during sexual intercourse, Pain or discomfort when urinating and&#xD;
      Abnormal vaginal discharge. VagiVitalAC is a modified version of the existing gel VagiVital,&#xD;
      formulated to act as a treatment for fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical investigation is a two-part study consisting of a pilot part followed by a&#xD;
      randomized part. The aim of the pilot part is to evaluate if VagiVitalAC is able to cure the&#xD;
      vulvovaginal candidiasis in at least 70% of the patients after 7 days treatment. If the&#xD;
      proportion of cured patients is at least 70 %, the next part, the randomized part, will be&#xD;
      performed. In the randomized part, the treatment efficacy and safety of VagiVitalAC on&#xD;
      candida vulvovaginitis will be evaluated by comparing a treatment group with a control group&#xD;
      receiving no treatment.&#xD;
