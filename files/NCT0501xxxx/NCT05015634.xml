  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-CTIMP randomised controlled trial looking at the utilisation of telemedicine&#xD;
      devices to provide remote, clinically necessary, diagnostic information, without the need for&#xD;
      hospital attendance that patients will take home with them following admission to hospital&#xD;
      with a heart attack.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The utilisation of telemedicine devices has the potential to provide remote, clinically&#xD;
      necessary, diagnostic information, without the need for hospital attendance. The aim of this&#xD;
      project is to equip and empower patients known to be at high risk of acute coronary syndromes&#xD;
      to seek urgent medical help without going to the hospital, if they experience symptoms, and&#xD;
      to make a decision to present to the emergency services whenever necessary. This serves two&#xD;
      aims: namely ensuring that patients present appropriately, even though there is an inherent&#xD;
      risk in attending hospital for treatment post-myocardial infarction, and preventing&#xD;
      unnecessary presentation coupled with an urgent remote consultation with a specialist, as&#xD;
      assessed by well-validated technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group will be discharged from the hospital with the telemedicine&#xD;
      package. In the active arm when patients seek medical attention by performing an ECG, the&#xD;
      data provided by the telemedicine package will be acted upon, as appropriate, by the trial&#xD;
      team. Conversely, in the control arm, standard routine clinical care will be carried out,&#xD;
      with remote follow up over the phone at 3, 6 and 9 months.&#xD;
