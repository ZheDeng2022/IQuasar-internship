  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      intrathecal pump refill procedures at home. It is our hypothesis that a refill at home will&#xD;
      be safe, effectiveness and feasible, as is demonstrated in The Netherlands, and preferred by&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
