    <description>Foot rotation (degree), will be evaluated by Zebris (Zebris Medical Limited - Germany) FDM (Force distribution measurement ) System. Participants will walk barefoot on the Zebris FDM (Zebris Medical Limited, Germany) treadmill system. Aim of the system to assessment the angle between the longitudinal axis of the foot and the running direction. Negative value = inward rotation, positive value = outward rotation.Subtalar joint supination describes angulation in the negative direction and pronation describes the angulation in the positive direction.Unit of measure is degrees.</description>

    <description>Step length (cm) will be evaluated by Zebris (Zebris Medical Limited -, Germany) FDM (Force distribution measurement ) System. Participants will walk barefoot on the Zebris FDM (Zebris Medical Limited, Germany) treadmill system. Aim of the system analyzes gait of the patients. Step length describes the distance between the heel contact of one side of the body and the heel contact of the contralateral side. Unit of measure is centimeter.</description>

    <time_frame>4weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cadence (steps/min) will be evaluated by Zebris (Zebris Medical -Limited -, Germany) FDM (Force distribution measurement ) System. Participants will walk barefoot on the Zebris FDM (Zebris Medical Limited, Germany) treadmill system. Cadence is steps/minute. It is defined as the step frequency.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Velocity will be evaluated by Zebris (Zebris Medical -Limited -, Germany) FDM (Force distribution measurement ) System. Participants will walk barefoot on the Zebris FDM (Zebris Medical Limited, Germany) treadmill system. The system measures average gait speed during the analyzed measuring interval. The unit is expressed as km/hr.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Foot pressure distiribution</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Foot pressure distiribution will be evaluated by Zebris (Zebris Medical -Limited -, Germany) FDM (Force distribution measurement ) System. Participants will walk barefoot on the Zebris FDM (Zebris Medical Limited, Germany) treadmill system. The system evaluate the average maximum values reached in N/cmÂ² for the three zones: toes, mid-foot and heel.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <description>The ages of the patients will be recorded in the evaluation form.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Demographic data/patient weight</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The weight of the patients will be recorded in the evaluation form in kilograms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Demographic data/patient height</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The height of the patients will be recorded in the evaluation form in meters.</description>

    <description>The effect of unilateral morton neuroma on gait parameters and foot pressure distribution in patients with bilateral pes planus will be investigated. Foot pressure distributions and gait parameters of the patients; foot rotation, step length, stance phase percentage, swing phase percentage, cadence, velocity, rerefoot pressure, midfoot pressure and forefoot pressure will be recorded with Zebris FDM -T ( Force distiribution Measurement Treadmill ) system. Zebris is a name of company in German .</description>
