      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy, efficiency and cost - effectiveness of a cardiac&#xD;
      telerehabilitation program using wearable sensors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Supervised single-blinded randomized controlled trial, comparing three groups, with&#xD;
      follow-ups at baseline, 12 weeks (completion of the intervention), 6 months after the&#xD;
      completion of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: cardiac rehabilitation centres, patients home environments Participants: A total of&#xD;
      102 cardiac patients, regardless sex, aged 18 years and older were randomly assigned to a&#xD;
      telerehabilitation group (n = 34), a centre - based cardiac rehabilitation group(n=34) and a&#xD;
      usual care control group (n = 34).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Exercise - based cardiac rehabilitation program for the intervention groups&#xD;
      (both in cardiac clinics' settings and in patients' homes) consisted of three sessions each&#xD;
      week for 12 consecutive weeks. The control group received no exercise intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: Main outcome was measured by Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes were measured by accelerometry and the use of proper questionnaires.&#xD;

      Methods Research design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A supervised, single - blind, randomized controlled trial design will be used to examine the&#xD;
      efficacy, efficiency and cost - effectiveness of a cardiac telerehabilitation program using&#xD;
      wearable sensors. The study was approved by the ethics committee of University of Thessaly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample One hundred and two (102) cardiac patients will be recruited from cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation centres. Subject eligibility criteria are: a) 18 years of age and older b)&#xD;
      diagnosis of stable cardiovascular diseases, acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      grafting within the previous six months c) ability to perform physical exercise d) ability to&#xD;
      understand and write in the Greek language e) possession of a mobile smartphone and access to&#xD;
      internet facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments Study data will be collected at baseline, the completion of the intervention&#xD;
      period (12 weeks follow - up) and 6 months after the completion of the intervention (long -&#xD;
      term follow - up)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The telerehabilitation group will undergo a telemonitored exercise - based rehabilitation&#xD;
      program 3 days a week for 12 consecutive weeks for 60'/session. The centre - based&#xD;
      rehabilitation group will undertake a supervised exercise - based rehabilitation program 3&#xD;
      days a week for 12 consecutive weeks for 60'/session at the rehabilitation centres'&#xD;
      facilities. The control group will not receive any exercise intervention during that period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Functional ability, as the primary outcome of the study, will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, at 12 weeks and 6 months after the completion of the intervention (long - term&#xD;
      follow - up) via cardiopulmonary exercise testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity will be recorded and evaluated at the 12 weeks follow up andn the long -&#xD;
      term follow - up by the use of tri - axial accelerometer and the International Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life will be assessed at baseline, at 12 weeks and 6 months after the completion&#xD;
      of the intervention (long - term follow - up) by the use of Health related quality of life&#xD;
      Questionnaire(HRQoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety levels and smoking cessation will be evaluated at baseline, at 12 weeks and 6 months&#xD;
      after the completion of the intervention (long - term follow - up) through the use of the&#xD;
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) and the fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence&#xD;
      (FTND) respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training adherence will be evaluated during the 12 week assessment endpoint, taking in&#xD;
      account the total number of successfully completed training sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed using the assessment of Quality-adjusted&#xD;
      life years (QALYs) as a utility measure, obtained with the EuroQol-5D questionnaire at&#xD;
      baseline and 12 - weeks follow - up assessment&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 week follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed using the assessment of Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as a utility measure. Patients will complete the European Quality of Life Five Dimension (EuroQol-5D) individually and their final scores will be converted into QALYs. The cost / benefit analysis will result from the calculation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER):&#xD;
ICER = (cost intervention group - cost control group) / (effectiveness intervention group - effectiveness control group).&#xD;
Incremental cost refers to the difference, per patient, in the total average cost between the intervention groups and the control group. Incremental effectiveness was defined as the difference in the mean change in QALYs between the intervention group and the control group.</description>

    <measure>Adherence to rehabilitation program</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' training adherence is defined as a percentage counted from the total number of completed training sessions. Patients' adherence in the telerehabilitation group will be evaluated through the Polar Flow web application as the overall completion rate of prescribed exercise sessions. Adherence in the centre - based cardiac rehabilitation group is determined as the number of attended training sessions at the outpatient clinic facilities, as recorded by the outpatient clinic's staff.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 week follow - up (end of intervention), 6 months after the completion of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety and depression rates will be assessed through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) which has seven items for the depression subscale and seven items for the anxiety subscale. Scoring for each item ranges from zero(0) to three(3), with three(3) denoting highest anxiety or depression/anxiety level. A total subscale score of &gt;8 points out of a possible 21 denotes considerable symptoms of anxiety or depression.</description>
