  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to systematically evaluate the effect of Singapore's new front-of-pack&#xD;
      non-alcoholic beverage labels, called Nutri-Grade, on the consumption of processed beverages.&#xD;
      Using a fully functional grocery webstore, the investigators wish to assess the causal effect&#xD;
      of the new labels on food and beverage purchase, sugar intake, and overall diet quality and&#xD;
      examine how this effect varies by shoppers' income and education level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hypotheses about the effects of these new food labels, measured by the&#xD;
      grams of sugar per serving (primary) of finalized shopping baskets, are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hypotheses 1: The new sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) labels will shift consumers toward&#xD;
           healthier products. Sugar-sweetened beverages are any liquids that have been sweetened&#xD;
           with one or more of the different forms of added sugars.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypotheses 2: The new SSB labels will reduce overall sugar and calories purchased and&#xD;
           increase overall diet quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hypotheses 3: Effects will be greater for those with low income/low education as they&#xD;
           are least familiar with the nutrition facts panel and thus most likely to benefit from&#xD;
           the new information.&#xD;

      1. Experimental Design and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of this study is to use a 2 x 2 within-subject crossover design with an online&#xD;
           grocery store, to systematically evaluate the effect of the new SSB front-of-pack&#xD;
           labels, Nutri-Grade, on diet quality and examine how this effect varies by shoppers'&#xD;
           income and education level. To this end, the investigators will be using two different&#xD;
           versions of an online experimental grocery store called NUSMart, designed for research&#xD;
           purposes. The two versions are described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Overview of Experimental Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit Singapore residents aged 21 years or older. Prospective&#xD;
      participants will be asked to complete an online screener to determine their eligibility to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Those who do not consent or are deemed ineligible will be notified&#xD;
      of their ineligibility with an on-screen message.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If interested and eligible, the applicant will then be asked to complete a registration form&#xD;
      containing name, mobile number, and email address. Contact information for the Duke-NUS study&#xD;
      team will be provided to allow questions to be asked at any point in the consent process and&#xD;
      throughout the study. Upon completion of the registration form, NUSMart will create the&#xD;
      participant account and a unique ID number (CID) for use throughout the study. Participants&#xD;
      will receive an automated email with their unique login details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be directed to read the Participant Information Sheet and provide consent.&#xD;
      The investigators will provide information on study protocols and participation details&#xD;
      without disclosing the intervention arms explicitly, to maintain the integrity of participant&#xD;
      responses and hence to ensure validity of results. It will be deleterious to the study to&#xD;
      reveal the labels or the differences between study arms before participants complete both&#xD;
      shops as this will likely confound participant responses. The consent form will state that in&#xD;
      each of the shops there is a 50% chance that the participant will have to make actual&#xD;
      purchases i.e. buy the groceries in the cart they checked out. In reality, it will be&#xD;
      randomly decided earlier whether shopping trip 1 or 2 is the real shop. This will be achieved&#xD;
      via a collaboration with a local online grocery provider, FairPrice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining consent, participants will be asked to fill in a baseline survey to collect&#xD;
      demographic and health characteristics. The baseline questionnaire includes a question as to&#xD;
      whether any household members have a medical condition, such as diabetes or hypertension,&#xD;
      which requires limiting the types of foods they eat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants who have completed to this point will enter a participant waiting list,&#xD;
      where the study team will manually enroll the participant as active according to the capacity&#xD;
      of the study team. Once participants have successfully enrolled in the study they will be&#xD;
      informed by email, and are expected to complete two grocery shops (one shop per week) on&#xD;
      NUSMart. Participants are expected to complete one shop in one sitting. The investigators&#xD;
      will apply a within person design and randomize the order of the two shops. Participants will&#xD;
      receive email and text reminders each week to complete their order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be told that they must buy at least one beverage product and that they&#xD;
      will make the payment using their credit card &amp; receive their grocery orders. This&#xD;
      real-shopping experiment ensures the credibility of the results. Each participant will&#xD;
      therefore shop a total of 2 times during the study. This will include 1 shop within each&#xD;
      shopping condition (Arm 1 and Arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will be asked to purchase their weekly groceries the amount of&#xD;
      which is similar to their typical grocery shopping for their households, with a specified&#xD;
      minimum spend at each shop. A wheel of purchase will be used to determine which one of the 2&#xD;
      shops will the participant actually pay for and receive ordered goods for. Upon completion of&#xD;
      their second shop, participants will be asked to fill in a short post-study survey asking for&#xD;
      their feedback on the interventions. Participants who successfully complete both shops and&#xD;
      all other surveys will be considered as having completed the study. Participants will be&#xD;
      provided with the debriefing sheet via email after study completion. For the participants who&#xD;
      wish to withdraw midway into the study, the debriefing sheet will be sent to them as soon as&#xD;
      possible after they withdraw.&#xD;
