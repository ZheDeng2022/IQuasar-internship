    <textblock>
      This is an Phase Ib/2 study, single arm, single cohort study to determine the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of Dupilumab with PD-(L)1 blockade for patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      metastatic NSCLC. For Phase 2, to determine the effect of adding IL-4Ra blockade to PD-(L)1&#xD;
      blocking agents in patients with relapsed/refractory NSCLC, who have progressed on prior&#xD;
      PD-(L)1 agents&#xD;

             clinically feasible by (Goal 3-6 biopsies, final number to be determined by the&#xD;
             interventionalist performing the procedure as safe) of tumor prior to initiation of&#xD;
             dupilumab and at the on-treatment time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG 0-2. The exception will be patients carrying long term disability (such as&#xD;
             cerebral palsy) where the disability is not acute nor progressive, and unlikely to&#xD;
             significantly affect their response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 3 months&#xD;
             following completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual&#xD;
             orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who&#xD;
             meets the following criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection requiring antibiotics (exception is a brief (≤10days) course of antibiotics&#xD;
             to be completed before initiation of treatment), symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina pectoris, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital&#xD;
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any&#xD;
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial&#xD;
             treatment. Patients on chronic steroids (more than 4 weeks at stable dose) equivalent&#xD;
             to ≤ 10mg prednisone will not be excluded.&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's&#xD;

             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.&#xD;

             detection AND receiving anti-viral therapy for hepatitis B) are permitted. Patients&#xD;
             with controlled infections must undergo periodic monitoring of HBV DNA. Patients must&#xD;

             transplantation.&#xD;

          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study medication&#xD;

             receptor traps)Principle investigator believes that for one or multiple reasons the&#xD;
             patient will be unable to comply with all study visits, or if they believe the trial&#xD;
             is not clinically in the best interest of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of irAE in response to prior immunotherapy that has not improved to a Grade 0&#xD;
             or 1; this does not include endocrinopathies which can be treated with hormone&#xD;
             replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of interstitial lung disease (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing&#xD;
             pneumonia) or active, noninfectious pneumonitis attributed to prior use of cancer&#xD;
             immunotherapy that required immune-suppressive doses of glucocorticoids to assist with&#xD;
             management. A history of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field is permitted.&#xD;
