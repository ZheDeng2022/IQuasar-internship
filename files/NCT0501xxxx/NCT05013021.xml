  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to analyse first, the acute effects generated by a single bout of&#xD;
      Sprint Interval Training (SIT) and, secondly, the effects of a long-term intervention on&#xD;
      sedentary participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main goal is to determine the optimal dose of high-intensity exercise that enhances the&#xD;
      best physiological adaptations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cumulative effects of SIT, will be assessed by a series of measures placed throughout the&#xD;
      time-course (before, after the 1st , the 2nd and the 3rd block of SIT). Those measures&#xD;
      consist of physiological measurements (VO2max), neuromuscular capacities (force-velocity&#xD;
      profile) the autonomic nervous system responses (heart rate variability) and blood markers&#xD;
      (lactate, Creatine phosphoKinase (CK), cytokinases, µRNA). Acute effects will be measured in&#xD;
      the familiarisation sessions (after short (8 sprints) and long (14 sprints) sets) by&#xD;
      performing a battery of neuromuscular, perceptual, and autonomic nervous system tests before&#xD;
      and after the single session of SIT.&#xD;

    <description>The Sprint Interval Training (SIT) training consists of 3 successive blocks of 5 training sessions each. The sessions are 24 to 48 hours apart.&#xD;
. One block lasts two weeks. After the end of one block, the following block begins the day after.&#xD;
The Sprint Interval Training lasts 6 weeks.&#xD;
Each session consists of a series of sprints, the number of which varies from 8 to 14. Thus a session will last from 30 to 45 min approximately&#xD;
So, the time frame of this study is Baseline, Block 1, Block 2 and Block 3 (Not in day or week or month)</description>
