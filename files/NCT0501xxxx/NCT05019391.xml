      Clinical and radiological evaluation including transcranial Doppler of vertebral arteries of&#xD;

      assessment of possible risk factors that may lead to vertebrobasilar insufficiency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI) is defined by inadequate blood flow through the posterior&#xD;
      circulation of the brain, supplied by the 2 vertebral arteries that merge to form the basilar&#xD;
      artery. Transient ischemic attacks in the vertebrobasilar system represent 20% of all&#xD;
      transient ischemic attacks, Their diagnosis is more difficult than that of ischemic attacks&#xD;
      in the anterior circulation because its manifestations are subjective and difficult to&#xD;
      quantify. Although traditionally VB stroke is regarded as having a more benign outcome when&#xD;
      compared to anterior circulation stroke, data is still conflicting, with some studies showing&#xD;
      a higher impairment in VB stroke patients with 21% of death or major disability at 3 months.&#xD;
      Transient ischemic attacks and, more rarely, infarcts in the posterior circulation may be due&#xD;
      to subclavian steal syndrome. Basilar artery transient ischemic attacks usually occur after&#xD;
      the six decade, syncopal attacks occur in about 10% sudden in onset and brief in duration.&#xD;
      Regarding the clinical presentation of VB stroke, the common symptoms are dizziness,&#xD;
      unilateral limb weakness, headache, vomiting and nausea; as for clinical signs, the most&#xD;
      frequent are unilateral limb weakness, gait ataxia, unilateral limb ataxia, dysarthria and&#xD;
      nystagmus. Previously, there was no simple and effective method for the detection of VBI, but&#xD;
      in recent years, with the development and progress of medical technology and the emergence of&#xD;
      Transcranial Doppler (TCD), it provides an accurate, noninvasive, and simple method for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of VBI. Through the diagnosis results, it will be clear about the blood flow status&#xD;
      of single vessel and vascular compliance, which is helpful for accurate reflection of the&#xD;
      subtle changes of VBI.&#xD;
