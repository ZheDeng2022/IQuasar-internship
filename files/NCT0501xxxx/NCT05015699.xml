      PIONEER IV CHINA is sought to investigate the safety and efficacy of 11-month ticagrelor&#xD;
      monotherapy following one-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after HT Supreme&#xD;
      drug-eluting stent system at 12 months follow-up.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm objective performance criteria clinical&#xD;
      trial in an all-comers patient population (including patients with high bleeding risk, HBR)&#xD;
      undergoing PCI with unrestrictive use of the HT Supreme sirolimus-eluting stent and treated&#xD;
      with 11-month ticagrelor monotherapy following one-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in&#xD;
      approximately 285 patients (including 80 coronary heart disease cases entering the OCT&#xD;
      subgroup). All patients will be (at minimum) contacted via visit at 30 days (±7 days) and at&#xD;
      12 months (±30 days), and by phone contact at 6 months (±14 days), 24 months (±30 days) and&#xD;
      36 months (±45 days) post index procedure to assess clinical status and adverse events. The&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint for this trial is Patient-oriented Composite Endpoint (PoCE) at 12 months&#xD;
      post-procedure.&#xD;
