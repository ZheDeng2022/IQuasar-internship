  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label, twenty-four weeks-long clinical study is to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy of acupuncture for Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) as adjunctive therapy to conventional&#xD;
      treatment in comparison to conventional therapy alone and assessment of its eventual&#xD;
      prolonged efficacy after nine weeks without treatment. Long term effects of acupuncture on&#xD;
      KOA are not yet confirmed. A safety assessment will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be interesting to find possible additional benefits of acupuncture while treating&#xD;
      knee/s with in advance determined acupuncture protocol for KOA since Traditional Chinese&#xD;
      Medicine (TCM) theory connects KOA with Kidney deficiency syndrome. Acupuncture treatment&#xD;
      point prescription will use local points for KOA and non-local points with their influence on&#xD;
      KOA through Kidney deficiency as a root cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deep layered chronic pathological condition like KOA requires a higher number of&#xD;
      acupuncture treatments. This study will provide three cycles of acupuncture treatments, which&#xD;
      are three weeks long each, with treatment frequency three times weekly. It is to be expected&#xD;
      that study design with twenty-seven acupuncture treatments of KOA in fifteen weeks achieves&#xD;
      improvement with the KOA and Kidney deficiency symptoms, additionally. Also, treatment&#xD;
      effectiveness is expected at the final assessment nine weeks after the last acupuncture&#xD;
      treatment. That could confirm holistic aspect of TCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty-four patients with symptomatic KOA will be randomly allocated into the Acupuncture&#xD;
      group or Control group (standard care) according to their permanent, unique, and coincidental&#xD;
      Personal Identification Number which is given to all citizens in Croatia. Before experiment&#xD;
      starts participant's demographic and disease parameters of both groups will be compared at&#xD;
      baseline. Prescribed acupuncture protocol will be provided to the Acupuncture group.&#xD;
      Objective assessments of therapeutic efficacy will be done by a physiatrist at three&#xD;
      time-points: baseline, after final acupuncture treatment (15th Week), and at the 24th Week as&#xD;
      the final one. Subjective evaluation of symptoms intensity will be assessed by Western&#xD;
      Ontario and McMaster University Arthritis Index (WOMAC) total score and subscales, Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale (VAS), Kidney Deficiency Syndrome Questionnaire (KDSQ). Analgesics taken by&#xD;
      participants for pain will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Decrease in symptoms intensity could be achieved after treatment in experimental&#xD;
      group compared to control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of the KOA in practice is high and patients are well motivated for additional&#xD;
      treatment regarding their pain and functional impairment. Symptoms of KOA are mainly pain in&#xD;
      the joint line and stiffness. Other manifestations of KOA include sequelae such as muscle&#xD;
      weakness, poor balance, fibromyalgia. KOA occurs in middle and old age. Pain is worse with&#xD;
      joint usage and relieved by rest. Limitation of motion mainly results from osteophytes and&#xD;
      synovial hyperplasia. Bony swelling reflects remodelling of the bones, cartilages, and&#xD;
      synovial thickening. Joint deformity is a sign of advanced joint damage and squaring,&#xD;
      subluxation could happen. Instability may be a sign of weakness of the muscle and joint&#xD;
      instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prototype of a patient with KOA is an older patient with pain and disturbed function in&#xD;
      one or in both knees, with possible less pronounced symptoms like weakness, insomnia,&#xD;
      depression, tinnitus, forgetfulness, feeling of cold, hot, low back pain, thirsty at night,&#xD;
      urogenital symptoms related to deeply layered disorders (Kidney deficiency symptoms). With&#xD;
      treating both causes simultaneously it is to be expected a reduction of the reactive symptoms&#xD;
      as the main effect, but also patient could experience changes in the presentation of its root&#xD;
      symptoms. The treatment effect could present better function of knee and could induce a&#xD;
      patient's better quality of life through influence on Kidney deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acupuncture treatment strategy for KOA logically follows the TCM syndrome differentiation&#xD;
      and understanding of its pathogenesis. In KOA, treatment principle distinguishes root as&#xD;
      deficient and branch as an excess condition. Weak root (Kidney and Blood deficiency)&#xD;
      condition contributes to the formation of branch syndrome (bone Bi syndrome). Aspiration with&#xD;
      treatment would be to tonify the Kidney and Blood (Liver), nourish Qi, expel evils, remove&#xD;
      dampness, promote blood circulation, and remove the obstruction from the channels and&#xD;
      collaterals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design It is expecting to confirm the therapeutical efficacy of acupuncture in&#xD;
      Acupuncture (A) group where acupuncture treatment is adjunctive to conventional as opposed to&#xD;
      Control (C) group which receives only conventional treatment (analgesics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants was done from the target population: patients in two Family&#xD;
      Medicine practices with confirmed and symptomatic KOA. Study population was formed with:&#xD;
      inclusion criteria - patient 50 years old or above with KOA for at least 6 months, painful&#xD;
      knee in last month, radiographic changes of OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or more) and signed&#xD;
      informed consent, and exclusion criteria - if an intra-articular injection into knee within 3&#xD;
      months preceding entry of participant into study, severe chronic or uncontrolled concomitant&#xD;
      disease, bleeding diathesis, or anticoagulant use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mostly all of 64 patients will be recruited from Family practices. All medical data of&#xD;
      participants are available to investigator. After previously fulfilled SOAP (Subjective,&#xD;
      Objective, Assessment, Plan) form and after getting informed written consent from all, study&#xD;
      population will be randomly allocated into two groups according to order by size of their&#xD;
      permanent, unique eleven numbers long Personal Identification Number (OIB), which is given to&#xD;
      all citizens in Croatia by birth. Its first ten numbers are accidentally chosen digits and&#xD;
      the last one digit is a control number. Every second participant in the accidental order by&#xD;
      size of OIB will belong to the same group. Odd ones will belong to A and even numbers to C&#xD;
      group. Demographic and disease parameters will be compared between two groups at baseline.&#xD;
      All patients in A and C groups will receive analgesics, which dosages could be modified&#xD;
      according to participant's needs. Analgesics include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
      (NSAIDs) and/or tramadol in both trial groups. Taken doses of analgesics in both groups will&#xD;
      be recorded at Week 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 and dose represent an average daily dose&#xD;
      of analgesics in the last three days according to the statement of participants. Recorded&#xD;
      dosage will be shown as the comparable dose of the selected representative, which will be&#xD;
      ibuprofen as the most prescribed one. Given data will be statistically processed and&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in A group will start with acupuncture treatment in September 2021 with the first of&#xD;
      three planned treatment cycles. Each of the three treatment cycles will be three weeks long,&#xD;
      one therapeutic cycle consists of 9 treatments each, each two acupuncture cycles will be&#xD;
      split with three weeks period without treatment. Patients will receive acupuncture treatments&#xD;
      three times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture treatment protocol: local treatment points Dubi (ST-35), Neixiyan (EX-LE-4) and&#xD;
      Heding (EX-LE-2), Xuehai (SP-10), Yanglingquan (GB-34), Yinlingquan (SP-9), Zusanli (ST-36),&#xD;
      Sanyinjiao (SP-6), and points selection based on kidney deficiency syndrome Taixi (KI-3),&#xD;
      Guanyuan (CV 4), and Shenshu (BL-23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disposable sterile acupuncture needle 0.30 × 40 mm will be used. The depth and angle&#xD;
      procedure predict straight needling and 1-1.5 inches deep, with mild reinforcing-reducing&#xD;
      method for local points, further straight and 0.5-1 inch deep, reinforcing method for points&#xD;
      based on kidney deficiency syndrome. Time of needling will be 30 minutes, and time point of&#xD;
      reinforcing and reducing manipulation will be every 10 minutes, three times in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size was calculated based on the study published by Berman et al.(3)&#xD;
      Authors used a shorter treatment period than the one envisioned for the present study (8 vs.&#xD;
      15 weeks). For sample size calculation, following data from the mentioned study were used:&#xD;
      WOMAC total score in A and C study groups was comparable at the baseline. After 8 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment, WOMAC total scores were in group A 28,08 (SD = 17,96), in group C 50,11 (SD =&#xD;
      14,52).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated using PASS software package, with envisioning a two-sided test&#xD;
      with unequal variances: type I error 0,05, power 0,95. Group sample sizes of 16 and 16 (i.e.&#xD;
      complete study population of 32 subjects) achieve 95,78% power to reject the null hypothesis&#xD;
      of equal means when the population means difference is μ1 - μ2 = 28,1 - 50,1 = -22,0 with&#xD;
      standard deviations of 18,0 for A group and 14,5 for C group, and with a significance level&#xD;
      (alpha) of 0,050 using a two-sided two-sample unequal-variance t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the treatment period will be significantly longer compared to the study used&#xD;
      for the calculation and that we expect a certain proportion of subjects to drop off the study&#xD;
      and be lost to follow-up, the study population will be doubled to a total of 64 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methods The clinical question &quot;Could the prolonged design of acupuncture treatments&#xD;
      on patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) decrease pain and improve the function of the knee&#xD;
      joints, and additionally achieve positive effects on the debilitating symptoms of a Kidney&#xD;
      deficiency as a root cause of KOA, measured by recognized questionaries?&quot; arise. The outcomes&#xD;
      that matter the most are determined under clinical question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the therapeutic effect of acupuncture on KOA will include renowned WOMAC, VAS,&#xD;
      and KDSQ scores, drug dosages are taken at Week 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24. WOMAC is&#xD;
      renowned questionnaire used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of patients&#xD;
      with KOA. It measures 5 items for pain, 2 for stiffness, and 17 for functional limitation.&#xD;
      VAS continuous scale of 100 mm in length is widely used and recognized scale for pain intense&#xD;
      assessment. KDSQ questionnaire is a valid and reliable measure for the evaluation of the&#xD;
      Kidney Yin and Yang deficiency syndromes in Hong Kong Chinese middle-aged women, constructed&#xD;
      by Chen et al., 2012. KDSQ represents a valid questionnaire for the assessment of Kidney&#xD;
      deficiency in this study population. (19) Data will be stored electronically on a database&#xD;
      with secured and restricted access. Data transfer will be encrypted and any information&#xD;
      capable of identifying individuals removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study analysis. This study tends to evaluate the difference in WOMAC total score at the end&#xD;
      of experiment (15th Week) between study groups as a primary outcome measure. Long-lasting&#xD;
      treatment effect will be assessed at 24th Week (nine weeks after the last treatment).&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will be WOMAC subscale, VAS, and KDSQ score, drug dosage-taken&#xD;
      according to the statement of participants. Baseline data will be obtained before the start&#xD;
      of acupuncture treatments. Endpoint measures at specified time periods will be calculated&#xD;
      from outcome measures in comparison to data at the baseline point. The effect size will be&#xD;
      calculated in the comparison between data in A group and data in C group. Efficacy should be&#xD;
      determined for primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. The primary efficacy analysis&#xD;
      will be based on the intention to treat analysis set, defined as all randomized subjects are&#xD;
      included in the statistical analysis and analyzed according to the group where originally&#xD;
      were allocated, regardless of if they receive the treatment. Statistical comparisons for&#xD;
      total and subscale scores based on the WOMAC will be made using a repeated-measure model with&#xD;
      terms of values for measuring at Week 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and baseline as a&#xD;
      covariate. The treatment difference and its 95% confidence interval will be estimated from&#xD;
      this model. The same approach will be used for analyzing VAS score and KDSQ questionnaire.&#xD;
      All statistical tests will be two-sided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiatrist's assessment, in three time points (baseline, 15th Week, and 24th Week) should be&#xD;
      used as a controlled measure. It'll include standard physiatrist KOA measurements (knee and&#xD;
      thigh circumference, range of motion in knee).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participant will be considered to have withdrawn from the trial when consent is revoked or&#xD;
      if the participant cannot be contacted or located. Participants will not be withdrawn from&#xD;
      the trial for protocol violations. Withdrawal due to an adverse event should be distinguished&#xD;
      from withdrawal due to insufficient response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events will be recorded at Adverse Event Report Form at every treatment. If&#xD;
      happen adverse event will be followed until resolution of the event occurs. The serious&#xD;
      adverse event must be reported to Medical Ethical Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected endpoints It is to be expected pain relief and increased joint movement. Secondly,&#xD;
      it could be expected to diminish symptoms of Kidney deficiency, reduction of analgesics&#xD;
      dosages, confirmation of acupuncture safety as a secondary outcome which should be considered&#xD;
      supportive. WOMAC could be reduced by 20 and KDSQ by 15. KOA pain and drug dose taken could&#xD;
      be reduced by half.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lowering the intensity of symptoms of Kidney deficiency represents an additional value that&#xD;
      can influent the life quality of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research adjectives This is prospective, interventional, randomized, open-label, controlled&#xD;
      trial. It is supported by recent scholarly, peer-reviewed literature. The research method&#xD;
      reflects the approach needed to answer the research questions. Research is addressing a gap&#xD;
      in the literature that would contribute new findings. The research topic is based on a&#xD;
      tangible and cited problem. The research will be conducted with data collection and analysis,&#xD;
      any deviations will be documented and approved by study performer. The study is originally&#xD;
      designed. The acupuncture treatment plan for KOA is obtained with the assistance of Professor&#xD;
      Xueping Zhou. The tendency of study is to be relevant and made under high standards applied&#xD;
      in research in medical fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditions for completing the project Study will be conducted in Family Medicine practice&#xD;
      which is led by the study performer. All financial and operating burdens will be funded from&#xD;
      practice resources.&#xD;

Increased values indicate a higher level of knee inflammation/deformation and decreased differences indicate a lower level of knee inflammation/deformation.&#xD;
This measure estimates the direct treatment effect of acupuncture on knee osteoarthritis at the last assessment time point.</description>
