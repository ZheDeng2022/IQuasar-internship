      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee injuries are common during sports that require fast change-of-direction (COD) movements&#xD;
      such as sidestepping and pivoting during soccer, basketball, handball, and related sports.&#xD;
      COD movements expose the knee joint to large external forces, particularly if players show a&#xD;
      poor COD technique such as lateral trunk lean towards the plant foot or a strong knee valgus&#xD;
      of the cutting leg. Larger external forces and moments that act on the knee joint are&#xD;
      expected to result in larger strain of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and thus a higher&#xD;
      risk of ACL rupture. Consequently, during sports like soccer and basketball, many non-contact&#xD;
      ACL injuries occur during COD tasks. While neuromuscular training (NMT) programs have been&#xD;
      developed to effectively reduce the risk of sports injury including ACL tears, ACL injury&#xD;
      rates have not declined in the last years. One of the reasons for this paradox may be that&#xD;
      many NMT programs such as the FIFA11+ program, which were developed to protect from injury do&#xD;
      not actually improve COD movement strategies. It may be assumed that FIFA11+ does reduce the&#xD;
      overall risk of sports injury through general improvements in strength and balance as well as&#xD;
      safer jump landing technique but not through safer COD technique. Further, if training&#xD;
      interventions were successful in reducing 'high-risk' movement patterns and in developing&#xD;
      knee-stabilizing muscle synergies during COD movements, it remains unclear whether the&#xD;
      improved movement strategy, e.g. the reduction in external knee valgus moments, actually&#xD;
      corresponds to reduced ACL strain. In consequence, there is the need for a comprehensive&#xD;
      investigation to determine whether a NMT program focused on improving COD technique will&#xD;
      improve COD movement and muscle activation strategies and whether these improvements are&#xD;
      correlated with estimated ACL strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second reason for the paradox may be that current experimental protocols to investigate COD&#xD;
      movement strategies in the laboratory are not a good indicator for actual player behavior on&#xD;
      the field thus masking potential benefits of NMT on lateral movements. Therefore, the sports&#xD;
      injury prevention community should aim to move the assessment of COD movement strategy onto&#xD;
      the playing field and into a more realistic playing environment while characterizing the&#xD;
      kinematics and kinetics of sidestepping based on wearable sensors. In consequence, novel&#xD;
      analytical frameworks based on wearables need to be developed, which can capture full-body&#xD;
      kinematics and the underlying forces during COD movements on the playing field. In the long&#xD;
      run, such systems could facilitate real-time feedback with respect to COD technique on the&#xD;
      playing field and thus enhance motor learning of the players as well as characterize&#xD;
      real-world player agility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives &amp; hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To determine the effect of an 8-week NMT and COD technique modification&#xD;
      intervention (multidirection training, MD) on 1) COD movement strategies as characterized by&#xD;
      the lateral trunk angle and knee valgus moment and 2) estimated ACL strain during 45- and&#xD;
      135-degree COD movements in comparison to an 8-week NMT and linear sprint training&#xD;
      intervention (linear sprint training, LS) in sports science students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: There will be a larger reduction in lateral trunk angle and knee valgus moment&#xD;
      and an associated reduction in ACL strain in the MD group compared to the LS group following&#xD;
      the 8-week intervention, which will be retained four weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To determine the effect of an 8-week NMT and COD technique modification&#xD;
      intervention on leg muscle synergies as characterized by the number of muscles and the&#xD;
      structure of the synergy vector for each identified muscle synergy in comparison to an 8-week&#xD;
      NMT and linear sprint training intervention in sports science students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: One or multiple muscle synergy vectors will show an increased contribution of&#xD;
      hip abductor muscle activity in the MD group following training and there will be a lower&#xD;
      number of activated muscles per identified synergy, i.e. a more selective muscle activation&#xD;
      in comparison to the LS group. These improvements will be retained four weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: To determine the validity of an analysis framework to estimate COD movement&#xD;
      strategy (lateral trunk angle, foot progression angle, knee valgus moment) and ACL strain&#xD;
      based solely on inertial motion capture data in comparison to the gold-standard of 3D optimal&#xD;
      motion capture.&#xD;

      Study design and participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a quasi-randomized trial to investigate the effects of effects of two neuromuscular&#xD;
      training interventions (multidirectional vs. linear sprint training) on COD movement&#xD;
      strategies in sports science students and in parallel to develop a methodological framework&#xD;
      for field-based COD movement assessments. This trial will be registered with&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov after ethical approval has been granted. An a-priori sample size&#xD;
      estimation was conducted based on a previous non-randomized controlled trial reporting a&#xD;
      strong, beneficial effect of a 6-week COD technique modification on the Cutting Movement&#xD;
      Assessment Score (CMAS), a qualitative screening tool to quantify biomechanical and&#xD;
      neuromuscular deficits during COD tasks [significant group x time interaction, Cohen's f2 =&#xD;
      0.63 (right leg) - 1.00 (left leg)]. With an a-priori significance level of alpha = 0.05 and&#xD;
      a desired power of 0.8, the minimum required sample size was estimated in G*Power v3.1.9.7 as&#xD;
      only N = 8 (n = 4 in each training group). One concern with this previous study is, however,&#xD;
      that CMAS raters were not blinded to group assignment leading to a potential systematic bias&#xD;
      and overestimated effect size. A second concern is that the CMAS, which combines multiple&#xD;
      biomechanical and neuromuscular deficits (e.g. knee valgus, lateral trunk flexion, hip&#xD;
      internal rotation) into one aggregate score may show a larger effect compared to the analysis&#xD;
      of single biomechanical variables (e.g. knee abduction moment) like in the current study.&#xD;
      Based on these considerations the required sample size of N = 40 sports science students (n =&#xD;
      20 for the MD and LS) was selected. With an expected drop-out rate of 25%, this sample of at&#xD;
      least N = 30 participants will enable to detect moderate to strong interaction effects&#xD;
      (Cohen's f2 &gt; 0.3) with a power of at least 0.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will take part in a first familiarization session (WN 40) to practice the&#xD;
      execution of the COD task and receive information about the content and goals of the training&#xD;
      intervention. Baseline testing (WN 40-41), follow-up testing (WN 49-50), and retention&#xD;
      testing (WN2-4, 2022) will be conducted in the laboratory Pulverturm at the ISW Innsbruck and&#xD;
      will follow the same testing protocol. Participants will be equipped with 47 retroreflective&#xD;
      markers for 3D motion analysis (extended full-body PlugIn Gait model, 10 cameras, 200 Hz) and&#xD;
      14 sensors for combined measurements of surface electromyography (sEMG, 2000 Hz) and inertial&#xD;
      segment data (200 Hz) (Noraxon Ultium, Noraxon Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, USA) of the right leg.&#xD;
      Afterwards, the participants will be asked to warm-up on a stationary bike for five minutes&#xD;
      followed by the initial running exercises of the FIFA11+ program. Maximum voluntary&#xD;
      contractions (MVCs) will be obtained for ankle plantarflexion/dorsiflexion, knee&#xD;
      flexion/extension, hip extension/flexion, and hip abduction according to standardized manual&#xD;
      tests. IMU position and orientation with respect to the participants' anatomy will be&#xD;
      determined based on images and calibration movements taken before the start of the&#xD;
      measurements. After four successful practice trials, participants will be asked to complete&#xD;
      10 COD movements with a 45-degree cutting angle (COD45) and 10 COD movements with a&#xD;
      135-degree cutting angle (COD135) always planting and cutting with the right foot on a&#xD;
      ground-embedded force plate (1000 Hz, Kistler, Winterthur, Switzerland). The approach and&#xD;
      exit speed for each COD movement will be controlled to approximately 4.5 m/s (COD45) and 4&#xD;
      m/s (COD135) as measured by optical timing gates placed within the approach and exit zones&#xD;
      (Witty, Microgate, Bolzano, Italy). Rest periods of one minute in between trials and five&#xD;
      minutes in between blocks (COD45 vs. COD135) will avoid accumulation of neuromuscular&#xD;
      fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the 3D marker trajectories and force data as inputs (optimal motion capture, OMC,&#xD;
      model), full-body kinematics, 3D joint moments, muscle forces, and ACL strain will be&#xD;
      estimated using inverse kinematics and EMG-informed optimization procedures in OpenSim&#xD;
      (v.4.2) combined with FE simulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using only the inertial sensor data as inputs (inertial motion capture, IMC, model),&#xD;
      full-body kinematics, 3D joint moments, muscle forces, and ACL strain will be estimated using&#xD;
      an IMU-tracking and optimal control algorithm combined with FE simulations. This latter&#xD;
      approach is novel and is currently being developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The muscle activation pattern of the right leg will be further analyzed via a muscle synergy&#xD;
      analysis [one muscle synergy model for each testing time point (baseline, follow-up 1,&#xD;
      follow-up 2] and quantified according to its muscle synergy vectors and synergy activation&#xD;
      profiles. Specifically, the number of muscles per synergy vector and the shape of the muscle&#xD;
      synergy vectors will serve as additional dependent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1 &amp; 2: Effects of the NMT and COD technique modification intervention on the&#xD;
      kinematic, kinetic (OMC model), and EMG-related outcome variables will be tested according to&#xD;
      a repeated measures ANOVA with the between-subject factor 'group' (MD vs. LS) and the&#xD;
      within-subject factor 'time point' (baseline, follow-up, retention). The null hypothesis H1&#xD;
      will be rejected if there is a significant interaction effect 'group x time point' at an&#xD;
      a-priori significance level of alpha = 0.05. Interaction effects, i.e. effect modification,&#xD;
      due to the participants' sex or potential other covariates (e.g. baseline COD performance)&#xD;
      will be explored in additional three-way repeated measures ANOVAs. Post-hoc testing will&#xD;
      investigate changes in dependent variables between time points for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: The validity of the IMC model will be determined based on Bland &amp; Altman limits&#xD;
      of agreement to estimate the systematic bias and random error of the IMC model-based&#xD;
      dependent variables in comparison to the OMC model-based variables. The IMC model will be&#xD;
      called valid if the limits of agreement are smaller than the observed changes in the&#xD;
      corresponding variables between baseline and follow-up testing in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations / risk-benefit analysis / insurance information&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be sports science students and thus frequently encounter the injury&#xD;
      risks associated with multi-directional sports. Therefore, the risk of injury for&#xD;
      participants in this study will be no higher than in their everyday life. In the rare case&#xD;
      that a participant sustains an injury during this study, he/she will be covered by accident&#xD;
      insurance provided to all University of Innsbruck students. Furthermore, all participants&#xD;
      will benefit from participating in the current study given that the FIFA11+ NMT program,&#xD;
      which is part of the training in both training groups, has been shown to effectively reduce&#xD;
      the risk of sports injury. Overall, the benefits of this study outweigh the risks.&#xD;
