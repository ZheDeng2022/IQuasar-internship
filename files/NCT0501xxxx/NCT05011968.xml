      The aim of the project is to study of the influence of Lettuce crop enriched with Iodine on&#xD;
      Thyroid hormone synthesis. Secondary outcome to find out iodine presence in urine in order to&#xD;
      evaluate vegetables, like little crop, as Iodine biocarrier&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Several human pathologies are caused by deficiencies of some mineral elements. These&#xD;
      deficiencies can be overcome through careful dietary diversification and mineral&#xD;
      supplementation. An alternative or even complementary way is represented by the intake of&#xD;
      bio-fortified foods. In the field of mineral deficiency increasing the bioavailable mineral&#xD;
      concentration in vegetables intended for human consumption; can be a useful tool to prevent&#xD;
      many harmful pathologies. Therefore, in this scenario, it appears very important to identify&#xD;
      the right dosages and the most effective methods of administration to bio-fortify vegetables&#xD;
      with a strong nutritional-health connotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project aim to investigate the benefits of fortified food intake in a cohort of&#xD;
      healthy individuals. Specifically, healthy individuals received lettuce enriched with iodine&#xD;
      and after 10 days plasma and urine samples were collected . Each subject was subjected to two&#xD;
      venous blood samples taken at the beginning of the observation and at the end (after 10&#xD;
      days). The samples thus obtained were transported in certified containers for the safe&#xD;
      transport of biological samples, and, subsequently, processed by the laboratories of the&#xD;
      Molecular Biology section of the University of Palermo. Serum and plasma will be obtained&#xD;
      from each blood sample. All information thus obtained will be recorded in a database in which&#xD;
      each person will be identified with a numerical code, in order to comply with current privacy&#xD;
      regulations. Body weight, Barefoot standing height, Body mass index, Body composition will be&#xD;
      measured in the different groups of study. Samples will be analyzed and compared for glucose,&#xD;
      albumin, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid,&#xD;
      creatinine, AST, ALT, γ-GT, ALP, bilirubin, Ferritin, free Iron, transferrin, total proteins,&#xD;
      Magnesium, Calcium, insulin, osteocalcin,TSH, FT3, FT4, hematocrit, hs-CRP, Bone metabolism&#xD;
      (Osteocalcin, parathyroid hormone, CTX, Calcitonin), Vitamin D Calcium, Phosphate, Potassium,&#xD;
      gastric hormones ( GIP, GLP1, GLP2, ghrelin, glucagon, PYY, CCK) oxidative stress markers&#xD;
      (LDL-ox, AGE, urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F (PGF)2alpha) and inflammatory markers(IL-1, TNF,&#xD;
