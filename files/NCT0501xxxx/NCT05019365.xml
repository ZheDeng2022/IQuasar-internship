  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with human epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer has had a major impact upon cancer outcomes.&#xD;
      However, cardiac toxicity remains a substantial concern. Conventionally, this toxicity has&#xD;
      been considered as a transient and reversible phenomenon occurring in the immediate&#xD;
      peri-treatment period in around 20% of patients. Current guidelines recommend monitoring&#xD;
      heart function during treatment and at completion. Recent registry data suggest that&#xD;
      trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity may also manifest in the longer-term. The nature and&#xD;
      longer-term prevalence of left ventricular dysfunction with HER2 positive breast cancer&#xD;
      treated with trastuzumab is unclear. The aim of this project is to define the prevalence of&#xD;
      left ventricular dysfunction late after completion of trastuzumab therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2014, there were 45,535 cases of breast cancer diagnosed in England and Wales(1).&#xD;
      Predicted 10-year survival in 2015, from data by the National Statistics office was estimated&#xD;
      at 81%(2). Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in Scotland and the second most common&#xD;
      cause of death(3). Around 1 in 4 of these cancers overexpress human epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor 2 (HER2). For these patients, trastuzumab is a recommended and highly effective&#xD;
      component of a chemotherapy regime that usually includes an anthracycline(4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to a quarter of patients treated with trastuzumab will develop cardiac dysfunction(5-7),&#xD;
      conventionally defined as an asymptomatic &gt;10% fall in left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
      (LVEF) to an absolute LVEF &lt;50%, or symptomatic heart failure(8). The risk is greater in&#xD;
      patients who have received prior anthracyclines(9). Trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity has,&#xD;
      typically been considered to be a reversible phenomenon which recovers with interruption or&#xD;
      cessation of treatment(10-14). The long-term benefit of cardioprotective treatment with&#xD;
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or beta blockers when cardiotoxicity is detected is&#xD;
      unclear(8) and these agents are often either not continued or not be prescribed at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of cardiac dysfunction or heart failure in the longer-term is not well-defined&#xD;
      (12,14-20) . Clinical trials, which have excluded patients with baseline cardiovascular&#xD;
      comorbidity, report no excess of cardiovascular events after the first two years(21-23) but&#xD;
      observational studies report a much higher incidence of up to 23.8%(9,24). A landmark&#xD;
      analysis of patients with a history of breast cancer (median follow-up 9 years) reported that&#xD;
      patients treated with anthracycline chemotherapy and trastuzumab were three-fold more likely&#xD;
      to develop heart failure than those treated with anthracycline alone. Importantly, these data&#xD;
      were derived from a population censored at one year and reflect 'late' manifestations of&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity rather than ongoing symptoms from an early diagnosis(25). This important study&#xD;
      reported the incidence of symptomatic heart failure and not LV dysfunction which would be&#xD;
      expected to be substantially more prevalent(26). Furthermore, the long-term implications of&#xD;
      an apparently transient drop in LVEF during treatment are unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for the assessment of LV&#xD;
      function(27). Previous work has demonstrated that CMR may be better able to identify small&#xD;
      changes in LVEF related to chemotherapeutic agents(18,28,29). CMR has superior accuracy and&#xD;
      precision when compared with echocardiography and allows myocardial tissue&#xD;
      characterisation(30,31). My proposed CMR protocol will generate important insights into the&#xD;
      long-term cardiac effects of trastuzumab and further novelty will be provided by the&#xD;
      incorporation of tissue mapping methods(32) and LV strain assessment(33,34). Via&#xD;
      collaboration with mathematicians I will also derive computational models.&#xD;
