    <textblock>
      Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a chronically neurological disease characterized by&#xD;
      progressive seizures. TLE is the most frequent subtype of refractory focal epilepsy in&#xD;
      adults. Epilepsy surgery has proven to be very efficient in TLE and superior to medical&#xD;
      therapy in two randomized controlled trials. According to the previous experience, the&#xD;
      investigators use functional temporal lobectomy (FTL) via minicraniotomy for TLE. To date,&#xD;
      this minimally invasive open surgery has been not reported. The investigators here present a&#xD;
      protocol of a prospective trail which for the first time evaluates the outcomes of this new&#xD;
      surgical therapy for TLE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a chronically neurological disease characterized by&#xD;
      progressive seizures, followed by a latency period of several years after various injuries&#xD;
      including febrile seizures, infection, trauma, tumors, and vascular malformation. Hippocampal&#xD;
      sclerosis is the most common histopathological finding. The macroscopic changes of TLE with&#xD;
      hippocampal sclerosis include the diminished size, sclerosis, and reduced metabolism in&#xD;
      mesial temporal structures (amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus). The&#xD;
      microscopic changes include neuronal loss, gliosis, and axonal reorganization. As TLE&#xD;
      progresses, most of patients become resistant to current antiepileptic drugs. Therefore, TLE&#xD;
      is the most frequent subtype of refractory focal epilepsy in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epilepsy surgery has proven to be very efficient for TLE and superior to medical therapy in&#xD;
      two randomized controlled trials. Patients with surgical therapy have high seizure-free rate&#xD;
      with the range of 60% to 80 % while less than 5% with medical treatment. Anterior temporal&#xD;
      lobectomy (ATL) is the most frequently used approach for TLE. For patients with TLE, Engel&#xD;
      suggested referral to ATL should be strongly considered. The decision analysis showed that&#xD;
      ATL increased life expectancy and quality- adjusted life expectancy in patients with TLE&#xD;
      compared with medical management. Nevertheless, ATL is performed by large frontotemporal&#xD;
      craniotomy. Although complication rates after temporal lobectomy have decreased dramatically&#xD;
      over time, ATL creates a large cavity with temporal lobe resected, causing potential&#xD;
      complications such as bleeding, brain shifts and subdural collections. With the advances in&#xD;
      minimally invasive surgery, surgical techniques of ATL for TLE need to be continuously&#xD;
      improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, the investigators modify the surgical approach. Functional temporal&#xD;
      lobectomy (FTL) via minicraniotomy is established. Recently, 16 patients with TLE undergoing&#xD;
      FTL obtained satisfactory outcomes in our center (unpublished data). To date, this new open&#xD;
      surgery for TLE has been not reported. The safety and efficacy of FTL need to be verified.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators here present a protocol of the minimally invasive surgical&#xD;
      epilepsy trial for TLE (MISET-TLE) which for the first time evaluates the outcomes of FTL as&#xD;
      a new surgical approach for TLE.&#xD;

QOLIE-89 is one of the special inventories applied mostly to assess QOL in research protocols, especially in long-term prospective clinical investigations. QOLIE- 89 has 89 items, range of scores, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better QOL.</description>

    <measure>Intelligence assessed by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after epilepsy surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Intelligence is assessed by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV (WAIS-IV). WAIS-IV provides four major domains: perceptual reasoning, processing speed, verbal comprehension, working memory. The WAIS-IV also provides two overall summary scores including a Full-Scale IQ and a General Ability Index (GAI), where FSIQ is a measurement of performance across all subcategories, but the GAI is more resistant to issues that might arise from cognitive impairment, allowing for a more precise and truthful analysis. Higher score means better outcome. Intelligence is classified according to the total score : 1) extremely abnormal with more than 130 points; 2) Exceptional: 120-129 points; 3) Higher than usual: 110-119 points; 4) Normal: 90-109 points; 5) Lower than usual: 80-89 points; 6) Boundary: 70-79 points; 7) Mental Retardation: lower than 69 points.</description>

    <description>Patients are placed in the supine position with the head contralaterally rotated 30°. The 3D model of incision and bone flap is printed prior to surgery by the slicer software based on the MRI data. Straight incision with the length of about 7 cm in the temporal region is marked according to the 3D model. Temporal craniotomy via small bone window with the diameter of about 3 cm is performed. From the temporal pole along T1 about 5 cm posteriorly, temporal horn is opened by dissecting the superior temporal sulcus. The head of temporal horn is exposed. The amygdala is resected. Then, the parahippocampal gyrus and the head and body of hippocampus are en bloc resected. The lateral temporal lobotomy is easy due to large view following the removal of mesial structures. The lateral posterior temporal lobotomy is no more than 5 cm from the temporal pole.</description>

    <description>Patients are placed in the supine position with the head contralaterally rotated 30°. Large frontotemporal craniotomy is performed. Question mark-shaped incision with the length of 20- 25 cm in the frontotemporal region is marked. The size of the bone flap is approximately 5×8 cm for the exposure of lateral temporal lobe. ATL consists of en bloc resection of the anterior 5 cm of lateral temporal lobe, followed by the removal of mesial structures including the amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and the head and body of hippocampus.</description>
