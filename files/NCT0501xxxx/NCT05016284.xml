  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy of a JW-100 cream with active control (commercially available as&#xD;
      EUCRISA®, Pfizer) for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) in adult patients with mild to&#xD;
      moderate AD measured with the Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) scale.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases, affecting 13% of&#xD;
      children and approximately 7% of adults in the United States. AD is often stimulated by a&#xD;
      cascade of inflammatory events; thus, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and&#xD;
      antihistamines are often prescribed. Many industrialized countries have legalized botanical&#xD;
      cannabis and its extracts for medical purposes. The most clinically relevant components of&#xD;
      botanical cannabis are the cannabinoid agents delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol&#xD;
      (CBD), and the noncannabinoids compounds, terpenoids, and flavonoids. The aim of this study&#xD;
      is to explore the efficacy of a novel cannabidiol cream in the treatment of atopic dermatitis&#xD;
      in comparison with a commercially available product from Pfizer (EUCRISA®).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject is at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has a clinical diagnosis of stable AD characterized by at least three of the&#xD;
             following four features:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Pruritus&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Typical morphology and distribution (e.g., flexural lichenification or linearity&#xD;
                  in adults)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Chronic or chronically-relapsing eczematous/atopic dermatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Personal or family history of atopy (i.e., asthma, allergic rhinitis, AD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has an area of AD (excluding the scalp) covering ≥5% and ≤20% body surface&#xD;
             area&#xD;
