      The purpose of this project is to explore whether Monoclonal Antibody-MMAE Conjugate for&#xD;
      Injection (RC48-ADC) combined with Triplizumab as a preoperative neoadjuvant therapy for&#xD;
      myometrial invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) can achieve a good tumor descending period, so as&#xD;
      to prolong disease-free survival and overall survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the urinary system, mainly urothelial&#xD;
      cancer, and its morbidity and mortality are increasing year by year. According to cancer&#xD;
      statistics published by CACancerJClin, there were about 81000 new cases of bladder cancer in&#xD;
      China in 2015, and the number of deaths from bladder cancer reached 33000. According to the&#xD;
      depth of invasion, bladder cancer can be divided into superficial bladder cancer and muscular&#xD;
      invasive bladder cancer. More than 70% of superficial bladder cancers recur after initial&#xD;
      treatment, and about 15% eventually develop into invasive cancer. The prognosis of&#xD;
      superficial bladder cancer is good (the 5-year survival rate is more than 90%). After&#xD;
      entering the stage of myometrial invasion, the 5-year survival rate is only 60%, while the&#xD;
      5-year survival rate of patients with local advanced stage or metastasis is less than 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder cancer has been shown to be sensitive to chemotherapeutic drugs such as platinum,&#xD;
      gemcitabine, doxorubicin and taxanes. The results show that in the stage of localized&#xD;
      myometrial invasive bladder cancer, cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy can&#xD;
      significantly improve the median survival time of patients with myometrial invasive bladder&#xD;
      cancer up to 31 months, showing a significant survival advantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is routinely recommended before radical resection for&#xD;
      bladder cancer patients who can tolerate cisplatin. However, a single neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy can not meet the needs of all bladder cancer patients, so it is necessary to&#xD;
      find new treatments to further supplement or improve the traditional neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy, so as to improve the postoperative survival of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2020, our group has also carried out a phase II clinical study of Tripril combined with&#xD;
      GC regimen as a neoadjuvant regimen before MIBC. Triplet monoclonal antibody injection&#xD;
      (Tuoyi) is a new type of recombinant humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody independently&#xD;
      developed in China. At present, 18 cases have been enrolled in the study, 13 cases have been&#xD;
      completed, and the rate of PaR and 31% pCR has reached 69.2%. The effect is similar to that&#xD;
      of similar studies abroad. In spite of this, the combined therapy of immunity and&#xD;
      chemotherapy is limited by the strong toxicity of platinum drugs, and some patients are still&#xD;
      unable to tolerate it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the emergence of antibody drug conjugates (antibody-drugconjugate,ADC)&#xD;
      provides a new choice for these patients. Studies have shown that ADC drugs and ICI drugs are&#xD;
      highly complementary and safe. In addition, according to the results of the EV103 study, it&#xD;
      can be found that the combination of ADC and ICI has a significant synergistic effect and has&#xD;
      a strong and rapid shrinking effect on urothelial cancer. At the same time, these two drugs&#xD;
      do not require high renal function, so they are very suitable for neoadjuvant therapy before&#xD;
      MIBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RC48-ADC (Recombinant humanized Anti-HER2 Monoclonal Antibody-MMAE Coupling Agent for&#xD;
      injection, referred to as RC48-ADC) independently developed by Rongchang Biopharmaceuticals&#xD;
      in China is the first clinically approved HER2 antibody coupling drug in China. RC48-ADC&#xD;
      exerts its anti-tumor effect through two main pathways: one is to interfere with cell&#xD;
      transcription, growth and proliferation by inhibiting downstream signal pathways activated by&#xD;
      HER2 (such as PI3K/AKT), and the other is the interference of microtubule formation by small&#xD;
      molecule MMAE, which is mainly manifested by depolymerizing microtubules and inducing cell&#xD;
      cycle arrest in G2max M phase. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that RC48-ADC has a&#xD;
      tumor inhibitory effect on HER2 overexpressed cancer cells through antibody-dependent&#xD;
      cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). About 25-30% of bladder cancers show high expression of&#xD;
      HER2, and these tumors tend to have higher stage and grade, are more prone to invasion and&#xD;
      metastasis and have a poor prognosis. Therefore, RC48-ADC has a high application prospect in&#xD;
      bladder cancer with high expression of HER2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RC48-C005 study is a single-arm, open, multicenter II phase clinical study in China to&#xD;
      evaluate RC48-ADC in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic bladder urothelial&#xD;
      carcinoma with overexpression of HER2. Through this study, it can be found that RC48-ADC has&#xD;
      significant therapeutic efficacy and good safety in advanced urothelial cancer with high&#xD;
      expression of Her-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this, this study intend to use the combination of ADC drugs and ICI drugs (RC48-ADC&#xD;
      combined with triplizumab) as preoperative neoadjuvant therapy for patients with high&#xD;
      expression of MIBC in HER2, in order to achieve a better effect of tumor decline, so as to&#xD;
      prolong the disease-free survival and overall survival of patients.&#xD;
