  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled and double blind study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity of FB704A in adult patients with severe&#xD;
      asthma. The study comprised a 4-week screening period, a 8-week treatment period and a&#xD;
      12-week follow-up period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40 subjects who meet the criteria for study entry are planned to be enrolled to&#xD;
      the study. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive placebo or FB704A in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
      There are 20 subjects participate in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility will be checked in patients with severe asthma during the 4-week screening&#xD;
      period. Potential candidates should provide signed informed consent forms before starting the&#xD;
      screening activities. The subjects will receive four dose of 4 mg/kg FB704A or placebo. The&#xD;
      study drug will be administered as a 1-hour IV infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may administer albuterol as rescue medications as needed throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have site visits after receiving study drug for efficacy, safety, PK, and&#xD;
      biomarker evaluation (see Study Flow Chart). Subjects who prematurely withdraw from the study&#xD;
      will have an end of study (EOS) visit within 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relative change in pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 , post-bronchodilator FEV 1, exhaled NO and&#xD;
      asthma symptom s will be evaluated during the study.&#xD;
