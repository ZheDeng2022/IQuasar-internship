      While suicide prevention depends on people disclosing suicidal thoughts and behaviors in&#xD;
      order to get help, those who talk about their suicidality also face negative responses from&#xD;
      the people who they tell. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial of a&#xD;
      peer-led strategic disclosure intervention for suicide attempt survivors (The To Share or Not&#xD;
      to Share Program; called 2Share). This study evaluates the impact of the intervention on&#xD;
      suicidal thoughts and behaviors, depression, stigma, disclosure behaviors, and psychosocial&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The estimated 1.3 million Americans who survive a suicide attempt suicide each year are at&#xD;
      risk for ongoing suicide ideation, repeated suicide attempts, and ultimately dying by&#xD;
      suicide. While suicide prevention often depends on people openly discussing suicidal thoughts&#xD;
      and behaviors in order to get help for themselves or others, those who talk about their&#xD;
      suicidality often face negative reactions from confidants. Stigmatizing responses in the form&#xD;
      of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination may exacerbate symptoms and interfere with&#xD;
      social relationships, employment opportunities, and help seeking. Feelings of shame and&#xD;
      rejection are common experiences of suicide attempt survivors and the mere anticipation of&#xD;
      rejection can encourage attempt survivors to maintain their silence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research suggests that suicide disclosure could help suicide attempt survivors in attaining&#xD;
      needed care, expanding social support networks, strengthening relationships, and advancing&#xD;
      coping strategies. However, few interventions are available to assist suicide attempt&#xD;
      survivors in making critical disclosure decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A peer-led strategic disclosure intervention (The 2Share Program), developed through a&#xD;
      collaborative process with suicide attempt survivors, aids participants in: (a) evaluating&#xD;
      the benefits and risks of disclosure; (b) considering ways to disclose; and (c) developing&#xD;
      disclosure scripts. A pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with community-dwelling attempt&#xD;
      survivors (n=38) found that intervention participants had significantly decreased depression&#xD;
      and internalized stigma, and increased self-esteem as compared with the control group.&#xD;
      However, this study was small and did not evaluate changes in suicidal thoughts and&#xD;
      behaviors, help-seeking, or disclosure outcomes. The methodology was also limited in&#xD;
      measuring longer term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given limitations of past research, the investigators propose a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      of the 2Share strategic disclosure program for community-dwelling suicide attempt survivors.&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of the intervention on suicidal&#xD;
      thoughts and behaviors and depression. Secondary goals are to examine intervention impact on&#xD;
      stigma, disclosure, and psychosocial outcomes. A final goal of the project is to&#xD;
      qualitatively examine participant experiences with disclosure over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research addresses the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention priority of&#xD;
      determining what interventions are effective and what prevents individuals from engaging in&#xD;
      suicidal behavior. The 2Share intervention is the first to address strategic disclosure in&#xD;
      suicide attempt survivors, and this study will provide important data about disclosure that&#xD;
      can ultimately aid in understanding suicide prevention.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Results will be available through the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Data Archive and through the project website at the National Consortium on Stigma and Empowerment (NCSE). No identifying information will be connected to the data and we do not believe that there is a possibility of deductive disclosure of subjects with unusual characteristics. We will certify the quality of all data prior to submission to New Drugs and Clinical Trials (NDCT). Descriptive/raw data will be submitted semi-annually (prior to January 15 and July 15) and will be checked for quality within four months. All other data will be submitted at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first. The final de-identified dataset and codebook will be posted on NCSE website at the time of publication. We will share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied by using the Study functionality.</ipd_description>
