  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of dietary fiber on psychobiological processes are examined in a sample of&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an interventional triple-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design with 2&#xD;
      arms (placebo, dietary fiber). Healthy male participants adhere to their normal eating habits&#xD;
      for the duration of the study (32 days). At the baseline study visit, measurements are taken&#xD;
      in the lab, including biological samples and psychophysiological measurements. Participants&#xD;
      then consume placebo or dietary fiber for 4 weeks and revisit the lab on day 32 for a second&#xD;
      measurement of the outcomes of interest. Specifically, we investigate the effect of dietary&#xD;
      fiber on affective processing, including stress sensitivity and fear-related processes (e.g.&#xD;
      extinction learning). Volunteers also respond to questionnaires in relation to mood and GI&#xD;
      symptoms, and provide biological samples (saliva, blood, faecal, and urine samples) for&#xD;
      analysis of cortisol levels, circulating short chain fatty acids and serum BDNF, faecal SCFA&#xD;
      and microbiota composition, and intestinal permeability, respectively.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stress sensitivity (cortisol)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, on average 1 year and 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Induction of cognitive, physical, and social stress using Maastricht Acute Stress Test. Stress hormone cortisol is quantified by gathering multiple saliva samples throughout the stress induction and recovery during both pre-intervention and post-intervention visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stress sensitivity (subjective)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, on average 1 year and 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Induction of cognitive, physical, and social stress using Maastricht Acute Stress Test. Participant rate how much stress, discomfort, and pain they feel on a 10-cm visual analogue scale, with higher values indicating greater stress, discomfort, and pain. This is done prior to stress induction, in the middle, and at the end at both pre- and post-intervention visits.</description>
