  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced gastric cancer has always been the focus and difficulty in the treatment of gastric&#xD;
      cancer, and postoperative peritoneal recurrence is one of the key factors with poor&#xD;
      prognosis. in recent years, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been used in the&#xD;
      treatment of advanced peritoneal metastases and achieved remarkable results. Existing studies&#xD;
      have shown that postoperative hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy plays a certain role&#xD;
      in reducing postoperative peritoneal recurrence of advanced gastric cancer. Our previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy adopted docetaxel combine&#xD;
      oxaliplatin can also reduce the peritoneal recurrence of advanced gastric cancer. At present,&#xD;
      there is a lack of comparison of the safety and efficacy of intraoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. In this study, patients with advanced gastric&#xD;
      cancer were selected by preoperative imaging, endoscopic ultrasonography and other&#xD;
      examinations. The patients were randomly divided into group A: D1-2 radical gastrectomy plus&#xD;
      hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy of docetaxel + oxaliplatin. Group B: D1-2 radical&#xD;
      gastrectomy + postoperative hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy of docetaxel +&#xD;
      oxaliplatin and group C: D1-2 radical radical gastrectomy .The three groups both proceed&#xD;
      postoperative conventional adjuvant chemotherapy（SOX/XELOX）.The incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage and other complications were collected, and the safety differences among&#xD;
      the three groups were compared. The three-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS), and disease-related mortality were evaluated and the long-term effects among the three&#xD;
      groups were compared.&#xD;

      Background Advanced gastric cancer has always been the focus and difficulty in the treatment&#xD;
      of gastric cancer. at present, gastric cancer with clinical stage of T3 / T4a / N + and&#xD;
      without distant metastasis is defined as advanced gastric cancer. The conventional treatment&#xD;
      is radical surgery plus postoperative or preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. The overall&#xD;
      median survival time is 10-12 months. After surgery-based comprehensive treatment, the 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate of advanced gastric cancer is about 30%, and about 30-40% of recurrence is&#xD;
      peritoneal recurrence or local recurrence. Postoperative peritoneal recurrence is one of the&#xD;
      key factors for poor prognosis of advanced gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous peritoneal recurrence and metastasis was defined as the end stage of the disease.&#xD;
      Since 1980s, Spratt et al found that chemotherapy combined with hyperthermia can improve the&#xD;
      treat efficacy of peritoneal metastases. In the past 20 years, with the progress of accurate&#xD;
      temperature control technology, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been&#xD;
      gradually applied to various advanced peritoneal metastases. HIPEC refers to the accurate&#xD;
      constant temperature, circulatory perfusion, filling the abdominal cavity and maintaining for&#xD;
      a certain period of time to prevent and treat peritoneal implant metastasis. HIPEC contains&#xD;
      three new concepts of precise temperature control, precise positioning and precise removal:&#xD;
      (1) accurate temperature control: the accuracy of temperature measurement is less than ±0.1C,&#xD;
      the accuracy of temperature control is less than ±0.5C, and the accuracy of flow rate control&#xD;
      is less than ±5%. (2) accurate positioning: &quot;x&quot; abdominal cavity cross-placed perfusion tube&#xD;
      to the subdiaphragm and pelvic floor to fill the whole abdominal cavity, leaving no treatment&#xD;
      blind area, giving full play to the best effect of HIPEC. (3) accurate clearance: volume&#xD;
      removal of free cancer cells, subclinical lesions and microcancerous nodules. Intraperitoneal&#xD;
      hyperthermic perfusion chemotherapy has been used in the treatment of advanced peritoneal&#xD;
      metastases such as gastric cancer, colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer, and achieved&#xD;
      remarkable results. The overall prognosis of patients with peritoneal metastases has been&#xD;
      greatly improved without increasing adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research status Previous peritoneal recurrence and metastasis was defined as the end stage of&#xD;
      the disease. Since 1980s, Spratt et al found that chemotherapy combined with hyperthermia can&#xD;
      improve the treat efficacy of peritoneal metastases. In the past 20 years, with the progress&#xD;
      of accurate temperature control technology, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC)&#xD;
      has been gradually applied to various advanced peritoneal metastases. HIPEC refers to the&#xD;
      accurate constant temperature, circulatory perfusion, filling the abdominal cavity and&#xD;
      maintaining for a certain period of time to prevent and treat peritoneal implant metastasis.&#xD;
      HIPEC contains three new concepts of precise temperature control, precise positioning and&#xD;
      precise removal: (1) accurate temperature control: the accuracy of temperature measurement is&#xD;
      less than ±0.1C, the accuracy of temperature control is less than ±0.5C, and the accuracy of&#xD;
      flow rate control is less than ±5%. (2) accurate positioning: &quot;x&quot; abdominal cavity&#xD;
      cross-placed perfusion tube to the subdiaphragm and pelvic floor to fill the whole abdominal&#xD;
      cavity, leaving no treatment blind area, giving full play to the best effect of HIPEC. (3)&#xD;
      accurate clearance: volume removal of free cancer cells, subclinical lesions and&#xD;
      microcancerous nodules. Intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion chemotherapy has been used in&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced peritoneal metastases such as gastric cancer, colorectal cancer and&#xD;
      ovarian cancer, and achieved remarkable results. The overall prognosis of patients with&#xD;
      peritoneal metastases has been greatly improved without increasing adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A French analysis of 1125 patients over the past 25 years shows that tumor cell reduction&#xD;
      surgery (CRS) combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy(HIPEC) may benefit&#xD;
      patients' survival regardless of the origin of peritoneal metastatic cancer. Foreign&#xD;
      GASTRICHIP studies have shown that radical resection of advanced gastric cancer D1-2 gastric&#xD;
      cancer plus postoperative hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy can reduce postoperative&#xD;
      peritoneal recurrence of advanced gastric cancer to a certain extent. At present, the HIPEC&#xD;
      study of advanced gastric cancer in China is mainly based on the mode of surgery combined&#xD;
      with postoperative HIPEC treatment, including the ongoing NCT02381847 study led by Professor&#xD;
      Guan Wenxian of Nanjing Gulou Hospital and the NCT03604614 study led by Professor Wang Wei of&#xD;
      Guangdong Hospital of traditional Chinese Medicine. both of them are aimed at the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of postoperativehyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for advanced gastric&#xD;
      cancer. At present, there is no clinical study on hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy&#xD;
      at home and abroad.&#xD;
