  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug safety is always a national, as well as international, patient safety goal.&#xD;
      Administration of injection, especially intravenous infusion, is an extremely complicated and&#xD;
      dangerous process, which includes reconstitution, dilution, selection of diluent and volume,&#xD;
      verification of concentration of final solution, check for stability, sterility and&#xD;
      compatibilities, and the selection of intravenous (IV) set, peripheral or central route, and&#xD;
      the rate of infusion. Due to its inherent complexity, errors occur easily during these&#xD;
      procedures. Literatures indicated that the incidence of injection administration errors&#xD;
      ranged from 13% to 84%, which included errors in dosage, diluents, and volumes; excessive&#xD;
      administration rate; and incompatible IV admixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the U.S.A., pharmacists provide comprehensive clinical services. They ensure the&#xD;
      appropriateness of every step in the process from prescription and dosage verification, drug&#xD;
      reconstitution and dilution, selection of diluents and concentration, to the rate of&#xD;
      administration. Even more, they provide the final IV products that are ready to administer to&#xD;
      the patients (IV admixture services). Therefore, many common administration errors can be&#xD;
      avoided. In Taiwan, nevertheless, pharmacists have limited role in IV services due to our&#xD;
      health-care system. There are no studies on the administration pattern of injections. There&#xD;
      is still room for improvement in the assurance of injection safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure the safety of injection, we not only have to oversee the accuracy of drugs and&#xD;
      dosage, but also take the compatibilities among drugs and diluents seriously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because diluent is not a mandatory claim data, the National Health Insurance data base cannot&#xD;
      provide the related information for drug compatibility epidemiology study. The application&#xD;
      for reimbursement of injections is based on total amount used instead of daily usage; it is&#xD;
      therefore difficult to find drug incompatibility problems in this data base. Hospital data&#xD;
      base analysis, questionnaire survey and chart review are more feasible for such study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will analyze the prescriptions of IV injection in the intensive-care units and&#xD;
      pediatric units to determine the prescribing pattern. High risk IV admixtures and Y-site&#xD;
      administrations will be explored by questionnaire survey and literature review. Laboratory&#xD;
      experiments will be done on some indicator drugs to find the reasons, categories and&#xD;
      severities of the compatibilities. A list of incompatible drugs shall be generated for&#xD;
      computerized intervention. We hope the results of the study can be used as a reference for&#xD;
      guideline, policy and procedure for health care system and government.&#xD;
