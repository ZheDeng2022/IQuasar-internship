  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Picture My Participation (PmP) is a child self-report tool for children and adolescents with&#xD;
      disabilities. The PmP uses pictures that enable children to identify participation&#xD;
      frequencies, participation goals, and environmental supports/barriers to a home, school, and&#xD;
      community activities. The PmP has been translated to different languages and cultures,&#xD;
      including Traditional Chinese for the use in Taiwan. Given the advances and popularity of&#xD;
      mobile technologies, the PmP-Traditional Chinese version has been developed into App software&#xD;
      (PmP-C App) to provide a fun and user-friendly interface to promote communication and active&#xD;
      engagement in the assessment process. The PmP-C App version would be need to establish the&#xD;
      usability, reliability and validity in children with various types of disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study are to: establish usability, reliability, and validity using the&#xD;
      PMP App version, and characterize child-identified participation goals and identify&#xD;
      environmental supports and barriers in children with and without disabilities. Data will be&#xD;
      collected by examination and interviews using the PmP-C App and other measures for&#xD;
      validation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-year cross-sectional study to explore the use of the PmP-C App version with&#xD;
      children with and without disabilities. The estimated participants are 160 pairs of children&#xD;
      with disabilities 6-12 years of age and their caregivers and 160 age-matched peers with&#xD;
      typical development and their caregivers (a total of 640 participants). The design enables&#xD;
      validation of the responses of children with disabilities with various sources (i.e.&#xD;
      caregivers' responses, children without disabilities, and other child-report measures).&#xD;
      Findings of reliability and validity will provide a basis for reporting child-identified&#xD;
      participation goals and environmental factors. The COnsensus-based Standards for the&#xD;
      selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) guideline is used to design a&#xD;
      high-quality validation study. To characterize child-perceived participation and environment,&#xD;
      the data are collected for two groups: one group of children with disabilities (the DD group)&#xD;
      and one group of children without disabilities (the TD group). The design enables examination&#xD;
      of how prioritized activities and frequent encountered environmental supports and barriers&#xD;
      may vary given different capabilities of children with disabilities and peers with typical&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
