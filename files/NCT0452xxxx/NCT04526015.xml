  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increase in CS in recent years makes even a small prevalence of persistent pain after CS&#xD;
      a significant burden, both financially and in terms of quality of life, for a large number of&#xD;
      otherwise healthy young women. Persistent pain after CS has been shown to be associated with&#xD;
      postpartum depression, interferes with daily activities, and causes sleep disturbances, all&#xD;
      of which negatively and directly impact the mother. As a result, the care of the baby by the&#xD;
      mother is affected negatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To adequately control postoperative pain, healthcare providers use a one-size-fits-all&#xD;
      multimodal analgesic approach and sensible opioid prescription with monitoring to prevent&#xD;
      addiction. The challenge is in tailoring this approach to the outliers who may be opioid&#xD;
      tolerant or opioid-sensitive. However, the severity and duration of postoperative pain and&#xD;
      its management may be predictive of developing persistent pain at two to 12 months or later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies revealed different outcomes regarding the analgesic efficacy of II-IH nerve&#xD;
      block for post caesarean pain, inguinal repair and surgery involving the female genital&#xD;
      tract. Moreover, exploring the efficacy of II-IH nerve block could help to tackle sever&#xD;
      postoperative pain after cesarean delivery particularly in settings where there is shortage&#xD;
      of epidural kit supply and availability of strong opioids for pain management. We aimed to&#xD;
      assess the analgesic efficacy of bilateral ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block for&#xD;
      planned caesareans delivery under spinal anaesthesia and evaluate the incidence of persistent&#xD;
      pain with transition from acute to chronic pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be assessed preoperatively by history taking, physical examination, and&#xD;
      laboratory evaluation. On arrival of the patients to the operative room, electrocardiography,&#xD;
      non-invasive blood pressure and pulse oximetry will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be positioned in sitting position to give the spinal anesthesia at&#xD;
      L3-L4/L2-L3 intervertebral level in the midline approach. After local infiltration of skin&#xD;
      and subcutaneous tissue with 2% lignocaine, 25 G B-braun spinal needle will be used to&#xD;
      administer subarachnoid block (SAB) with 2.5 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine (5%) and 20 Âµg of&#xD;
      fentanyl after confirmation of free flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the hub of the&#xD;
      needle. Patients will be coloaded with 10-12 ml/kg (over the period of 15 min) of Ringer's&#xD;
      Lactate (RL) solution at the time of SAB. Thereafter, patients will be placed in supine&#xD;
      position with wedge under the right hip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      64 Patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups (each 32 patients):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B (IL/IH group): Each patient will receive spinal anesthesia plus bilateral&#xD;
           ultrasound-guided IL/IH nerve block. The abdomen will be scanned through anterior&#xD;
           superior iliac spine (ASIS)-umbilicus line. Ilioinguinal nerve can be visualized between&#xD;
           the internal oblique and transverse or external oblique muscles and within 1 to 3 cm&#xD;
           from the ASIS. The iliohypogastric nerve lies immediately adjacent. After negative&#xD;
           aspiration (to exclude intravascular injection), 10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine will be&#xD;
           injected. The same technique will be performed on the other side&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C (Controlled group): Each patient will receive spinal anesthesia alone with no&#xD;
           block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Analgesia Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be given a standardized patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA)&#xD;
      regimen. The disposable PCIA device (Coopdech Syrinjector PCA set; Daiken Medical) contained&#xD;
      30 mg morphine in 45 ml saline. Patients will be instructed on how to use the PCIA device,&#xD;
      which was set with a bolus of 2 mg morphine and a minimum interval of 30 min. If the&#xD;
      analgesic effect was not satisfactory, complementary use of intravenous morphine will be&#xD;
      applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Acute Postoperative Pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 24 hours after surgery, pain intensity will be recorded on a 10-point verbal pain rating&#xD;
      scale ranging from 0 to 10 (VPRS; 0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain imaginable), at rest&#xD;
      (VPRS-R) and while moving into the sitting position (VPRS-S). Pain will be considered none,&#xD;
      mild, moderate, or severe if scored 0, 1 to 3, 4 to 6, or 7 to 10, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Persistent Postoperative Pain (3 and 6 Months) The Short-Form McGill Pain&#xD;
      Questionnaire-Revised (SFMPQ- 2) was designed specifically and validated to assess both&#xD;
      neuropathic and non-neuropathic aspects of chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will report their average and worst pain the week prior to and at the time of the&#xD;
      telephone interview using a previously developed scripted telephone interview. Persistent&#xD;
      pain will be defined as new onset of pain related to the CS, located around the scar or in&#xD;
      the abdomen, and still present at 8 weeks. Chronic pain will be defined if same symptoms were&#xD;
      still present at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements The following parameters will be recorded by an anesthesia resident not included&#xD;
      in the study and blinded to its groups: -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data (Age in month, body mass index, and ASA class)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total consumption of analgesia (mg/kg) in first day postoperatively. (Primary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The time to the first rescue analgesic request. (Secondary outcome) The postoperative&#xD;
           pain score (NRS pain score). Assessment of the presence and intensity of pain was done&#xD;
           immediately after transfer to the ward (0 h) and at 4 h, 6 h , 12 h and 24 h after&#xD;
           surgery both at rest and with movement (turning from side to side) by using verbally&#xD;
           administered Numerical rating scale pain assessment tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of perioperative complications including bradycardia, hypotension, nausea&#xD;
           and vomiting, localized hematoma, infection, or pruritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of chronic pain at 3 &amp; 6 months.&#xD;
