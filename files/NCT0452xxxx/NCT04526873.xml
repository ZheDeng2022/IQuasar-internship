      Annual Wellness Visits (AWVs) are a type of detailed healthcare checkup to which Medicare&#xD;
      beneficiaries are entitled, free of charge, once per year. The purpose of the current study&#xD;
      is to assess what content and communication modality results in the most effective messaging&#xD;
      campaign to encourage Medicare beneficiaries to schedule their AWVs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Annual Wellness Visits (AWVs) are a type of detailed healthcare checkup to which Medicare&#xD;
      beneficiaries are entitled, free of charge, once per year. The Keystone Affordable Care&#xD;
      Organization (KACO), of which Geisinger is a part, is working to increase the number of&#xD;
      eligible patients who take advantage of AWVs via mail and telephone outreach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to assess what content and communication modality results&#xD;
      in the most effective messaging campaign. Patients will either receive a phone call or a&#xD;
      mailed postcard, or they will be part of a no-contact control condition. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      content of the postcard will vary in terms of humor and salience, as well as whether&#xD;
      telehealth is mentioned as an AWV option.* Although telehealth is a great option for patients&#xD;
      who are unable to attend an in-person visit, the latter is preferable in terms of quality of&#xD;
      care. Furthermore, insurance coverage for telehealth visits may not extend indefinitely&#xD;
      beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Highlighting the telehealth option may help attract patients&#xD;
      who would not otherwise get an AWV, increasing the effectiveness of the intervention. On the&#xD;
      other hand, it may unintentionally nudge patients who would otherwise have scheduled an&#xD;
      in-person visit to opt for telehealth instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following research questions will assess effectiveness in increasing patient scheduling&#xD;
      of an AWV:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Are postcards effective compared with a no-contact control condition?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How effective are postcards when compared with phone calls, a presumably more intrusive&#xD;
           type of intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is a humorous cartoon, accompanied by language using examples to make salient the future&#xD;
           health risks that could be prevented, more effective than stock photography of similar&#xD;
           patient-doctor situations (typically used in outreach), accompanied by prevention&#xD;
           language that is less specific?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is it more effective to highlight the availability of telehealth video visits than not&#xD;
           to mention that option?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Are in-person AWVs are scheduled at least as frequently when the telehealth option is&#xD;
           highlighted as when it is not?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included in the study will be patients from 7 KACO partner sites: Caring Community Health&#xD;
      Center, Evangelical Community Hospital, Geisinger, Geisinger-Hm Joint Venture, Holy Spirit,&#xD;
      Wayne Memorial Hospital, and Wright Center. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) will&#xD;
      examine the primary study outcomes as a function of the study arms (between-subjects), with&#xD;
      partner site included as a random effect, assuming high intraclass correlation coefficients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Wayne Memorial Hospital patients will not receive postcards with tele-health content. In&#xD;
      addition, only patients from the following partner sites will be randomized to receive a&#xD;
      phone call: Evangelical Community Hospital, Wayne Memorial Hospital, and the Wright Center.&#xD;
      Geisinger patients will not be randomized to receive phone calls, but Geisinger patients who&#xD;
      are randomized to other conditions may receive phone calls as part of regular operations.&#xD;
      This will be accounted for during analysis as a model regressor.&#xD;
