  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the detection of small pulmonary nodules continuously grows, the intraoperative&#xD;
      localization of small pulmonary nodules is in great demand. The intraoperative localization&#xD;
      nowadays is usually done under local anesthesia before surgery. There is a certain rate of&#xD;
      failure and complication. The result of our early animal experiments show that the pulmonary&#xD;
      surgery marker system can deliver the intraoperative localization safely and precisely under&#xD;
      anesthesia, and the average distance between the localization and the simulated lesion is&#xD;
      less than 5mm during surgery. Therefore, the safety and feasibility of the system require&#xD;
      further evaluation in patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a prospective, mulitiple-center clinical trial initiated by the investigator.&#xD;
      LungBrella marker can be accurately implanted into a predetermined position in the lung&#xD;
      assisted by JediVision software and successfully marked the pulmonary nodules which needs to&#xD;
      undergo Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. The study is expected to enroll 90 patients.&#xD;
      Finally, the effectiveness and safety of the method will be evaluated. This method not only&#xD;
      can complete pulmonary nodule localization in the operating room without occupying the&#xD;
      resources of radiology department, but also can let patients receive pulmonary nodule&#xD;
      location after anesthesia. Thereby the risks during transportation are avoided and the&#xD;
      suffering of patients is reduced.&#xD;
