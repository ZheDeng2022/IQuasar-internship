  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary angiography (CAG) is a diagnostic method used as the gold standard in the diagnosis&#xD;
      of coronary artery disease (CAD), which is increasingly prevalent in developed and developing&#xD;
      countries and is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Although&#xD;
      coronary angiography is one of the best diagnostic methods of CAD, it can cause psychological&#xD;
      problems such as stress, fear, anxiety in patients; It also causes physical problems such as&#xD;
      bleeding, hematom and pain. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods are used by&#xD;
      nurses to solve problems of patients, to ensure their relaxation and to improve their quality&#xD;
      of life. With the development of technology, virtual reality (VR) glasses have been used to&#xD;
      have fun at first, and later to provide pain management and to solve anxiety problems. VR&#xD;
      glasses are an advanced technology that allows the patient to move into a virtual world and&#xD;
      focus his attention on other thoughts, giving less attention to pain and anxiety. During&#xD;
      literature search, no studies were found about the effect of using SG glasses on pain and&#xD;
      anxiety during CAG. This research will be conducted to determine the effect of VR glasses&#xD;
      used during CAG on pain, anxiety and hemodynamic parameters of patients who will experience&#xD;
      coronary angiography for the first time.&#xD;

      Although coronary angiography is widely used in the diagnosis and evaluation of CAD and heart&#xD;
      valve diseases, it causes patients to experience intense stress, anxiety, pain and even fear&#xD;
      of death. The main purpose of nurses before an interventional procedure is to increase the&#xD;
      physiological and mental well-being of the patient and to help them adapt to the procedure.&#xD;
      Various pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods are used to manage the psychological&#xD;
      and physical problems of patients undergoing coronary angiography. Distraction is one of the&#xD;
      non-pharmacological interventions commonly used during medical procedures. Virtual reality&#xD;
      (VR) is a new method that can be used to distract and prepare patients for the procedure&#xD;
      during medical procedures. It is thought to be more effective than traditional methods.&#xD;
      Virtual reality is a computer-generated environment in which three-dimensional interaction is&#xD;
      possible. It projects a wide field of view in front of the user's eye through advanced&#xD;
      head-worn screens (glasses). It is an advanced technology that allows the individual to move&#xD;
      into a virtual environment and focus his attention on other thoughts to less consideration&#xD;
      for pain and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled study to determine the effectiveness of virtual reality&#xD;
      glasses on pain, anxiety and hemodynamic parameters during coronary angiography.The universe&#xD;
      of the study will be the individuals who will have a coronary angiography in the Angiography&#xD;
      Laboratory of the Department of Cardiology, Dr. Siyami Ersek Thoracic and Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Surgery Training and Research Hospital. On the other hand, the sample of the study will&#xD;
      consist of patients who meet the inclusion criteria within the time the study is planned.&#xD;
      Power analysis was performed using the G * Power (v3.1.7) program to determine the number of&#xD;
      samples. It was decided that there should be at least 64 people in the groups. Participants&#xD;
      in the study will be randomly divided into two groups as intervention and control groups.&#xD;
      Before the procedure, patients will be informed about the purpose of the study, and written&#xD;
      and verbal informed consent will be obtained from the patients. Patients in both groups will&#xD;
      be asked to fill in the Personal Information Form before the procedure, and their pain levels&#xD;
      will be evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and their anxiety levels will be&#xD;
      evaluated with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory I (STAI-I). Immediately after the procedure,&#xD;
      the pain levels of the patients with VAS and their anxiety levels will be evaluated with&#xD;
      STAI-I. Virtual reality glasses will be worn on the intervention group just before the&#xD;
      procedure starts and patients will continue to wear VR glasses until the procedure is&#xD;
      completed. In patients selected as the control group, the same evaluations will be made at&#xD;
      the same time interval. SPSS 22.0 (Statistical Package of Social Sciences) package program&#xD;
      will be used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
