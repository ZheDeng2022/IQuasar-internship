  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of synbiotics supplementation on the level of the uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate,&#xD;
      symptoms of constipation, and constipation-related quality of life in end-stage renal disease&#xD;
      patients undergoing hemodialysis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most common gastrointestinal symptoms in end-stage renal disease patients&#xD;
      undergoing hemodialysis is constipation, which is one of the risk factors of microbiota&#xD;
      dysbiosis. One effect of dysbiosis is the increased level of a uremic toxin known as indoxyl&#xD;
      sulfate. The accumulated concentration of indoxyl sulfate in end-stage renal disease patients&#xD;
      undergoing hemodialysis is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn&#xD;
      increases the risk of cardiovascular event. Constipation and an increased risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular event is associated with low quality of life in chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      patients undergoing hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synbiotics administrations had become one of the many ways to improve gut dysbiosis as it is&#xD;
      expected to lower the level of indoxyl sulfate and improve the symptoms of constipation and&#xD;
      constipation-related quality of life. Although studies had investigated the role of&#xD;
      probiotics/prebiotics/synbiotics, the role of synbiotics in lowering the concentration of the&#xD;
      uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate remains inconclusive. Therefore, this study is conducted to&#xD;
      demonstrate the benefits of synbiotics administration in lowering the concentration of&#xD;
      indoxyl sulfate in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis, This is the&#xD;
      first study in Indonesia investigating the effects of synbiotics supplementation in end-stage&#xD;
      renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted on&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis. Patients will be divided into two&#xD;
      arms: synbiotics and placebo. The study will take place in the hemodialysis unit of Dr. Cipto&#xD;
      Mangunkusumo General Hospital in September 2020 to February 2021. A total of 60 participants&#xD;
      will be recruited for the study (30 in each arm), who will be randomized into the synbiotic&#xD;
      arm or the placebo arm. Both investigators and patients will be blinded to the treatment, and&#xD;
      blinding will be conducted by the pharmacy unit of Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who had consented to participate will be assessed for medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination. Food recall evaluation will also be performed by a nutritionist. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected from the patient for laboratory examinations, including haemoglobin, white&#xD;
      blood cells (WBC), platelet, urea, creatinine, albumin, and indoxyl sulfate. Patients will&#xD;
      also be asked to complete two questionnaires: the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms&#xD;
      (PAC-SYM) questionnaire to assess the symptoms of constipation and the Patient Assessment of&#xD;
      Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) questionnaire to assess constipation-related quality&#xD;
      of life. After this, patients will be randomized into one of the two study arms. The data&#xD;
      will serve as baseline data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 2 capsules containing either synbiotics or placebo per day for the next&#xD;
      30 days. Afterwards, the patients will undergo examination to evaluate food recall and side&#xD;
      effects. After evaluation, the patients will once again receive 2 capsules containing either&#xD;
      synbiotics or placebo per day for the next 30 days, and after a total 2 months of&#xD;
      interventions, will undergo examinations similar to that done in baseline examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is the concentration of indoxyl sulfate in end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease patients undergoing hemodialysis. Secondary outcomes include the symptoms of&#xD;
      constipation and constipation-related quality of life in end-stage renal disease patients&#xD;
      undergoing hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be done according to the principles detailed in Helsinki declaration,&#xD;
      Guideline for Good Clinical Practice from ICH Tripartite Guideline (ICH-GCP), and had been&#xD;
      approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of Indonesia University.&#xD;
