  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of botulinum toxin for microstomia (also known as reduced&#xD;
      oral aperture) in scleroderma patients. Botox is a neurotoxin that functions as a paralytic&#xD;
      by preventing the release of acetylcholine to inhibit muscle contracture and decrease&#xD;
      fibrosis by decreasing differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, decreasing&#xD;
      expression of collagen, and increasing expression of matrix metalloproteinase1-3. The study&#xD;
      will include three arms: the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) group who will receive injections&#xD;
      of Botox to the masseter, the perioral group who will receive injections of Botox around the&#xD;
      lips, and a control group who will receive no treatment for ROA. Outcome measurements will&#xD;
      include measurement of oral aperture size through measurement inter-labial distance and&#xD;
      between the upper and lower lips and the inter-incisal distance, patient satisfaction via a&#xD;
      Skindex16 survey, mouth disability via the Mouth Handicap in Systemic Sclerosis Scale&#xD;
      (MHISS), and patient and physician satisfaction using the Visual Analogic Scale (VAS). The&#xD;
      maximum number of subjects to be consented for this study is 30. The study is expected to&#xD;
      last four months per subject from time of consent to last clinical evaluation. Conditions&#xD;
      that may result in a subject exiting the study prior to completion date include&#xD;
      non-compliance, withdrawal of consent, or safety concerns such as adverse events as a result&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>This study will evaluate the use of botulinum toxin for microstomia (reduced oral aperture) in scleroderma patients. The TMJ group will be injected with two units of Botox into four different injection points to each masseter (16 units of Botox total) at the initial visit. No additional Botox will be injected in subsequent visits. Botox is a neurotoxin that functions as a paralytic by preventing the release of acetylcholine to inhibit muscle contracture and decrease fibrosis by decreasing differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, decreasing expression of collagen, and increasing expression of matrix metalloproteinase1</description>
