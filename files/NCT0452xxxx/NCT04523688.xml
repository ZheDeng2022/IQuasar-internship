    <textblock>
      Single arm, monocentric trial to assess the safety and the progression-free survival related&#xD;
      to the combined treatment of dendritic cell vaccine loaded with autologous tumor homogenate&#xD;
      and temozolomide in patients operated for glioblastoma and then treated with standard&#xD;
      radiochemotherapy (according to Stupp regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental treatment consists of an induction phase with 4 weekly doses of dendritic&#xD;
      cell vaccine (10x10exp6 cells) intradermally administered (weeks 1-4), followed by a&#xD;
      maintenance phase consisting of 28 days cycles with vaccine administration (start on week 7)&#xD;
      and adjuvant temozolomide (150-200mg/m2/day) assumed orally from day 1 to 5 q28 (start on&#xD;
      week 5). The combined maintenance treatment will continue until disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent by the patient, or up to a maximum of 1 year&#xD;
      of treatments. After disease progression or the end of maintenance phase, is foreseen a&#xD;
      one-year follow-up phase for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives are clinical activity and safety of the study treatment. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are the evaluation of the prognostic role of the positive Delayed-Type&#xD;
      Hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test after at least four vaccine administrations, the OS and the&#xD;
      immunological efficacy of the study treatment. A series of exploratory objectives will be&#xD;
      also assessed on samples from patients who participate to this optional part of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simon's two-stage design (Simon, 1989) will be used for the sample size calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned interim analysis will be done after the recruitment of the first 9 evaluable&#xD;
      patients for toxicity and for efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If study will not be stopped due to lack of safety or efficacy, a total of 28 evaluable&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to events (PFS and OS) will be calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method and the analysis&#xD;
      was performed on the eligible population. For the primary objective, the proportion of&#xD;
      patients without progression at three months from leukapheresis date will be evaluated. The&#xD;
      proportion of patients experiencing vaccine-related grade ≥ 3 adverse events (AEs) during the&#xD;
      treatment will be inferred by means of the two-sided Clopper-Pearson, or a more appropriate&#xD;
      one, 95% confidence interval. Descriptive statistics will be used to assess the extent of the&#xD;
      secondary endpoints.&#xD;
