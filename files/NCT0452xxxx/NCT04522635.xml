  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized patients often suffer from an acute shutdown of kidney function secondary to&#xD;
      infections, use of antibiotics, or use of intravenous contrast agents. This results in the&#xD;
      accumulation of toxic substances and retention of fluid in the body. Dialysis techniques are&#xD;
      often needed to manage these patients to remove the retained toxic substances and extra fluid&#xD;
      and allow the kidney time to recover. The amount and duration of fluid accumulation have been&#xD;
      associated with a higher risk of death and longer hospital stays. Correction of fluid&#xD;
      overload with dialysis has been shown to be beneficial in improving the outcomes from these&#xD;
      patients. Most patients are quite sick and often have low levels of a blood protein called&#xD;
      albumin that makes them more prone to developing low blood pressure during dialysis and&#xD;
      limits the ability of dialysis to remove solutes and fluid adequately. Often dialysis&#xD;
      sessions are complicated by the development of low blood pressures and symptoms such as&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, and headaches that further compromises dialysis efficacy. In this study,&#xD;
      the hypothesis that addition of intravenous albumin during the dialysis session will improve&#xD;
      the ability to remove fluid and reduce the incidence of low blood pressure during dialysis&#xD;
      thereby improving patient tolerance and the efficacy of the procedure will be tested.&#xD;
      Patients with acute kidney failure or end-stage Renal Disease who need dialysis for fluid&#xD;
      removal will be allocated to receive albumin or saline as intravenous fluids during&#xD;
      individual dialysis sessions and information on how much fluid can be removed and how many&#xD;
      complications occur in each session will be recorded. Dialysis sessions with albumin will be&#xD;
      compared with those with saline alone to determine the benefit of adding albumin to the&#xD;
      treatment. Information obtained from this study will allow physicians to manage patients&#xD;
      requiring dialysis for acute kidney failure more effectively and help improve outcomes.&#xD;

      This study will address the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Can the utilization of intravenous albumin enhance the efficacy of fluid removal in&#xD;
      hospitalized patients undergoing dialysis for AKI or ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Addition of albumin solutions to dialysis therapy will enhance the efficacy of fluid&#xD;
           removal (total amount of fluid removed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Albumin solutions will improve the efficiency of fluid removal by dialysis per unit time&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Albumin addition will reduce the time to achieving and maintaining fluid balance and&#xD;
           correcting fluid overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Can the utilization of IV albumin improve the safety of fluid removal during dialysis?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Addition of albumin solutions will reduce the frequency of Intradialytic hypotension&#xD;
           associated with fluid removal on dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Albumin solutions given during dialysis will reduce the incidence and magnitude of&#xD;
           myocardial stunning associated with fluid removal on dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Albumin solutions given during dialysis will reduce post-dialysis symptoms AIM 3: Does&#xD;
           utilization of IV albumin improve the microcirculation in hospitalized patients&#xD;
           undergoing fluid removal with dialysis?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with AKI or ESRD will have deranged microcirculatory profile as compared to&#xD;
           normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During fluid removal with dialysis changes in microcirculation correlate with&#xD;
           alterations in hemodynamics related to the rate and amount of fluid removal&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Utilization of IV albumin during dialysis will reduce the microcirculatory stress of&#xD;
           fluid removal&#xD;
