  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Only limited data exist on the benefit of online hemodiafiltration in patient with Acute&#xD;
      kidney injury. The objective of this pilot RCT is to assess the feasibility of a large&#xD;
      multicentre RCT to determine whether, in patients with AKI requiring acute renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy, does exposure to Online Hemodiafiltration reduce the inflammatory status and improve&#xD;
      renal recovery compared to conventional intermittent hemodialysis at the ICU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite sparse data on the advantages of hemodiafiltration over conventional hemodialysis for&#xD;
      intermittent dialysis, there is limited data comparing these modalities in AKI from various&#xD;
      aetiologies in critically ill patients. As RCTs involving renal replacement therapy at the&#xD;
      ICU are exceptionally challenging to complete, thus a rigorous RCT based on appropriate&#xD;
      sample size and relevant clinical outcomes is crucial. The objective of this pilot RCT is to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of a larger multicentre RCT to determine whether, in patients with AKI&#xD;
      requiring acute renal replacement therapy, does exposure to Post-dilution Hemodiafiltration&#xD;
      or Pre-dilution Hemodiafiltration reduce the inflammatory status and improve renal recovery&#xD;
      compared to conventional intermittent hemodialysis at the ICU. As post-dilution HDF has never&#xD;
      been adequately evaluated in an ICU context, comparison between pre-dilution and&#xD;
      post-dilution HDF is also required to confirm feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proof-of-concept pilot trial will focus on three feasibility endpoints. It will be&#xD;
      considered successful if the following criteria are achieved :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protocol adherence: If ≥85% of overall dialysis sessions are administered per-protocol&#xD;
           according to the allocated modality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence to follow-up: If it was possible to obtain end-of-study outcomes in ≥90% of&#xD;
           participants, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant accrual: If the average monthly enrolment is 4 or more participants per&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
