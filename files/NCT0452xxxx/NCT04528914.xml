  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, randomized, controlled, quadruple-blinded, superiority trial is performed&#xD;
      to test the hypothesis that children with IBS and FAP-NOS who receive a low-FODMAP diet will&#xD;
      have a lower mean abdominal pain intensity score compared with those who receive a regular&#xD;
      diet after 4 weeks of intervention.&#xD;

      Introduction. Evidence from studies in adults documents that fermentable oligosaccharides,&#xD;
      disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) may be triggers of symptoms in&#xD;
      individuals with functional abdominal pain disorders. However, in children with FAPDs, there&#xD;
      is a need for high-quality evidence regarding the dietary management. We aim to assess the&#xD;
      effects of a low-FODMAP diet compared with a regular diet for the management of children with&#xD;
      FAPDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. In this trial, seventy-four children aged 8 to 18 years with a Functional Abdominal&#xD;
      Pain Disorder (Irritable Bowel Syndrome or Functional Abdominal Pain-Not Otherwise&#xD;
      Specified), diagnosed according to the Rome IV criteria, will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      receive either a low-FODMAP diet or a regular diet for 4 weeks.A primary outcome will be the&#xD;
      percentage of the responders, defined as the participants who have at least 30% improvement&#xD;
      in abdominal pain intensity on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) during the last week of the&#xD;
      trial compared with baseline, that is at least equal to the Reliable Change Index (≥ 25 mm&#xD;
      change on VAS).&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome will be the percentage of the responders, defined as the participants who have at least 30% improvement in abdominal pain intensity on a 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) during the last week of the trial compared with baseline, that is at least equal to the Reliable Change Index (≥ 25 mm change on VAS).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in stool consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>At week 1, 2, 3 and 4 from baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>Bristol Stool Scale is a seven-point scale that distinguish seven pictures of different forms of stool, ranging from the hardest (type 1) to the softest (type 7).&#xD;
At baseline, participants with IBS and a stool consistency score &gt; 5 on the Bristol Stool Scale will be classified as having IBS with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D); if the stool consistency score is &lt; 3, the subjects will be classified as having IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C).&#xD;
Responders will be subjects with improvement in their average stool consistency during the last week of the trial compared with baseline [≥1 higher Bristol Stool Scale score in case of IBS with predominant constipation, or at least one lower score in case of IBS with predominant diarrhea].</description>

    <measure>Change in Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>At week 1, 2, 3 and 4 from baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The GSRS is a 15-item interview-based rating scale. Each item is assessed in a seven-point graded Likert-type scale (one means no symptoms, and seven represents very troublesome symptoms), then total score is calculated.</description>

    <measure>Change in KIDSCREEN-10 index total score</measure>
    <time_frame>At week 1, 2, 3 and 4 from baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>KIDSCREEN-10 index is a 11-item instrument to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Each item is assessed in a 5-point scale with higher values indicating a higher HRQoL. Total score is calculated.</description>

    <measure>Change in World Health Organization Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>At week 1, 2, 3 and 4 from baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The WHO-5 consists of five statements regarding the physical well-being, assessed in a six-point scale (in which zero means at no time, and five represents all of the time). Total raw score is then calculated, ranging from 0 to 25 which is multiplied by four, therefore the final score ranges from 0 (the worst imaginable well-being) to 100 (the best imaginable well-being).</description>

    <description>The BW (kg) and standing height (cm) will be measured following standard methods. Body Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated using the standard equation. BMI-for-age z-score will be computed using the WHO AnthroPlus software v1.0.4., then assessed and monitored over time using the WHO growth charts.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of compliant participants</measure>
    <time_frame>0-4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage compliance in each group will be calculated. A compliant participant is considered as one who consumes at least 80% of the provided diet.&#xD;
The percent of each meal which the subject consumed (&lt;50%, 50-79% or 80-100%) each day will be reported by participant in a study diary (developed by research team); the additional snacks consumed also will be reported daily (characteristics and amount). Snacks and meals outside the meal plan will be assessed separately.</description>
