      Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined as a clinical entity originated from trauma or&#xD;
      other conditions, and remains challenging to diagnose and treat effectively. Threre is the&#xD;
      controversy in diagnosing, treating ACS. It was found that there was no criterion about the&#xD;
      ACS, and result unnecessary osteotomy. The presence of clinical assessment (5P) always means&#xD;
      the necrosis of muscles and was the most serious or irreversible stage of ACS. Besides&#xD;
      pressure methods, the threshold of pressure identifying ACS was also controversial.&#xD;
