  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Higher doses of rifampicin as a means of more efficient use of this pivotal TB drug has shown&#xD;
      promising results and might become standard in future. This means that higher doses of&#xD;
      rifampicin will be co-administered with many other drugs taken by TB patients, including&#xD;
      anti-retroviral, anti-diabetic, cardiovascular and other drugs. Therefore, in this study the&#xD;
      aim is to quantitatively assess the drug interaction potential of high dose rifampicin (~40&#xD;
      mg/kg daily dose, the currently available maximum tolerated dose) with respect to five major&#xD;
      human drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes and P-gp in comparison to the conventional dose of 10&#xD;
      mg/kg daily in pulmonary TB patients. A phenotyping approach with single administration of&#xD;
      several selective substrates for multiple enzymes will be used, in order to prevent multiple&#xD;
      drug-drug interaction studies.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is able and willing to provide written, informed consent prior to all&#xD;
             trial-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is aged between 18 and 65 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is a diagnosed pulmonary TB patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is currently being treated with a daily dose of 10 mg/kg rifampicin,&#xD;
             i.e. 450 mg daily for patients with a body weight below 55 kg and 600 mg daily for&#xD;
             participants with a body weight above 55 kg. This is in correspondence with the local&#xD;
             South African TB treatment programme. Furthermore, the participant has to be in the&#xD;
             continuation phase of the treatment regimen (i.e. month 3 to 6), has demonstrated&#xD;
