  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess peoples' satisfaction with their diet based on adhering to&#xD;
      three different meal-timing protocols for one week each: (1) Time-restricted feeding (TRF);&#xD;
      (2) Intermittent fasting (IF); and (3) Alternate day fasting (ADF). The overall goal of this&#xD;
      study is to determine if people would find it easy or difficult to follow these diet&#xD;
      protocols for the purpose of weight management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fasting and time-restricted feeding (TRF) have become increasingly popular in nutrition&#xD;
      research due to the potential health benefits they may provide. Several animal studies, and&#xD;
      more recently some human studies, have indicated regular meal-timing (i.e. eating mostly in&#xD;
      the day) or fasting have been beneficial for controlling weight, blood pressure, cholesterol,&#xD;
      glucose, and insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These types of eating patterns may offer the same &quot;anti-aging&quot; health benefits as traditional&#xD;
      caloric restriction (i.e. consistent and routine adherence to a very low-calorie diet).While&#xD;
      caloric restriction is considered the gold standard for weight management, weight regain&#xD;
      often limits the long-term effectiveness of this approach. People often experience increases&#xD;
      in hunger, which make it difficult to sustain this type of behavior.Therefore, researchers&#xD;
      are turning to these dietary approaches as alternatives to low-calorie diets in an effort to&#xD;
      obtain the same benefits, but with less burden on participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is not clear if the adherence to these types of diet protocols are any better&#xD;
      than a low-calorie diet. Would people be more satisfied with meal-timing or fasting over a&#xD;
      traditional very low-calorie diet? That is the main research question of this study.&#xD;
