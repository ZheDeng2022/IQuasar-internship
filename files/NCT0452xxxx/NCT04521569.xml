  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if adding a drug called Regadenoson to the EVLP&#xD;
      circulation reservoir during perfusion of marginal donor lungs will help increase the&#xD;
      likelihood that the donor lungs will become usable for transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung transplantation currently is one way to treat a variety of serious diseases and&#xD;
      conditions such as emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and cystic fibrosis. Ischemia Reperfusion&#xD;
      Injury (IRI) is a known problem that can happen during the first few days after a lung&#xD;
      transplant. IRI can cause swelling of the lungs and low levels of oxygen. The most serious&#xD;
      type of IRI can cause the transplanted lung to not work properly, it can even cause death.&#xD;
      While new treatments and practices have been put into place to lower the chances of IRI, it&#xD;
      is still a difficult problem to overcome after a lung transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecule called Adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR) have been studied in animals with IRI for many&#xD;
      years. Some of these studies suggest that with the use of A2AR agonist, the chance of IRI may&#xD;
      be lowered or prevented. Regadenoson is a selective A2AR agonist.&#xD;

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is rehabilitation (yes, no) for marginal donor lungs that undergo ex-vivo perfusion using a &quot;lung box&quot; as assessed by the transplant surgeon and utilizing the &quot;Toronto Method&quot; clinical protocol. Rate of rehabilitation is defined as the proportion of sets of lungs that underwent EVLP with/without Regadenoson treatment and are determined to be eligible for implant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Primary Lung Graft Dysfunction (PGD) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a clinical entity that reflects the development of early acute lung injury after lung transplantation. PGD severity is graded between 0 and 3 and it is measured at 6h, 12h, 24h, 48h and 72 hours after lung transplantation. A score of Score 0 means no PGD and 1-3 increasingly more severe. 3 is so severe requires ECMO support.</description>

The donor lungs will be perfused with Regadenoson at a dosage of 1.44 microgram/kg/min (based on donor's weight) for a minimum of three hours and maximum of four hours, using a pediatric syringe pump into the EVLP circuit (XVIVO Perfusion System). The infusion will begin within 10 minutes of the start of the EVLP procedure. Once the EVLP is complete the lungs are re-flushed with Perfadex solution (removing the Steen™ solution and Regadenoson; standard for EVLP).</description>
