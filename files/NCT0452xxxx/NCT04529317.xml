    <textblock>
      Quinoa is a pseudo-cereal and has potential health benefits and exceptional nutritional&#xD;
      value. It is a food rich in proteins of high biological value, in unsaturated fats and fiber,&#xD;
      it is also a grain low in carbohydrates and with a low glycemic index. Concretely, quinoa&#xD;
      could produce a benefit on postprandial glycemia that would result in lower type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (T2D) incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-over design pilot clinical study with a nutritional intervention for 8 weeks were&#xD;
      performed: 4 weeks on a regular diet (RD) and 4 weeks on a quinoa diet (QD). Nine subjects&#xD;
      aged ≥65 years with prediabetes were monitored during the first 4 weeks of RD with daily&#xD;
      dietary records and FreeStyle Libre®. Subsequently, participants started the DQ where quinoa&#xD;
      and 100% quinoa-based products replaced foods rich in complex carbohydrates that they&#xD;
      regularly consumed by the first 4 weeks of DR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The glycemic measurements recorded by the sensors were considered as functions of time and&#xD;
      the effects of nutrients consumed at the intended time period were analyzed by means of&#xD;
      function on scalar regression (fosr) model.&#xD;

      The study was a cross-over pilot clinical study consisting of two periods. The first period&#xD;
      was only an observational and monitoring phase where participants just continued with their&#xD;
      regular diet (RD), for this reason all participants initiated this period and wash-out term&#xD;
      was no needed. Subsequently, with the data of the first phase obtained, the subjects began&#xD;
      the second period in which they had to undergo a nutritional intervention with a quinoa diet&#xD;
      (QD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of six visits plus two quinoa products collection days were programmed. After the&#xD;
      pre-study visit (V0) which took place a week before start nutritional intervention and where&#xD;
      researchers obtained signed informed consent, participants were summoned for a first visit&#xD;
      (V1) where they were explained how they should fill in the dietary records and they were&#xD;
      applied with the FreeStyle Libre®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects then began RD, a period of 4 weeks during which only their normal life was&#xD;
      monitored. After the first 14 days of this, a second visit (V2) was made where the dietary&#xD;
      record was collected that would serve to account for their usual consumption of cereals,&#xD;
      flours, tubers and legumes, the FreeStyle Libre® sensor was also collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last day on RD period, on day 28, they were cited (V3) in consultation where blood&#xD;
      samples after an 8 hours fast, anthropometrics measurements and blood pressure measure where&#xD;
      obtained and for the placement of the new FreeStyle Libre® sensor. Participants were asked&#xD;
      about their physical activity and exercise practice during those past 4 weeks by a short&#xD;
      questionnaire adapted from the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire for&#xD;
      individuals of advanced age (VREM questionnaire) and a new empty 14-day dietary record was&#xD;
      given. In addition, the volunteers received the first foods with quinoa to initiate QD the&#xD;
      next day. Products were delivered weekly, for conservation reasons but also to ensure that&#xD;
      they followed an adequate consumption, they had to go through consultation to pick up the&#xD;
      product and gave the researchers the empty packs where quinoa products had been.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the next visit the day 42 (V4) the Freestyle Libre® sensor was collected and the filled&#xD;
      dietary record was collected. Finally, after 28 days of quinoa diet they were summoned for&#xD;
      the last visit the day 56 (V5) where all the determinations were repeated identically as V3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the premise that the products created replaced not only grains, legumes or tubers, but&#xD;
      also farinaceous commonly consumed by the participants and that only the cereal fraction was&#xD;
      modified, similar products based on quinoa flour were created. The creation of these products&#xD;
      was necessary, after conducting a market search where it was observed that there was not&#xD;
      enough food to replace those consumed since these had percentages of quinoa flour not&#xD;
      exceeding 20-30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, apart from delivering quinoa, quinoa flakes and quinoa flour to the participants, they&#xD;
      were given products created with ≥70% quinoa flour and were biscuits, crackers, brioche,&#xD;
      sponge cake, baguette bread, sliced bread and pasta. Moreover, a quinoa-based recipe was&#xD;
      delivered with eight commonly consumed recipes that replaced the tuber, legume or grain of&#xD;
      the recipe. Each subject received the equivalent of what they consumed according to their RD&#xD;
      dietary records. Thus, only if the volunteer had indicated that he consumed sponge cake was&#xD;
      the quinoa-based product delivered to him.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive data are presented as the mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and&#xD;
      interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables, and the frequencies and percentages (%)&#xD;
      for categorical variables. Anthropometric measurements, blood test variables and dietary&#xD;
      intake were compared at different times using the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test&#xD;
      because normality and equality of variance could not be assumed due to small sample size&#xD;
      (n=9). In order to compare variables related to dietary patterns, mean value for dietary&#xD;
      intake, including all meals, was considered for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The glucose level monitoring sensor takes measurements at discrete time points for each&#xD;
      patient. Therefore, firstly the glucose curves have been linearly interpolated in order to&#xD;
      have observations for each patient at equal time points. A first sight to the glucose curves&#xD;
      over the day shown that they were more homogeneous around breakfast than around other later&#xD;
      meals intakes. Therefore, the glucose concentration values corresponding to the breakfast&#xD;
      were considered as a function of time in minutes over the interval t= [-30,120], that begins&#xD;
      half an hour before the start of breakfast and ends two hours later. Before constructing a&#xD;
      functional model, the functional data were time aligned in order to reduce the differences&#xD;
      between different patients and/or different days (for instance, some patients could mark the&#xD;
      starting time of breakfast systematically before than others, or spend systematically more&#xD;
      time in breakfast than the average). The time alignment has been done by warping functions,&#xD;
      using the function WFDA in the R package fdapace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the glucose level curves have been synchronized, a functional regression analysis was&#xD;
      conducted to model the effect of diet type, patient and nutrient intake on monitored glucose&#xD;
      levels. Three different explanatory variables have been considered: diet type with two&#xD;
      categories (regular and Quinoa diets), patient indicator (categorical variable with nine&#xD;
      levels) and the contents in different nutrients. The breakfast glucose curves are handled as&#xD;
      the functional response variable. To study the relationship between these variables function&#xD;
      on scalar regression (fosr) models were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, the univariate effect of the diet type on glucose curves have been analyzed and then&#xD;
      more complex fosr models with two factors (diet and patient factors) and scalar variables&#xD;
      (nutrients) have been constructed. The most complex model including all effects of the&#xD;
      independent variables is defined by a specific-created equation. The functional regression&#xD;
      models have been fitted by penalized flexible functional regression, as implemented in the&#xD;
      function pffr of the R package refund.&#xD;
