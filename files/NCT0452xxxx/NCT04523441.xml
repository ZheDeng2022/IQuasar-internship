      The App-eMot-Quali project proposed here is the first phase in the implementation of a care&#xD;
      pathway supported by a digital tool. It consists of a qualitative study allowing individual&#xD;
      interviews to be conducted with parents of infants at high risk of cerebral palsy and health&#xD;
      professionals in order to identify and precisely describe the needs and difficulties present&#xD;
      during the child's rehabilitative care during the first months of life.&#xD;
