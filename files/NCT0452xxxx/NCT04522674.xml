    <measure>PROMIS Survey for Low Back Pain Function (PROMIS-29)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after intervention, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>NIH validated PROMIS score for physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, ability to participate in social activities, pain interference, and pain intensity (PROMIS- 29 Profile v2.0). A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured.For negatively-worded concepts like Anxiety,a T-score of 60 is one SD worse than average.By comparison,an Anxiety T-score of 40 is one SD better than average.However,for positively-worded concepts like Physical Function-Mobility,a T-score of 60 is one SD better than average while a T-score of 40 is one SD worse than average.</description>
