      This is a two-step, prospective study using Dilapan-S for preinduction cervical ripening.&#xD;
      Phase one determines what route of ultrasound will be most beneficial to visualize Dilapan-S&#xD;
      rods during the induction process. This study will take place on the Labor and Delivery Unit&#xD;
      of Sentara Norfolk General Hospital. Only women who have been scheduled for a medical or&#xD;
      elective induction can be recruited. Three routes of ultrasound will be conducted in women&#xD;
      with gauze placement with the Dilapan-S and without gauze placement with Dilapan-S. This will&#xD;
      require 4 extra ultrasound examinations each lasting less than 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase two of the study, the purpose is to objectively evaluate the rate of cervical&#xD;
      dilation using a predetermined route of ultrasound in women using the preinduction agent,&#xD;
      Dilapan-S. This study will establish and project the maximal rate of cervical change to&#xD;
      determine what time frame is most beneficial for keeping Dilapan-S insitu during the&#xD;
      induction process. It will also objectively establish if the presence of soaked gauze&#xD;
      placement with the Dilapan-S affects the rate of Dilapan-S change. At time intervals of&#xD;
      approximately 3, 6, 8 and 12 hours, the investigators plan to assess predetermined data&#xD;
      collection points with the Dilapan-S in place. Each ultrasound should take a maximum of 5&#xD;
      minutes. The Dilapan-S rods will be removed at hour 12 and the next steps in the induction&#xD;
      process will be based on local practice guidelines. Lastly, subjects will be asked to fill&#xD;
      out a patient satisfaction survey both immediately after Dilapan-S placement and immediately&#xD;
      after Dilapan-S removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine, by ultrasound, the rate of cervical&#xD;
      dilation using DILAPAN-S for pre-induction cervical ripening. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that DILAPAN-S will achieve its maximal rate of change in cervical dilation within the first&#xD;
      six hours of placement. A secondary aim of this study is to determine whether rates of&#xD;
      cervical dilation differ between patients who have gauze inserted with Dilapan-S and patients&#xD;
      who do not have gauze inserted. The investigators hypothesize that the change in dilation&#xD;
      across time points will be greater in the DILAPAN-S with soaked-gauze group compared with the&#xD;
      Dilapan-S only group. The third aim of this study is to assess patient satisfaction scores&#xD;
      and determine whether satisfaction scores differ between patients who have gauze inserted&#xD;
      with Dilapan-S and patients who do not.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-step, single center, prospective study evaluating the use of Dilapan-S for&#xD;
      preinduction cervical ripening. Phase one of the study involves a pilot study to assess the&#xD;
      best approach to imaging of the cervix following Dilapan-S placement. Placement of Dilapan-S&#xD;
      will be in accordance to FDA guidelines and will be performed in the exact same manner in&#xD;
      phase 1 and phase 2 of the study. The pilot study will be conducted on 4 patients (2:&#xD;
      placement with gauze and 2: placement without gauze) who are scheduled for a medical or&#xD;
      elective induction at Sentara Norfolk General's Labor and Delivery Unit. Consent for the&#xD;
      study will be obtained on the Labor and Delivery Unit prior to the start of induction. After&#xD;
      placement of Dilapan-S in accordance with FDA standards, the investigators plan to perform&#xD;
      transabdominal, transvaginal, and transperineal ultrasound to determine the optimal route of&#xD;
      cervical visualization in order to obtain individual Dilapan-S diameter measurements, in&#xD;
      addition to, internal os cervical diameter, overall cervical length, and 3D cervical volume&#xD;
      measurements. Safety of ultrasound examination during pregnancy has been proven for both the&#xD;
      mother and fetus and given that the ultrasound will be limited to the cervix during&#xD;
      measurements, no fetal ultrasound exposure is expected. The ultrasound methods that will be&#xD;
      performed will follow the &quot;As Low As Reasonably Achievable&quot; ALARA principle set forth by the&#xD;
      American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM). Preparation and cleaning of the&#xD;
      endovaginal probes and safe handling will be observed throughout the study. Each route of&#xD;
      ultrasound will be performed on two patients with saturated gauze (with sterile water)&#xD;
      placement at the time of Dilapan-S placement to determine route of optimal visualization.&#xD;
      Similarly, each route of ultrasound will be performed on two separate patients without gauze&#xD;
      placement at the time of Dilapan-S insertion to determine the route of optimal visualization.&#xD;
      Ultrasound evaluation will be performed at approximately 3, 6, 8 and 12 hours post Dilapan-S&#xD;
      placement to ensure that visualization is not changed during the Dilapan-S dilation. At each&#xD;
      time point, each ultrasound route will take approximately 5 minutes or less to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Two:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the pilot study, and selection of optimal method to image the cervix with&#xD;
      Dilapan-S placement, women who are scheduled for a medical or elective induction will be&#xD;
      screened and consented at the Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS) Maternal Fetal Medicine&#xD;
      office at Hofheimer Hall. After consent is obtained, a baseline bishop score, 2D and 3D&#xD;
      transvaginal ultrasound to assess cervical length along with transabdominal estimated fetal&#xD;
      weight will be obtained by the primary investigator within 72 hours of the scheduled&#xD;
      induction at Hofheimer Hall in a scheduled research-only visit. Cervical dilation will be&#xD;
      assessed by digital exam at the time of bishop scoring. Cervical length is to be assessed&#xD;
      according to CLEAR guidelines. An ultrasound estimated fetal weight will be performed and&#xD;
      based on the Hadlock formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women enrolled in the study will undergo induction of labor at Sentara Norfolk General&#xD;
      Hospital. Women will be randomly allocated to 1 of 2 arms of the study. The first arm will&#xD;
      assess the predetermined cervical measurements with placement of approximately 2 gauze that&#xD;
      are saturated in sterile water during the initial Dilapan-S insertion. The second arm of the&#xD;
      study will again assess the predetermined cervical measurements without placement of gauze&#xD;
      during the initial Dilapan-S insertion. Insertion of Dilapan-S is to be performed by 4-5&#xD;
      trained operators and will follow an EVMS-OBGYN approved protocol. Women will complete&#xD;
      continuous cardiotocography monitoring for 20 minutes prior to the Dilapan-S (rod size 4 x 65&#xD;
      mm) placement as per the manufacturer's instructions. At the time of placement, consent will&#xD;
      again be confirmed, and contraindications reassessed. The number of rods to be placed will&#xD;
      vary based on the patient's parity, but on average is generally 3-5 rods. Again, ultrasound&#xD;
      evaluation will be performed at approximately 3, 6, 8 and 12 hours post Dilapan-S placement&#xD;
      to measure the prespecified data collection points. At each time interval, each ultrasound&#xD;
      route will take approximately 5 minutes or less to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine, by ultrasound, the rate of cervical&#xD;
      dilation using DILAPAN-S for pre-induction cervical ripening. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that DILAPAN-S will achieve its maximal rate of change in cervical dilation within the first&#xD;
      six hours of placement. A secondary aim of the study is to determine whether rates of&#xD;
      cervical dilation differ between patients who have gauze inserted with Dilapan-S and patients&#xD;
      who do not have gauze inserted. The investigators hypothesize that the change in dilation&#xD;
      across time points will be greater in the DILAPAN-S with soaked-gauze group compared with the&#xD;
      Dilapan-S only group. The third aim of the study is to assess patient satisfaction scores and&#xD;
      determine whether satisfaction scores differ between patients who have gauze inserted with&#xD;
      Dilapan-S and patients who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening/recruitment/consenting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet criteria for inclusion in the study will be approached for participation.&#xD;
      Women scheduled for induction of labor at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital will be&#xD;
      approached. Written informed consent will be obtained from the patients by the primary&#xD;
      investigator and by the study collaborators. If patients agree to participate, women&#xD;
      undergoing medical or elective induction of labor will have their preinduction cervical&#xD;
      ripening portion completed with DILAPAN-S in accordance with FDA labelling. Coordination,&#xD;
      management, and data collection is to be collected by the vested authors. IRB approval is to&#xD;
      be obtained before the study is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be available to the manufacturer after statistical analysis is completed and&#xD;
      will not be shared with the manufacturer during study execution. The manufacturer company&#xD;
      will not be involved in data analysis and all data will be independently analyzed by EVMS&#xD;
      Healthcare Analytics and Delivery Science Institute (HADSI). The results of this study will&#xD;
      be presented at conferences or published in a peer-review journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information will be obtained from the electronic medical record. The data will be&#xD;
      kept on a password secured EVMS computer. An encrypted USB flash drive will be used to&#xD;
      transfer data. The data will be identified and linked to the patient using the medical record&#xD;
      number (MRN). During data analysis, all patient identifiers will be deleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI will review the list of scheduled inductions at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital to&#xD;
      determine if patients meet inclusion criteria. Once inclusion criteria is met, written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from the patient by the PI, study coordinator, or&#xD;
      collaborator at the patient's next scheduled prenatal visit.The data collected will be kept&#xD;
      on a password secured computer. An encrypted USB flash drive will be used to transfer data.&#xD;
      The data will be linked via MRN, which is needed to access the demographic data and will be&#xD;
      deleted when the data is analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits/follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study visits will be needed during the trial. The subject participation will be considered&#xD;
      complete when the subject is discharged home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who withdraw from the study after inclusion will be excluded from further follow-up.&#xD;
      Data collected until the time of withdrawal will be analyzed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI, research coordinator, and collaborators will ensure that all aspects of data quality&#xD;
      adhere to the study design. This will include monitoring for adherence to consent procedures,&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, valid abstraction, correct entry, timeliness and&#xD;
      responsiveness to data queries. Data will be collected and stored with the participant ID&#xD;
      code only. The master enrollment log linking patient identifiers with study ID numbers will&#xD;
      be kept in a password protected database on the Ob/Gyn department's internal server. Several&#xD;
      data collection forms will be used. Data on these forms will be devoid of personal&#xD;
      identifiers and will be securely stored at the division offices. The research coordinator&#xD;
      will be available to monitor the data and correct any discrepancies based on source documents&#xD;
      if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures to maintain confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be assigned a study number with personally identifiable information deleted&#xD;
      or removed. If needed, charts will be reviewed in the medical records area. Subjects'&#xD;
      information will be de-identified and tagged with a number. Data will be collected and stored&#xD;
      on a password-protected computer. Data will be collected in REDCap, or on paper form if&#xD;
      REDCap is not available. REDCap data collection tool will be created by the PI in conjunction&#xD;
      with EVMS HADSI and will reflect variables outlined in the study data dictionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Recruitment Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to recruit a total of 50 participants for this study. This sample size&#xD;
      was selected based on investigators' estimate of number of women likely to meet study&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and choose to participate over a one-year time frame. 4 total patients&#xD;
      will be counted in the first phase, and 40 total in the second phase with 6 patients&#xD;
      accounting for a 12% attrition rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 50 participants will be randomized for the study. Stratified block randomization&#xD;
      with block size of 4 will be used to allocate participants on a 1:1 ratio to the two study&#xD;
      groups (DILAPAN-S alone and DILAPAN-S with gauze). Randomization will be stratified by parity&#xD;
      (yes/no). Randomization scheme will be generated by EVMS HADSI prior to the start of&#xD;
      enrollment using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Randomization of participants&#xD;
      will be performed by study PI in REDCap at the time of the baseline visit after eligibility&#xD;
      has been confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of the participants and clinician researcher&#xD;
      will not be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be assessed for both study groups. Univariate analysis will be&#xD;
      used to examine the distribution of maternal baseline variables and outcomes. Continuous&#xD;
      baseline variables will be presented as mean (standard deviation) and categorical baseline&#xD;
      variables will be presented as count (percent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the rate of dilation across study time points, mean change (± SD) in cervical&#xD;
      dilation and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated and plotted for each group. Cervical&#xD;
      dilation over time will be modeled with best-fit equations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether there are significant differences in dilation between the two groups,&#xD;
      general linear models will be used, controlling for baseline dilation, baseline bishop score,&#xD;
      and parity. To assess whether there are significant differences in composite satisfaction&#xD;
      scores between groups, general linear models will be used, controlling for baseline dilation,&#xD;
      baseline bishop score, and parity. All hypothesis testing will be carried out at the 95%&#xD;
      significance level, unless otherwise specified, with a p value of &lt;.05 accepted as&#xD;
      statistically significant. All statistical analyses will be performed in collaboration with&#xD;
      the EVMS Healthcare Analytics and Delivery Science Institute (HADSI) using SAS version 9.4&#xD;
      (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).&#xD;
