      To identify the occurrence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular&#xD;
      events and all-cause death in patients with baseline prediabetes and stage1 hypertension&#xD;
      after18 years follow up, then explore the role of risk factors. After assessing the&#xD;
      association between BP categories and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, to&#xD;
      analyze the risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality by blood glucose categories and&#xD;
      BP categories combined by using multiple Cox regression analysis. To analyze the&#xD;
      corresponding incidence of all-cause mortality per 1,000 person-years for the BP&lt;130/80 mmHg,&#xD;
      130-139/80-89 mmHg, and â‰¥140/90 mmHg or treated groups respectively after adjusting for age,&#xD;
      sex, and other factors. To identify the associations between cardiovascular mortality and BP&#xD;
      categories alone or combined with blood glucose categories were consistent with that of&#xD;
      all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify relative metabolic molecular biomarker panel detected by mass spectrometry in&#xD;
      blood samples correlating with efficacy in prediabetes and stage 1 hypertension among Chinese&#xD;
      adults. Compare the plasma metabolic profiles of different groups and the metabolic markers&#xD;
      were screened and optimized by multivariate statistical analysis, logistic regression&#xD;
      analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether one or several metabolites can be used as serum markers to judge the&#xD;
      prognosis of patients with prediabetes and stage1 hypertension, and to establish the&#xD;
      evaluation model of metabolites for the prognosis.&#xD;

    <description>The diagnosis of myocardial infarction includes clinical manifestations (symptoms and signs), measurement of cardiac biomarkers and ECG interpretation; myocardial infarction occurred during surgery / operation and myocardial infarction terminated due to thrombolytic therapy. According to the available data, the outcome evaluator will classify myocardial infarction into three categories: definite, probable and possible. All three types of myocardial infarction were included in the main outcome. Stroke can be judged based on all available data, including symptoms and signs, brain and large vessel imaging, and cardiac examinations such as echocardiography.</description>
