  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study aimed to study the effect of an intervention with foods containing folate&#xD;
      and hazelnut oil to assess whether this diet could modulate the methylation levels of two&#xD;
      obesity-related genes, LEP and POMC, in addition to impacting body weight and values of lipid&#xD;
      profile of overweight women. The hypothesis of the clinical study is that the intervention&#xD;
      diet could reduce the methylation levels of the genes mentioned and this would impact on the&#xD;
      reduction of body weight and improvement of the lipid profile of the women studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention study was carried out with a sample selected by randomization, and n = 40&#xD;
      adult women classified as overweight were considered for the study. After assessing the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, women were instructed to have stable weight, eating habits and levels&#xD;
      of physical activity constant to those found during the baseline, as well as receiving an&#xD;
      individual diet plan one week before starting the dietary intervention. Before the start of&#xD;
      the intervention, the 40 women were allocated to four groups of 10 each, and three groups&#xD;
      started the individual diet plan for weight maintenance with a focus on vegetables and&#xD;
      legumes with antioxidant and folate-rich action, and were also invited to consume foods&#xD;
      fortified with folic acid and foods naturally rich in folate to achieve a usual folate intake&#xD;
      close to the RAS (≥400 µg), this amount was for intervention group 1 and 2, group 3 received&#xD;
      a lower amount (approximately half of the consumption of groups 1 and 2) and group 4 was the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Still referring to the intervention, the participants of the three groups received advice&#xD;
      from a nutritionist, responsible for this research and all the printed material free of&#xD;
      charge, including pre-packaged foods, and also delivered hazelnut oil capsules, used as a&#xD;
      source of monounsaturated fat. Counseling sessions with the nutritionist were offered daily&#xD;
      at the homes during the entire period of the intervention, except for group 4, where the&#xD;
      monitoring was weekly, to maintain eating habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of the 8 weeks of the intervention, the third stage of the study began, which&#xD;
      consisted of anthropometric assessment, analysis of the dietary intake of the 24-hour food&#xD;
      record and blood collection for biochemical tests and DNA methylation.&#xD;
