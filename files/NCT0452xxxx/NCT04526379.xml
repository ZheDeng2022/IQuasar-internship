  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present project project is divided in two parts. The primary aim of the part 1 of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate emotional control abilities of children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)&#xD;
      aged from 9 to 15 years and to study repercussions of this supposed lack of abilities on&#xD;
      cognitive capacities and behavioral troubles. The study also evaluate influence of the&#xD;
      emotional symptomatology of patients on quality of parents' life and on the care of parents&#xD;
      and scholar/institutional caregivers. In the second part of this study, the study evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility and the tolerance to a non-invasive device supposed to reduce emotional&#xD;
      symptoms in this disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder involving a variety of clinical,&#xD;
      behavioral and cognitive symptoms. 83 to 97% of patients have episodes of temper tantrum,&#xD;
      associated with an important emotional lability. These different cognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      limitations are barriers to the social integration of patients. The PWS also has&#xD;
      repercussions on well-being and quality of life of the family. Thus, the present project&#xD;
      focuses on the characteristics of emotional control related to the anger of children with PWS&#xD;
      and its behavioral, cognitive and social implications. In addition, at a therapeutic level,&#xD;
      our project assumes that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (t-VNS), a non-invasive,&#xD;
      safe and inexpensive method, could be effective in reducing the severity of behavioral&#xD;
      disorders such as temper tantrums while improving cognitive performance and social&#xD;
      communication in the PWS.&#xD;

    <time_frame>month 6</time_frame>
    <description>CBCL (Child Behavior CheckList) scale: is a questionnaire comprising 1) an adaptive functioning scale (activities, social and school spheres), 2) a syndrome scale (social withdrawal, anxiety / depression, somatic complaints, social problems, thinking problems, attention problems, behavior problems and aggressiveness; total of internalized problems and total of externalized problems), 3) a DSM-oriented scale (Lengua et al., 2001; anxiety, attention problems / hyperactivity, behavior problems, depression, opposition / mistrust, social problems / immaturity, somatization). (duration = 20 ') - there is no minimum and maximum values as this is an evaluation of behavioral disorders</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of behavioral disorders of children with PWS by Hyperphagia Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>month 6</time_frame>
    <description>HQ-CT (Hyperphagia Questionnaire) scale: The HQ-CT (Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Use in Prader-Willi Syndrome Clinical Trials, Fehnel et al., 2015, appendix 10) is a scale derived from the Dykens hyperphagia questionnaire (Dykens et al., 2007). The specificity of the Dykens questionnaire makes it a favored tool in the international literature in the evaluation of the eating behavior of patients with PWS (Crain, 2010). The HQ-CT was created specifically to assess the eating behavior of these patients in clinical trials. It consists of 9 items for which a person taking care of the patient (family or caregiver) indicates the frequency and severity of the behavior described on a 5-point Likert scale (with 1 = absence of the behavior and 5 = very frequent behavior or severe) (⍺ = .91). (duration = 5 ') - so 1 is the minimum value and 5 the maximum value and higher scores mean a worse outcome</description>
