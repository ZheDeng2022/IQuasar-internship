  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal pain is common and often occurs already in adolescence. To be able to target&#xD;
      future interventions that aim to prevent new episodes of MSK pain, more studies on modifiable&#xD;
      risk factors are necessary. In this prospective cohort study, already collected data from the&#xD;
      Fit Futures study will be used. The aim is to investigate if perceived social acceptance&#xD;
      among peers in the first year of high school is associated with musculoskeletal pain in the&#xD;
      last year of high school, and if this association is moderated by psychological distress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Few studies have investigated social factors in association with musculoskeletal pain in&#xD;
      adolescents, such as perceived peer acceptance. Adolescence is a vulnerable period of life&#xD;
      when peer relations is important in order to develop social, emotional and behavioural&#xD;
      skills. Social relations have been linked to several health outcomes in previous studies.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to investigate if social acceptance among peers is associated with&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain in adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is there a significant association between perceived social acceptance among peers&#xD;
           during the first year of high school and persistent MSK pain two years later in&#xD;
           adolescents?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is psychological distress an effect modifier of the relationship between perceived&#xD;
           social acceptance among peers during the first year of high school and MSK pain two&#xD;
           years later in adolescents?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective cohort study using data from the Fit Futures (FF) study. Students from&#xD;
      the first year of high school were included at baseline in Fit Futures 1 (FF1) and followed&#xD;
      up for two years later in Fit Futures 2 (FF2). The students answered a comprehensive&#xD;
      questionnaire, including biological, psychological, and social variables. They also underwent&#xD;
      measurements of height and weight during school hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics will be extracted from FF1 with data collected in the period&#xD;
      2010-2011. Baseline characteristics from adolescents who participated in the study and&#xD;
      adolescents who were lost to follow-up will be presented and compared. Information about age,&#xD;
      sex, parents socioeconomic status (SES), and body mass index (BMI), will be used to describe&#xD;
      the study sample and as potential confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social acceptance among peers was measured by five questions from the revised Norwegian&#xD;
      version of Self-perception Profile for Adolescent; scale for social competence and&#xD;
      psychological distress was measured by the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical tests will be two-sided, and the nominal p-values will be reported. All&#xD;
      confidence intervals (CIs) will be reported as 95%. Preliminary analyses of frequencies,&#xD;
      missing data and normality will be conducted. The assumption of normal distribution will be&#xD;
      investigated using histograms and QQ-plots. Normally distributed data will be described with&#xD;
      means and standard deviations (SDs), skewed data will be presented with medians and ranges.&#xD;
      Categorical data will be reported as counts and percentages. All statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted using SPSS statistical software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with missing data on the outcome will be excluded from the analyses. Missing&#xD;
      data on the exposure variable will be handled by multiple imputations unless the missingness&#xD;
      is very low (&lt;10%). A two-year incidence rate of participants who reports no MSK pain at&#xD;
      baseline and develops persistent MSK pain during the follow-up period will be calculated,&#xD;
      presented as percentage with 95% CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic regression:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main analyses will be conducted in a sample of adolescents that report no persistent MSK pain&#xD;
      at baseline. Secondary analyses will be conducted in the total sample regardless of pain&#xD;
      status at baseline. Binary logistic regression will be conducted with social acceptance among&#xD;
      peers as the exposure and persistent MSK pain as the outcome. Sex and chronic diseases will&#xD;
      be included as confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderation analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The moderation analysis will be performed as described by Hayes, using PROCESS macro model 1&#xD;
      in SPSS. In the analysis, social acceptance will be included as the exposure, MSK pain as the&#xD;
      outcome, and psychological distress as the possible effect modifier. Sex and chronic diseases&#xD;
      will be included as confounders. Regression coefficients and ORs will be presented in figures&#xD;
      and tables. Confidence intervals for the effect modifier will be constructed using a&#xD;
      bias-corrected bootstrap method with 5000 bootstrap samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drop-out analyses will be conducted to explore possible attrition bias by comparing baseline&#xD;
      characteristics between participants lost to follow-up and responders at follow-up. The&#xD;
      chi-square test will be used for comparison of categorical variables, independent samples&#xD;
      t-test to compare normally distributed continuous variables, and Mann-Whitney U test to&#xD;
      compare data with skewed distribution.&#xD;
