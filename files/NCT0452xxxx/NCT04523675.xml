  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this investigation the investigators utilized NAC supplementation to boost GSH&#xD;
      availability during an one-week-microcycle consisting of three soccer games, in order to test&#xD;
      the hypotheses that: i) antioxidant supplementation may enhance the recovery of performance&#xD;
      and physiological stress variables following multiple match-plays and ii) redox status&#xD;
      perturbations are critical in regulating the inflammatory response and repair in skeletal&#xD;
      muscle, following repetitive exercise-induced muscle injuries.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After exercise-induced muscle microtrauma the thiol/disulfide couple of reduced (GSH) and&#xD;
      oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is a key regulator of important transcriptional pathways that&#xD;
      control the inflammatory response and recovery of skeletal muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective was to examine how thiol-based antioxidant supplementation affects the muscle&#xD;
      damage, oxidative stress, inflammatory and immune responses, as well as the level of&#xD;
      post-game fatigue and muscle's recovery kinetics in response to three soccer games within a&#xD;
      week. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: i) Experimental-NAC&#xD;
      [EXP-NAC, N=10, participated in daily training sessions and three games and received NAC (20&#xD;
      mg/kg/day)], ii) Experimental-Placebo (EXP-Pla, N=10, participated in daily training sessions&#xD;
      and three games and received Placebo), iii) Control-NAC [CON-NAC, N=10, participated in daily&#xD;
      training sessions only and received NAC(20 mg/kg/day)] and iv) Control-Placebo (CON-Pla,&#xD;
      N=10, participated in daily training sessions only and received Placebo). Blood samples were&#xD;
      collected at baseline, post-games and daily during recovery. Performance was assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and daily during recovery.&#xD;
