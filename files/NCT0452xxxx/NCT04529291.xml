  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy is a diffuse multifocal autoimmune&#xD;
      disorder of the peripheral neuron, affecting 1 to 9 in 100,000 people. Its course is&#xD;
      difficult to predict, and may be characterized by continuous progression, multiple relapses,&#xD;
      or recovery after a few months. treatment. The predominantly motor form with 4 limbs&#xD;
      represents the typical form, but the disease can take on other clinical forms (pure sensory&#xD;
      impairment, ataxia, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to induction therapy, patients most often require long-term maintenance therapy.&#xD;
      First-line therapies, with the same efficacy according to a 2013 Cochrane study, are&#xD;
      glucocorticoid therapy, plasma exchanges and intravenous immunoglobulin injections.&#xD;
      Glucocorticoids have a grade C recommendation level while a grade A has been assigned to&#xD;
      intravenous immunoglobulins and plasma exchange. However, the latter have less tolerance and&#xD;
      have a rebound effect which limits their long-term interest. Intravenous immunoglobulins are&#xD;
      therefore the preferred treatment today. The effect of intravenous immunoglobulins, delivered&#xD;
      as a bolus over a few days, lasts two to six weeks, with the number of people being cured of&#xD;
      three to improve a person. A more recent study has also shown their advantage in reducing the&#xD;
      relapse rate at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the response to intravenous immunoglobulins fluctuates in different patients and,&#xD;
      for any given patient, changes over the course of the disease. The 2010 recommendations&#xD;
      therefore recommend an adaptation of the doses and duration of intercourse (0.4 to 1.2 g / kg&#xD;
      every 2 to 6 weeks) according to individual monitoring of the response to treatment. In order&#xD;
      to embrace the diversity of symptoms of chronic inflammatory demyelinating&#xD;
      polyradiculoneuropathy, several scores and scales are usually combined to ensure this&#xD;
      follow-up in a cohort. Three clinical data are currently favored: the Inflammatory&#xD;
      Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (I-RODS), the INCAT Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale&#xD;
      (ONLS), the score of the Medical Research Council (MRC). However, none of them assess walking&#xD;
      objectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy sometimes&#xD;
      report significant walking disturbances, which may result from both sensory disturbances or&#xD;
      motor disturbances present in varying degrees depending on the patient. The alterations&#xD;
      concerned, according to the studies, the walking speed, the temporal pattern of the step,&#xD;
      with an impairment of the durations of the different phases (support and oscillation) or the&#xD;
      angle and the angular speed of roll at the level of the trunk. Alterations in speed and phase&#xD;
      duration of the step improve during treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin cures, with&#xD;
      greater sensitivity compared to the ONLS and MRC scales. The power of the propulsive moment&#xD;
      at the ankle during the last moments of the stance phase - the push-off - is another&#xD;
      promising gait parameter that has made it possible to distinguish diabetic patients with&#xD;
      polyneuropathy from those without diabetes. polyneuropathy and the intensity of the deficit&#xD;
      is linked to the severity of the attack. Gait speed, as a reflection of the subject's gait&#xD;
      performance, and the quality of gait including the timing of gait, trunk rotation movements&#xD;
      and push-off, therefore seem to be potential response markers. for monitoring patients&#xD;
      treated with intravenous immunoglobulins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      InertiaLocoGraphy, quantification of gait by inertial measurement sensors, has proven its&#xD;
      value in the evaluation of various pathologies in neurological practice, including chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. It gives access to the walking speed as&#xD;
      well as to various walking quality criteria (vigor of the step, rhythmicity, regularity,&#xD;
      symmetry, stability, fluidity, synchronization) including the times of the different walking&#xD;
      phases and the rotational movements of the trunk, and a push-off substitute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      InertiaLocoGraphie, non-invasive, easy and quick to set up, reflecting the patient's&#xD;
      function, therefore potentially provides biomarkers of choice for monitoring the response to&#xD;
      intravenous immunoglobulin cures in patients with chronic inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy&#xD;
      demyelinating. Its association with the traditional monitoring tools such as the ONLS score,&#xD;
      the I-ROS, and the CRM therefore appears to be of key interest for this monitoring.&#xD;

    <description>During the patient's hospitalization, two questionnaires will be completed, assessing the handicap of the patient in his daily activities, and the specific incapacity to carry out activities of daily living and social life (10 minutes to complete). The patient will then carry out two 20-meter round-trip walking tests during his first day and his last day of care at the hospital. Additional home visits, corresponding to intervention, performed by a member of the investigative team, will take place once a week (15-20 minutes). The team will collect his feelings about the evolution of symptoms through the two questionnaires, and quantify the evolution of his walking. Walk tests are recorded using small inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyrometers) that will be placed at his feet, belt and forehead. This examination is not painful. All the measurements are carried out in 15 minutes by a member of the team.</description>
