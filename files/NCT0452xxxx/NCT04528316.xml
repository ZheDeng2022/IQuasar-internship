  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medulloblastoma is a rapidly-growing tumor of the cerebellum, this area controls balance,&#xD;
      posture and sophisticated motor functions like finer hand movements, speech, and swallowing.&#xD;
      It has been reported that those children fall frequently so the purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the effectiveness of balance and coordination training in these Children.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The effects of physical exercise training interventions for childhood cancer participants are&#xD;
      not yet convincing due to small numbers of participants and insufficient study methodology.&#xD;
      More and high-quality evidence is needed in order to be able to draft exercise and physical&#xD;
      activity guidelines for this population. Despite the positive results of exercise&#xD;
      interventions in adult cancer patients, the evidence for benefits in childhood cancer&#xD;
      patients is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are Two Main objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the effectiveness of Pilates core stability exercises program. 2. To&#xD;
           investigate the effectiveness of Humac balance and tilt system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The effectiveness of coordination training in children with posterior fossa tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The comparison between balance and coordination training and which of both trainings has&#xD;
           more effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in a pediatric oncology setting, Children's Cancer Hospital&#xD;
      Egypt(CCHE), in outpatient setting. Patients will be evaluated for their balance and&#xD;
      coordination at initial presentation, during treatment, and during follow-up after end of&#xD;
      treatment at CCHE. Also patients will receive balance and coordination training, before each&#xD;
      chemotherapy cycle-maximum one week- given the patient is in good state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty children with posterior fossa tumors of both sexes will participate in this study. They&#xD;
      will be selected from CCHE. They will be randomly assigned into 3 groups of equal number.&#xD;

    <description>The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency - Second Edition&#xD;
- The minimum and maximum values: Coordination will be assessed using BOT2, Bilateral coordination (Sub test No.4) composed of 7 items and Upper-Limb coordination (Sub test No.7) composed of 7 items too.&#xD;
The raw scores are recorded first then it is converted into point scores, then subtest total point score is obtained by adding point scores.&#xD;
Bilateral Coordination: Total Point Score Subtest (min=Zero, max=24). Upper-Limb Coordination: Total Point Score Subtest (min=Zero, max=39).&#xD;
- Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>
