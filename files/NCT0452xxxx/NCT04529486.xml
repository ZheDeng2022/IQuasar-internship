      Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of kinesio taping on upper&#xD;
      extremity functionality in participants with Cerebral Palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study included 14 children aged 6-16 years, diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy. The&#xD;
      children with Cerebral Palsy were divided into 2 groups, the study group and the control&#xD;
      group. Assessments were done three times for each group (beginning - 45min later - 1 week&#xD;
      later). Frenchay Arm Test was used to evaluate upper extremity functionality in participants&#xD;
      with Cerebral Palsy. Kinesio taping was applied to study group to improve posture and&#xD;
      function in shoulder area.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The children with Cerebral Palsy included in this study consisted of 2 groups, the study group and the control group. No application was made to the control group. The same participant group was included as the experimental group after 1 week of rest. The assessments were done three times for each group (beginning - 45min later - 1 week later)</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Frenchay Arm Test was used to evaluate upper extremity functionality in participants with Cerebral Palsy.&#xD;
Frenchay Arm Test: The total duration of the test is 3 minutes. Each task is scored as 1 point. The participant takes minimum 0 and maximum 5 points. Higher scores indicate better functionality. The participant sits in the chair with a table in front of him and puts his hands on his knees and tries to perform the following sequential tasks with the affected arm / hand.&#xD;
1. Fixing the ruler 2. Holding a roller 3. Raising the cup 4. Attaching a latch to the bar 5. Combing hair</description>

    <description>Kinesio taping was applied to the study group to improve posture and improve function in the shoulder area. Measurements were carried out for the study group before and after application (with tape on). The tape was then removed and the measurements were repeated after 1 week.</description>

    <description>Before applying the tape, it was checked whether the children were allergic. Tape was first started from the distal part of the fingers and taped with 0% tension with Kinesio Taping Functional Correction Technique. Another I tape was applied from palmar area of the hand to spina scapula for supination of the forearm and external rotation of the shoulder with %0 tension to make functional correction (Figure 2). Kinesio Taping Functional Correction method is suggested to be done with 75% of tension but for children, we applied it with 0% tension to minimize the shear effects to the skin4. Kinesio Tex Light Touch Plus tape was used for taping application (Kinesio Co., USA).</description>
