  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized, single blind, controlled intervention&#xD;
      trial to observe the therapeutic effect of kidney-tonifying and tune up Chong-Ren hemostasis&#xD;
      Chinese medicine periodic therapy for dysfunctional uterine bleeding based on objective&#xD;
      Chinese and western medicine evaluation standard.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysfunctional uterine bleeding during adolescence is the most common menstrual disorders&#xD;
      during adolescence, and the age of children suffering from it tended to be lower. It's urgent&#xD;
      to explore effective ways to alleviate the pain caused by dysfunctional uterine bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our research, 160 children are randomly divided into a Chinese medication periodic therapy&#xD;
      group (80 cases) and a Gong Xue Ning control group (80 cases). Paticipants in Chinese&#xD;
      medication periodic therapy group are treated with kidney-tonifying and tune up Chong-Ren&#xD;
      hemostasis Chinese medicine for 3 months, whereas the Gong Xue Ning control group received&#xD;
      Gong Xue Ning capsules for 3 months. We compare the effect of the two therapies about&#xD;
      hemostasis and menstruation regulation, and the change of the thickness of endometrium, sex&#xD;
      hormones, Kisspeptin, and PAI-1 in blood before and after the treatment, in order to make&#xD;
      clear the efficacy and the mechanism of the Chinese medicine periodic therapy.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Restoration of menstruation cycle(binomial)</measure>
    <time_frame>the end of the third months</time_frame>
    <description>Restoration of menstruation cycle is a binomial variable. Through clinical follow-up and menstrual diary, we record participants' menstrual period at month 3 of the treatment to confirm the restoration of menstruation, and we regard the menstrual cycle that is within 25-35 days as a normal cycle. Then normal cycles are defined as 1, and the rest are defined as 0.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Menstrual hemostatic time</measure>
    <time_frame>during procedure (about 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>We give every patient a menstrual diary to record the length of menstrual bleeding every month in order to confirm the hemostatic time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Menstrual blood volume</measure>
    <time_frame>during procedure (about 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Menstrual blood volume is a repeated measurement variable. We give every participant a pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) to measure the menstrual blood volume. They fill in the chart every day during menstrual period according to the degree to which each item of sanitary protection was soiled with blood, thus we can calculate a score and speculate the menstrual blood volume based on that.</description>

    <description>Participants of Chinese medicine periodic therapy group will be treated with kidney-tonifying and tune up Chong-Ren hemostasis Chinese medicine periodic therapy. During bleeding period, use kidney-tonifying, heat-clearing and consolidating channel for hemostasis Chinese medicine to stop bleeding. The kidney-tonifying hemostasis prescription is made up of Nvzhenzi, Hanliancao, Tusizi, Xianhecao, Cebaiyetan, Danpi, Zhimu, etc. When the bleeding stops, use the kidney-tonifying, essence-strengthening and blood-activating, menstruation-regulating Chinese medicine to regulate menstruation. The kidney-tonifying and menstruation-regulating prescription is made up of Shengshudi, Zhimu, Tusizi, Fupenzi, Bajirou, Danggui, Danpi, etc. The drugs are granules for taking after infusion once a day. Participants receive this treatment for 3 months.</description>
