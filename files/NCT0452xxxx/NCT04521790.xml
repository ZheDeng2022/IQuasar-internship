  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocarditis is a complex inflammatory disease, usually occurring secondary to viral&#xD;
      infections, autoimmune processes or toxic agents. Clinical presentations are multiple,&#xD;
      including chest-pain, heart failure and a broad spectrum of arrhythmias. In turn, outcome is&#xD;
      largely unpredictable, ranging from mild self-limiting disease, to chronic stage and&#xD;
      progressive evolution towards dilated cardiomyopathy, to rapid adverse outcome in fulminant&#xD;
      forms. Subsequently, myocarditis is often underdiagnosed and undertreated, and optimal&#xD;
      diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are still to be defined. This study, both retrospective&#xD;
      and prospective, originally single-center and subsequently upgraded to multicenter, aims at&#xD;
      answering multiple questions about myocarditis, with special attention to its arrhythmic&#xD;
      manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Optimal diagnostic workflow is still to be defined. In fact, although endomyocardial&#xD;
           biopsy (EMB) is still the diagnostic gold standard, especially for aetiology&#xD;
           identification, it is an invasive technique. Furthermore, it may lack sensitivity&#xD;
           because of sampling errors. By converse, modern imaging techniques - cardiac magnetic&#xD;
           resonance (CMR) in particular - have been proposed as alternative or complementary&#xD;
           diagnostic tool in inflammatory heart disease. Other noninvasive diagnostic techniques,&#xD;
           like delayed-enhanced CT (DECT) scan or position emission tomography (PET) scan, are&#xD;
           under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biomarkers to identify myocarditis aetiology, predisposition, prognosis and response to&#xD;
           treatment are still to be defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Arrhythmic myocarditis is largely underdiagnosed and uninvestigated. Importantly,&#xD;
           myocarditis presenting with arrhythmias requires specific diagnostic, prognostic and&#xD;
           therapeutic considerations. At the group leader hospital, which is an international&#xD;
           referral center for ventricular arrhythmias management and ablation, a relevant number&#xD;
           of patients with unexplained arrhythmias had myocarditis as underlying aetiology. The&#xD;
           experience of a dedicated third-level center is going to be shared with other centers,&#xD;
           to considerably improve knowledge and management of arrhythmic myocarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The role of CMR, as well as alternative noninvasive imaging techniques, in defining&#xD;
           myocarditis healing is a relevant issue. In particular, optimal timing for follow-up&#xD;
           diagnostic reassessment is still to be defined, in patients with myocarditis at&#xD;
           different inflammatory stages, either with or without aetiology-dependent treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Uniformly-designed studies are lacking, to compare myocarditis among different patient&#xD;
           subgroups, differing by variables like: clinical presentations, myocarditis stage,&#xD;
           associated cardiac or extra-cardiac diseases, aetiology-based treatment, associated&#xD;
           arrhythmic manifestations, diagnostic workup, and devices or ablation treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study, previously designed as a single-center experience, is multicenter, observational&#xD;
      and both retrospective and prospective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective phase includes all clinical data occurring before the index event&#xD;
      (hospitalization or clinically suspected myocarditis) and myocarditis diagnosis. Prospective&#xD;
      phase includes all data following index event and myocarditis diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has multiple aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare EMB with noninvasive diagnostic techniques (CMR, DECT, PET scan, either alone&#xD;
           or in association).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the role of blood biomarkers for identification of aetiology, predisposition,&#xD;
           prognosis, response to treatment, inflammatory activity, clinical presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To describe myocarditis presenting with arrhythmias, with special focus on ventricular&#xD;
           arrhythmias at different myocarditis stages and in different clinical contexts. To&#xD;
           validate and generalize the leader hospital model for optimal diagnostic and&#xD;
           therapeutical management of arrhythmias in myocarditis patients (given the role of the&#xD;
           leader hospital as an international referral center for arrhythmias ablation and&#xD;
           management).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the timing needed for myocarditis healing in different patients subgroups,&#xD;
           as assessed by noninvasive imaging techniques (CMR, DECT, PET scan), either alone or in&#xD;
           association.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare patients subgroups of myocarditis, in terms of epidemiology, aetiology,&#xD;
           prognosis, and diagnostic-therapeutical strategies. Among the others, the main study&#xD;
           subgroups will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Arrhythmic vs. non-arrhythmic myocarditis. B. Arrhythmic myocarditis subgroups. C.&#xD;
      Non-arrhythmic myocarditis subgroups (i.e.: fulminant, acute coronary syndrome-like,&#xD;
      pericarditis-like, heart failure, nonischaemic dilated /hypokinetic cardiomyopathies of&#xD;
      unknown aetiologyâ€¦).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Infectious vs. autoimmune vs. toxic myocarditis. E. Myocarditis treated by aetiology-based&#xD;
      treatment vs. isolated cardiac medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Myocarditis at different disease stages: acute, hyperacute, fulminant, chronic active,&#xD;
      post-inflammatory, or active vs. previous vs. non-myocarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Myocarditis presenting as organ-specific diseases vs. in the context of a genetic disorder&#xD;
      or systemic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. Myocarditis vs. peri-myocarditis/myo-pericarditis. I. Other analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any adult patient with clinically suspected myocarditis, of any clinical presentation and any&#xD;
      degree of severity, will be considered as suitable for study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo diagnostic and therapeutical strategies considered as clinically&#xD;
      indicated in a patient-tailored manner, as suggested by international guidelines&#xD;
      recommendations and best local clinical practice. Patients will be free of either accepting&#xD;
      or refusing any diagnostic or therapeutical proposal. Whenever accepted, data will be simply&#xD;
      collected and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on clinical presentation, patients will be divided into two groups, arrhythmic (group&#xD;
      A) and non-arrhythmic (group NA, including any other clinical presentation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independently of A/NA groups, all patients will undergo optimal diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies, as summarized in panel A. In parallel, special diagnostic and therapeutical&#xD;
      strategies will be performed in patients with arrhythmic presentation or evidence of&#xD;
      arrhythmias, as shown in panel B. Proposed flowcharts (Panels A and B) represent only an&#xD;
      approximate algorithm. Exceptions can be made in single cases, based on clinical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panel A - Diagnostic and therapeutical workup in all patients. Independently of groups&#xD;
      (A/NA), all patients will undergo optimal diagnostic and therapeutical workup, guided by&#xD;
      updated scientific evidence merged with the clinical experience of the center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline diagnostic workup will include: complete blood exams, 12-leads ECG, continuous&#xD;
      telemetric monitoring, transthoracic doppler echocardiogram, coronary artery imaging&#xD;
      (coronary angiography or CT scan). Any other clinically relevant diagnostic test will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In life-threatening presentations (cardiogenic shock or malignant arrhythmias), support&#xD;
      treatment by optimal medical therapy, inotropic or mechanical circulatory support, and&#xD;
      acute-phase arrhythmia management (including cardioversion, defibrillation, or temporary&#xD;
      pacing) will be performed, as indicated, before completing diagnostic workup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final diagnosis of myocarditis will include, whenever applicable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. For stable patients: 1) a second-level imaging technique (CMR as first choice; and/or&#xD;
      DECT, PET, or multiple/fusion imaging techniques, based on clinical indications); followed&#xD;
      by: 2) EMB, whenever clinically indicated. Blood exams for aetiology screening will be&#xD;
      personalized upon clinical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. For unstable patients: EMB only, as recommended. Blood exams for aetiology screening will&#xD;
      be personalized upon clinical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic criteria for myocarditis, as assessed by any diagnostic technique, will be defined&#xD;
      based on international scientific evidence and will be constantly updated. Similar&#xD;
      considerations apply to myocarditis staging and aetiology definition. Whenever not available&#xD;
      at local institutions, diagnostic exams can be performed and analyzed at external centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with myocarditis (or any alternative final diagnosis), will undergo standard&#xD;
      cardiological optimal medical treatment (COMT), as indicated. By converse,&#xD;
      aetiology-dependent treatment will be performed only in patients with a final diagnosis of&#xD;
      any active (acute, fulminant, chronic active) myocarditis of defined aetiology (EMB-proved).&#xD;
      Multidisciplinary assessment, including infective disease specialists (in viral/infective&#xD;
      myocarditis), immunologists (in non-infective/autoimmune myocarditis) or any other specialist&#xD;
      as needed, will be used to identify indications to treatment, drug choice (either approved or&#xD;
      with a justified unapproved indication), treatment duration and safety profile, aiming at the&#xD;
      best patients' interest. Toxic myocarditis will be treated accordingly, by evaluating the&#xD;
      opportunity of withdrawing pathogenic noxa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will not interfere with local best clinical practice. Patients with non-active&#xD;
      myocarditis (previous or healed) or with non-myocarditis, will undergo &quot;standard FU&quot; (see&#xD;
      below). Patients with active myocarditis will undergo &quot;intensive FU&quot; (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independently of FU modalities, diagnostic reassessment will be considered in the presence of&#xD;
      at least one of the following instability criteria: a) new unexplained cardiac symptoms&#xD;
      (dyspnoea, chest pain, syncope, palpitation); b) new unexplained increase in troponin or&#xD;
      natriuretic peptides; c) new imaging abnormal signs; d) new unexplained clinically relevant&#xD;
      arrhythmias. Diagnostic reassessment will include second-level imaging and/or EMB, as shown&#xD;
      above. Subsequent therapeutical workup will be in line with the above explanations. In stable&#xD;
      patients or undergone myocarditis healing, exercise stress test will be obtained, whenever&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panel B - Diagnostic and therapeutical workup of patients with arrhythmias In parallel with&#xD;
      (and independently of) Panel A content, patients with arrhythmias (group A) will undergo&#xD;
      specific diagnostic and therapeutical management for arrhythmias, as a result of the&#xD;
      integration between international guidelines recommendations and the experience of an&#xD;
      international referral center for arrhythmia management and ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To oversimplify, 4 groups of patients will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1: major ventricular arrhythmias, including haemodynamically unstable VT (hu-VT)&#xD;
           and ventricular fibrillation (VF).&#xD;
&#xD;
           After electrical stabilization and support treatment (panel A), indication to secondary&#xD;
           prevention ICD implant will be multiparametric and patient-tailored. In patients with&#xD;
           active myocarditis, subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) or wearable CD (WCD) will be considered.&#xD;
           Antiarrhythmic drugs will be considered in all Group 1 patients. In addition, all Group&#xD;
           1 patients will undergo COMT and aetiology-dependent treatment whenever applicable&#xD;
           (panel A). Ablation of ventricular arrhythmias will be considered in patients with&#xD;
           severe arrhythmic presentation, or symptomatic, or refractory to optimal medical&#xD;
           treatment. Electrophysiological study (EPS) may be used in selected cases. A cardiac&#xD;
           resynchronization therapy with defibrillator function (CRT-D) will replace ICD whenever&#xD;
           indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2: other ventricular arrhythmias, including high-burden (hb) premature ventricular&#xD;
           complexes (PVC); nonsustained VT (NSVT); haemodynamically stable VT (hs-VT).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Whenever clinically indicated, Group 2 patients will undergo invasive EPS (or in&#xD;
           alternative noninvasive programmed ventricular stimulation in ICD carriers) to stratify&#xD;
           arrhythmic risk. Patients with positive EPS will undergo ICD (or S-ICD/WCD) as in Group&#xD;
           1. Patients with negative EPS, as well as Group 2 cases not undergoing EPS, will undergo&#xD;
           watchful waiting strategy (always with an intensive FU) with or without loop recorder&#xD;
           implant: in these cases, ICD (or S-ICD/WCD) will be implanted only following&#xD;
           documentation of relevant VA in FU. In addition, all Group 2 patients will undergo&#xD;
           antiarrhythmic treatment, COMT and aetiology-dependent treatment whenever applicable&#xD;
           (panel A). In symptomatic or drug-refractory cases, ablation of ventricular arrhythmias&#xD;
           will be considered. A CRT-D will replace ICD whenever indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group 3: bradyarrhythmias, including advanced (2nd type II or 3rd degree)&#xD;
           atrioventricular block (AVB); critical sinus pauses from sinus node disease (SND).&#xD;
&#xD;
           After electrical stabilization and support treatment (panel A), including the use of&#xD;
           temporary pacemaker as a bridge-to-decision, patients will undergo watchful waiting&#xD;
           strategy or definitive device implant. Instead of a pacemaker (PM), ICD will be&#xD;
           considered in the presence of high-risk criteria for ventricular tachyarrhythmias,&#xD;
           including: a) overlap with Group 1 presentation; b) overlap with Group 2 presentation,&#xD;
           especially in the presence of positive EPS; c) other indications for primary prevention&#xD;
           ICD implant (severe systolic dysfunction); d) signs of increased tachyarrhythmic risk&#xD;
           (scar signs); e) patients with special aetiologies leading to an increased&#xD;
           tachyarrhythmic risk (i.e: cardiac sarcoid, giant cell myocarditis, Chagas disease,&#xD;
           overlapping genetic syndromes). In addition, all Group 3 patients will undergo COMT and&#xD;
           aetiology-dependent treatment whenever applicable (panel A). A CRT-D or a CRT-P will&#xD;
           replace ICD or PM, respectively, whenever indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Group 4: supraventricular arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF); atrial&#xD;
           flutter (AFlu); atrial tachycardia (AT).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following acute-phase rate control (RaC), stable rhythm control (RyC) strategy will be&#xD;
           considered as the therapeutical target, together with appropriate anticoagulation, as&#xD;
           needed. Normal sinus rhythm will be obtained through either electrical or&#xD;
           pharmacological cardioversion. In patients with unsuccessful attempts of sinus rhythm&#xD;
           conversion, optimal treatment of active myocarditis will be considered as a primary&#xD;
           target. Following myocarditis healing, in the presence of persistent arrhythmias,&#xD;
           patients will be considered for RyC via electrical or pharmacological cardioversion.&#xD;
           Transcatheter ablation will be an option for patients with drug-symptomatic, recurrent&#xD;
           or refractory arrhythmias. Permanent RaC strategy will be considered only in non&#xD;
           responders. Widespread use of implantable loop recorders will apply, as clinically&#xD;
           indicated. In addition, all Group 4 patients will undergo COMT and aetiology-dependent&#xD;
           treatment whenever applicable (panel A).&#xD;
