    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare outcomes from three different strategies for the&#xD;
      management of household (HH) contacts of individuals with newly diagnosed microbiologically&#xD;
      confirmed active pulmonary TB. The study is a cluster randomized trial with three arms of&#xD;
      equal size. The first eligible member of the HH who provides signed informed consent to&#xD;
      participate will be randomized to one of the three strategies. The three different study arms&#xD;
      are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard care (control arm): Participants will receive symptom screening and tuberculin&#xD;
           skin testing (TST). If symptom screen positive and/or TST positive, they undergo chest&#xD;
           x-rays (CXR). If CXR abnormal, they undergo microbiological investigation. If CXR normal&#xD;
           or if microbiological investigation negative, TST positive receive latent TB infection&#xD;
           (LTBI) treatment. If microbiological investigation is positive, they will be offered&#xD;
           treatment for active TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. GeneXpert (GX): Participants follow an algorithm similar to the standard care, however&#xD;
           participants with positive symptom screen and/or positive TST will receive GX (i.e., GX&#xD;
           replaces CXR in standard care algorithm). GX positive are considered to have active TB.&#xD;
           TST positive and GX negative receive LTBI treatment. If an individual is not able to&#xD;
           provide sputum, they will undergo a CXR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CXR for all/NoTST: Participants will receive symptom screening and CXR. No TST will be&#xD;
           performed. If CXR abnormal or symptom positive, they undergo microbiological&#xD;
           investigation. If the CXR is normal, and/or microbiological investigations negative -&#xD;
           they receive LTBI treatment as per national guidelines. If microbiological investigation&#xD;
           is positive they will be offered treatment for active TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population includes HIV uninfected persons aged 5-50 years who are HH contacts of&#xD;
      individuals with newly diagnosed microbiologically confirmed active pulmonary TB. The planned&#xD;
      number of household contacts to recruit is about 1434 in total, or about 455 for each of the&#xD;
      three arms. The study will take place in Benin and Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study outcome is, of those eligible for LTBI therapy, the proportion starting&#xD;
      therapy within 3 months of the index TB patient starting active TB treatment. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes measured in each study arm include societal costs, prevalence of microbiologically&#xD;
      confirmed and clinically diagnosed active TB, prevalence of TB infection, Incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events, proportion who complete LTBI therapy, sensitivity and specificity of Chest&#xD;
      Xray reading in each study side, and prevalence of active TB diagnosed using CXR in&#xD;
      participants who cannot produce a sputum sample. Details of the statistical analysis plan for&#xD;
      each primary and secondary outcome are provided below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be recruited over 18 months. Participants will be followed until LTBI&#xD;
      treatment is completed.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a recent United Nations high level conference on TB a target was set that more than 30&#xD;
      million individuals should be treated for LTBI over the next 5 years. This ambitious goal&#xD;
      will require massive scaling up of LTBI diagnosis and treatment - which will be challenging,&#xD;
      if not impossible, with current approaches to diagnosis and treatment of latent TB. Two&#xD;
      aspects of management of LTBI - need for CXR and need for TST - are controversial, as both&#xD;
      can create important barriers to LTBI initiation, thereby reducing the individual as well as&#xD;
      public health benefits of treatment. For TST, difficulties in training and quality assurance&#xD;
      of administration and reading, and a global shortage of tuberculin material have reduced&#xD;
      uptake. CXR was recommended by WHO in its 2018 guidelines for LTBI management as part of&#xD;
      investigations to rule our active TB, however CXR services are not accessible in many&#xD;
      settings and even if accessible, the cost for a CXR often falls on patients and is often&#xD;
      prohibitively expensive. An alternate strategy is to use GeneXpert equipment, with the Xpert&#xD;
      MTB/Rif test (hereafter labelled GX) to replace CXR to exclude prevalent active TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare outcomes from three different strategies for the management of HIV uninfected&#xD;
      persons aged 5-50 years who are HH contacts of newly diagnosed microbiologically confirmed&#xD;
      active pulmonary TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a cluster randomized trial with three arms of equal size; clusters will be&#xD;
      defined as all the household contacts of patients with newly diagnosed active pulmonary TB.&#xD;
      The first eligible member of the HH who provides signed informed consent to participate will&#xD;
      be randomized to one of the three strategies. All subsequently enrolled members of the same&#xD;
      HH will be assigned to the same study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be randomized to one of three different study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard care (control arm): Participants will receive symptom screening and tuberculin&#xD;
           skin testing (TST). If symptom screen positive and/or TST positive, they undergo chest&#xD;
           x-rays (CXR). If CXR abnormal, they undergo microbiological investigation. If CXR normal&#xD;
           or if microbiological investigation negative, TST positive receive latent TB infection&#xD;
           (LTBI) treatment. If microbiological investigation is positive, they will be offered&#xD;
           treatment for active TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. GeneXpert (GX): Participants follow an algorithm similar to the standard care, however&#xD;
           participants with positive symptom screen and/or positive TST will receive GX (i.e., GX&#xD;
           replaces CXR in standard care algorithm). GX positive are considered to have active TB.&#xD;
           TST positive and GX negative receive LTBI treatment. If an individual is not able to&#xD;
           provide sputum, they will undergo a CXR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CXR for all/NoTST: Participants will receive symptom screening and CXR. No TST will be&#xD;
           performed. If CXR abnormal or symptom positive, they undergo microbiological&#xD;
           investigation. If the CXR is normal, and/or microbiological investigations negative -&#xD;
           they receive LTBI treatment as per national guidelines. If microbiological investigation&#xD;
           is positive they will be offered treatment for active TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV uninfected persons aged 5-50 years who are household contacts newly diagnosed&#xD;
      microbiologically confirmed active pulmonary TB can participate in the study. The planned&#xD;
      number of household contacts to recruit is about 1434 in total, or about 455 for each of the&#xD;
      three arms. The study will take place in three cities in two countries: Benin (Cotonou and&#xD;
      Porto Novo) and Brazil (Rio de Janeiro). In each city clinics will be selected that are&#xD;
      representative of the diagnostic facilities and capacities available in most clinics in the&#xD;
      country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be recruited over a period of 18 months. Participants will be&#xD;
      followed until LTBI treatment is completed (4-6 months depending on what treatment is given)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of those eligible (measured or estimated) for LTBI therapy, the proportion starting therapy&#xD;
      within 3 months of the index TB patient starting active TB treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Societal costs (health system and patient costs) of the full cascade of care - from&#xD;
           initial identification to LTBI therapy completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prevalence of microbiologically confirmed and clinically diagnosed active TB - detected&#xD;
           as part of the initial contact investigation, who initiate LTBI treatment within 3&#xD;
           months of the index TB patient starting active TB treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prevalence of positive TST (&gt;5 mm or &gt;10 mm) - overall, and by age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Incidence of grade 1-4 adverse events related to LTBI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Proportion who complete LTBI therapy - defined as having taken at least 80% of doses in&#xD;
           120% of allowed time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Sensitivity and specificity of CXR reading by usual providers in each study site&#xD;
           (reference standard will be readings by external reviewers).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Prevalence of active TB diagnosed using CXR in participants who cannot produce a sputum&#xD;
           sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis The primary outcome is the proportion starting LTBI therapy of those&#xD;
      eligible (measured or estimated) for latent TB therapy. 'Eligible' will be defined as: aged&#xD;
      5-50 years, HIV uninfected and TST &gt;5mm. For the no TST arm, the expected prevalence for HIV&#xD;
      uninfected HH contacts aged 5 years and older will be estimated from age-specific prevalence&#xD;
      of positive TST among HH contacts tested in the other two arms. This expected prevalence will&#xD;
      be used to estimate the proportion 'eligible' for LTBI therapy in the no TST arm. Treatment&#xD;
      initiation will be defined as being given a prescription for LTBI therapy, or dispensed the&#xD;
      first month of pills needed for LTBI therapy. Since this is a dichotomous outcome, the&#xD;
      primary analysis will be a logistic regression, using an identity link, and estimated via&#xD;
      generalized estimating equations (GEE) to account for clustering by household. An&#xD;
      exchangeable correlation structure and empirical standard errors will be used. The proportion&#xD;
      starting LTBI therapy within 3 months of the index TB patient starting active TB treatment&#xD;
      will be compared in each experimental arm against the standard arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Societal costs (health system and patient costs) of the full cascade of care - from&#xD;
           initial identification to LTBI therapy completion will be considered. Using all relevant&#xD;
           cost components and an ingredients approach, differences in health system costs will be&#xD;
           assessed for each of the strategies. Patient time will be valuated based on an&#xD;
           assumption of income equivalent to the average per capita income in the country. Health&#xD;
           care personnel time will be valuated based on average salaries from information provided&#xD;
           by facility management in each setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prevalence of microbiologically confirmed and clinically diagnosed active TB - detected&#xD;
           as part of the initial contact investigation, who initiate LTBI treatment within 3&#xD;
           months of the index TB patient starting active TB treatment, will be compared between&#xD;
           all three arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prevalence of positive TST (5 mm or 10 mm cut-points) by age group - 5-10, 11-17, 18-24,&#xD;
           25-34 years, and older in Standard and GX Strategies. This is simple descriptive&#xD;
           analysis - and will be presented as overall prevalence in the specified age groups, plus&#xD;
           stratified by country.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Incidence of serious adverse events related to LTBI therapy. Adverse events are&#xD;
           relatively rare dichotomous outcomes. As such, Poisson regression will be used to&#xD;
           compare the occurrence of the adverse events between each of the two experimental arms&#xD;
           and the conventional arm. To account for clustering by household, GEE, with an&#xD;
           exchangeable correlation structure and empirical standard errors will be used.&#xD;
           Investigators will compare in the same way - the occurrence of grade 1-2 adverse events&#xD;
           reported by study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Completion of LTBI therapy - defined as taking at least 80% of doses in 120% of allowed&#xD;
           time. (For 6H this means taking at least 144 doses within 216 days; for 4R this means 96&#xD;
           doses within 144 days, and for 3HR - 72 doses within 108 days.) Since this is a&#xD;
           dichotomous outcome, the primary analysis will use logistic regression, with an identity&#xD;
           link, and estimated via GEE to account for clustering by household. An exchangeable&#xD;
           correlation structure and empirical standard errors will be used. The proportion&#xD;
           completing treatment in each experimental arm against the standard arm will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Sensitivity and specificity of CXR reading by usual providers in each study site. For&#xD;
           this analysis, the reference standard will be the readings by the external CXR review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Active TB - defined as treatment initiated for active TB - detected only as a result of&#xD;
           the CXR done in persons who could not produce a sputum sample.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Index TB patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. New diagnosis of pulmonary microbiologically confirmed (smear, GX or culture)&#xD;
                  active TB within 30 days of treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Must have at least one identified household contact, and HHC investigation has&#xD;
                  not been started already.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Must agree to allow research team to access their medical history and approach&#xD;
                  their household contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Household contacts:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Age 5-50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. On average in the past 3 months - slept in the same house, at least one night per&#xD;
                  week, or spent at least one hour per day for 5 days per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Pregnant woman can be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. People with prior active TB or latent TB therapy will be included. These&#xD;
                  participants will be assessed for prevalent active TB, although they will not be&#xD;
                  treated for LTBI. Hence they will be included in the analyses of yield of active&#xD;
                  case finding, but excluded from analyses of numbers diagnosed and treated for&#xD;
                  LTBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Index TB patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Known drug-resistant TB (INH resistant, multidrug resistance or rifampin&#xD;
                  resistance) may be excluded - after discussion in each country with TB program&#xD;
                  officials. If the TB programme's policy is to screen contacts of MDR cases for&#xD;
                  active TB only and not provide any LTBI therapy, then index TB patients with MDR&#xD;
                  will be excluded as well as their HHCs. However, if the national TB program&#xD;
                  policy is to treat such individuals with standard LTBI therapy (since some HHCs&#xD;
                  of MDR patients will develop TB with drug-sensitive isolates later), then these&#xD;
                  index TB patients and their HHCs will be eligible. Hence, this will be a&#xD;
                  country-specific exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Index TB patient with previous history of active TB (because their HHC may have&#xD;
                  undergone investigation before - which may change their need for study&#xD;
                  interventions, and also potentially change their perceptions and behaviours in&#xD;
                  the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Only has extra-pulmonary TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. No identified household contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Household contacts:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Members of the household, but do not meet the minimum time definitions for HH&#xD;
                  contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Had TST/IGRA within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Had a CXR on the same day or after the date of diagnosis of the index TB patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. People living with HIV. (In most TB programs, HH contacts have unknown HIV&#xD;
                  status; HIV testing is recommended by WHO only if the index TB patient is known&#xD;
                  to have HIV co-infection). Contacts will be asked if they have been previously&#xD;
                  diagnosed to have HIV infection, and also asked if they are taking&#xD;
                  anti-retroviral therapy (if patients are receiving any medications, these will be&#xD;
                  checked carefully to verify what these are, and in particular if they are on&#xD;
                  anti-retroviral therapy). Both questions will be asked because some patients may&#xD;
                  be on therapy, but are not aware of the indication, or they may not wish to&#xD;
                  divulge their HIV status. If HHC are on anti-retroviral therapy and/or provide a&#xD;
                  history of previous HIV diagnosis, then they will be excluded, because the WHO&#xD;
                  recommended algorithm for investigation of household contacts who are HIV&#xD;
                  infected is different from that followed in the study arms. All index TB patients&#xD;
                  should undergo HIV testing based on national algorithm. If the index TB patient&#xD;
                  is found to be HIV positive, partner notification services will be recommended to&#xD;
                  the person living with HIV. The children of women who are HIV-infected should&#xD;
                  also undergo HIV testing. HIV testing will be offered to all household contacts&#xD;
                  who have not been HIV-tested within the last 6 months. If any household contact&#xD;
                  is found to be HIV-infected, they will be excluded pre-randomization. If there is&#xD;
                  a significant delay between identification of the household contacts and&#xD;
                  obtaining the HIV result, the HHCs can be randomized and then excluded&#xD;
                  post-randomization. These HHCs will be excluded from the modified intention to&#xD;
                  treat analysis, which will be the primary analysis. All HHCs identified to have&#xD;
                  HIV-infection will undergo investigations and treatment following WHO guidelines&#xD;
                  for HIV-infected household contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. If one member family refuses to participate to the study and has no objection to&#xD;
                  have the other HH members to participate in the study, then we can proceed with&#xD;
                  the consent process with the other HHC. But if one household contact refuses to&#xD;
                  participate and objects to other HH members to take part of the study, then none&#xD;
                  of the HHC in this family can participate in the study. It is not necessary that&#xD;
                  all of the HHC signed consent but simply that no one objects. At any time a&#xD;
                  participant can refuse any test, or have other investigations - as ordered by&#xD;
                  their doctor/nurse or if they prefer).&#xD;
