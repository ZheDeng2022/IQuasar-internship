  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, two-arm, parallel group randomized clinical trial comparing the effect&#xD;
      of two mindfulness-based interventions (Mindful Interoceptive Mapping vs. Mindfulness of the&#xD;
      Breath) on opioid-treated chronic pain patients' pleasant/unpleasant sensation reports and&#xD;
      opioid use.&#xD;

    <measure>Immediate Change in Pleasant Sensation Ratios</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before and immediately after the final mindfulness training session, approximately 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Multidimensional Assessment of Pleasant and Painful Sensations (MAPPS) is an outline of a human body overlaid by a grid of 786 sensation pixels that was developed using the Qualtrics online survey platform, which can be recreated on any device capable of supporting a web-browser. Mouse clicks allow respondents to identify locations (i.e., grid pixels) on the manikin where they feel both pleasant and unpleasant sensations. Clicking once in any grid pixel turns that location blue, indicating a pleasant sensation. Clicking twice in any grid pixel turns that location red, indicating an unpleasant sensation. A ratio of pleasant to unpleasant sensations is derived from MAPPS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Longer-Term Change in Pleasant Sensation Ratios</measure>
    <time_frame>At pre- and posttreatment, approximately 1.5 months</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Immediately before and immediately after the final mindfulness training session, approximately 30 minutes</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in Opioid Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily from study enrollment to 1-month follow-up: approximately 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid Use will be assessed with a timeline follow-back procedure.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pain Functional Interference</measure>
    <time_frame>At pre- and posttreatment, approximately 1.5 months</time_frame>

    <description>The Mindful Breathing intervention will be adapted from a validated, brief mindfulness training model. Participants will be instructed to focus on the sensations of the breath (i.e., at the tip of the nose and in the nostrils, abdomen and back) and, if a pain arises in the body, acknowledge it without judgement and return attention to the breath.</description>

    <description>The MIM intervention will be adapted from the core MORE meditation practice. Participants will be instructed to (1) zoom in to deconstruct pain into its constituent affectively-valenced physical sensations and precisely map each sensation's spatial location, (2) zoom out to broaden the field of attention to include previously neglected sensory elements (i.e., spaces within the body that are absent of sensation and pleasant sensations), and (3) savor any pleasant sensations or experiences occurring during the mindfulness practice.</description>
