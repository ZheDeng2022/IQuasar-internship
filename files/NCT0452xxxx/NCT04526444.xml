  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project addresses physical inactivity as a global health issue. Physical inactivity is&#xD;
      the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality. Moreover, inactive adults have a higher&#xD;
      risk to develop lifestyle diseases. To date, there is preliminary evidence of the efficacy in&#xD;
      the use of certain strategies including fitness technologies and digital interventions for&#xD;
      physical activity (PA) promotion. Intervention studies are needed to test the effectiveness&#xD;
      of PA promotion strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Hybrid Type I effectiveness-implementation randomised controlled trial (RCT) will&#xD;
      investigate the effects of 1) fitness trackers, 2) home-based online training, and 3) peer&#xD;
      support via social media among inactive adults. The design will allow testing the study&#xD;
      outcomes while gathering information on implementation in a real-world situation. The study&#xD;
      will produce evidence on whether these interventions increase the levels of PA among inactive&#xD;
      adults and improve health outcomes. Increased PA will also result in better primary&#xD;
      prevention of lifestyle diseases.&#xD;
