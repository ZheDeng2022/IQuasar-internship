      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiological changes in respiratory muscle morphology and functioning in patients&#xD;
      with end-stage pulmonary disease are not very well known. Furthermore, in COPD, long-term&#xD;
      high-intensity NIV is applied without knowing the exact consequences on the lungs and&#xD;
      respiratory muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aims of the study are to get insight in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. changes respiratory muscles in end-stage respiratory disease, comparing COPD with&#xD;
      restrictive lung disease (RLD) due to pulmonary fibrosis B. the effects of long-term HI-NIV&#xD;
      in severe COPD patients on the respiratory muscles and the lungs; by comparing COPD patients&#xD;
      that had been treated with long-term NIV to COPD patients that were not treated with&#xD;
      long-term NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: In order to investigate this, the investigators will include in a small pilot&#xD;
      cohort study patients being lung transplanted. In these patients there is lung tissue&#xD;
      available and respiratory muscle biopsies will be performed during lung-transplant surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients that are listed for lung transplantation for an underlying&#xD;
      diagnosis of COPD or RLD will be asked to participate. Three groups will be included:&#xD;
      patients with a RLD due to pulmonary fibrosis, COPD patients that had been treated with&#xD;
      long-term NIV prior to being lung transplanted and COPD patients that were not treated with&#xD;
      long-term NIV. Patients will be included definitely once being lung transplanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The study is an exploratory pilot study. Both contractile&#xD;
      strength and the structure of single diaphragm and intercostal muscle fibres as well as lung&#xD;
      injury; i.e. alveolar structure and damage and inflammation in the alveoli, will be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive inflammatory disease&#xD;
      characterised by airway and lung parenchyma damage. At end-stage disease patients may develop&#xD;
      chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, a disease characteristic that is however not&#xD;
      uniformly seen in other end-stage lung diseases, such as in patients with pulmonary fibrosis.&#xD;
      The underlying process for the development of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure is&#xD;
      incompletely understood and the role of respiratory muscle alterations is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home noninvasive ventilation with high-intensity ventilatory settings (HI-NIV) has been shown&#xD;
      to be effective in these severe COPD patients. However, in patients being mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated on the intensive care unit for diverse reasons, high-intensity ventilation,&#xD;
      especially high tidal volumes, has been shown to result in ventilator associated lung and&#xD;
      diaphragm injury. Whether this occurs in home high-intensity NIV, is however completely&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aims of the study are to get insight in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. changes respiratory muscles in end-stage respiratory disease, comparing COPD with&#xD;
      restrictive lung disease (RLD) due to pulmonary fibrosis B. the effects of long-term HI-NIV&#xD;
      in severe COPD patients on the respiratory muscles; i.e. the contractile strength and the&#xD;
      structure of single diaphragm and intercostal muscle fibres and the lungs; i.e. alveolar&#xD;
      structure and damage and inflammation, by comparing COPD patients that had been treated with&#xD;
      long-term NIV to COPD patients that were not treated with long-term NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: In order to investigate this, the investigators will include in a small pilot&#xD;
      cohort study patients being lung transplanted. In these patients there is lung tissue&#xD;
      available and respiratory muscle biopsies will be performed during lung-transplant surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients that are listed for lung transplantation for an underlying&#xD;
      diagnosis of COPD or RLD will be asked to participate. Three groups will be included:&#xD;
      patients with a RLD due to pulmonary fibrosis, COPD patients that had been treated with&#xD;
      long-term NIV prior to being lung transplanted and COPD patients that were not treated with&#xD;
      long-term NIV. Patients will be included definitely once being lung transplanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The study is an exploratory pilot study. The study aims to&#xD;
      get data on respiratory muscle and lung and airway pathology in order to, if important&#xD;
      results are observed, set up a larger prospective trial investigating both clinical outcomes&#xD;
      and pathology of the respiratory muscles/lungs. Both contractile strength and the structure&#xD;
      of single diaphragm and intercostal muscle fibres as well as lung injury; i.e. alveolar&#xD;
      structure and damage and inflammation in the alveoli, will be investigated.&#xD;
