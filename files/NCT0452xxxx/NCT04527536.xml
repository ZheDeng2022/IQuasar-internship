  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast milk jaundice (BMJ) is the main cause of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Excessive serum&#xD;
      unconjugated bilirubin level will not only cause the interruption or early termination of&#xD;
      breastfeeding, but also cause kernicterus. Which can cause long-term dysfunction in infants.&#xD;
      But for a long time, BMJ diagnosis has relied on clinical exclusive methods, lack of&#xD;
      objective and reliable laboratory indicators. Which leads to misdiag. This project is a&#xD;
      single-center, prospective nested case-control study. It is planned to establish a neonatal&#xD;
      BMJ cohort. According to the admission criteria, 100 cases of early-onset BMJ and late-onset&#xD;
      BMJ will be completed, and 100 healthy controls collected during the same period. , Compare&#xD;
      the detection results of fecal miRNA and intestinal flora of the two groups of BMJ children&#xD;
      and healthy controls, draw the ROC curve of the joint diagnosis, conduct research on the&#xD;
      combined diagnostic value of fecal miRNA and intestinal flora analysis, and try to find the&#xD;
      feasibility and practical value of diagnostic markers for feces in infants with BMJ.&#xD;

      This project is a single-center, prospective nested case-control study to investigate&#xD;
      feasibility and practical value of diagnostic markers in infants with BMJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the admission criteria, 100 cases of early-onset BMJ, 100 late-onset BMJ and 100&#xD;
      healthy controls will be selected. Their feces, peripheral venous blood and mothers' breast&#xD;
      milk were collected for further testing. Compare the detection results of fecal miRNA and&#xD;
      intestinal flora of the two groups of BMJ children and healthy controls, draw the ROC curve&#xD;
      of the joint diagnosis, conduct research on the combined diagnostic value of fecal miRNA and&#xD;
      intestinal flora analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to find the objective and reliable laboratory indicators to diagnose BMJ.&#xD;
