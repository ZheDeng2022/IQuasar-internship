    <textblock>
      Phase IV clinical trial, single-center, double-blind, randomized, two-period crossover,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, to determine the effect of treatment with umeclidinium/vilanterol 55/22&#xD;
      μg compared with placebo on the increase in left systolic chamber function during exercise in&#xD;
      patients with COPD, lung hyperinflation and mild to moderate left ventricular dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be patients from the outpatient offices of the Cardiology, Pulmonology&#xD;
      and Internal Medicine departments of the Gregorio Marañon University Hospital in Madrid, over&#xD;
      40 years of age with a diagnosis of COPD, lung hyperinflation with a residual volume more&#xD;
      than 135 % and stable heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction between 35-55%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either umeclidinium/vilanterol 55/22 μg Ellipta&#xD;
      for 14 days followed by a washout period of 14 days and then placebo for 14 days, or the same&#xD;
      treatments in reverse order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization numbers will be generated by blocks of 4 elements selected with a&#xD;
      computer-generated random list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, investigators, individuals in charge of the assessments, sponsor, CRO staff, and&#xD;
      data analysts will be blinded to the identity and assignment of the treatments from the time&#xD;
      of randomization until database lock, using the following methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Randomization data will be kept confidential until the time of unmasking (unlocking the&#xD;
           database) and will not be accessible to anyone else involved in the study and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The identities of the treatments will be concealed by the use of active drugs and&#xD;
           placebo identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of administration, appearance, and&#xD;
           taste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two crossover treatment periods (treatments 1 and 2) of 14 days each separated by 14 days&#xD;
      washout, and follow-up. The active treatment will be a combination of umeclidinium/vilanterol&#xD;
      55/22 μg Ellipta given by inhalation once per day over 14 days. Matching placebo will be used&#xD;
      as a control. Any ongoing hypertensive and cardiovascular medications (including&#xD;
      beta-blockers if prescribed) will be kept stable throughout the study. All previous COPD&#xD;
      medications except inhaled corticosteroids (if dose stable for at least 30 days) will be&#xD;
      withdrawn. Patients will be given salbutamol as rescue medication throughout the study and&#xD;
      the respective study drugs in the treatment phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse effects (AEs) spontaneously referred to either by the patients or during the&#xD;
      visits will be registered and notified. All AEs will be collected, including those that are&#xD;
      not considered associated with the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical information will be anonymously recorded in an e-CRF system programmed using&#xD;
      in-house resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any abnormal result of the study variables that the investigator considers clinically&#xD;
      significant and require adjustments or transient or permanent interruption of treatment or&#xD;
      any type of intervention or diagnostic evaluation to assess the associated risk for the&#xD;
      patient will be collected as an adverse event and should be investigated and monitored&#xD;
      adequately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, cardiac parameters will be determined by exercise echocardiography and MRI&#xD;
      and assessed by experienced cardiologists (with cardiac MRI experience) blinded to all&#xD;
      clinical and trial-related data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung function will be assessed using constant-volume body plethysmography and spirometry in&#xD;
      accordance with the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a symptom-limited bicycle-exercise test at 30⁰ lateral decubitus in a&#xD;
      dedicated ergometer (Easystress, Ecogito Medical SPRL, Liege, Belgium). Workrate will be&#xD;
      initiated at 25 W and increased by 15 W every 3 min. The gas exchange will be simultaneously&#xD;
      analyzed breath-by-breath (Ergostik, Geratherm, Germany). Doppler-derived stroke volume,&#xD;
      systolic ejection period, and left ventricular outflow tract, at a specific point from the&#xD;
      aortic valve, will be measured as recommended. The LV outflow tract cross-sectional area will&#xD;
      be assumed constant so that the change in SV will be determined by the change in the outflow&#xD;
      tract time-velocity integral as measured by pulsed-wave Doppler. We have recently validated&#xD;
      the Doppler-derived method for measuring SV during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline LV volumes and ejection fraction will be measured using the biplane Simpson's&#xD;
      method. In addition, color-Doppler M-mode images will be acquired at baseline and during all&#xD;
      exercise phases both for the ejection and diastolic phases at the outflow and inflow tract&#xD;
      locations, respectively. These recordings have been validated both in clinical and&#xD;
      preclinical studies as robust and load-independent indices of global LV systolic chamber&#xD;
      function and diastolic suction, respectively. Furthermore, the ejection intraventricular&#xD;
      pressure difference (EIVPD) is a simple but very sensitive method to detect subtle changes in&#xD;
      LV systolic function, undetectable by other conventional methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because frequently patients do not reach the anaerobic threshold during exercise&#xD;
      echocardiography (decubitus…), a separate maximal ergospirometry on a cycle ergometer will be&#xD;
      performed to measure peak exercise capacity. The cycle ergometer (ER-900, Vyasis, Hochberg,&#xD;
      Germany) exercise test will start with a period of quiet breathing for at least 3 min&#xD;
      followed by unloaded pedaling for 3 min, thereafter an immediate increase in work rate to 10&#xD;
      W and then by further increments of 10 W every minute until symptom limitation during which&#xD;
      breath by breath gas exchange ( i.e. VO2 and VCO2) (Oxycon-pro Vyasis, Hoechberg Germany)&#xD;
      lactate threshold (if attained by the patient) maximum ventilation and heart-rate dyspnea,&#xD;
      inspiratory capacity and exercise flow-volume loops (every 2 min) and HR recovery rate will&#xD;
      be measured. Peak oxygen uptake will be defined as the greatest work rate that was maintained&#xD;
      for ≥30 s at 50-70 rpm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a conventional cardiac MRI study (Philips Achieva 1.5 T) without&#xD;
      gadolinium to assess the size of the left and right ventricles. In addition, phase-contrast&#xD;
      studies will be obtained to address cardiac output and flow characteristics at the level of&#xD;
      the aorta and the main pulmonary artery, as previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient reported outcomes will be assessed using the COPD assessment test (CAT) to measure&#xD;
      health status and the transition dyspnea index to measure dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      External data monitorization and Adverse Event Reporting shall be contracted to an&#xD;
      independent CRO, following current standards of clinical investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the effect (compared with placebo) of umeclidinium/vilanterol 55/22 μg on the&#xD;
      increase in exercise stroke volume (from baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the effect (compared with placebo) of umeclidinium/vilanterol 55/22 μg on the&#xD;
      reduction of dynamic hyperinflation (from baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the effect (compared with placebo) of umeclidinium/vilanterol 55/22 μg on resting&#xD;
      cardiac function (from baseline).&#xD;
