      The pregnant women constituting the sample were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 was given only&#xD;
      childbirth education (Group-ED), group 2 was given childbirth education and was subjected to&#xD;
      a birth plan (Group-ED&amp;P), and group 3 was the control group, each including 51 pregnant&#xD;
      women.&#xD;

      Aim: The purpose of this study was to investigate how pregnant women's childbirth&#xD;
      self-efficacy was affected by childbirth education and birth plans applied with the&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The research was carried out at seven Family Health Centers in Turkey as a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. The pregnant women constituting the sample were divided into 3&#xD;
      groups. Group 1 was given only childbirth education (Group-ED), group 2 was given childbirth&#xD;
      education and was subjected to a birth plan (Group-ED&amp;P), and group 3 was the control group,&#xD;
      each including 51 pregnant women.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in birth self-efficacy level at 2 weeks (after intervention).</measure>
    <time_frame>CBSEI was administered as a pretest to all pregnant women in the three groups. After two weeks CBSEI was administered as a posttest to the pregnant women in all three groups.</time_frame>
    <description>Childbirth Self-Efficacy was measured with Childbirth Self-Efficacy Inventory (CBSEI) Short Version. The scale consisted of two sub-dimensions, self-efficacy expectancy and outcome expectancy. The highest score to be taken from the sub-dimensions was 160, and the lowest score was 16. Pregnant women's having a high score on this scale meant that the level of their childbirth self-efficacy was high.</description>
