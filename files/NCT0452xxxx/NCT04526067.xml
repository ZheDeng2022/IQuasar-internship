  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team will use components of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation,&#xD;
      Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to compare Cognitive Adaptation Training (CAT) to Remotely&#xD;
      delivered Cognitive Adaptation Training (R-CAT) 1-9 within a managed care organization (MCO),&#xD;
      targeting members with serious mental illness (SMI) needing assistance with the regular&#xD;
      taking of medication.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals choosing or assigned to R-CAT will continue treatment as usual with their health&#xD;
      care team and R-CAT will be added. R-CAT is a remotely delivered version of CAT focused on&#xD;
      medication adherence using a series of manual-driven compensatory strategies and&#xD;
      environmental supports (signs, checklists, electronic cueing devices) based upon a&#xD;
      streamlined assessment of executive function impairment and barriers to habit formation&#xD;
      including forgetfulness, difficulties in problem-solving, disorganization, apathy or&#xD;
      amotivation, disinhibition. and home environment. Initial R-CAT goals are to 1) ensure that&#xD;
      medications listed as prescribed are available 2) to assess current cognitive, behavioral and&#xD;
      environmental facilitators and barriers to habit-formation 3) to set up customized CAT&#xD;
      supports to address the barriers and use facilitators to build habits to take medication.&#xD;
      Rare home visits may occur if issues cannot be resolved remotely. Based upon the pilot, the&#xD;
      study team don't anticipate any more than 5-10% of individuals to need face-to-face visits.&#xD;
      No one had home visits as part of the pilot intervention. A structured R-CAT treatment note&#xD;
      with places for pictures of CAT interventions is used for home visits. Support and reminder&#xD;
      calls use a brief checklist modified from the Healthy Habits Program to address issues in use&#xD;
      of supports, placement of supports and habit formation. Examples of CAT interventions to&#xD;
      promote taking medication regularly appear above. All home visits and phone calls will be&#xD;
      audio-taped (with consent) for quality assurance.&#xD;

    <description>A 12-item scale assessing three proposed characteristics of habit;1) automaticity , 2) frequency, and 3) relevance to self-identity. Four items of this scale, items 2,3,5 and 8 represent the Self-Reported Behavioral Automaticity Index (SRBAI). Lower scores indicate greater habit strength and greater automaticity. A mean Habit score will be computed using the entire scale.</description>

    <description>Change in symptoms assess by a trained rater using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Expanded Version (BPRS-E). The scale is used to rate the subjects using 24 items, each to be rated in a 7-point scale of severity ranging from NA (not assessed), then 1-7, with 7 being the most severe. A total score reflects an overall level of symptomology, with 164, being the maximum score, with the most symptoms present.</description>
