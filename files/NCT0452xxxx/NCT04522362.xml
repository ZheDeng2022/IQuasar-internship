  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this pilot study were to (1) initially validate the applicability of a&#xD;
      human laboratory model of relapse initially developed for smokers to e-cigarette users; (2)&#xD;
      to use this human laboratory model of lapse behavior to examine the effects of acute&#xD;
      psychological stress on vaping-lapse behavior among adults who are experienced, e-cigarette&#xD;
      users.&#xD;

    <measure>Craving</measure>
    <time_frame>The VAS will be collected at each laboratory session (within 1 week after screening/baseline) 5 times: baseline (pre task), post task (+15 minutes), decision to smoke (+20 minutes), +30 minutes smoking ab-lib, and +60 minutes during smoking ab-lib</time_frame>
    <description>Craving was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) asking &quot;How much do you crave an e-cigarette right now?&quot; with possible responses ranging from 0 (not at all) to 100 (extremely).</description>

    <description>Stress was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) asking: &quot;How stressed or anxious do you feel right now?&quot; with possible responses ranging from 0 (not at all) to 100 (extremely).</description>

    <description>The Control Task was implemented to ensure the specificity of the psychological stress effects had on study outcomes. Therefore, the Control Task had a similar procedure and the same duration of the TSST, lacking except for only the psychologically stressful component. The control task consisted of (a) Participants had a 5-min a preparation section and anticipation phase (5 min ), (b) a reading task where they had to. Then, all participants had to be read a simple text in a low voice (5 min), and (c) an arithmetic section where they were asked to perform an easy mathematical calculation (5 mins).</description>

    <description>The Trier Social Stress Task (TSST) is a standardized, 15-minute laboratory task designed to induce psychological stress in laboratory settings (Kirschbaum, Pirke, &amp; Hellhammer, 1993). The TSST consists of three continuously successive phases: (a) an anticipation period (5 min); (b) a free speech task (5 min); and (c) a mental arithmetic task (5 min). As is standard in the TSST procedure, participants were told by a research staff member that they would provide a brief speech about &quot;their dream job&quot; in front of a critical audience. At the end of the speech, a member of the audience instructed the participant to conduct serial subtractions as accurately and quickly as possible.</description>
