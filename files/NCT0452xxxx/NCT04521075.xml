      A Phase Ib trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Fecal Microbial Transplantation (FMT)&#xD;
      in combination with Nivolumab in subjects with metastatic or inoperable melanoma,&#xD;
      microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch-repair deficient (dMMR) cancer, or&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I single-center adaptive design study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of FMT in combination with Nivolumab for adult subjects with treatment-refractory or&#xD;
      inoperable melanoma, MSH-H, dMMr or NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FMT will be conducted with fecal capsules, originating from patients that have achieved a&#xD;
      durable complete response with immune checkpoint inhibitors. The study will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the combination of FMT with Nivolumab, a human immunoglobulin G4&#xD;
      (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that blocks PD-1 (anti PD-1) treatment and explore different&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
