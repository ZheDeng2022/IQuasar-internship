      The purpose of the study was to compare the effect of upper cervical thrust joint&#xD;
      manipulation and reverse Sustained Natural apophyseal Glide on intensity of pain, pain&#xD;
      pressure threshold, range of motion and headache disability in patients with cervicogenic&#xD;
      headache. A randomized control trial was conducted at Max Rehab and Physical therapy center,&#xD;
      Islamabad. The sample size was calculated through open epi tool is 16. The participants were&#xD;
      divided in two groups, 8 participants in experimental group and 8 participants in control&#xD;
      group. The study duration was six months. Sampling technique applied was Purposive sampling&#xD;
      for recruitment and group randomization using sealed envelope method. Only 20 to 40 years&#xD;
      participants with cervicogenic headache and associated symptoms were included in the study.&#xD;
      Tools used in this study are Numeric pain rating Scale (NPRS), Algometer, Inclinometer and&#xD;
      headache disability index (HDI). Data analyzed through Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences (SPSS) version 23.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 1983 the term &quot;cervicogenic headache&quot; was introduced in an article in the medical&#xD;
      literature. The diagnostic criteria of cervicogenic headache was revised in 1998. The&#xD;
      international headache society classified the types of headaches based on their source and&#xD;
      characteristics. Studies showed that out of 47% of the patients suffering from headache. 38%&#xD;
      are tension-type ; 10% are migraine ; 3% chronic headache and 2.5 to 4.1 % are cervicogenic&#xD;
      headaches.The prevalence of cervicogenic headache (CH) after the whiplash is as high as&#xD;
      fifty-three percent.Literature revealed that due to varying use of diagnostic measures it is&#xD;
      difficult to find out the true prevalence of cervicogenic headache but it ranges from minimum&#xD;
      0.7% to maximum 13.8% in population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The headache which is originated from the cervical spine and pain is referred to the head&#xD;
      region is termed as Cervicogenic headache.So, the source of pain is a cervical region located&#xD;
      near the base of the skull, pain is referred from the neck region which travels towards the&#xD;
      occulo-frontal and temporal areas of the head.Cervicogenic headache is four times more&#xD;
      prevalent in females than males. Females suffer more from cervicogenic head due to hormonal&#xD;
      imbalances and poor posture. Poor posture includes the forward headache posture which affects&#xD;
      the normal biomechanics of the cervical spine and increases the stress on the neck region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible cause of cervicogenic headache is said to be the supply of the upper three&#xD;
      cervical nerves and its various distributions.Upper three cervical nerves innervate the&#xD;
      atlantoaxial joint, atlantooccipital joint, facet joint (C2-C3), suboccipital, paravertebral.&#xD;
      upper posterior neck musculature, upper cervical ligaments, spinal dura mater, the vertebral&#xD;
      artery, intervertebral disc (C2-C3), trapezius, and sternocleidomastoid muscles. Any of these&#xD;
      structures is the possible source of pain and it should be diagnosed first. According to the&#xD;
      criteria of the International headache society (IHS) impairment in the function of upper&#xD;
      cervical muscles is the source of cervicogenic headache.Patients suffering from cervicogenic&#xD;
      headaches show a decrease in their quality of life and also compromised physical abilities as&#xD;
      compared to other types of headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multifaced approach is required to treat the patients suffering from cervicogenic&#xD;
      headaches. Most commonly pharmacological, non-pharmacological, physical therapy, anesthetic&#xD;
      blockade, and sometimes surgical approach is used. A successful intervention requires a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team of physicians including a pain specialist, anesthesiologist, physical&#xD;
      therapist, a psychologist to provide a suitable treatment. For the long-lasting effect of the&#xD;
      nerve blocks and neurolytic procedures, physical therapy and rehabilitation are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different physical therapy treatments including thrust joint manipulation, mobilizations,&#xD;
      exercise program, postural education, or modification used as an effective intervention of&#xD;
      cervicogenic headache. A combination of these treatments is used to subside the symptoms of&#xD;
      CH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature review:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic and evidence-based search of relevant literature was performed by utilizing&#xD;
      PubMed and Google Scholar as search engines and the key words used were sustained natural&#xD;
      apophyseal glides, thrust joint manipulation, mulligan, and reverse sustained natural&#xD;
      apophyseal glides. The purpose of the literature review is to find out the pre-existing&#xD;
      literature regarding the Reverse SNAGS and TJM interventions for cervicogenic headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in 2019 on cervicogenic headache&#xD;
      to find out the effectiveness of mobilization and manipulation compared to other conservative&#xD;
      interventions in reducing pain and disability. So, it was concluded that both mobilization&#xD;
      and manipulation are effective in cervicogenic headache but there were few limitations in the&#xD;
      study that only nine studies were included and more quality research are required. Further&#xD;
      research is required to observe the long-term effect and other interventions for clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An overview of systematic reviews was conducted in 2019 on the physical therapy interventions&#xD;
      for cervicogenic headache. Results from the reviews stated that manipulation, mobilization,&#xD;
      and other conservative interventions were effective in decreasing the frequency of pain and&#xD;
      disability in patients suffering from cervicogenic headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a randomized control trial conducted in 2019 on cervicogenic headache. The&#xD;
      purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of headache sustained natural&#xD;
      apophyseal glide (SNAG) and SNAG rotation separately as well as in combination in patients&#xD;
      suffering from cervicogenic headache to reduce the headache and improve activity limitation.&#xD;
      The results of the study showed that group that received both SNAG and SNAG rotation&#xD;
      technique is effective in reducing cervicogenic headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized control trail in 2018 on cervicogenic headaches. The purpose of the study was to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of SNAG and reverse SNAG on patients suffering from cervicogenic&#xD;
      headache. Results showed that headache SNAG was more effective than reverse SNAG in treating&#xD;
      patients suffering from cervicogenic headache. The major limitation of the study was limited&#xD;
      sample size and lack of quantitative equipment for measuring the change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent studies, results reported that Sustained Natural Apophyseal Glides and Thrust Joint&#xD;
      Manipulation (TJM) were effective in the management of Cervicogenic Headache. However, they&#xD;
      did not report if manipulation resulted in superior outcomes compared to mobilization for the&#xD;
      management of this population, or secondly no literature was found regarding the reverse&#xD;
      SNAGs as an intervention for cervicogenic headache. The purpose of this study is to compare&#xD;
      the effects of reverse SNAG and TJM in patients with cervicogenic headache regarding the&#xD;
      improvement of headache, pain, pain pressure threshold, and cervical range of motion&#xD;
