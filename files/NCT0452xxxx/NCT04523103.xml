  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fertilization failure is a common problem in assisted reproductive Technology (ART). The main&#xD;
      reason for fertilization failure of conventional IVF fertilization is sperm penetration&#xD;
      failure, and the main reason of ICSI is insufficient oocyte activation. Artificial assisted&#xD;
      activation may provide an effective technique to rescue fertilization failure. In this study,&#xD;
      standard ICSI procedures were applied to save fertilization failure of unfertilized mature&#xD;
      oocytes in IVF cycles. The unfertilized mature oocytes after ICSI were activated by calcium&#xD;
      ion, or injected with calcium chloride/activated with mechanical stimulated and then transfer&#xD;
      to calcium ion to improve fertilization. In this study, different artificial assisted&#xD;
      activation methods were used to save the fertilization failure and assess its effective and&#xD;
      subsequent embryo development potential.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A variety of mechanical, electrical, and chemical methods has been used to trigger the&#xD;
      calcium oscillations to activate oocytes. Mechanical and chemical activation are the most&#xD;
      commonly used methods for artificial oocyte activation, which can mimic calcium oscillations&#xD;
      saving fertilization failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group, a single spermatozoon was injected into the failed fertilization MII oocyte in&#xD;
      conventional IVF cycle. What to do when ICSI fails? The investigators collected the&#xD;
      unfertilized MII oocytes and divided them into 3 groups to perform different activation&#xD;
      methods, including chemical calcium ionophore activation (experiment group 1), CaCl2 injected&#xD;
      combined with calcium ionophore activation (experiment group 2), and mechanical stimulation&#xD;
      combined with calcium ionophore activation (experiment group 3). Calcium ionophore A23187&#xD;
      (Sigma) was used for assisted activation. The final solution was 10 μmol/L. The oocytes were&#xD;
      exposed to the calcium ionophore A23187 for 10 min at 37°C in 5% CO2. The oocytes were&#xD;
      checked for pronucleus formation at 16-20 hours after activation. Fertilized oocytes were&#xD;
      cultured in vitro for 3-5 days, the developmental potential of the activated embryos were&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study want to explore the effective of different artificial assisted activation methods,&#xD;
      to improve the fertilization outcome of unfertilized oocytes after ICSI or IVF.&#xD;
