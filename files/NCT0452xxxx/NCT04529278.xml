  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is the second leading cause of end stage renal disease in France (22% in the 2016&#xD;
      REIN register). In hemodialysis, its prevalence is higher, between 30-40% depending on the&#xD;
      study. Associated with type 2 diabetes, a large number of patients present with overweight&#xD;
      (body mass index or BMI&gt; 25 kg / m2) which can lead to a temporary contraindication to kidney&#xD;
      transplant by the surgeon, or even definitive once BMI is over 30 kg / m2. Indeed, above this&#xD;
      threshold, patients are exposed to an increased risk of surgical complications (wall&#xD;
      infections, suture release), hospitalizations and potentially transplant failure. A recent&#xD;
      study based on the Kidney Registry showed that patients with a BMI&gt; 31 kg / m2 were more&#xD;
      likely to stay on dialysis than to benefit from a transplant whereas for each decrease of 1&#xD;
      kg / m2 of BMI, there is a 9-11% increase in the likelihood of being transplanted. The&#xD;
      management of obesity in dialysis patients is important for reducing cardiovascular risks but&#xD;
      also because it increases the chances of access to transplantation. However, current weight&#xD;
      loss programs are disappointing. The changes in hygiene and diet rules integrated into a&#xD;
      specialized monitoring program only allow a weight loss of 2 to 8% in 24 months for half of&#xD;
      the patients. Bariatric surgery is, of course, a more effective alternative, but with a 10%&#xD;
      risk of postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (aGLP1) analogues are a new class of antidiabetic drugs that have&#xD;
      revolutionized the management of type 2 diabetes. In fact, they combine efficacy on glycemic&#xD;
      control but also on weight loss. They are used in obese non-diabetic people in some&#xD;
      countries, with a reduction in weight of up to 10 to 15% with certain molecules. In addition,&#xD;
      they have shown an effect on reducing cardiovascular events in diabetics including with&#xD;
      Chronic Kidney Disease CKD 3-4. AGPL1 are well tolerated with side effects mainly of&#xD;
      digestive tropism such as nausea or vomiting. Exceptionally, these effects can occur from the&#xD;
      first injection requiring permanent discontinuation of treatment. In 20% of cases, these side&#xD;
      effects can appear in the first weeks. They gradually fade, spontaneously or after&#xD;
      symptomatic treatment and allow titration of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AGLP1 is currently contraindicated in patients with reduced renal function, that is, when the&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is &lt;15 ml / min (MRC stage 5-5D), because this population&#xD;
      specific was excluded from the originator studies. However, aGLP1 are small peptides that are&#xD;
      not eliminated by the kidneys. Their elimination takes place through the general catabolism&#xD;
      of proteins. To date, 2 publications have evaluated the safety profile and efficacy of an&#xD;
      aGLP1, liraglutide (Victoza®), in diabetic dialysis patients. These studies showed that the&#xD;
      24 hour plasma concentration of liraglutide increased by 50% over the long term. The safety&#xD;
      profile was acceptable with, as expected, a predominance of gastrointestinal effects in the&#xD;
      first weeks of treatment such as nausea, vomiting. The authors suggest an adjustment of the&#xD;
      dosages and a longer titration period to limit side effects. However, treatment with aGPL1 is&#xD;
      effective with better glycemic control and an average weight loss of 2.6 kg over a period of&#xD;
      3 months. Studies show that weight loss under liraglutide continues beyond 3 months with&#xD;
      possible losses between 4 and 8 kg at 6 months and 12 months of treatment followed 12.&#xD;
      Liraglutide (Victoza®) is the analogue of GPL1 for which we have a sufficiently long&#xD;
      follow-up (&gt; 10 years) on its effectiveness and its short and long-term side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project, in type 2 diabetic patients on dialysis, as a temporary&#xD;
      contraindication for transplant due to overweight, is on the one hand to study the effect of&#xD;
      liraglutide on weight loss and control of diabetes, and on the other hand to assess its&#xD;
      tolerance in this population. The expected benefit is to be able to facilitate registration&#xD;
      on the waiting list and access to renal transplantation of these overweight patients, without&#xD;
      having to resort to more invasive methods such as bariatric surgery.&#xD;
