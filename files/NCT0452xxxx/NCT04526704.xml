  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter study in previously pexidartinib-treated participants with TGCT will provide&#xD;
      the Investigators and participants the option at Screening to either continue pexidartinib&#xD;
      treatment (Treatment Continuation Cohort) or discontinue treatment with the possibility of&#xD;
      re-initiating pexidartinib treatment (Treatment-Free/Re-Treatment Cohort).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently enrolled and on pexidartinib treatment in one of the following studies:&#xD;
             Study PLX108-10 (ENLIVEN), Study PLX108-01, Study PL3397-A-A103 or Study&#xD;
             PL3397-A-U126.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to complete the PROMIS Physical Function Scale and EQ-5D-5L&#xD;
             throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to any study-related&#xD;
             procedures and to comply with all study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of reproductive potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at&#xD;
             Screening/Baseline (to be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test taken on the last&#xD;
             treatment visit of their prior study). They are advised to use an effective,&#xD;
             non-hormonal method of contraception during treatment with pexidartinib and for 1&#xD;
             month after the last dose. Males with female partners of reproductive potential should&#xD;
             be advised to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with&#xD;
             pexidartinib and for 1 month after the last dose. Female partners of male patients&#xD;
             should concurrently use effective contraceptive methods (hormonal or non-hormonal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: A female is considered of reproductive potential following menarche and until&#xD;
        becoming postmenopausal (no menstrual period for a minimum of 12 months) unless permanently&#xD;
        sterile (undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) with&#xD;
        a confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) test level &gt;40 mIU/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male participants must not freeze or donate sperm starting at Screening and throughout&#xD;
             the study period, and for at least 5 half-lives or 1 month after the final study drug&#xD;
             administration, whichever is longer. Female participants must not donate, or retrieve&#xD;
             for their own use, ova from the time of Screening and throughout the study treatment&#xD;
             period, and for at least 1 month or 5 half-lives after the final study drug&#xD;
             administration, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a clinically significant abnormality identified by the Investigator at&#xD;
             Screening on physical examination, laboratory tests, or electrocardiogram (ECG) which,&#xD;
             in the judgement of the Investigator, would preclude the participant's safe completion&#xD;
             of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to another investigational drug or current participation in other therapeutic&#xD;
             investigational procedures, besides pexidartinib studies, within 1 month prior to&#xD;
             start of study treatment. Any known contraindication to treatment with, including&#xD;
             hypersensitivity to, the study drug(s) or excipients in pexidartinib.&#xD;
