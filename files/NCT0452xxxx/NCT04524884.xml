      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of Toripalimab&#xD;
      and Surufatinib for Locally Advanced Thyroid Cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surufatinib (HMPL-012, previously named sulfatinib) is a small-molecule inhibitor targeting&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 and&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor. A multi-center , opened, Phase II study have identified&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of Surufatinib in advanced medullary thyroid Carcinoma ( MTC) and&#xD;
      iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC).Toripalimab is a humanized&#xD;
      immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory&#xD;
      human cell surface receptor programmed cell death 1 (programmed death-1; PD-1), with&#xD;
      potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. In the present study,&#xD;
      we design a single-arm, single center Phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      the combination of Surufatinib wiht Toripalimab in locally advanced differentiated thyroid&#xD;
      cancer as neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
