  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is being widely accepted as a treatment of choice for&#xD;
      patients with a small number of brain metastases and an acceptable size, allowing a better&#xD;
      target dose conformity resulting in high local control rates and better sparing of organs at&#xD;
      risk. Currently, imaging for such a delivery technique requires both a recent magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) brain study for volume definition and a computed tomography (CT) scan&#xD;
      for SRT planning. An MRI-only workflow could reduce the risk of misalignment between the two&#xD;
      imaging modalities and shorten the delay of planning. Given the absence of a calibrated&#xD;
      electronic density on MRI, the investigators aim to assess the equivalence of synthetic CTs&#xD;
      generated by a generative adversarial network (GAN) for planning in the brain SRT setting.&#xD;
