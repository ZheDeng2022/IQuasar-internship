  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-centre, open-label, single-arm, stratified, exploratory, Phase 2&#xD;
      study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-DOTATATE in combination with nivolumab in&#xD;
      adult patients with Grade 3 neuroendocrine tumours (NET) or neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will have unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic, histologically confirmed,&#xD;
      well-differentiated Grade 3 NET or poorly-differentiated NEC of the pancreas,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract lung and unknown primary site. Thirty patients will be included in&#xD;
      this trial, of which 15 will not have received prior chemotherapy (Cohort 1) and 15 will have&#xD;
      received at least one prior line of chemotherapy (Cohort 2). Patient will receive 240 mg flat&#xD;
      dose of nivolumab intravenously as a 30-minutes infusion and 7.4 GBq 177Lu-DOTATATE&#xD;
      intravenously as a 4-hours infusion. Nivolumab will be administered at Day 1 and Day 15 of a&#xD;
      28-days cycle, starting on Cycle 1 Day 1. Patients will receive the study drugs while it is&#xD;
      considered to be in their best interest, 177Lu-DOTATATE being administered at a maximum of 4&#xD;
      injection cycle. Treatment discontinuation criteria include, among others, progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or patient study withdrawal&#xD;
