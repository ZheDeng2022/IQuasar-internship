      This study is designed to test if the medical-education-community collaborated intervention&#xD;
      can reduce the symptoms of children with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)&#xD;
      compared to routine clinical care. Investigators will also evaluate if the intervention will&#xD;
      positively affect organizational skills and academic achievement compared to controls.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The medical treatment of participants will be given by a doctor who does not know the study group of the patient. The investigator of the primary outcome and secondary outcome will also be unaware of the grouping of the patient. One psychiatrist blind of grouping will ask parents about the ADHD symptom of their children and rate it with SNAP-IV score.</masking_description>

    <measure>total score change in SNAP-IV scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Questionnaire (SNAP-IV) Rating Scale is a revised version of the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham (SNAP) Questionnaire that utilizes the DSM-IV criteria for ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder, rated by caregiver or professionals. It comprises three subscales: Inattention, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder. The score of each item is rated with a 4-point Likert scale (0 = not at all, 3 = very much). We choose the total score ofInattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivityfor the evaluation of change in ADHD symptom in children. The score is calculated by adding all the items inthe two subscales. The change of score is calculated by score at 3 months enrollment minus score at baseline (enrollment).</description>

    <measure>total score change in Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function(BRIEF) Scale reflects the performance of children's deficits in executive function in daily life, which covers a number of organizational skills involved in organizational skills training. We choose the total score ofBRIEF for the evaluation of change in organizational skills in children. The score is calculated by the published recording chart. The change of score is calculated by score at 3 months enrollment minus score at baseline (enrollment).</description>
