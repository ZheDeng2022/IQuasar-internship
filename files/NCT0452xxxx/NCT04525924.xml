    <textblock>
      Fatigue is the most common symptom in palliative care patients who have advanced cancer.&#xD;
      Fatigue is also one of the most underreported hence under-treated symptoms. Patients may&#xD;
      perceive it as a condition to be endured, whereas healthcare workers find it very challenging&#xD;
      to assess and treat due to its subjective nature and multi-dimensional causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, evidence-based practice to tackle this distressing problem is still inadequate, and&#xD;
      that a one-size fit all approach is unrealistic. Various pharmacological options have been&#xD;
      examined, but due to limited evidence, no specific drug could be recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Latest development in management of fatigue includes non-pharmacological approach. Bright&#xD;
      Light Treatment (BLT) has also evolved as a favourable treatment for cancer-related fatigue.&#xD;
      BLT is the prescription of artificial bright light over a designated period of time. Recent&#xD;
      clinical evidence showed that BLT reduced symptom of fatigue in patients undergoing active&#xD;
      chemotherapy and cancer survivours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is however no data on bright light therapy used in in-patient palliative care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single group, prospective interventional study will be conducted in in-patient palliative&#xD;
      care unit of Shatin Hospital (N = 42). The aim is to assess the feasibility and impact of BLT&#xD;
      as an in-patient intervention in a cohort of local Chinese palliative care in-patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with incurable cancer with documented symptom of fatigue, and to ascertain the&#xD;
      changes of fatigue, mood, sleep and quality of life after 1-week exposure of BLT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is the most common symptom in palliative care patients who have advanced cancer,&#xD;
      ranging from 59% to 77% depends on the assessment method (1). There is limited local data on&#xD;
      the prevalence of fatigue in cancer patients. A cross-sectional study by Dr KY Lam in 2009&#xD;
      (unpublished data) found 53% of 55 patients receiving palliative care suffered from severe&#xD;
      fatigue. A cross-sectional symptom screening of all the patients in the palliative care ward&#xD;
      in Shatin Hospital showed 22 out of 55 (40%) patients reported fatigue (unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fatigue experienced by cancer patients is multi-dimensional. The feeling may be a&#xD;
      physical sensation (weakness, tiredness, exhaustion, unable to perform tasks), an affective&#xD;
      sensation (low mood, lack of motivation), or a cognitive sensation (lack of concentration,&#xD;
      difficulty thinking clearly). This phenomenon is also subject to cultural interpretation&#xD;
      therefore there is a need to understand each subject's perception and experience of fatigue&#xD;
      within his or her own cultural context (2, 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue is also one of the most under-reported hence under-treated symptoms. Patients may&#xD;
      perceive it as a condition to be endured, whereas healthcare workers find it very challenging&#xD;
      to assess and treat due to its subjective nature and multidimensional causes. The impairment&#xD;
      in self-care capabilities and daily functioning lead to negative effects on desire to&#xD;
      continue treatment thus affecting the functional recovery even in patients with a more stable&#xD;
      disease status (3-5). The quality of life (QOL) of patients, which is our focus in palliative&#xD;
      care service, is heavily reduced (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, evidence-based practice to tackle this distressing problem is still inadequate, and&#xD;
      that a one-size fit all approach is unrealistic (7). Various pharmacological options have&#xD;
      been examined, but due to limited evidence, no specific drug could be recommended for the&#xD;
      treatment of fatigue in palliative care patients in the latest Cochrane review in 2015 (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Latest development in management of fatigue includes non-pharmacological approach. Effect&#xD;
      size in reducing fatigue in various treatments were summarised in a report by Bower (9).&#xD;
      Exercise was more effective than control in reducing fatigue with a mean effect size of&#xD;
      -0.27. Psychosocial intervention trials that included fatigue as a primary or secondary&#xD;
      outcome have shown reductions in fatigue relative to control, with effective sizes ranging&#xD;
      from -0.10 to -0.31. Psychostimulant trials, most of which were conducted among patients with&#xD;
      advanced disease and used methylphenidate, suggested that psychostimulants were more&#xD;
      effective than placebo in improving fatigue with an effect size of -0.28. Of note, two&#xD;
      studies with larger sample size showed no benefit for methylphenidate vs. placebo for&#xD;
      improving fatigue (10, 11). The application of non-pharmacological approach in our local&#xD;
      patients was even more limited. A pilot study of 26 patients receiving palliative care in&#xD;
      Shatin Hospital showed a mean change score of 0.5 (1.862) of improvement in Brief Fatigue&#xD;
      Inventory (BFI) Q3 after two weeks of in-patient multidisciplinary care (unpublished data).&#xD;
      The estimated effect size of the pilot study was 0.268 (mean change/SD = 0.5/1.863). Overall,&#xD;
      these data suggest that non-pharmacological treatments (e.g. exercise, psychoeducation,&#xD;
      support program, cognitive-behavioural therapy) have a mild to moderate effect on improving&#xD;
      symptom of fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over these few decades, Bright Light Treatment (BLT) has also evolved as a favourable&#xD;
      treatment for cancer-related fatigue. BLT is the prescription of artificial bright light over&#xD;
      a designated period of time. It was initially developed for the treatment of seasonal&#xD;
      affective disorder, and found to be as effective as antidepressants for treatment of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms during winter (12). The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)&#xD;
      guidelines on cancer-related fatigue (13) and a recent review on all treatment options of&#xD;
      cancer-related fatigue (14) suggested that BLT is a safe and accessible option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several mechanisms on how light therapy works. Firstly, it works through improving&#xD;
      alertness. Healthy subjects who had increasing bright light exposure as compared to dim light&#xD;
      would have a rapid effect of decrease in sleepiness and improvement in their performance&#xD;
      (15). Secondly, BLT works through improving mood. Efficacy of BLT have been demonstrated in&#xD;
      seasonal affective disorder (12), non-seasonal depression (16) and bipolar depression (17).&#xD;
      Thirdly, BLT works through regulation of circadian rhythm. Circadian disruptions were&#xD;
      demonstrated in 55 community-dwelling cancer patients receiving palliative care (18).&#xD;
      Although the cause and effect between exacerbated fatigue and decreased light exposure could&#xD;
      not be confirmed, increased fatigue was significantly correlated with decreased light&#xD;
      exposure among patients with breast cancer (19). Exposure to bright light in the morning&#xD;
      leads to an advance of endogenous circadian rhythms that results in a realignment of these&#xD;
      rhythms with the individual's sleep-wake cycle. Therefore, possibly by providing a corrective&#xD;
      phase advance with morning BLT, rhythm dysregulation could be corrected resulting in a&#xD;
      reduction of fatigue symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two trials investigated the impact of light therapy on fatigue and QOL in the same group of&#xD;
      39 women with breast cancer undergoing active chemotherapy (20, 21). Results suggest that&#xD;
      morning bright light treatment helped prevent the typical worsening of fatigue and quality of&#xD;
      life during chemotherapy treatment. Although the light treatment did not improve overall&#xD;
      fatigue in this sample, the lack of deterioration in total fatigue during a period where&#xD;
      symptoms typically worsen was encouraging. Another study sought to determine the effect of&#xD;
      bright light treatment on cancer-related fatigue among 36 post-treatment survivors (22). At&#xD;
      the end of the treatment period, patients who had received bright white light therapy were no&#xD;
      longer clinically fatigued, whereas 55% of the patients in the active control condition&#xD;
      continued to report clinical fatigue. The effects of the bright white light treatment were&#xD;
      maintained 3-weeks post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more recent study again focused on cancer survivors (23, 24). The total fatigue score using&#xD;
      the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form showed an effect size of 1.20 in&#xD;
      the bright-white-light intervention group and an effect size of 0.93 in the supposing placebo&#xD;
      arm dim-red-light group. These were large within group effect size. This study employed BLT&#xD;
      as an adjunctive therapy and the participants were not excluded for using their usual&#xD;
      medications (including psychotropic medications). A randomised controlled trial in 2007&#xD;
      reported that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) do not appear to have beneficial&#xD;
      effects on cancer-related fatigue, supporting the distinction between fatigue and depression&#xD;
      in cancer patients and suggesting that fatigue is not solely a symptom of depression (25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bruera and team tried to introduce BLT to patients with advanced cancer and insomnia in&#xD;
      out-patient settings (26). One shortcoming of their study was partly due to a high attrition&#xD;
      rate especially in the control arm where dim red light was used as placebo. They suggested&#xD;
      future studies to incorporate alternative trial designs to improve the adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is however no data on bright light therapy used in in-patient palliative care settings.&#xD;
      Conducting research on patients receiving palliative care has been particularly challenging&#xD;
      (27, 28). Barriers include the difficulty in participation due to limitations of serious&#xD;
      illness, complex symptoms and clinical instability, resulting in high attrition and missing&#xD;
      data. The MOREcare Statement (29) suggested researchers to use measures which are as short&#xD;
      and simple as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these limitations, the present evidence suggests that BLT, a safe and easily&#xD;
      delivered treatment, may be a clinically feasible and effective intervention to reduce&#xD;
      symptom of fatigue in cancer palliative care patients during hospital stay. This study aims&#xD;
      to test the feasibility of administering bright light therapy in cancer palliative care&#xD;
      patients for the treatment of fatigue.&#xD;
