    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical and radiographic results after surgical&#xD;
      treatment with implant-free allograft in the treatment of Anterior Shoulder Dislocation and&#xD;
      to assess the safety of the surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be informed about the study and potential risks. All patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will undergo a screening visit to assess the eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the eligibility requirements will perform a pre-treatment visit in order to&#xD;
      assess their healthy state. Also, patients will undergo to the radiographic visit (RX and TX)&#xD;
      as request by clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be treated with arthrotomy mini-open technique with bone allograft at&#xD;
      the site of the shoulder lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery all the patients will be followed up to 24 months through clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic visits.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in DASH score at 24th months</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Score is a 30-item self-reported questionnaire in which the response options are presented as 5-point Likert scales. Scores range from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability). This score was designed be useful in patients with any musculoskeletal disorder of the upper limb.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Constant score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Constant score contains both physician-completed and patient-reported portions. The four domains include pain (15 possible points), activities of daily living (20 possible points), mobility (40 possible points), and strength (25 possible points). Scores range from 0 points (most disability) to 100 points (least disability).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Rowe score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Rowe score is a 3-item physician completed instrument. Its questions address the categories of shoulder stability, motion, and function. Scores range from 0 to 100 with a score of 90-100 points indicating an excellent evaluation, 75-89 points indicating a good evaluation, 51-74 points indicating a fair evaluation, and 0-50 points indicating a poor evaluation.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in EQ-5D-3L (EuroQoL) CurrentHealthAssessment:</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. The classification system defines health in five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each dimension with three levels (&quot;no problems&quot; [level 1], &quot;some problems&quot; [level 2], and &quot;extreme problems&quot; [level 3]), resulting in a total of 243 (3^5) health states. The 3L classification system defined the 243 health states by combining different levels from each dimension, with 11111 and 33333 representing full health and worst health, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the grade of the Shoulder Osteoarthritis through Kellgren-Lawrence scoring</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Kellgren and Lawrence system is a common method of classifying the severity of osteoarthritis (OA).&#xD;
The K-L system defines OA in 5 grades:&#xD;
grade 0 (none): definite absence of x-ray changes of osteoarthritis grade 1 (doubtful): doubtful joint space narrowing and possible osteophytic lipping grade 2 (minimal): definite osteophytes and possible joint space narrowing grade 3 (moderate): moderate multiple osteophytes, definite narrowing of joint space and some sclerosis and possible deformity of bone ends grade 4 (severe): large osteophytes, marked narrowing of joint space, severe sclerosis and definite deformity of bone ends.</description>
