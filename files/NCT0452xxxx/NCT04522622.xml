    <textblock>
      This study is a 1:1 randomized controlled trial with an intervention for 18 months and a&#xD;
      follow up period of 12 months. The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of recombinant human parathyroid hormone for treatment of adynamic bone disorder in patients&#xD;
      with chronic kidney disease.&#xD;

      This study is a 1:1 randomized controlled trial with an intervention for 18 months and a&#xD;
      follow up period of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will explore if treatment with recombinant human parathyroid hormone (PTH) improves&#xD;
      bone turnover and bone mineral density (BMD), and thereby prevents the high risk of fracture&#xD;
      in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disturbed bone metabolism is related to increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients&#xD;
      with CKD. This study also wishes to examine of treatment with recombinant PTH improves&#xD;
      cardiovascular parameters.&#xD;
