  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre real-world experience aimed at verifying the outcome of palbociclib&#xD;
      plus ET in an unselected population of MBC patients. The primary endpoint is the clinical&#xD;
      benefit rate (CBR); secondary aims are the median PFS (mPFS), overall survival (OS) and&#xD;
      safety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, longitudinal, prospective, multicentre cohort study. Eligible patients&#xD;
      are pre- and postmenopausal women with a histologically proven HR+ MBC, candidate to receive&#xD;
      palbociclib plus endocrine therapy (ET) as first or subsequent line of therapy according to&#xD;
      their contingent clinical situation. Additional inclusion criteria are HER2- disease&#xD;
      (immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0-1+ or IHC 2+, confirmed as fluorescence in situ hybridization&#xD;
      [FISH] negative), presence of measurable or evaluable lesions and life expectancy of at least&#xD;
      4 months. They need to have adequate bone marrow, hepatic and renal function, according to&#xD;
      clinical practice guidelines for antineoplastic drug administration. Previous chemotherapy or&#xD;
      ET for metastatic disease is allowed. Patients receive palbociclib 125 mg daily, 3 weeks on/1&#xD;
      week off in a 28-day cycle, combined with letrozole 2.5 mg administered orally on a&#xD;
      continuous daily dosing schedule (cohort A) or fulvestrant at the dose of 500 mg&#xD;
      intramuscular on days 1, 14, 28, then every 4 weeks thereafter (cohort B). Premenopausal&#xD;
      women receive a GnRH analogue in combination with ET and palbociclib. Treatment is&#xD;
      administered until documented disease progression (PD), unacceptable toxicity or patient&#xD;
      refusal. The tumour assessment is performed approximately every 16 weeks. Treatment efficacy&#xD;
      is evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.1). A complete&#xD;
      blood count and organ function test is performed before each cycle, through study completion,&#xD;
      an avarange of 1 year. No pre-specified treatment modifications are planned; dose reductions,&#xD;
      delay or discontinuations of palbociclib are performed according to observed side effects.&#xD;
      AEs are recorded and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) (version 5.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to analyse the activity of palbociclib plus ET in terms of&#xD;
      clinical benefit rate that is defined as the percentage of patients experiencing complete&#xD;
      response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) lasting 6 months or more.&#xD;
      Secondary aims include the evaluation of the safety of the treatments, progression-free&#xD;
      survival and overall survival.&#xD;
