  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Humeral epicondylopathies are common disorders which can significantly impair upper limb&#xD;
      function. In case of failure of rehabilitation protocol there is no evidence based second&#xD;
      line therapy. It is common practice to perform one of the injection procedures. The&#xD;
      biological mechanisms of these procedures are unclear, and may even be contrary. These&#xD;
      include, but are not limited to, injections of corticosteroids, autologous platelet rich&#xD;
      plasma (PRP) and hyaluronic acid (HA). Despite the frequent use there is much controversy&#xD;
      about their clinical effectiveness and more evidence based data are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare three different injection therapies for lateral and medial&#xD;
      epicondylopathy. In addition, correlation between selected bioactive compounds in PRP and its&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned as a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled&#xD;
      trial on 200 patients aged 30-50 who suffer for lateral or medial epicondylitis. After&#xD;
      meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria patients will receive an injection of&#xD;
      leukocyte-poor autologous PRP (N1), corticosteroid (N2), HA (N3) in the area of the common&#xD;
      extensors or flexor tendon attachment, respectively. Patients from control group (N4) will&#xD;
      get an injection of saline in the same area. All groups will be instructed how to perform&#xD;
      everyday stretching and strengthening exercises. Evaluation of clinical effectiveness of the&#xD;
      treatment will be based on objective measurements such as range of motion, limb girth, grip&#xD;
      strength, X-ray and ultrasound examination and subjective measurements such as pain (VAS),&#xD;
      functional (PRTEE, DASH, SEV, MEPS) and quality of life questionnaires (SF-36) before and&#xD;
      during follow-up period (1, 4, 12, 24, 52 weeks). PRP samples will undergo laboratory&#xD;
      analysis of levels of bioactive compounds including platelets, white blood cells,&#xD;
      erythrocytes and selected growth factors and inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After data collection, the clinical effectiveness of three different injection therapies will&#xD;
      be evaluated and statistically analyzed. Subjective and objective outcomes, safety,&#xD;
      costs-effectiveness of three different injection therapies compared to placebo and between&#xD;
      each other will be assessed. In addition, correlation between levels of bioactive compounds&#xD;
      in PRP and its efficacy will be checked.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial&#xD;
      with placebo. It is planned to enroll 200 patients with lateral or medial epicondylopathy and&#xD;
      divide them to four equal groups receiving an autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) (N1=50),&#xD;
      corticosteroid (N2=50) or hyaluronic acid (N3=50) injection in the area of lateral or medial&#xD;
      epicondyle, or to control group (N4=50) receiving an injection of saline in the same area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria and before therapeutic intervention&#xD;
      patients will undergo clinical and radiological examination and laboratory analysis of blood&#xD;
      samples - complete blood count, C reactive protein (CRP), selected cytokines. Elbow&#xD;
      anterior-posterior and lateral view X-ray and ultrasound examination will be performed to&#xD;
      find signs of enthesopathy, asses calcifications and to exclude other pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the clinical effectiveness of the treatment examination including range of motion,&#xD;
      limb girth measurements, grip and muscle strength measured by dedicated device (digital&#xD;
      dynamometer) and regional pain severity measured by professional digital algometer will be&#xD;
      performed. Patients will be asked to fulfil pain, functional and quality of live&#xD;
      questionnaires, including Visual Analog Scale for pain intensity evaluation (VAS),&#xD;
      Patient-rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand&#xD;
      (DASH), The Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), The Oxford Elbow Score, The Subjective Elbow&#xD;
      Value (SEV) and The Quality of life questionnaire SF-36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from the experimental group will receive an injection of autologous platelet-rich&#xD;
      plasma (PRP) without activator (2ml) in the area of attachment of the common extensor or&#xD;
      flexor tendon under supervision of ultrasound (N1=50), corticosteroid - 2ml of 7mg&#xD;
      Betamethasone (N2=50) or 2ml of 40mg hyaluronic acid with mannitol (N3=50). Patients from&#xD;
      control group will get an injection of saline (2ml 0,9% NaCl) in the same area (N=50). The&#xD;
      injection will be carried out with aseptic precautions, under regional anesthesia with&#xD;
      Lignocaine 2%. Saline injection as placebo intervention for control group was chosen because&#xD;
      of a similar impression for the patient comparing to other injections. Also there are some&#xD;
      previously reported positive outcomes of that kind of intervention alone. The procedure will&#xD;
      be performed in accordance with the principle of double-blinding. Every patient will get&#xD;
      identification number which will be randomly assigned to one from all groups, in equal&#xD;
      proportion. Both, patient and investigator will not know what kind of substance was used for&#xD;
      the treatment. Only person giving the injection will have access to patients identification&#xD;
      numbers list and will know the exact type of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part of the PRP sample (1ml) will undergo laboratory analysis of levels of bioactive&#xD;
      compounds. Assessment of levels and concentrations of platelets, white blood cells and&#xD;
      erythrocytes will be performed. The investigators will evaluate the content of selected&#xD;
      cytokines in PRP using flow cytometry for growth hormones: Platelet Derived Growth Factor-AA&#xD;
      (PDGF-AA), Platelet Derived Growth Factor-BB (PDGF-BB), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor&#xD;
      (VEGF), Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), Fibroblast Growth&#xD;
      Factor basic (FGF), Transforming Growth Factor Beta1 free active (TGFβ1) and inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines: Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Interferon-α2 (IFN-α2), Interferon-γ (IFN-γ), Tumor&#xD;
      Necrosis Factor -α (TNF-α), Monocyte Chemotactic Protein -1 (MCP-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6),&#xD;
      Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), Interleukin-12p70 (IL-12p70), Interleukin-17A&#xD;
      (IL-17A), Interleukin-18 (IL-18), Interleukin-23 (IL-23), Interleukin-33 (IL-33).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be reassessed 1, 4, 12, 24 and 52 weeks after intervention. All patients will&#xD;
      undergo ultrasound examination before treatment and during follow-up period. Every group will&#xD;
      be instructed how to perform everyday stretching and strengthening exercises during the whole&#xD;
      period of the study. All information about any complications will be collected and evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After data unblinding, statistical analysis will be performed. Subjective and objective&#xD;
      outcomes, safety, costs-effectiveness of three different injection therapies compared to&#xD;
      placebo and between each other will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no original studies comparing clinical effectiveness between corticosteroid,&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid, autologous platelet rich plasma and placebo in patients with elbow&#xD;
      tendinopathy. There are only few good quality studies on the clinical effectiveness of&#xD;
      lateral or medial epicondylopathy treatment with different injection therapies. Most of them&#xD;
      compare only one injection method to active comparator or placebo. Usually follow-up period&#xD;
      is less than 3 months. Frequent follow-up visits will help to reliably evaluate rate of&#xD;
      recurrence and to evaluate correlation between subjective and objective (e.g. USG) findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that results of this study will show significant positive clinical effect of&#xD;
      different injection treatments of patients with humeral epicondylopathy. The investigators&#xD;
      would like to find which one from injection treatments among corticosteroids, autologous&#xD;
      platelet rich plasma and hyaluronic acid will provide best outcomes, safety profile, short&#xD;
      and long-term efficacy, cost-effectiveness and the fastest return to work. The results of the&#xD;
      study will increase the knowledge about the treatment of lateral and medial&#xD;
      epicondylopathies, helping to create a reliable algorithm for supporting the decision-making&#xD;
      process in everyday clinical practice.&#xD;
