      The Universe and Sample of the Research The universe of the study consisted of women who&#xD;
      applied to cancer early diagnosis and screening center for examination for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation of the sample size of the study was determined according to the studies in&#xD;
      which non-pharmacological methods were used to cope with menopausal symptoms. The calculation&#xD;
      was determined according to the effect size of 0.5 in a moderate level, considering the&#xD;
      effect size ranging between (0.25-0.83) reported by the studies on the subject.&#xD;

    <description>The application was performed on the determined acupressure points by considering the direction of the meridian in a certain order. It was performed with the administration order of Spleen 6th point (SP 6) and Large Intestine 4th point (Li 4). In total, the administration was performed with 4 acupressure points including 2 points in the upper/lower extremity along with the parallel points in each intervention. Each acupressure point was massaged for 30 seconds to provide circulation before the pressure. After the massage, consecutive pressures were applied for 90 seconds. In each intervention, a total of 8-minute sessions were applied to 4 points as 2 minutes for each point. Consecutive pressures were applied on a frequency that did not disturb the women, did not cause pain, and had a soothing effect. Until the end of the intervention it was continued 2 times a week, 16 times in total in 8 weeks.</description>

    <description>Acupressure was administered in a semi-sitting or supine position where the woman felt comfortable and the researcher could perform the practice comfortably to the acupressure points. The application was performed on the determined acupressure points by considering the direction of the meridian in a certain order. It was performed with the administration order of Spleen 6th point (SP 6) and Large Intestine 4th point (Li 4). In total, the administration was performed with 4 acupressure points including 2 points in the upper/lower extremity along with the parallel points in each intervention.</description>
