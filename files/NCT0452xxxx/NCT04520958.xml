  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a single site, three-arm, parallel group randomized clinical trial that compared the&#xD;
      effect of three preoperative psychosocial interventions on knee and hip replacement patients'&#xD;
      preoperative pain intensity and postoperative pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, and opioid&#xD;
      use.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Preoperative Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed immediately before the preoperative intervention and immediately after the preoperative intervention (i.e., 20 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Single-item Numeric Rating Scale (0-10), with 0 indicating no pain and 10 representing the most intense pain imaginable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Postoperative Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed on the evenings of the 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th postoperative days.</time_frame>
    <description>Single-item Numeric Rating Scale (0-10), with 0 indicating no pain and 10 representing the most intense pain imaginable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Postoperative Pain Unpleasantness</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed on the evenings of the 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th postoperative days.</time_frame>
    <description>Single-item Numeric Rating Scale (0-10), with 0 indicating no pain and 10 representing the most unpleasant pain imaginable.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Postoperative Opioid Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed on the evenings of the 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th postoperative days.</time_frame>
    <description>Single-item, dichotomously scored (no vs. yes): &quot;Did you take opioid medications in the last 24 hours?&quot;</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-Transcendent State</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed immediately before the preoperative intervention and immediately after the preoperative intervention (i.e., 20 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-transcendent state was measured with the Nondual Awareness Dimensional Assessment (NADAs; Hanley, Nakamura, &amp; Garland, 2018). The NADAs is a 3-item, Likert type (0-10) self-report scale specifically designed to measure alterations in the experience of self occasioned by mindfulness practice.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Confidence</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed immediately after the preoperative intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' confidence (&quot;How confident are you that you could effectively use this pain management technique?&quot;) in using the pain management technique was assessed with a single item rated on a numeric rating scale (0-10), with 0 indicating no confidence and 10 representing complete confidence.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Intent</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed immediately after the preoperative intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' intent to use the technique (&quot;How likely are you to use this pain management technique?&quot;) to use the pain management technique was assessed with a single item rated on a numeric rating scale (0-10), with 0 indicating no intent and 10 representing absolute intent.</description>

    <description>Mindfulness of Pain consisted of instruction in how to (1) zoom in to deconstruct pain into its constituent physical sensations and precisely map each sensation's spatial location, (2) use mindful breathing to zoom out and broaden the field of attention to include previously neglected sensory elements (i.e., spaces within the body that were absent of sensation and pleasant sensations), and (3) shift attention from unpleasant sensations to neutral/pleasant sensations or experiences.</description>
