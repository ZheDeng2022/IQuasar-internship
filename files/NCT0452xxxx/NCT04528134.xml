  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthodontic treatment is common in teenagers, which typically involve the attachment of metal&#xD;
      brackets to the teeth. These brackets often impede proper oral hygiene, leading to plaque&#xD;
      accumulation and the development of white spots lesions (the early stage of cavity&#xD;
      development). Our study aims to investigate the efficacy of different commercially available&#xD;
      fluoride varnishes to treat these white spot lesions after the completion of orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment and evaluate their effect on the oral microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target enrollment is 120 subjects. The study will follow a split-mouth design, with each&#xD;
      subject receiving different treatment on the left and right sides of their mouth. The&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized into 3 groups, with each group receiving two of the following&#xD;
      three options: placebo varnish, traditional sodium fluoride varnish, and a resin-modified&#xD;
      glass ionomer light-cured fluoride varnish. There will be 4 total visits for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (day 0): Oral health assessed, plaque collected, intraoral photos taken, dental&#xD;
      cleaning performed, DiagnoDent measurements taken, varnishes applied T1 (day 30): Oral health&#xD;
      assessed, plaque collected, intraoral photos taken, DiagnoDent measurements taken, varnishes&#xD;
      reapplied T2 (day 90): Oral health assessed, plaque collected, intraoral photos taken,&#xD;
      DiagnoDent measurements taken, varnishes reapplied T3 (day 180): Oral health assessed, plaque&#xD;
      collected, intraoral photos taken, DiagnoDent measurements taken, dental cleaning performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to use regular fluoridated toothpaste and floss twice per day&#xD;
      for the duration of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Orthodontic patients ages 12-19 (target 120 subjects) nearing the end of treatment with&#xD;
           metal braces at the UCLA Orthodontic Clinic will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients will be consented by Dr. Joseph Mullen, or an eligible and trained orthodontic&#xD;
           resident.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants will be assigned into one of three groups via stratified permuted block&#xD;
           randomization. The groups will receive treatment as follows in a split-mouth study&#xD;
           design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 1 - extended contact varnish on upper left and lower right teeth, 5% fluoride&#xD;
           varnish on upper right and lower left teeth Group 2 - placebo varnish on upper left and&#xD;
           lower right teeth, extended contact varnish on upper right and lower left teeth Group 3&#xD;
           - 5% fluoride varnish on upper left and lower right teeth, placebo varnish on upper&#xD;
           right and lower left teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. On the day their braces are coming off, each subject will fill out an oral health&#xD;
           questionnaire and the investigators will use Trace Plaque Disclosing Liquid (a safe,&#xD;
           commercially available product) to visualize the plaque. Intraoral photos of only the&#xD;
           teeth surfaces will be taken. Dental plaque samples will be collected from buccal&#xD;
           surfaces of the teeth. The plaque will be collected with a sterile dental instrument and&#xD;
           carefully deposited into a sterile plastic collection tube containing a nutrient&#xD;
           solution for the bacteria. After collection, the samples will be taken to the laboratory&#xD;
           for further analysis and no subject identifiers will be used. Total DNA from each will&#xD;
           be extracted, and sequencing analysis will be performed in order to determine the&#xD;
           relative abundance of each species in the samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After the subject's braces are removed, a professional cleaning will be done of the&#xD;
           subjects teeth to remove all remaining plaque and calculus buildup on the teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After the cleaning, the subject will rinse with water and a second set of intraoral&#xD;
           photos will be taken. The teeth will then be air dried for 15 seconds, and a third set&#xD;
           of intraoral photos will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The extent of the demineralized white spot lesions will be quantitatively assessed using&#xD;
           the DiagnoDent, where a light is shined on the teeth and the fluorescence is measured to&#xD;
           assess the depth/severity of the demineralization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The study varnishes will be applied to the patient's teeth (according to the&#xD;
           manufacturer's instructions), consistent with their group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The patient will be given written post-op instructions, including oral hygiene&#xD;
           instructions to use OTC sodium fluoride toothpaste and a manual toothbrush. The subjects&#xD;
           will be asked to refrain from using adjunctive fluoride products (such as mouthwash) for&#xD;
           the duration of the study. Since all subjects will receive another professional cleaning&#xD;
           at their 6-month visit (consistent with the standard of care to receive professional&#xD;
           cleanings every 6 months), they will be asked to not receive additional dental cleanings&#xD;
           from outside providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Subjects will return to the clinic after 30, 90, and 180 days. At each appointment, they&#xD;
           will have their plaque disclosed with Trace Plaque Disclosing solution, have 3 sets of&#xD;
           intraoral photos taken (with plaque, with clean/moist teeth, and with clean/dry teeth),&#xD;
           have the white spot lesion severity measured with the DiagnoDent, and have the varnishes&#xD;
           reapplied to their teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. At the final visit (day 180), subjects will receive a professional dental cleaning after&#xD;
           the photos have been assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. After study completion, blinded investigators will use the intraoral photos to (1)&#xD;
           assess the extent of plaque using various plaque indices, and (2) assess the severity of&#xD;
           white spot lesions using various visual indices.&#xD;
