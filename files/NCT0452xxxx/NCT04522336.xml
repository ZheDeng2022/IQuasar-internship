  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial investigates how well pembrolizumab and chemoradiotherapy works in&#xD;
      treating patients with gastroesophageal cancer that cannot be removed by surgery&#xD;
      (unresectable). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and docetaxel work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy&#xD;
      photons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving pembrolizumab together with&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy may help to control gastroesophageal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the clinical activity (as assessed by complete clinical response rate) of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab plus chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab plus chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the overall survival efficacy of pembrolizumab plus chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate progression free survival (PFS) by local investigator review and by blinded&#xD;
      central radiologists' review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the association between PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry, somatic gene&#xD;
      expression profiling, and clinical efficacy of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the relationship between genomic variation and response to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify molecular (genomic, metabolic, and/or proteomic) biomarkers that may&#xD;
      correlate with clinical response/resistance, safety, pharmacodynamic activity, and/or the&#xD;
      mechanism of action of pembrolizumab in combination with chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the effect of pembrolizumab plus chemoradiation treatment on tumor T cell&#xD;
      infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1. Treatment with pembrolizumab repeats every 3 weeks for up to 3 cycles in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV over 2&#xD;
      hours on day 1 followed by fluorouracil IV over 48 hours once every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 8 weeks&#xD;
      (4 cycles) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION CHEMORADIATION: After a 3 week treatment free period, patients receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment with pembrolizumab repeats every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      also receive fluorouracil IV continuous over 5 days (Monday through Friday) for 5 weeks and&#xD;
      docetaxel IV over 1 hour once a week (QW) for 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity. Starting no later than 3 days after the beginning of the&#xD;
      Consolidation Chemoradiation period, patients also undergo 28 fractions of radiation therapy&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 6-9 week treatment free period, patients continue pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1. Treatment with pembrolizumab repeats every 3 weeks for up to 30 cycles in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 9-12&#xD;
      weeks thereafter.&#xD;
