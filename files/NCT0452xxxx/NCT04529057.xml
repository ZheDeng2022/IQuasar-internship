    <textblock>
      Rapid maxillary expansion (RME) is an orthodontic treatment based on the principle of opening&#xD;
      the midpalatal suture with the effect of orthopedic forces. The aim of this randomized&#xD;
      clinical study was to evaluate and compare the effects of tooth-borne, tooth-tissue borne,&#xD;
      and bone-borne rapid maxillary expanders on nasal airway by using AR. The null hypothesis was&#xD;
      that there is no difference for the effect on nasal airway between the appliances.&#xD;

      Introduction: The aim of this 3-arm parallel trial was to compare the effects of tooth-borne&#xD;
      (Hyrax), tooth tissue-borne (KBME) and bone-borne (MIDME) rapid maxillary expansion (RME)&#xD;
      appliances on nasal airway with acoustic rhinometry (AR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Fourty-six 12- to 14-years-old patients with narrow maxilla were randomly allocated&#xD;
      into 3 study groups according to the type of RME appliance: tooth-borne, tooth tissue-borne&#xD;
      and bone-borne. Participants were recruited from the Department of Orthodontics, Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Izmir Katip Celebi University, Turkey. During the RME treatment, the same protocol&#xD;
      was applied to all patients and the expansion screws were activated twice a day (0.4 mm/day).&#xD;
      Computer-generated randomization was used with group allocation concealed using opaque,&#xD;
      sealed envelopes. The outcome assessor was blinded; however, it was not feasible to blind&#xD;
      either operator or patients. The primary outcome of this study was the correction of&#xD;
      posterior crossbite. Secondary outcomes included AR assessment of nasal airway dimensions as&#xD;
      nasal volume, the minimal cross-sectional area (MCA) 1 and 2. AR measurements were obtained&#xD;
      before treatment (T0), after active expansion (T1), and at 3 months-follow-up (T2). One-way&#xD;
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a Bonferroni test was used for inter-group comparison and&#xD;
      two-way ANOVA was used for intra-group evalaution.&#xD;

    <description>The patients were treated with KBME, Hyrax and MIDME maxillary expansion appliances, respectively. All expansion appliances containing a Hyrax expansion screw positioned parallel to the second premolars and were used to correct the posterior crossbite. In the MIDME group, two mini-screws with a diameter of 1.6 mm and a length of 10 mm are located on the right and left sides between the roots of the 2nd premolar and 1st molar teeth with 60-70° angle. KBME and Hyrax expansion appliances were cemented with glass ionomer cement and MIDME was cemented with using the light-cured composite. Same protocol was applied to all patients during RME treatment. Expansion screws in all groups were activated by two turns a day.</description>
