  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beatboxing is a form of vocal percussion primarily involving the art of mimicking drum&#xD;
      machines, using one's mouth, lips, tongue, and voice. It may also involve vocal imitation of&#xD;
      turntablism, and other musical instruments. To produces the different sounds, the Beatboxers&#xD;
      use their vocal apparatus in a much wider and more complex way than its use in speech. This&#xD;
      allows them to acquire a panel of rich and varied sounds. The Human Beatbox (HBB) is a very&#xD;
      recent subject of study in phonetics. This study offers an exploratory study of&#xD;
      pharyngolaryngeal articulatory behaviors using nasofibroscopy and electroglottography and an&#xD;
      aerodynamic study in order to better understand the articulatory capacities and limits of the&#xD;
      vocal tract.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HBB is characterized by two very interesting aspects (1) the complexity of the&#xD;
      oro-pharyngo-laryngeal joints and the articulatory precision of the beatboxers and (2) the&#xD;
      respiratory management which allows the artists to beatbox continuously without interrupting&#xD;
      their performance. These two points, very characteristic of this technique, allow them to&#xD;
      best imitate diverse and varied musical tones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Human Beatbox is still little studied and the literature on this subject is quite&#xD;
      limited. Percussive sounds (for example imitations of bass drums, hi-hat or snare) seem to be&#xD;
      characterized by articulatory strategies, melodic sounds (for example wind instruments,&#xD;
      strings) seem to be based on both articulatory and phonatory strategies, and finally,&#xD;
      electronic sounds seem to mainly use complex phonatory strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objectives are to better understand the articulatory capacities and limits of the vocal&#xD;
      tract at different levels (articulation capacities, sound production mechanisms, muscular and&#xD;
      acoustic temporal relationships, strategies of efficiency...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible to find clinical applications of the Human Beatbox in the context of&#xD;
      congenital speech disorders (for example dyspraxia) or acquired (for example&#xD;
      oro-pharyngo-laryngeal surgery of the partial glossectomy type).&#xD;
