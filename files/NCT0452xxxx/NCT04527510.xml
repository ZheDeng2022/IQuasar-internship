      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Automated Breast Ultrasound (ABUS) with&#xD;
      remote reading mode is an effective breast cancer screening method and whether there is a&#xD;
      difference in the efficiency of screening with or without artificial intelligence (AI) in&#xD;
      Chinese women undergoing ABUS screening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer screening is an effective way to reduce breast cancer mortality. Because of&#xD;
      most women with dense breast and younger age at onset of breast cancer, ultrasound is more&#xD;
      sensitive and widely available in breast cancer screening of China. We designed experiments&#xD;
      to determine whether ABUS with remote reading mode is an effective breast cancer screening&#xD;
      method and whether there is a difference in the efficiency of screening with or without&#xD;
      artificial intelligence (AI) in Chinese women undergoing ABUS screening.&#xD;

    <description>Screening ABUS are independently reviewed by two readers, each of whom reports on any abnormalities and decides whether a participant is recalled for further assessment or returned home to routine screening. In the event there is disagreement between the readers' findings, a third reader acts as an arbitrator by rendering an interpretation of the ABUS and making the final decision to recall the participant or return to routine screening.&#xD;

    <description>ABUS are reviewed initially by a reader who reports on any abnormalities. The reader then re-examines the ABUS with the aid of AI, a system that uses computer prompts to recall suspicious features or abnormalities that may have been overlooked or previously dismissed as being normal. Based on these evaluations, a recommendation is made by the reader to either recall the participant for further assessment or return home to routine screening.&#xD;
