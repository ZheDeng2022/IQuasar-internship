  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dentine hypersensitivity (DH) is a condition that occurs in non-pathological, non-defective&#xD;
      teeth and is defined as &quot;a short, sharp pain in response to stimuli, typically thermal,&#xD;
      evaporative, tactile, osmotic or chemical and which cannot be attributed to any other dental&#xD;
      defect or pathology&quot;. The incidence of DH ranges from 4% to 74% in several studies.&#xD;
      Mandibular first molars, canines and premolars of both jaws are most commonly affected by DH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of DH is linked to exposure of dentinal tubules that can occur in the oral&#xD;
      cavity due to dental erosion from acidogenic diets, aggressive tooth-brushing, injudicious&#xD;
      use of whitening products, gingival recession, periodontal debridement or surgery. The most&#xD;
      commonly reported initiating factor is cold drinks. Management usually involves methods that&#xD;
      can achieve one or both of the following objectives; i) alteration of fluid flow in the&#xD;
      dentinal tubules and ii) modification or blocking of the pulpal nerve response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A broad range of products that achieve these objectives have been developed after rigorous&#xD;
      trials and can be used in-office or at home depending on the severity of the condition. These&#xD;
      products are commonly referred to as desensitizing agents. Grossman suggested that an ideal&#xD;
      desensitizing agent should be non-irritating to the pulp, relatively painless on application,&#xD;
      easy to apply, rapid in action, effective for long periods of time and should not stain the&#xD;
      teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of dentine desensitizers has become one of the most common methods in managing DH.&#xD;
      The most commonly used desensitizers contain components such as fluoride, triclosan,&#xD;
      benzalkonium chloride, ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid and glutaraldehyde. Fluoraphat Pro&#xD;
      (Neumunster, Germany) and VivaSens® (Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein, Switzerland)&#xD;
      are two agents that have been tested for use as dentine desensitizers and are currently&#xD;
      available for commercial use. In the present study, two such varnishes VivaSens (Ivoclar&#xD;
      Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland) and Fluoraphat (Promedical Neumunster,&#xD;
      Germany) have been used. The present study aims to establish which of the two desensitizing&#xD;
      agents has better efficacy in reducing hypersensitivity in patients who have been previously&#xD;
      diagnosed with DH.&#xD;

    <description>22 participants above the age of 18 years who presented to dental clinics in Riyadh Elm University with dentine hypersensitivity were randomly selected to participate in the study.&#xD;
Each participant has at least two teeth with natural hypersensitivity which was not caused by any iatrogenic causes or bad oral habits, so there are 44 cases divided into two groups according to the material used, each group has 22 teeth, that make it applicable to apply the studied material with every patient on individual tooth with the same variables of the oral mouth. When teeth in the hypersensitivity group were evaluated for the level of DH, all teeth were found to have Grade 4 sensitivity.</description>
