  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of arginine/lysine solution administration&#xD;
      on serum potassium levels. A systematic assessment of serum potassium levels will be&#xD;
      performed during infusion and up to 24 hours post start of infusion compared to baseline.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study schedule for each patient consists of a screening period followed by an infusion&#xD;
      day with an optional overnight in-clinic stay, and a follow up call 48h post infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening, patient eligibility will be determined according to inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, with evaluation of patient's vital signs, ECG and laboratory parameters. The&#xD;
      duration of screening can be as short as one day but should not exceed 7 days. Patients who&#xD;
      show potassium level &gt; 6 mmol/L at screening should have their potassium level corrected and&#xD;
      can be re-screened afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be admitted to the in-clinic unit to be dosed with arginine/lysine&#xD;
      solution for infusion of 1,000 mL, which is administered intravenously over a period of 4&#xD;
      hours. Before the infusion (at 0 h time point), a set of baseline tests will be performed.&#xD;
      During and after the infusion, patient condition will be monitored for evaluation of any&#xD;
      adverse events. Only patients with a potassium level of ≤ 6 mmol/L at screening will be&#xD;
      allowed to be dosed. Potassium testing on the infusion day will be performed at 0h (before&#xD;
      the infusion), and at 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, and 24h after the start of infusion. Vital signs&#xD;
      and ECGs will be taken as specified in the assessment schedule. All patients will be&#xD;
      monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hyperkalemia, e.g. dyspnoea, weakness, numbness,&#xD;
      chest pain and cardiac manifestations (conduction abnormalities and cardiac arrhythmias).&#xD;
      Other common adverse reactions during arginine/lysine solution administration are nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting. Before the start of arginine/lysine solution infusion, an intravenous bolus of an&#xD;
      anti-emetic should be given. The choice of anti-emetic drugs is at the discretion of the&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be called for a safety follow-up in 48 hours after dosing. Patients should&#xD;
      not be scheduled to receive repeat dosing with arginine/lysine solution as concomitant&#xD;
      medication with Lutathera® within 7 days of the arginine/lysine solution infusion in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
