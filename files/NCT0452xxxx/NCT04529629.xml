  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The adrenal gland is an important organ that produces life hormones. There are many types of&#xD;
      adrenal tumors, which tend to occur in young adults and affect the whole body. It has the&#xD;
      dual threat: hormone secretion and tumor metastasis. At present, there are four major&#xD;
      dilemmas in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of adrenal tumors: 1) Pulse secretion of the&#xD;
      hormones, which are affected by many factors; and the diagnostic value of single hormone is&#xD;
      limited; 2) Traditional imaging cannot accurately reflect the characteristics of hormone&#xD;
      secretion. The prognosis cannot be accurately predicted; 3) The molecular characteristics of&#xD;
      tumor cells and the microenvironment are unclear, making it difficult to implement early&#xD;
      diagnosis and precise treatment; 4) Traditional pathology cannot determine the nature and&#xD;
      long-term prognosis of the tumor, which makes the treatment delay, and the disease prognosis&#xD;
      is extremely poor. It threatens the lives of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting from solving the above-mentioned key problems in the early stage, the research team&#xD;
      has systematically established new clinical diagnostic technologies, hormone dynamic tests to&#xD;
      accurately assess hormone secretion and segmented blood collection hormone determination&#xD;
      technologies to accurately locate adrenal tumors; A series of important research results have&#xD;
      been published in Science, Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology, Cell Research, etc To sum up, the&#xD;
      goal of this research is improving the early diagnosis rate of complicated adrenal tumors&#xD;
      especially in malignant tumors, developing the optimal treatment plan, avoiding unnecessary&#xD;
      surgical treatment, improving the quality of life of patients, reducing mortality. This&#xD;
      project will further integrate the adrenal cortex and medulla hormone mass spectrometry&#xD;
      detection and the molecular markers of adrenal tumors through phenotypic, functional imaging,&#xD;
      and molecular pathological evaluations, and built a sensitive drug screening platform that&#xD;
      integrates visual drug response and molecular characteristics, thereby achieving precise&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of complicated adrenal tumors.&#xD;

Partial Response: The total diameter of the target lesions is reduced by at least 30% compared with the baseline.&#xD;
Progressive Disease: Take the minimum value of the sum of the diameters of all target lesions measured during the study as the reference, and the relative increase in diameter sum by at least 20% ④Stable Disease: Based on the minimum value of the sum of the diameters of all target lesions measured during the study, the reduction of the target lesion did not reach PR, and the degree of increase did not reach PD, between PR and PD.</description>
