  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been a steep rise in the prevalence of obesity among children and adults in the&#xD;
      United States. The Weigh Smart program, a family based weight management program was&#xD;
      developed in 2005 with significant improvement in the severity of obesity among children in&#xD;
      the Baltimore are participating in the group program with limited impact outside the region&#xD;
      due to transportation. Trial of the group program (nutrition, exercise) delivered via&#xD;
      telehealth through fruit street on the Eastern Shore and Western Maryland with use of&#xD;
      noninvasive lifestyle tracking options (drink water aquarium app for water consumption and&#xD;
      fitbit- steps, sleep monitoring) provides novel options for expansion of family- based&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention to underserved areas. Investigators plan as a pilot study to assess&#xD;
      the sensitivity of noninvasive measures for the detection of sleep apnea (pediatric sleep&#xD;
      questionnaire (PSQ) and fitbit re: sleep data) in comparison to clinically indicated&#xD;
      polysomnography among children with clinical suspicion for sleep apnea.&#xD;

      . Trial of the group program (nutrition, exercise) delivered via telehealth through fruit&#xD;
      street to families of overweight and obese children between 7-17 years of age referred from&#xD;
      selected pediatric practices on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Western Maryland with use&#xD;
      of noninvasive lifestyle tracking options (drink water aquarium app for water consumption and&#xD;
      fitbit charge 3- steps, sleep monitoring) provides novel options for expansion of family-&#xD;
      based lifestyle intervention to underserved areas. Investigators plan as a pilot study to&#xD;
      assess the sensitivity of noninvasive measures for the detection of sleep apnea (pediatric&#xD;
      sleep questionnaire (PSQ) and fitbit charge 3 sleep data) in comparison to clinically&#xD;
      indicated polysomnography among children with clinical suspicion for sleep apnea.&#xD;

    <description>This will assess the comparison of score at baseline to 3-6 months post-intervention. The PSQ contains 22 symptom items that ask about snoring frequency, loud snoring, observed apneas, difficulty breathing during sleep, daytime sleepiness, inattentive or hyperactive behavior, and other pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea features. It is a binary scale of 2 responses, YES=1 OR NO=0, therefore a maximum of 22 points and minimum of zero.</description>
