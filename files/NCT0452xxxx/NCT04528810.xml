  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comprehensive pediatric injury burden assessment is an essential foundation for formulating&#xD;
      injury prevention strategies and improving emergency care for injured children. Although the&#xD;
      hospital-based passive surveillance of national injury surveillance system of medical and&#xD;
      health institutions has been well-established in China, the monitoring points of hospitals&#xD;
      were not stratified according to children's hospital. Aim of the project is to collect&#xD;
      epidemiological and clinical data to describe causes, clinical features and outcomes of&#xD;
      pediatric injuries at a Children's Hospital in Shanghai, China. The project intends to&#xD;
      establish a method for collecting and analyzing high quality data of child injury using data&#xD;
      mining based on the hospital information system.&#xD;

      Injuries are a leading cause of death for infants and children around the world. According to&#xD;
      the Haddon Injury Control Model, 90 percent of injuries are both predictable and preventable.&#xD;
      Injuries are preventable, not &quot;accidents&quot;. All unintentionally and intentionally injured&#xD;
      children first visit to the emergency department are recruited in the study. Children's&#xD;
      Hospital of Fudan University with a Regional Pediatric Trauma Centre is also the first&#xD;
      Pediatric Injury Prevention Center established in China. We conduct a prospective cohort&#xD;
      study to investigate the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of the injured child&#xD;
      first visit to the emergency department, which expected to serve as evidence of injury&#xD;
      prevention and promising practices. In the study, we collect and analyze high quality data of&#xD;
      child injury based on data mining.&#xD;
