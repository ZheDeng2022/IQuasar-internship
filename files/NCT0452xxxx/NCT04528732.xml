  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to reduce HIV/AIDS-associated stigma and its negative impact on adolescent&#xD;
      health and psychosocial well-being. This study will examine two evidence-informed&#xD;
      interventions: 1) group cognitive behavior therapy (G-CBT) that aims at cognitive&#xD;
      restructuring and strengthening coping skills at the individual level, and 2) multiple family&#xD;
      group (MFG) that strengthens family relationships intended to address HIV/AIDS-associated&#xD;
      stigma at the individual level and within families. Adolescents between 10-14 years, will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned -at the clinic level, to one of three study arms: 1) Usual care to receive&#xD;
      the currently implemented usual care addressing HIV/AIDS-associated stigma (educational&#xD;
      materials from the Ugandan Ministry of Health); 2) G-CBT intervention + Usual care; and 3)&#xD;
      MFG intervention + Usual care. The interventions will be delivered over a 3-month period.&#xD;
      Assessments will be collected at baseline, 3 months and 6 months post intervention&#xD;
      initiation. The study will also explore participants, caregivers and facilitators'&#xD;
      intervention experiences, as well as multi-level facilitators and barriers to intervention&#xD;
      implementation and participation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is heavily burdened by HIV, with 85% of new infections among&#xD;
      adolescents and youth globally happening in the region. Recent statistics indicate that HIV&#xD;
      prevalence among adolescents and young people is rising in Uganda. While availability and&#xD;
      access to free antiretroviral therapy (ART) has decreased child mortality, it has increased&#xD;
      the likelihood that a number of children living with HIV (CLWH) will transition into&#xD;
      adulthood, with HIV as a chronic, highly stigmatized illness. Unfortunately, the stigma this&#xD;
      group experiences results in much lower quality of life. Stigma, a common experience&#xD;
      characterized by public blame, moral condemnation and discrimination, has been documented to&#xD;
      be one of the greatest challenges to slowing the spread of HIV&amp;AIDS. It perpetuates the&#xD;
      culture of silence and fear and prevents individuals from testing and seeking health care.&#xD;
      Research has shown that HIV/AIDS-associated stigma predicts depression and PTSD, poor&#xD;
      treatment and adherence, loneliness and social isolation, HIV-related physical health, and&#xD;
      HIV sexual risk behavior. It is critical for HIV interventions to target stigma in order to&#xD;
      reduce HIV spread. Yet, stigma-reduction interventions targeting children and adolescents&#xD;
      living with HIV/AIDS in SSA are almost non-existent. Thus, there is a need for research that&#xD;
      will generate knowledge to address HIV/AIDS-associated stigma, especially among CLWH as they&#xD;
      transition to adolescence. The proposed exploratory study (R21) will: Aim 1: Pilot test the&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of an innovative Group Cognitive Behavior&#xD;
      Therapy (G-CBT) and Multiple Family Group (MFG) interventions on reducing HIV/AIDS-associated&#xD;
      stigma and its impact on targeted participant outcomes (stigma, post-trauma symptoms,&#xD;
      depression, sexual risk behavior, family/social support, and adherence to medication) in&#xD;
      comparison to: 1a) usual care vs G-CBT; 1b) Usual care vs MFG; 1c) G-CBT vs. MFG. Aim 2:&#xD;
      Qualitatively examine participants' and facilitators' intervention experiences and identify&#xD;
      individual, family and institutional-level facilitators and barriers to G-CBT and MFG&#xD;
      intervention implementation and participation. The study will be conducted in 9 health&#xD;
      clinics (n = 90 children, ages 10-14) and their caregivers (total 90 child- caregiver dyads)&#xD;
      in Masaka. Clinics will be randomized to one of three study arms (n=3 clinics; 30&#xD;
      child-caregiver dyads each arm): 1) Usual care to receive the currently implemented usual&#xD;
      care addressing HIV/AIDS-associated stigma (educational materials developed by the Ugandan&#xD;
      Ministry of Health); 2) G-CBT intervention + usual care; and 3) MFG intervention + usual&#xD;
      care. Participants will be followed over a 6-month period, with data collected at baseline, 3&#xD;
      months and 6 months post intervention initiation to assess feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary impact. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop culturally&#xD;
      appropriate, feasible, acceptable and effective interventions that address&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS-associated stigma and its impact on CLWH's wellbeing and their families in SSA.&#xD;
