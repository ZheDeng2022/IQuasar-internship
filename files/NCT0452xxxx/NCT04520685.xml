  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study but all study participants will receive the&#xD;
      active study medication at some point during the study for at least 12 weeks, and some&#xD;
      children with receive CBD for the entire study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a relatively common neurodevelopmental disorder manifest by&#xD;
      social communication deficits and restricted and repetitive interests. Individuals with ASD&#xD;
      often have behavioral issues and psychiatric comorbidities which can be very hard to manage.&#xD;
      Currently, there are only two FDA approved medications (aripiprazole and risperidone) for the&#xD;
      treatment of irritability in ASD. Both medications have the potential for side effects and&#xD;
      are not tolerated in all children with ASD. Anecdotal and some preliminary studies suggest&#xD;
      that cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid in the marijuana plant, may lead to&#xD;
      improvements in symptoms of ASD including irritability, aggressive behaviors, and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will test whether CBD leads to differences in behaviors&#xD;
      commonly associated with ASD. The main behavioral problems investigators will study are&#xD;
      irritability and aggressive behavior. This study will also measure changes in other behaviors&#xD;
      seen in ASD such as anxiety, social interaction difficulties, repetitive behaviors,&#xD;
      attentional problems, hyperactivity, repetitive behaviors, and quality of life. Study&#xD;
      investigators will also test whether there are any important side effects of CBD in children&#xD;
      and adolescents with ASD.&#xD;

Each item on the parent form is scored 1-3 (1 = Never; 2 = Sometimes; 3 = Often), yielding a raw score of the global scale range from 63 to 189. T scores (M = 50, SD = 10) are used to interpret the level of executive functioning. T-score range is 0-100, and higher scores are indicative of more severe deficiency - 65 or higher is considered to be in the &quot;clinically significant&quot; range.</description>
