      Clinical exploring study of Weiyang Yuping Decoction in preventing acute attacks of mild to&#xD;

      Based on the preliminary clinical and basic research, this project intends to highly optimize&#xD;
      and integrate the TCM treatment of disease theory with the current methods to form two&#xD;
      preventive treatment plans, one treatment group was given Weiyang Yupingfang Granules orally&#xD;
      for 1 month on the &quot;Sanfu&quot;days and on the &quot;Sanjiu&quot; days each year for a total of 2 months one&#xD;
      year; the other treatment group was given Weiyang Yupingfang Granules orally for 1 month in&#xD;
      the first month of each quarter in the four quarters of the year, for a total of 4 months one&#xD;
      year.; Comparing the effect of prevention and treatment of mild to moderate intermittent&#xD;
      asthma exacerbations of the two prevention methods , provides new ideas for the prevention&#xD;
      and treatment of bronchial asthma in the future, and further improves bronchial The level of&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of asthma.&#xD;
