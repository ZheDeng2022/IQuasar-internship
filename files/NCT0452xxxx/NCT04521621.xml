  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy in&#xD;
      participants with advanced/metastatic or recurrent malignancies who receive V937 in&#xD;
      Combination with Pembrolizumab (MK-3475). The primary objective for Part 1 is to evaluate the&#xD;
      objective response rate, and the primary objective for Part 2 is to determine the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of V937 administered in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;

The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. For this study, RECIST 1.1 has been modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, and to specify that intratumoral injection does not render a lesion non-evaluable.
