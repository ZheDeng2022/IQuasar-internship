      Malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea causes a lot of illness in children in Tanzania and the&#xD;
      study want to find better ways of protecting people against these diseases and want to find&#xD;
      out if the type of house design can affect the general health of children living in the&#xD;
      house.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that healthy houses will reduce the incidence of malaria, respiratory&#xD;
      diseases and diarrhoeal diseases in children compared with traditional houses. And healthy&#xD;
      houses are also likely to reduce the incidence of all-cause morbidity incidence, disease&#xD;
      severity, improve growth and well-being. The primary endpoints will be assessed in children&#xD;
      under 13 years of age through weekly household visits for three years. All homes will have&#xD;
      access to basic vector control, such as insecticide treated nets (ITNs). Access to early&#xD;
      diagnosis and appropriate malaria treatment will be assured. Approximately 2,750 Tanzanians&#xD;
      living in 550 houses in Mtwara region, of which 110 are new design houses (Star Homes) and&#xD;
      the remaining 440 traditional African houses will be participating in this study. 330&#xD;
      children living in the novel design houses and 1320 children in traditional homes will be&#xD;
      followed for three years for the assessment of malaria, respiratory tract infections and&#xD;
      diarrhoea. Mosquito density will be assessed from all 550 houses where tent/light trap will&#xD;
      be used for mosquito catch at night in all study houses. Acceptance of the novel designed&#xD;
      houses will be assessed using mixed methods. Acceptability surveys will be conducted with 550&#xD;
      household heads concurrently with in-depth interviews with 30 purposively selected heads of&#xD;
      the households in the intervention arm. Ten focus group discussions will be conducted each&#xD;
      comprising 10 heads of households making it to be 100 heads of households.&#xD;
