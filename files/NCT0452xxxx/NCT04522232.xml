  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial was done on 127 women planned for TLH, and divided into two&#xD;
      groups; group A includes women that underwent conventional TLH, and group B includes women&#xD;
      that underwent TLH with prior uterine artery ligation at its origin. Both grouped were&#xD;
      compared regarding the blood loss, operation time, intraoperative complications and&#xD;
      post-operative follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>the ascending branch of the uterine artery was identified close to the isthmus then ligated at this level, close to the uterus or coagulated, using bipolar diathermy. The utero-vesical fold was dissected and the bladder was pushed down done, thus moving the ureters laterally, which decreases the risk of including them in a suture. The vasculature of the uterus is now secured and this is evidenced by the pale color of the fundus.&#xD;
Using either bipolar diathermy or the harmonic ultracision, the cornual pedicles on one side were desiccated and cut. Also, both the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments were desiccated and cut. So that, the opposite side pedicles can be taken care of, the direction of manipulator was changed. The infundibulopelvic ligaments were desiccated and cut if it is necessary to remove both ovaries. A vaginal cuff was inserted into the vagina to identify the vault, which was then cut laparoscopically using a monopolar hook, where the specimen was completely detached.</description>

    <intervention_name>Total laparoscopic hysterectomy with prior uterine artery ligation at its origin</intervention_name>
    <description>the uterine artery was dissected using the lateral approach; where dissection begins from the anterior leaf of the broad ligament. The triangle enclosed by the round ligament, external iliac artery, and infundibulopelvic ligament was opened. The areolar space was dissected and the origin of the uterine artery from the internal iliac and the ureter was identified. The uterine artery was then isolated from the surrounding structures and ligated by Hem-o-lok clips.&#xD;
