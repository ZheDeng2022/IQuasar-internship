  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common type of malignant tumor and the third leading cause&#xD;
      of cancer-associated mortality among men worldwide. The biological behaviors of PCa at&#xD;
      different degrees of malignancy also largely differ, directly impacting disease outcomes and&#xD;
      responses to treatment. Therefore, accurate risk stratification of PCa before treatment and&#xD;
      the development of an individualized treatment regimen, play a vital role to improve the&#xD;
      clinical outcome of patients. However, overdiagnosis and unnecessary biopsies, which are&#xD;
      invasive examinations associated with higher costs and adverse effects, such as infection and&#xD;
      bleeding. The American Urological Association (AUA) and the European Association of Urology&#xD;
      (EAU) adopted that when the PSA is less than 20ng/mL, less than 1% of PCa patients have a&#xD;
      positive bone scan, and routine bone scans are not recommended for asymptomatic or low-risk&#xD;
      PCa patients. Interestingly, due to the variations among evaluators that often occur when&#xD;
      defining the T stage, biopsies operate inaccuracy, also low-PSA level can also occur&#xD;
      metastasis, there is a need for an objective and accurate imaging biomarker for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of different grade PCa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II transmembrane protein, which has&#xD;
      higher expression in cancerous prostate cells than in normal prostate cells. Meanwhile, its&#xD;
      expression level is positively correlated with the degree of malignancy, the tendency of&#xD;
      metastasis, and the risk of early recurrence. In recent years, 18F-PSMA positron emission&#xD;
      tomography/computerized tomography (PSMA PET/CT) has earned widespread attention as a novel&#xD;
      imaging modality based on molecular-level analysis, rather than morphological or&#xD;
      physiological analysis, to assist in PCa diagnosis and tumor burden evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, Maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax) is the most commonly used&#xD;
      semi-quantitative parameter in PET/CT, which is used to assess tumor burden of PCa, and thus&#xD;
      can be used as an imaging biomarker to assess the degree of malignancy of prostate cancers.&#xD;
      However, prior studies mainly focused on the correlation between patients' biochemical&#xD;
      recurrence lesions and the PSA levels and Gleason score. There is a lack of research to&#xD;
      explore the correlation among primary PCa burden, PSA levels, and the degree of prostate&#xD;
      cancer malignancy. The aim of this project is to use 18F-PSMA PET/CT indexes SUVmax to&#xD;
      analyze the correlation among primary PCa imaging, GS, and PSA levels, and to evaluate the&#xD;
      predictive value of this method for prostate cancer risk stratification, metastasis risk, and&#xD;
      biochemical recurrence.&#xD;

    <description>Prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, is a protein produced by normal, as well as malignant, cells of the prostate gland. The PSA test measures the level of PSA in a man's blood. For this test, a blood sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis. The results are usually reported as nanograms of PSA per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood.</description>

    <description>Genetic factors and age:&#xD;
Epidemiological studies have shown that if an immediate family member (brother or father) suffers from prostate cancer, the risk of prostate cancer will be more than doubled. Age is a relatively strong risk factor for PCa.&#xD;
Prostatitis: Prostatitis is related to PCa. Cancer is usually found in the tissues where inflammation is found.&#xD;
Obesity: Research has found that obese patients have a low grade of PCa, but their risk of developing aggressive cancer is higher.&#xD;
Infection:&#xD;
Exercise: Most studies have found that exercise does not reduce the risk of prostate cancer, but some studies have shown that.&#xD;
Daily diet: The corrective mechanism of diet in PCa is not very clear.&#xD;
