  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children, however, underdiagnosis of childhood&#xD;
      asthma is an important issue in asthma management. The lack of reliable and objective&#xD;
      diagnostic indicators requires the development of rapid and accurate strategies for the early&#xD;
      diagnosis of childhood asthma. Recent studies have found a correlation between long-chain&#xD;
      non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression and childhood asthma, suggesting that lncRNA may be a&#xD;
      potential biomarker for asthma diagnosis.&#xD;

      The investigators envision exploring the early diagnosis of asthma by combining lncRNA with&#xD;
      electronic medical records. In this project, the investigators will combine high-throughput&#xD;
      sequencing, asthma case database, electronic medical record and informatics to investigate&#xD;
      the feasibility of combining lncRNA with electronic medical record for asthma diagnostic&#xD;
      model. The expected results will establish the foundation for the diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      childhood asthma and open up new ideas.&#xD;
