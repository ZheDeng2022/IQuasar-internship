  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In health, blood pressure (BP) falls at night by &gt;10% compared with day-time values. This&#xD;
      natural dipping pattern is important as without it there is an increased risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent evidence suggests that chronotherapy (taking&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive medication at bedtime instead of in the morning) may enhance nocturnal BP&#xD;
      dipping and reduce the risk of CVD events. There is therefore an urgent need to characterise&#xD;
      diurnal BP patterns in patients who may be at risk of reduced nocturnal dipping in order to&#xD;
      maximise protective therapy in all those who would benefit. Similarly, it has previously been&#xD;
      demonstrated that increased arterial stiffness is associated with increased CVD risk, however&#xD;
      little is known about whether loss of diurnal variations in arterial stiffness confer&#xD;
      addition risk. Kidney disease is independently associated with increased CVD events, but the&#xD;
      exact makeup of this risk is not clear. Within this heterogenous cohort several very distinct&#xD;
      groups exist including those with acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD),&#xD;
      inflammatory conditions like small vessel vasculitis (SVV), and those who have either donated&#xD;
      or received a kidney transplant. Diurnal BP and arterial stiffness patterns within these&#xD;
      patient groups are not well characterised. The investigators will recruit patients at&#xD;
      increased risk of CVD from the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh Renal and Vasculitis Clinics.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo 24-hour ambulatory BP and arterial stiffness measurement in&#xD;
      conjunction with day- and night-time blood and urine sampling on two separate occasions. This&#xD;
      study aims to characterise diurnal patterns of BP and arterial stiffness in patients at&#xD;
      increased risk of CVD and compare findings with healthy controls. In doing so, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to allow more targeted CVD risk reduction strategies and improve long-term&#xD;
      patient outcomes.&#xD;
