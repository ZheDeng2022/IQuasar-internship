  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that multimodal pain regimen&#xD;
      (consisting of acetaminophen, celecoxib, gabapentin, and oxycodone) administered&#xD;
      pre-operatively before elective spine surgery significantly decreases acute pain&#xD;
      post-operatively as well as decreasing requirements of post-op opioids for pain control in&#xD;
      PACU as compared to patients undergoing elective spine surgery without a pre-operative pain&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;

    <description>The study subjects will be assigned to the defined pre-op MMA regimen with standard postop oxycodone based pain control regimen given on an as needed basis. The treatment group outcomes will be compared to patients outside of the study including a historical control group (receiving only post-op pain regimen) prior to the implementation of the new regimen. The studied treatment group will receive within 3 hours before surgery an oral MMA regimen consisting of:&#xD;
Acetaminophen 975 mg Celecoxib 200 mg Gabapentin 300 mg Oxycodone 10 mg Extended Release</description>
