    <textblock>
      Airway microbiota pattern may related the preschool asthma exacerbation. This is a&#xD;
      single-center, randomized-controlled trial, the study will compare the management of&#xD;
      preschool wheeze determined by airway microbiota phenotype and blood eosinophils level to the&#xD;
      management using current clinical guidelines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants will be children aged 1-5 years who have recurrent wheezing and&#xD;
      will be allocated to one of two treatment groups, either current clinical care or airway&#xD;
      microbiota and blood eosinophils phenotype based management for 3 months.They will be&#xD;
      followed up for one year after the intervention. The primary outcome is the frequency of&#xD;
      unscheduled healthcare visit for wheezing, the secondary outcome parameters are events of&#xD;
      severe wheezing requiring oral or intravenous steroids, events of emergency department visit&#xD;
      and hospital admissions, the changes of Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids&#xD;
      (TRACK) score and Paediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ) score.&#xD;
