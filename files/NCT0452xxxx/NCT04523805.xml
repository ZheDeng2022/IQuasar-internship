    <textblock>
      The project is aligned with one of the overall: To promote social inclusion and equal&#xD;
      opportunities, encouraging participation in sport and physical activity. With this goal in&#xD;
      mind, the following specific objectives for this project were established:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop an adapted judo programme for children with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To demonstrate the impact of the participation in adapted judo on the quality of life of&#xD;
           people with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To validate instruments for use among the population with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To establish a set of coherent pedagogical principles that can be applied throughout the&#xD;
           EU to ensure the effectiveness of adapted judo programmes for children with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To establish a coherent set of pedagogical principles to promote good habits in the&#xD;
           participation in judo by children with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To consolidate and disseminate a systematic approach to adapted judo participation and&#xD;
           competition for people with ASD around the EU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the participants will show improved behaviour after the adapted judo&#xD;
      intervention&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The children were recruited via a number of associations of families with children with ASD&#xD;
      and special education schools. All participants had been diagnosed with ASD according to the&#xD;
      criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fifth Edition,&#xD;
      (DSM-V). Individuals who had been advised against physical activity for medical reasons were&#xD;
      excluded, as were those who had previously taken judo classes. The participants were invited&#xD;
      to take part in the study voluntarily, and along with their parents were informed verbally&#xD;
      and in writing as to the characteristics of the programme. Parents or legal guardians signed&#xD;
      informed consent forms, and the children signed a consent document that explained the&#xD;
      objectives and planned activities of the programme. The study was approved by the Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee of (blinded for review). All protocols applied in this research (including&#xD;
      the management of the personal data of the participants) complied with the requirements&#xD;
      specified in the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975 and its subsequent revisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adapted judo programme is aimed at children of between 8 and 15 years of age who have&#xD;
      been diagnosed with ASD and who being introduced to judo. All the project partners will&#xD;
      contact institutions and organisations involved in the education of people with ASD in their&#xD;
      respective localities and countries. The partners will explain the project and enlist the&#xD;
      help of these institutions to recruit participants. All the study participants will be asked&#xD;
      to sign an informed consent document that will be drafted in keeping with all applicable&#xD;
      research ethics protocols, including a guarantee of the confidentiality of personal data and&#xD;
      an assurance that participants can choose to abandon the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The judo programme will be carried out over the course of two academic years (2020-21,&#xD;
      2021-22). The first school year will allow for pilot testing of the methods and point toward&#xD;
      any necessary adaptations in the assessment techniques used. The design of this first phase&#xD;
      will take into account prior experiences, expert input and information gleaned from focus&#xD;
      groups in order to arrive at an initial proposal, which will then be subject to modification&#xD;
      in accordance with results. The conclusions drawn from this initial experience will form the&#xD;
      scientific and pedagogical basis for the definitive version of the programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The judo sessions will be offered in a large and well-ventilated space suitable for athletic&#xD;
      activity in general and for judo in particular, such that the safety of the participants can&#xD;
      be guaranteed. The judo equipment required for this project will include a tatami mat with a&#xD;
      minimum surface area of 90 m2, made using high-density cushions that help prevent injuries&#xD;
      and ensure that a wide range of activities can be carried out safely. Each participant will&#xD;
      be outfitted with a judogui (a traditional uniform consisting of a cotton jacket and trousers&#xD;
      and a belt that indicates the participant's level of technical skill).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sessions will be an hour in length and will be held twice a week. Two instructors will&#xD;
      lead each session, and at least four volunteers will have to be present to lend support. The&#xD;
      sessions will be divided into three parts in accordance with the physiological principles of&#xD;
      exercise: warm-up, main exercise and cool-down. The main content of the sessions will&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Judo analytical techniques and judo games&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Different types of movements and falling techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ground control techniques and throws. The instruction methodology will always apply the&#xD;
           principle of gradual progression, featuring practice to consolidate the concepts learned&#xD;
           in the initial lessons before moving on to more complex material. Each participant will&#xD;
           be allowed to progress at his or her own pace. Learning will be largely based on&#xD;
           imitation and guided modelling of techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This adapted judo programme for children with ASD will have broader scientific and&#xD;
      pedagogical applications. Each project partner will be responsible for some data collection&#xD;
      tasks. All the partners will gather pedagogical data throughout the process using a common&#xD;
      methodology. Meanwhile, the scientific data will be gathered under stricter conditions by&#xD;
      only some of the project partners. These data will then be handled and analysed by the&#xD;
      research teams of the participating universities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The judo sessions will be accompanied by the constant management and refining of the&#xD;
      assessment and monitoring instruments that will be needed to gather the data that will inform&#xD;
      the final results. Some of these instruments will be used pending a process of adaptation and&#xD;
      validation for use with individuals with ASD, while others have already been tested and&#xD;
      validated for use with this population. The following instruments will be administered during&#xD;
      the programme:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test of Gross Motor Development (TGMD-2). Evaluates two components: a) Locomotor:&#xD;
           Measures gross motor skills that require movements made with a fluid coordination&#xD;
           (running, galloping, jumping with one foot, stride, jump with two feet slide). b) Object&#xD;
           control: This subtest measures the gross motor skills that require efficiency when&#xD;
           throwing, hitting and receiving (hitting a static ball, static jump, reception,&#xD;
           shooting, throwing over the head and throwing below the head).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS-3). It consists of three subscales: Stereotypical&#xD;
           behaviours, communication and social interaction. The instrument consists of 56 clearly&#xD;
           stated items describing the characteristic behaviours of persons with autism. The items&#xD;
           are grouped into six subscales: Restrictive/Repetitive Behaviours, Social Interaction,&#xD;
           Social Communication, Emotional Responses, Cognitive Style, and Maladaptive Speech.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES). It is a short questionnaire that asks about&#xD;
           the degree of satisfaction when it comes to practicing physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Battery ALPHA-FITNESS. It consists of the following variables: weight, height, body&#xD;
           composition (abdominal perimeter, triceps sheet, subscapular fold), hand strength, leg&#xD;
           strength, agility and aerobic endurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Forms to record the participants' technical progress in judo (created for this study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pedagogical data will be collected by all the adapted judo instructors. In the collection&#xD;
      of the research data, standard (blinded study) research protocols will be followed, and&#xD;
      researchers will not be provided with information about the participants or the process&#xD;
      carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two kinds of data described above will be handled differently. First, the pedagogical&#xD;
      information will be subjected to qualitative analysis. These data will include expert&#xD;
      opinion, the participants' level of satisfaction with the process and their degree of&#xD;
      technical progress in judo. These qualitative data will be used to inform the drafting of the&#xD;
      manuals for instructors of adapted judo for children with ASD, texts that will be produced&#xD;
      within the framework of this project. Second, the scientific data will be subjected to&#xD;
      quantitative analysis, including the use of more complex statistical methodology and of&#xD;
      statistical analysis software. This quantitative analysis represents an opportunity validate&#xD;
      some of the instruments applied in the study (PACES, ALPHA-FITNESS) for use among members of&#xD;
      the autistic population. Also measured will be the performance of the participants in adapted&#xD;
      judo competitions, the benefits of judo for individuals with ASD and the prevalence of&#xD;
      injuries among participants in adapted judo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data are collected at timepoint 1 (T1-Baseline), at the start of the programme and&#xD;
      eight weeks later, scores are recorded for timepoint 2 (T2-Control), which represents a&#xD;
      control period. During the control period, part of which includes the winter break from&#xD;
      classes, the students not participate in any extracurricular physical activities, as their&#xD;
      organised physical exercise is limited to their regular physical education classes at school.&#xD;
      Between this second measurement and timepoint 3 (T3-Judo), The choice was made to include the&#xD;
      control period at the start of the process because we did not have a control group willing to&#xD;
      submit to all the measurements over the course of the project. In the absence of a control&#xD;
      group, it was decided to take the second measurement after which the participants only took&#xD;
      part in the compulsory physical education activities at their schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All descriptive data from the dependent variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation&#xD;
      (SD). The normal distribution of each variable was checked with a Shapiro-Wilks test. In&#xD;
      order to test the study hypotheses, comparisons between the four different timepoints.&#xD;

Judo techniques and games (building up body contact with games, teaching simplified movements, essential judo movements) (blinded for review).&#xD;
Ground control techniques and throws (gradually adding techniques to already known movements, scaffolding basic repetitive movements to assist in understanding to those more relevant for judo ).&#xD;
Repetition of different forms of foundational directional movements (pulling, pushing, holding, lifting).</description>
