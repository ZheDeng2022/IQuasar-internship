      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large proportion of injection-guided injections for pain relief including the lower back&#xD;
      are performed with fluoroscopy. Performing the injection requires an adapted room, a&#xD;
      fluoroscope with a C-shaped arm (c-arm), an X-ray technician, a physician, and a nurse. The&#xD;
      amount of radiation, which is ionizing, is not negligible and depends very much on the&#xD;
      reliability of the medical team. The injections performed in this technique include&#xD;
      injections into the epidural space, injections into the facet joints (joints between the&#xD;
      vertebrae of the back), nerve blocks, and radiofrequency nerve ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using ultrasound imaging, as a substitute for fluoroscopy, may help real-time guidance of&#xD;
      needle placement, and allow imaging from multiple directions, without ionizing radiation that&#xD;
      endangers the patient and caregivers, while reducing treatment. costs The use of ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging will allow these treatments to be performed in outpatient clinics as well, without&#xD;
      the need for expensive equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, with the existing ultrasound equipment, there is a very high variability as to the&#xD;
      quality of the image obtained while scanning the lower back. Poor image quality makes it very&#xD;
      difficult to perform an accurate and reliable injection. In contrast, the structures of the&#xD;
      lower back can be optimally simulated using CT (mainly the skeletal structures such as&#xD;
      vertebrae and joints) and using MRI (better resolution for soft tissue structures than for&#xD;
      skeletal structures). Performing invasive injections under the guidance of these measures is&#xD;
      costly both in terms of equipment and in terms of manpower and certainly contributes to&#xD;
      ionizing exposure in the case of CT. At the same time, many patients come to the Institute of&#xD;
      Pain Medicine, after performing these imaging tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to develop an algorithm in which these tests (CT, MRI) will serve as&#xD;
      a database for each patient participating in the study whose back will be scanned using an&#xD;
      ultrasound transducer. According to the initiators of the study, the investigators can&#xD;
      develop an imaging application that will rely on both the information of an imaging image of&#xD;
      CT and / or MRI and after the back scan (using an ultrasound transducer) the investigators&#xD;
      will get an improved (augmented) ultrasound image that can be used in the future as an&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to improve the quality of the imaging image obtained when&#xD;
      scanning the lower back with an ultrasound transducer using the information available from&#xD;
      previous imaging images - CT and / or MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are referred to the Rambam Institute of Pain Medicine suffering from low back&#xD;
      pain and who have already undergone a CT scan or MRI examination of the lower back before&#xD;
      arriving at the Institute&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants in this center:&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age range:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between the ages of 18 and 80&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gender:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without gender restriction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Low back pain including lower / upper back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who underwent MRI or CT imaging of the lower back during the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients who can understand the rationale of the study and can sign an informed consent&#xD;
           form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Back surgery in the lower back area&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Significant deformity in the back such as scoliosis with an angle above 50 degrees&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for removal from the experiment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      none&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the medical trial includes the follow-up period after the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About a year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up program (during and after treatment):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: Patients eligible for the study will receive an explanation and sign a scientific consent&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B: Subjects will fill out a short demographic questionnaire as well as a questionnaire about&#xD;
      their pain problem. Each subject will receive a unique identification number for the study&#xD;
      itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C: The subjects will be admitted to the Institute of Pain Medicine for the purpose of&#xD;
      scanning the back using an ultrasound device. The required imaging acquisition, using the&#xD;
      standard transducer (curved array or phased array), is of three scans along the bilateral&#xD;
      spine, and three transverse scans in the same area. After scanning - which will take about 5&#xD;
      minutes, the data will be stored in digital media anonymously but with the unique&#xD;
      identification number given to the patient in section B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D: The digital media - CT or MRI will be uploaded to the hospital's imaging archive. Data&#xD;
      will be transferred anonymously to external media (disk with a unique identification number&#xD;
      of the study only) The digital information of both the ultrasound scan and the previous&#xD;
      imaging tests will be transferred to a biotechnology lab, without any identifying details of&#xD;
      the patient for analysis.&#xD;
