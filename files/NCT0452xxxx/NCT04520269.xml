  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, lead in phase Ib dose confirmation, followed by phase II&#xD;
      study with 2 parallel study cohorts. Patients will be pre-screened for presence of 1q21.3&#xD;
      copy number amplification in plasma samples prior to screening process. Only patients with&#xD;
      confirmed plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) 1q21.3 copy number amplification who successfully meet&#xD;
      study eligibility criteria will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase Ib segment will be carried out in a standard 3+3 design, with a projected enrolment&#xD;
      of 3 to 18 patients to determine the RP2D. In the phase II portion, 2 parallel cohorts will&#xD;
      be enrolled (Cohort A: 1q21.3 amplified breast cancers, Cohort B: 1q21.3 amplified other&#xD;
      solid tumors). Based on the Simon 2 stage optimal design, 12 patients will be enrolled in&#xD;
      each cohort for stage I of the study, and assessed for PFS. If at least 3 of 12 patients meet&#xD;
      study response criteria, the study will then be expanded to stage 2 to include a total of 25&#xD;
      patients in each cohort. Accounting for 10% attrition rate, a maximum of 28 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled into each cohort for phase II of the study.&#xD;

      2.1. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single agent pacritinib is effective in disease control of patients with 1q21.3&#xD;
           amplified solid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single agent pacritinib is safe in patients with 1q21.3 amplified solid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment with pacritinib will decrease plasma cfDNA copy number ratio of 1q21.3 in&#xD;
           patients with 1q21.3 amplified solid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma cfDNA copy number ratio of 1q21.3 will correlate with serial radiological&#xD;
           findings in patients with 1q21.3 amplified solid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the proportion of patients with 1q21.3 amplified breast cancer (primary&#xD;
      population: Cohort A) who remain progression-free at 4 months after treatment with pacritinib&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of pacritinib in patients with treatment&#xD;
           refractory solid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the RP2D of pacritinib in patients with treatment refractory solid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate disease response from pacritinib by RECIST criteria version 1.1 and tumor&#xD;
           markers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the proportion of patients with 1q21.3 amplified treatment refractory solid&#xD;
           tumors excluding (exploratory population: Cohort B) who remain progression-free at 4&#xD;
           months after treatment with pacritinib&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4. Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters including Cmax/min and steady state&#xD;
           concentrations of pacritinib through serial plasma sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine pharmacodynamics (PD) parameters including highly sensitive C-reactive&#xD;
           protein (CRP), HbA1c, changes in cytokine levels and plasma cfDNA levels of copy number&#xD;
           ratio of 1q21.3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of plasma cfDNA levels of copy number ratio of 1q21.3 with radiological&#xD;
           findings determined by RECIST criteria 1.1 and tumor markers&#xD;
