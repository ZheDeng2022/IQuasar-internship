      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the 1-month&#xD;
      regimen of three times weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid in improving fertility outcome in&#xD;
      recurrent implantation failure (RIF) patients with latent genital tuberculosis (LGTB),&#xD;
      compared to no treatment and non-LGTB patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of latent genital tuberculosis (LGTB) is relatively high in women with&#xD;
      infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss. Whether preventive treatment of latent tuberculosis&#xD;
      infection (LTBI) can improve the fertility outcome in women with recurrent implantation&#xD;
      failure (RIF) remains to be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective interventional cohort study.The main purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the fertility outcome between 1-month regimen of three times weekly rifapentine plus&#xD;
      isoniazid and no treatment in RIF patients with LGTB and RIF patients without LGTB. The study&#xD;
      will also assess the safety and tolerability and the efficacy of the preventive treatment&#xD;
      regimen in prevention of the incidence of active female genital tuberculosis (FGTB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 1050 participants will be recruited for screening of LGTB. The endometrial&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test will be employed for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      LGTB. Eligible participants with negative TB PCR results will be assigned to the non-LGTB&#xD;
      group, while those with positive TB PCR results will be assigned to the LGTB group. The LGTB&#xD;
      group will be further assigned, according to their will to receive preventive treatment of&#xD;
      tuberculosis, to one of the following groups: the LGTB treatment group and the LGTB no&#xD;
      treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LGTB treatment group will receive the 1-month regimen of three times weekly rifapentine&#xD;
      plus isoniazid, and the in vitro fertilization (IVF)/ intra cytoplasmic sperm injection&#xD;
      (ICSI) cycle can be started after 1 month post the completion of the treatment regimen.&#xD;
      Adverse events and side effects will be monitored at a 2-week interval during the preventive&#xD;
      treatment and followed up once more at 4 weeks post the end of treatment. The LGTB no&#xD;
      treatment group and the non-LGTB group will start the IVF/ICSI cycle directly after&#xD;
      enrollment without taking any medication related to preventive treatment of tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be followed up until the end of an IVF/ ICSI cycle or pregnancy.&#xD;
      Fertility outcomes of both groups will be recorded and compared. Secondary outcomes,&#xD;
      including the incidence of adverse events, the adhesion of treatment and the incidence of&#xD;
      LGTB and FGTB, ovarian reserve, embryo quality, history of infertility and tuberculosis will&#xD;
      also be recorded and compared.&#xD;
