  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different modality of anesthesia and analgesia could influence a postoperative quality of&#xD;
      recovery (QoR). This study is exploring early QoR after unilateral nephrectomy in the two&#xD;
      groups of anesthesia. The first group had a light general anesthesia with thoracic epidural&#xD;
      anesthesia and postoperative epidural analgesia with morphine and ropivacaine. The second&#xD;
      group had general anesthesia and a continuous postoperative analgesia with tramadol. The&#xD;
      postoperative QoR was evaluated 24 hours after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants were premedicated with diazepam 5 mg 12 hours and 1 hour before surgery.&#xD;
      Thromboprophylaxis ( 4,000 - 6000 IU) depending on the body weight was given at least 12&#xD;
      hours before surgery. All participants were warmed to prevent unintended hypothermia.&#xD;
      Participants were allocated by permuted-block randomisation into one of two groups: general&#xD;
      anesthesia group and epidural anesthesia. The randomisation list was obtained from R program&#xD;
      version 3.5.3. The group allocations were contained in a closed envelope that were opened&#xD;
      before surgery after the completed enrollment procedure. All patients and infusions were&#xD;
      wormed to prevent unintended hypothermia. Induction of general anesthesia was with midazolam&#xD;
      2.5 mg, fentanyl 100 Î¼g, propofol 1-2 mg/kg and vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balanced crystalloid fluids were used to treat hypovolemia. Additionally, 6% Hydroxyethyl&#xD;
      starch was used before blood transfusion products to treat profound hypovolemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood transfusions were given according to clinical situation. Bradycardia was treated with&#xD;
      atropine. Hypotension was treated with ephedrine boluses. Anti-inflammatory drug metamizole&#xD;
      (dipyrone) 2.5 g was given intravenously before the end of the surgery and after 12 hours&#xD;
      after the surgery. Neostigmine 2.5 mg with atropine 1 mg was used for the reversal of the&#xD;
      effects of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents after surgery. Participants were&#xD;
      placed for one day in a urology high care unit provided with constant and vigilant nurse&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crystalloid infusions were used for maintaining diuresis. Gastroprotection was done with&#xD;
      pantoprazole 40 mg. Metoclopramid 10 mg was given for postoperative nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      (PONV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative QoR was evaluated with three QoR scales. Scales for pain, anxiety and PONV&#xD;
      were also examined. The 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) questionnaire evaluated quality of&#xD;
      life one month before and one month after surgery.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analog scale of quality of recovery (QoR)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patient rated visual analog scale is a simple scale for rating the quality of recovery by placing &quot;X&quot; on the line. Poor recovery is on the left side of the line. Under the end of the left line is an explanation of poor recovery: in severe pain, nausea &amp; vomiting, confused, immobilized, unable to eat and unable to communicate. Excellent recovery is on the right side of the line. Under the end of the line is a written explanation: without any pain, comfortable, alert, active, enjoying food and communicating freely.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of recovery 40 (QoR-40)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The QoR-40 measures five related dimensions of quality of recovery: emotional state (8 items), physical comfort (12 items), physical independence (5 items), psychological support (7 items) and pain (7 items). Each item is rated on a 5 point Likert scale. Minimal possible score is 40 and maximal possible score is 200.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of recovery 15 (QoR-15)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of recovery (QoR-15) is a short version of QoR - 40 questionnaire. The QoR-15 questionnaire has 15 items scaled from 0 to 10. Minimum score is 0, and maximum 150. It is shorter, user friendly and less time consuming then extensive QoR-40 questionnaire.</description>
