      This is a prospective, open label, multi-centre phase II trial with a two-arm non comparative&#xD;
      design aiming to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Enasidenib (investigational product) as&#xD;
      prophylactic consolidation in patients with IDH2-mutated MDS, CMML and AML in remission after&#xD;
      allo-SCT (Arm A) and as salvage therapy in patients with IDH2-mutated MDS, CMML and AML who&#xD;
      have relapsed after allo-SCT (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  interventional&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  prospective, open-label, non-randomized with 2 single non-comparative arms, multicenter&#xD;
           phase-II trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  total patients sample size: 30 patients (Arm A) + 30 patients (Arm B) = 60 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of trial sites: 10 all located in Germany and members of the EBMT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A (Consolidation):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with AML, MDS and CMML, in whom an IDH2 mutation has been detected at diagnosis&#xD;
      prior allo-SCT, are eligible for consolidation therapy, if they are in complete molecular&#xD;
      remission (no IDH2 mutation detected) after first allo-SCT. Remission will be evaluated&#xD;
      within a screening period between day +25 and day +35. Evaluation of remission will be&#xD;
      performed locally with IDH2 mutation analysis performed at an experienced local laboratory of&#xD;
      the respective center. Reports about IDH2 mutation testing at diagnosis and at screening have&#xD;
      to be sent to the principle investigator for review at screening to include the patient; a BM&#xD;
      sample will be stored for central retesting, which will be performed in batch during the&#xD;
      course of the study. Having a documented molecular CR, patients will enter the treatment&#xD;
      phase within 30 days after this BM evaluation (latest time point day +65) and start treatment&#xD;
      with Enasidenib. They are envisaged to receive Enasidenib (100 mg per day, day 1-28) for up&#xD;
      to 12 cycles (=12 months). Patients will go off protocol prematurely in case of relapse,&#xD;
      intolerability of study treatment and in case of withdrawal of consent. In those patients who&#xD;
      relapse during study treatment subsequent therapy for relapse will be performed according to&#xD;
      the choice of the individual treating physician. Patients who finish study as planned or&#xD;
      prematurely will be regularly followed for one year, lost to follow up, death or withdrawal&#xD;
      of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B (Salvage):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, either with known IDH2 mutation prior transplant or with unknown IDH2 mutation&#xD;
      status, who have already relapsed after first allo-SCT either on a molecular or hematological&#xD;
      level at any time point and have an IDH2 mutation at relapse, are not eligible for part A of&#xD;
      this study. They are eligible for screening for Arm B of this study. Screening will be&#xD;
      performed locally with IDH2 mutation analysis performed at an experienced local laboratory of&#xD;
      the respective center. Reports about IDH2 mutation testing at diagnosis and at screening have&#xD;
      to be sent to the principle investigator for review at screening to include the patient; a BM&#xD;
      sample will be stored for central retesting, which will be performed in batch during the&#xD;
      course of the study. In case of ineligibility according to exclusion and inclusion criteria,&#xD;
      patients will not enter the treatment phase and go off protocol. They should be treated&#xD;
      according to the choice of the individual treating physician and the chosen treatment will be&#xD;
      recorded. If an IDH2 mutation is present and patients also fulfill all other inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, they will be included and enter treatment phase of the study. They will be treated&#xD;
      according to the treatment schedule outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enasidenib 100 mg/day for 28 days per cycle up to 12 cycles (investigational product)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optionally: DLI after cycle 4, 6 and 8 at a dose of 1-5 x10^6 CD3/kg (1st DLI), 5 x10^6&#xD;
           -5x10^7 CD3/kg (2ndDLI) and 5 x10^7-5x10^8 CD3/kg (3rd DLI) (in case of HLA-identical&#xD;
           donors or at lower dosages in case of unrelated, mismatched or haploidentical donors, as&#xD;
           per standard of care)&#xD;
