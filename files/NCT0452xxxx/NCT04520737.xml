  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver resection is the only curative treatment for patients with colorectal liver metastases&#xD;
      (CRLM). Most patients undergo chemotherapy (CT) before liver surgery. CT objectively&#xD;
      decreases patient functional capacity. It has already been demonstrated that a structured&#xD;
      training program carried out during the 4 weeks following CT, while the patient is waiting&#xD;
      for liver resection, is able to return the functional capacity to baseline levels. Despite&#xD;
      this, multimodal prehabilitation programs (MPP) during preoperative CT have not been&#xD;
      evaluated or implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether a 16-week MPP applied during and following CT&#xD;
      in CRLM patients will result in a significant increase in physical fitness when compared to&#xD;
      those that undergo MPP only during the 4-weeks, between the end of CT and liver resection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal prehabilitation&#xD;
      program (MPP) in CRLM patients, which will be implemented right through the period of&#xD;
      preoperative CT and during the 4-weeks of recovery before liver resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MPP will consist of in-hospital high-moderate intensive exercise training, nutritional&#xD;
      assessment and high-protein supplementation, smoking cessation, psychological support and&#xD;
      Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected improvement in physical fitness will be measured by the difference in meters&#xD;
      achieved in the six-minute walk test (6MWT) and will be compared with patients that will&#xD;
      follow the MPP only during the 4-weeks before surgery, when preoperative CT has been&#xD;
      finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims include patient reported outcomes measures such as quality of life,&#xD;
      postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, 30-day mortality and re-admissions.&#xD;
      Protocol feasibility will be evaluated by monitoring all interventions.&#xD;
