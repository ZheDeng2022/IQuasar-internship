  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dr. Park and her colleagues published findings in the Journal of Clinical Oncology&#xD;
      demonstrating that CCSS survivors, compared to siblings, were significantly more likely to be&#xD;
      uninsured and to have difficulties obtaining health insurance. Given the current insurance&#xD;
      landscape and the additional insurance burden that childhood cancer survivors face, the&#xD;
      present study seeks to develop and pilot a health insurance navigation program targeted at&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability with survivors, and improving health insurance literacy and&#xD;
      ameliorating financial distress related to medical costs. The proposed health insurance&#xD;
      navigation will involve 4 navigator-led health insurance navigation sessions. The study&#xD;
      investigators propose that, compared to the control arm (who will receive a health insurance&#xD;
      information guide, but will not receive the navigation intervention), participants in the&#xD;
      intervention arm will have improved health insurance literacy and decreased financial&#xD;
      distress related to medical costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study seeks to develop and pilot a health insurance navigation program with&#xD;
      childhood cancer survivors recruited from the Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) Cohort. Childhood&#xD;
      cancer survivors tend to face health challenges throughout their lives that require&#xD;
      monitoring and ongoing care. This is compounded by the tendency among childhood survivors to&#xD;
      have higher rates of under and uninsurance, unmet healthcare need, and burdensome costs&#xD;
      related to care.These burdensome costs also contribute to underutilization of care among&#xD;
      survivors. Additionally, as health insurance systems and designs continue to evolve, many&#xD;
      people have inadequate understandings of their own health insurance. Dr. Park and her&#xD;
      colleagues published findings that suggested LTFU survivors had difficulty in understanding&#xD;
      how to use their insurance, and often experienced financial-related distress. Survivors were&#xD;
      more likely than their siblings to have borrowed money to pay for medical expenses, and only&#xD;
      27.3% of survivors and 26.2% of their siblings reported familiarity with the ACA. Given these&#xD;
      circumstances, understanding and navigating insurance benefits in the current in the current&#xD;
      landscape is crucial for cancer survivors to obtain and utilize the health care that they&#xD;
      need. With this in mind, the study investigators propose to develop and pilot an insurance&#xD;
      navigation intervention with LTFU participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three institutions involved in this study have differing, complementary roles that will&#xD;
      contribute to the development and piloting of a health insurance navigation intervention. As&#xD;
      the lead site and IRB of record for this study, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) will be&#xD;
      responsible for the development and regulation of all study-related materials. MGH will also&#xD;
      be responsible for the delivery of the navigation intervention (which necessitates the&#xD;
      training and supervision of the individual delivery the navigation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a collaborating site for this study, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital will be&#xD;
      responsible for all recruitment activities, as this study plans to recruit exclusively from&#xD;
      the Long-Term Follow-Up Study (LTFU) Cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a collaborating site for this study, the University of Utah will be responsible for all&#xD;
      participant assessment during the study, which will include baseline and follow-up surveys,&#xD;
      and exit interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 80 LTFU participants will be recruited for the randomized pilot trial portion&#xD;
      of the study. Prospective participants for the pilot randomized trial portion of the study&#xD;
      will be identified via LTFU records, and recruited and consented by LTFU study staff at St.&#xD;
      Jude Children's Research Hospital. Prospective participants will receive an invitation to the&#xD;
      study through email and mail. The proposed navigation intervention will be delivered by a&#xD;
      health insurance navigator via HIPAA-compliant videoconferencing. Content of the navigation&#xD;
      intervention will involve the following sessions: 1- Learning Abut Survivorship Healthcare&#xD;
      Needs; 2- Learning About Your Plan in Relation to Policy; 3- Navigating One's Own Plan and&#xD;
      Overcoming Obstacles; 4- Managing Care Costs. The sessions will be delivered to participants&#xD;
      every week over a one to two-month period. Participants will be randomized into either the&#xD;
      navigation intervention arm, or the enhanced usual care arm (approximately 40 per arm). The&#xD;
      sample size of approximately 40 per arm was chosen to enable evaluation of feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability goals, as well as to explore meaningful differences in the outcomes.To assess&#xD;
      the proposed primary and secondary outcomes, all trial participants will complete a baseline&#xD;
      and 3-month post-program follow-up survey (approximately 5-month follow-up from baseline).&#xD;
      The surveys will be conducted via RedCap or via mailed survey (which will then be input into&#xD;
      the RedCap database by study staff). Intervention arm participants will also complete an exit&#xD;
      interview in order to further refine the navigation intervention. Both study arm participants&#xD;
      will receive a health insurance information guide.&#xD;
