      Study Design: A double-blinded randomized controlled trial will be conducted, and all the&#xD;
      participants will undertake a non-immersive VR tasks and tDCS-active or tDCS-sham. It will be&#xD;
      a cross-sectional protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and sampling: Participants will be recruited through referral by the&#xD;
      coordinators of places or institutions who has patients available to participate in the state&#xD;
      of São Paulo-Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: Participants with idiopathic Parkinson's Disease, with diagnosis&#xD;
      previously confirmed by a specialized doctor, will be included if they have the agreement to&#xD;
      participate in the research by signing the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: Participants will be excluded if they used a wheelchair, were unable to&#xD;
      complete the procedures due to any reported fatigue or due to having to leave previously, and&#xD;
      who could not stand without any kind of help, such as a carrier or walking aids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Participants: Participants will be randomly allocated to either group 1&#xD;
      (tDCS-active and VR tasks) or group 2 (tDCS-sham and VR tasks). Randomization will be under&#xD;
      the control of a blinded investigator who will be the only person allowed to manage the&#xD;
      electronic security file of the randomization to assign the individuals. The investigator&#xD;
      will be blind to the group in which the participant is allocated to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: The participants, researchers and outcome assessors will remain blind throughout&#xD;
      the study. To ensure proper blinding, the researcher responsible for that, will configurate&#xD;
      the code of the tDCS device to sham or active before the proper application. It will be no&#xD;
      difference between the devices for sham or active application of the tDCS, because the same&#xD;
      device has these two options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation concealment: Allocation concealment will successfully be reached since no one&#xD;
      involved in this study (i.e. the participants, researchers, and outcome assessors) will be&#xD;
      aware of the treatment allocations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will attend the assigned tDCS and VR intervention as follows: there will be&#xD;
      one session of application of tDCS and non-immersive VR tasks during twenty minutes of&#xD;
      intervention. The researchers will be trained to perform all interventions tDCS-sham,&#xD;
      tDCS-active and VR tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual Reality intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the application of the tDCS-active or sham, it will be performed tasks in&#xD;
      non-immersive virtual reality environment to stimulate and verify the performance in the&#xD;
      timing coincident task present in the software that will be used provided by the &quot;Bridge&#xD;
      Games&quot;. A software developed by the Research and Technological Applications in Rehabilitation&#xD;
      (Grupo de Pesquisa e Aplicação Tecnológica em Reabilitação - PATER) group of the School of&#xD;
      Arts, Sciences, and Humanities of the University of Sao Paulo (EACH-USP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart Rate Variability (HRV): It will be analyzed the HRV when the participant is already in&#xD;
      the tDCS-active or sham application + VR task. The HRV analysis will follow the guidelines of&#xD;
      the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing&#xD;
      and Electrophysiology (TFESC &amp; NASPE, 1996). The strap (for data collection) will be&#xD;
      positioned on the participant's chest, and the Polar RS800cx heart rate receiver will be&#xD;
      positioned next to it. HRV will be recorded after the initial assessments at rest for 5&#xD;
      minutes, during virtual reality combined to tDCS training for 10 minutes and for rest after&#xD;
      the intervention for 5 minutes, totalizing 20 minutes. For analysis of HRV data at rest 1000&#xD;
      consecutive RR intervals will be used and during the tasks 256 consecutive RR intervals will&#xD;
      be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HR will be recorded beat by beat throughout the protocol by the Polar RS800CX FC Portable&#xD;
      Monitor (Polar Electro, Finland) and RR intervals recorded by the monitor will be transferred&#xD;
      to the Polar ProTreiner program (3.0 v., Polar Electro, Finland) , which allows HR&#xD;
      visualization and cardiac period extraction in the &quot;txt&quot; file format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderate digital filtering will be performed in the program itself complemented with manual&#xD;
      filtering performed in Excel software to eliminate premature ectopic beats and artifacts, and&#xD;
      only series with more than 95% sinus beats will be included in the study (Vanderlei et al.,&#xD;
      2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRV analysis will be performed using linear (time and frequency domain) and nonlinear methods&#xD;
      that will be analyzed using Kubios HRV® software (Kubios HRV v.1.1 for Windows, Biomedical&#xD;
      Signal Analysis Group, Department of Applied Physics, University of Kuopio, Finland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS-active or tDCS-sham will be performed over one session during the practice of VR games.&#xD;
      The frequency of current applied will be 2mA. The stimulation intensity will be set at 100%,&#xD;
      and the anodal electrode will be at the M1 area, and the cathodal electrode at the&#xD;
      contralateral supraorbital area. The device used will be the DS-Stimulator, from NeuroConn,&#xD;
      which allows blindness of the subjects of the research and the experimenters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: First, the demarcation and positioning of the tDCS device will be done, and the&#xD;
      electrodes positioned at predetermined locations. Anodic TDCS with electrodes between 25-35&#xD;
      cm2, intensity of 2mA, density of up to 0.057 mA / cm2 for a period of 20 minutes will be&#xD;
      used. However, for the TDCS-sham (placebo) the same active procedure setting will be used,&#xD;
      however, the current will be interrupted after 20 seconds. This configuration will ensure&#xD;
      that the electrical stimulus is interrupted before generating considerable stimuli, while the&#xD;
      other characteristics of the intervention will be maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After five minutes of stimulation at rest, the individuals performed the VR training with the&#xD;
      MoveHero game, first with the upper limbs (during 5 minutes), then with the lower limbs (5&#xD;
      minutes). The participants will have the rest of the time (5 minutes) (with tDCS (sham or&#xD;
      active). After each session the participant will be questioned about the presence of adverse&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
