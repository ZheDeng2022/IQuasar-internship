  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is used ever more increasingly across the emergency medicine&#xD;
      departments in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guided procedures like nerve blocks, vascular access, abscess drainage and foreign body&#xD;
      exploration are done more conveniently and efficiently utilising visualisation under ultra&#xD;
      sonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several training models are available commercially that aids in training the novice and&#xD;
      expert in the field alike. The commercially available models are expensive and inaccessible&#xD;
      for most, while the utility of POCUS in Emergency Department (ED) is on the rise. This has&#xD;
      lead people to experiment with various models for training which ranges from basic gelatin&#xD;
      moulds to ballistic gel. There are only a few studies that compare these with the&#xD;
      commercially available products for educational purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The home made models are cheaper and more easily procurable for training making it a&#xD;
      relatively favourable choice in financially constrained situations. The investigators have&#xD;
      been using a gelatine based training model to train their emergency medicine residents for&#xD;
      many years. In this study they intend to assess whether their indigenously developed&#xD;
      ultrasound phantom model is comparable to commercially available models for vascular access&#xD;
      training.They also sought to assess the better preliminary teaching model for ultrasound&#xD;
      guided vascular access: in-plane or out-of-plane approach?&#xD;

    <masking_description>The examiners, examinees and statistician would be blinded to the nature of the model.&#xD;
The model would be matched in colour shape and size with the commercially available model. The models would be covered by a plastic surgical drape, with a label on top that said model A or model B.&#xD;
The models identity would be known only to the team leader. One the coin toss is complete and model allocated, the allocation would be marked unto a sealed envelope which would be opened only after data entry and analysis.&#xD;
Any untoward event needing unmasking of the models like damage to the model, warranting replacement was also carried out by the team leader.</masking_description>

    <description>Model A and B would be randomly allotted to commercial model and IDUP. Intervention limb would involve performing on sequentially on the commercial and IDUP, following which a feed back of the candidates would be recorded about their performance on the same with respect to sonological appearance, tactile feedback, artefacts and ease of performing the procedure. Set time points (time to needle tip visualisation, time to puncture) and no of attempts before successful cannulation would be recorded by an assessor on a pre set proforma.</description>
