  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-centered, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial&#xD;
      conducted in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), in patients who were aged 1 month to&#xD;
      18 years, needing MV for at least 48 hours, to evaluate the effect of Chlorhexidine (CHX) on&#xD;
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) incidence and to determine VAP risk factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomized into two groups receiving CHX (0.12%) or placebo (0.9% NaCl) and&#xD;
      followed for VAP development. All patients were consecutively randomized (1:1) to receive&#xD;
      either 0.12% CHX rinse solution or placebo applications using a computer generated balanced&#xD;
      randomization table. The unlabeled standardized tubes containing placebo or 0.12% CHX were&#xD;
      serially numbered and bagged for each patient according to randomization. The preparation of&#xD;
      bagged treatments and their numbering were done by the same personnel who was not involved in&#xD;
      the study. The placebo rinse contained 0.9% NaCl (normal saline [NS]), and was identical to&#xD;
      the 0.12% CHX rinse solution with regard to appearance, consistency, taste and smell. The&#xD;
      patients, physicians, outcome assessors, and data analysts were kept blinded to the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard care protocols in the PICU were performed. Before beginning the study, nurses&#xD;
      received a training program for VAP prevention, procedure/technique for oral hygiene and use&#xD;
      of oral mucosa assessment score under supervision of pediatric residents. They were trained&#xD;
      on the method of application of solutions according to CDC guidelines in order to ensure&#xD;
      uniform treatments. Nurses were double blinded and had no knowledge of the solution they were&#xD;
      using.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both treatment groups (placebo and 0.12% CHX) received treatments at 4-hour intervals, nurses&#xD;
      used the whole content of 5 ml tubes containing rinse solution. In both groups, nurses&#xD;
      performed oral cleansing as follows: first, the endotracheal cuff pressure was tested to&#xD;
      ensure proper pressure prior to oral care and oropharyngeal secretions were aspirated to&#xD;
      remove any accumulated secretions. Then the application of rinse solutions to cleanse all&#xD;
      areas of the oral cavity, including the anterior and posterior pharynx, gums, teeth, tongue,&#xD;
      and buccal mucosa, with standard disposable applicator (foam swab) was applied, followed by&#xD;
      removal of excess solution from the mouth by a sterile catheter. Strict hand hygiene was&#xD;
      ensured during the procedures. The period of application was from the day of intubation until&#xD;
      extubation. Presence of any adverse effect of the solutions was recorded. Beck oral&#xD;
      assessment score (BOAS) was used twice daily to evaluate the oral health of both groups.&#xD;
