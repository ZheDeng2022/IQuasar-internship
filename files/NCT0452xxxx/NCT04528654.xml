  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-management of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors is a recommended form of secondary&#xD;
      disease prevention. There are thousands of consumer-facing mobile health (mHealth)&#xD;
      applications (apps) intended for tracking, monitoring, and communicating risk factors and&#xD;
      health conditions such as hypertension. mHealth apps may be beneficial in improving health&#xD;
      status and reducing risk factors. However, the majority of mHealth apps available for&#xD;
      consumers have not been scientifically and rigorously evaluated in clinical trials, and due&#xD;
      to the fast pace of technological development, those previously evaluated are often outdated&#xD;
      by the time trial results are available. Given the rapid pace of change in this field, it is&#xD;
      not feasible to rigorously evaluate mHealth apps with current methodologies. McMaster&#xD;
      University Health Information Research Unit has developed an innovative research approach&#xD;
      using a web-based platform, called Trial My App (TMA), designed to perform efficient, cheap,&#xD;
      but high-quality testing of apps relevant to patients with CV risk factors. The overall aim&#xD;
      of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of using the web research platform to conduct&#xD;
      efficient and rigorous online randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mHealth apps relevant to&#xD;
      patients with CV risk factors. Screening, consent, randomization, and collection of outcomes&#xD;
      are completed online using the TMA platform. Recruitment, retention, and completion&#xD;
      statistics will be collected in this pilot trial evaluating an mHealth app that targets&#xD;
      hypertension. The investigators will partner with clinics in the community to recruit&#xD;
      patients to the platform. Study findings will determine if it is feasible to use the&#xD;
      relatively simple TMA web-based approach to evaluating the clinical efficacy of mHealth apps&#xD;
      for patients with CV risk factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of the newly developed Trial My App&#xD;
      platform to conduct an efficient RCT of an mHealth app that targets hypertension, a CV risk&#xD;
      factor, without the need for in-person visits. Trial stages, including screening, consent,&#xD;
      randomization, and collection of patient-important outcomes, will be performed virtually&#xD;
      using the TMA platform. A combination of passive and active recruitment will begin in fall&#xD;
      2020 after ethics approval. A variety of recruitment materials will be distributed by a&#xD;
      research assistant to partner newsletters, websites, community practices and primary care or&#xD;
      speciality clinic waiting rooms. These materials include videos, paper and online&#xD;
      posters/postcards, emails, as well as posts advertising on social media. Social media&#xD;
      recruitment will consist of general posts and targeted ads. The primary goal at this stage is&#xD;
      to determine whether TMA, the innovative, efficient, web-based methodology, can be used to&#xD;
      conduct RCTs evaluating mHealth interventions. The primary feasibility outcome is study&#xD;
      completion. Other feasibility outcomes are recruitment rate, eligibility rates, consent&#xD;
      rates, retention rates, intervention adherence, and appropriateness of data collection&#xD;
      processes. Descriptive analysis will be performed on the dataset using appropriate&#xD;
      statistical methods. The secondary objective is to test the clinical efficacy of the chosen&#xD;
      mHealth app in reducing BP in patients with sub-optimally controlled hypertension when&#xD;
      compared with an educational control group. Efficacy outcomes include clinical assessment&#xD;
      changes, self-management adherence, and patient-reported outcomes. This is a pilot,&#xD;
      non-blinded, feasibility RCT, comparing use of a hypertension tracking app versus an&#xD;
      education control in participants with hypertension that is sub optimally controlled. The&#xD;
      investigators will later include a sub-study to validate the blood pressure data inputted&#xD;
      into the online platform through in-person blood pressure measurements. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to register on the TMA site and will complete user profile and screening questionnaires&#xD;
      and consent for participation in the pilot trial. The participants that meet inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be asked to electronically consent to take part in the pilot trial, and input&#xD;
      clinical and patient-important data at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months into the web application.&#xD;
