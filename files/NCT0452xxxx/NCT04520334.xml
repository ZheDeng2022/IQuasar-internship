    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a Zhineng Qigong intervention for patients with&#xD;
      chronic low back pain and/or leg pain, and to test feasibility aspects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Zhineng Qigong is a self-training method which enables the participant to take an active part&#xD;
      in a possible recovery process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are: 1) evaluate a Zhineng Qigong intervention regarding health&#xD;
      aspects (both subjective and objective outcomes) in patients with chronic low back pain&#xD;
      and/or leg pain; 2) test different aspects of feasibility including recruiting from different&#xD;
      patient populations and testing outcome measurements; and, 3) get a basis for power&#xD;
      calculation for a future Randomised Controlled Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous experiences after Zhineng Qigong training with European Zhineng Qigong,&#xD;
      this study is based on the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Zhineng Qigong training gives pain reduction and reduced consumption of analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Zhineng Qigong training reduces lumbar spine-related symptoms (other than pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Zhineng Qigong training reduces healthcare utilisation, including lumbar spine surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Zhineng Qigong training improves walking ability, mobility, and functional capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Zhineng Qigong training improves Health-Related Quality of Life, including perceived&#xD;
           concentration ability, distress, sleeping quality, vitality, depression, mood, and&#xD;
           anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigatorsÂ´ idea was to give patients with chronic low back pain and/or leg pain the&#xD;
      opportunity to practise Zhineng Qigong in an intervention arranged by European Zhineng&#xD;
      Qigong. To this prospective interventional study without control group, patients were&#xD;
      recruited from the Swedish spine surgery register (SweSpine), Orthopaedic clinic, and Primary&#xD;
      Healthcare. The intervention period was 12 weeks, with measurements once before and once&#xD;
      after intervention. However, because of difficulties in recruiting, 15 of the respondents&#xD;
      were enrolled to 3 weeks shorter intervention, joining respondents who already started the 12&#xD;
      weeks intervention. Totally, 55 respondents were enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Marital status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children at home (number and age)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of symptoms in the lumbar spine and/or leg (year-month when the symptoms&#xD;
           started)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar spine diagnosis (name and year-month of the diagnosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of lumbar spine surgery (number of times and which years)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of surgery and surgery level(s) (for postoperative patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sick- or disability pension (since which year-month and main reason)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatments and/or training methods already tried (also for how long time)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Educational level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occupation or living situation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking habits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Financial difficulties&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same physiotherapist examined the respondents once before and once after the intervention&#xD;
      period. Two weeks before and two weeks after the intervention period, a &quot;pain diary&quot; was&#xD;
      filled in by the respondents. Also, they filled in questionnaires once before and once after&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention period participation in the group activities was registered on an&#xD;
      attendance list. Every day during the intervention period and two weeks after, the&#xD;
      respondents filled in a &quot;training diary&quot; with information about how much Zhineng Qigong was&#xD;
      practised besides the group activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The respondents that were on waiting list for lumbar spine surgery were asked by telephone if&#xD;
      lumbar spine surgery was performed or not. This was done six months after the intervention&#xD;
      was completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive and analytical statistics are used to present the results.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention consisted of group activities which were performed in one group, as lectures, demonstrations, and Zhineng Qigong training, all planned and led by European Zhineng Qigong.&#xD;
The group activities were performed during four weekends (12 hours each) and weekly training two times per week (each for two hours). Introductory lecture (two hours) was given at the evening before the first weekend. The respondents were recommended daily Zhineng Qigong training with help of an instructional training CD.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Lumbar spine or other major surgery planned before, during, or within 1 month after&#xD;
