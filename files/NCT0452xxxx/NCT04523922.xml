  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the proposed Stage II study is to examine the efficacy of oxytocin&#xD;
      (OT) as compared to placebo in reducing (1) alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptoms, and (2)&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among Veterans receiving COPE therapy&#xD;
      (Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and Substance Use Disorders using Prolonged Exposure). To&#xD;
      evaluate purported neurobiological mechanisms of change, we will employ functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) at pre- and post-treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently co-occur and&#xD;
      are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures. Military&#xD;
      Veterans are at increased risk for co-occurring AUD and PTSD, with prevalence rates 2-4 times&#xD;
      higher than the general population. Our group developed an integrated intervention entitled&#xD;
      Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and Substance Use Disorders using Prolonged Exposure (COPE).&#xD;
      COPE incorporates empirically validated cognitive-behavioral techniques for AUD with&#xD;
      Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy for PTSD. Several randomized controlled trials among Veterans&#xD;
      and civilians demonstrate efficacy of COPE in significantly reducing AUD and PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
      Despite the positive findings, there remains substantial room for improving treatment&#xD;
      outcomes and enhancing retention. Accumulating data suggest that the neuropeptide oxytocin&#xD;
      (OT) is a promising candidate to enhance psychosocial interventions for co-occurring AUD and&#xD;
      PTSD, as OT targets neurobiological and behavioral dysregulation common to both disorders.&#xD;
      Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate the ability of OT to ameliorate a variety of&#xD;
      alcohol-related behaviors (e.g., craving, withdrawal symptoms, tolerance, ethanol&#xD;
      self-administration), enhance fear extinction, and promote prosocial behaviors associated&#xD;
      with successful psychosocial treatment outcomes. In a randomized controlled pilot study, our&#xD;
      group found that OT administration prior to weekly Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy sessions&#xD;
      was safe, well-tolerated, and resulted in accelerated reduction in PTSD symptoms as compared&#xD;
      to placebo. Although the empirical and theoretical support for augmenting psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions such as COPE with OT is robust, no studies to date have examined this combined&#xD;
      approach. The primary objective of the proposed Stage II study is to examine the efficacy of&#xD;
      OT as compared to placebo in reducing (1) AUD symptoms, and (2) PTSD symptoms among Veterans&#xD;
      (50% women) receiving COPE therapy. To accomplish this, we will employ a manualized,&#xD;
      evidence-based, cognitive-behavioral intervention (COPE); a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study design; and standardized, repeated dependent measures of clinical&#xD;
      outcomes at multiple time points. In addition, to investigate neurobiological mechanisms of&#xD;
      change, we will employ functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at pre-and post-treatment&#xD;
      .&#xD;
