    <textblock>
      This randomized, single-blind, active-controlled trial will assess humoral immune responses&#xD;
      to a single dose of 2019-20 recombinant hemagglutinin quadrivalent influenza vaccines (RIV4)&#xD;
      compared with standard egg-based unadjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccines (IIV4) among&#xD;
      healthcare personnel (HCP) vaccinated during the previous 2018-19 season with IIV4. The trial&#xD;
      will be conducted at two hospital sites in Israel during the 2019-20 influenza season among&#xD;
      HCP who were enrolled in the Study of Healthcare Personnel with Influenza and other&#xD;
      Respiratory Viruses in Israel (SHIRI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-blind study design. Starting in July 2019, approximately 550 to&#xD;
      700 HCP from two hospitals (275-350 per hospital site) in Israel will be enrolled. Following&#xD;
      completion of a written consent form, participants will complete an enrollment survey and&#xD;
      grant permission for review of information collected during the SHIRI study, including&#xD;
      vaccination status and immune response during the SHIRI study years. Participants will&#xD;
      complete an enrollment survey and grant permission to include and integrate information&#xD;
      collected during the SHIRI study into the current study's data, including health history,&#xD;
      influenza vaccination history, and immune response to vaccination during the SHIRI study&#xD;
      years. HCP will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a single dose of IIV4 licensed in Israel&#xD;
      (expected to be Vaxigrip® Quadrivalent, 15µg of HA per strain) or RIV4 (Flublok® Quadrivalent&#xD;
      by Sanofi Pasteur, 45µg of HA per strain) during August-October of 2019. Participants will be&#xD;
      blinded to the vaccine that they vaccine, but study staff will be aware of the vaccine.&#xD;
      Adverse events following vaccination will be monitored and documented. Blood specimens will&#xD;
      be collected prior to vaccination and approximately 28 days after to evaluate immune&#xD;
      responses to vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible HCP who were already vaccinated with Vaxigrip, the vaccine that is routinely&#xD;
      available in Israel, at the time they are approached to join the study, will be invited to&#xD;
      join the study as part of the Vaxigrip arm. Like randomized participants, participants who&#xD;
      were vaccinated with Vaxigrip outside the study will complete a written consent form, an&#xD;
      enrollment survey and grant permission for review of information collected during the SHIRI&#xD;
      study, including vaccination status and immune response during the SHIRI study years. As part&#xD;
      of the consent form, participants will record the estimated date that they received the&#xD;
      vaccine, and the location, and will authorize study staff to verify the date of current-year&#xD;
      Vaxigrip vaccination in the Clalit EMR and with the hospital vaccination staff. Participants&#xD;
      will complete an enrollment survey and grant permission to include and integrate information&#xD;
      collected during the SHIRI study into the current study's data, including health history,&#xD;
      influenza vaccination history, and immune response to vaccination during the SHIRI study&#xD;
      years. Blood specimens will be collected approximately 28 days after to evaluate immune&#xD;
      responses to vaccination.&#xD;
