  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study addresses the issue about post-surgical recovery process, for patients&#xD;
      arthroscopically treated for rotator-cuff tear. The aim of the research is to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a new rehabilitation protocol that includes kinematic biofeedback with the&#xD;
      motion analysis system ISEO.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research includes at least 62 patients arthroscopically treated for the rotator cuff&#xD;
      tear. For this purpose, two groups of patients of equal size are identified. The attribution&#xD;
      of each patient to one of the two groups is random. The standard rehabilitation protocol is&#xD;
      applied to the Control group (Group A), whereas the standard rehabilitation protocol&#xD;
      integrated by proprioception exercises (physical therapist assisted) performed with ISEO is&#xD;
      applied to the Experimental group (Group B). The primary objective is to verify if the ISEO&#xD;
      system, used as a biofeedback tool, improves shoulder functionality and activity of patients&#xD;
      arthroscopically treated for rotator cuff tear, both in the short (90 days from surgery) and&#xD;
      in the medium term (6-12 months from surgery). All patients are longitudinally evaluated from&#xD;
      the pre-surgery to a 6/12 months follow-up. Each evaluation includes both a clinical and an&#xD;
      instrumented assessment of shoulder kinematics. The primary outcome tested is the&#xD;
      Scapula-Weighted Constant-Murley Score, which represents a reformulation of the&#xD;
      Constant-Murley Score, which is modified based on the quality of the scapular movement&#xD;
      measured with ISEO.&#xD;
