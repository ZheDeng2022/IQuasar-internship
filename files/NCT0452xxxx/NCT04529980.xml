      To determine the effectiveness of the use of probiotics in patients with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      complicated appendicitis on antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD). Probiotics are defined as&#xD;
      live microbial organisms that when administered in sufficient amounts, can provide a&#xD;
      protective benefit to the individual patient. The use of probiotics in a pediatric population&#xD;
      exposed to antibiotics and gastrointestinal surgery such as an appendectomy may provide a&#xD;
      protective effect and prevent antibiotic associated diarrhea (ADD)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Appendicitis is the most common urgent surgical procedure performed on children.&#xD;
      Approximately one third of the population end up having complicated appendicitis with&#xD;
      evidence of peritoneal contamination and infection or abscess requiring the use of IV&#xD;
      antibiotics and prolonged hospital stay. Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea (AAD) is a common&#xD;
      complication seen in both outpatient and inpatient settings in approximately a third of all&#xD;
      patients treated with antibiotics (Mantegazza, et al., 2018). In particular, pediatric&#xD;
      patients experience ADD 11-62% of the time and can up upwards to 80% in hospitalized toddlers&#xD;
      (Mantegazza, et al., 2018). Current literature defines AAD as three or more liquid stools per&#xD;
      day. The causes of AAD are often related to the use of multiple antibiotics, prolonged&#xD;
      hospital stay and gastrointestinal surgery. Antibiotics often disturb the normal enteric&#xD;
      microbiome in the gut and allow for an increased growth of pathogens (Hojsak, 2017). AAD can&#xD;
      occur as late as six to eight weeks after antibiotic exposure. Lactobacillus rhanmosus&#xD;
      GG(LGG®)(Culturelle) is an over the counter dietary supplement that can help to restore the&#xD;
      balance in the gut by promoting colonization to support better digestion and immune&#xD;
      health.This study does not intend to investigate route of administration, dose, patient&#xD;
      population, or other factor that significantly increases the risk (or decreases the&#xD;
      acceptability of the risk) associated with the use of the dietary supplement.At Children's&#xD;
      Medical Center, the investigators see over 1000 cases of appendicitis a year with&#xD;
      approximately 1/3 of those patients being complicated appendicitis. For those requiring&#xD;
      immediate appendectomy, the typical course of treatment include surgery, admission to the&#xD;
      hospital for 3 to 5 days, administration of IV antibiotics while in hospital, and discharge&#xD;
      orders for oral antibiotics to complete their treatment. The investigators propose to perform&#xD;
      a randomized controlled trial where one group of patients will receive probiotic therapy and&#xD;
      another group of patients does not. The investigators hypothesize patients given probiotics&#xD;
      after a diagnosis of complicated appendicitis with immediate appendectomy who receive&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment during their inpatient stay will decrease the overall length of stay&#xD;
      (LOS) by 25% vs the LOS in those patients who do not receive probiotics.&#xD;
