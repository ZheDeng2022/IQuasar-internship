      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of lidocaine 2.5%/prilocaine 2.5%&#xD;
      cream versus lidocaine 23%/tetracaine 7% ointment for topical anesthesia prior to a&#xD;
      nonablative laser procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lidocaine 23% / tetracaine 7% ointment and lidocaine 2.5%/ prilocaine 2.5% cream are both&#xD;
      topical anesthetics that are used commonly to locally anesthetize the skin prior to laser&#xD;
      procedures. With the increased use of powerful lasers for medical and cosmetic purposes,&#xD;
      adequate pain control is necessary. This study will compare the efficacy of lidocaine 23% /&#xD;
      tetracaine 7% ointment and lidocaine 2.5%/ prilocaine 2.5% cream in reducing self-reported&#xD;
      pain after laser treatment. It will also aim to determine the amount of redness, burning and&#xD;
      itching a patient experiences with each cream, and if any symptoms of lidocaine toxicity are&#xD;
      experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the procedure, we will randomly assign half of the face to be applied with 2.5 g of&#xD;
      lidocaine 23% / tetracaine 7% ointment without occlusion and the other half of the face with&#xD;
      7.5 g lidocaine 2.5%/ prilocaine 2.5% cream with occlusion. After 60 minutes we will remove&#xD;
      the creams with soap and water. Next, the patient will be treated with a fractional thulium&#xD;
      fiber laser with a fluence of 20 millijoules and treatment level of 7-11. Standard post&#xD;
      procedure instructions will be given, and surveys on symptoms and pain will be completed by&#xD;
      both patient and investigator.&#xD;
