  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to prospectively investigate the incidence of hypothyroidism after&#xD;
      postoperative radiotherapy and identify risk factors for development of hypothyroidism.&#xD;
      Patients with breast cancer treated with surgery followed by radiotherapy is enrolled.&#xD;
      Thyroid function was assessed at baseline and different times after radiotherapy. The&#xD;
      radiation technique, thyroid dose parameters and hypothyroidism are prospective evaluated,&#xD;
      and the dose-effect relationship is analyzed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy after surgery are prospectively enrolled.&#xD;
      Thyroid function is evaluated mainly by the measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),&#xD;
      free triiodo-thyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4). Thyroid function is regularly assessed&#xD;
      before and after radiotherapy. The radiation technique and thyroid dose parameters are&#xD;
      assessed. Development of subclinical or biochemical hypothyroidism is noted. The incidence&#xD;
      and risk factors of hypothyroidism is analyzed. The dose-volume constraints that correlate&#xD;
      with functional impairment of the thyroid in breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy&#xD;
      is discussed.&#xD;
