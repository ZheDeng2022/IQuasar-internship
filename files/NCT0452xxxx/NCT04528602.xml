  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of diaper change position on neonatal&#xD;
      comfort and heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation in preterm infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was planned as a randomized controlled prospective trial until reaching the entire&#xD;
      sample group specified in the Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) in a private hospital that&#xD;
      has other branches in Istanbul.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the data collection process, two methods will be applied to preterm infants during&#xD;
      diaper change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group of the study, diaper change will be performed after the legs of the&#xD;
      babies are brought to extension, and in the experimental group, the diaper change will be&#xD;
      performed after the legs of the babies are brought closer to the abdomen by maintaining their&#xD;
      flexion. Data on the babies' heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and comfort&#xD;
      level will be collected using the Premature Infant Comfort Scale before, during, immediately&#xD;
      after and 3 minutes after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will collect the data by using a form that questions individual&#xD;
      characteristics and includes records of heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation&#xD;
      and Premature Infant Comfort.&#xD;

    <description>Premature Infant Comfort Scale (PICS), which is a multidimensional scale used in evaluating comfort and pain behaviorally and psychologically. The PICS evaluates seven parameters as Alertness, Calmness/Agitation, Respiratory Status (only on mechanic ventilation support) or Crying (not evaluated because it is scored in children with spontaneous breathing), Physical Movements, Muscle Tone, Facial Gestures and Mean Heart Rate. It is a five-point likert scale in which each element is scored from one to five (from bad to good). According to the PICS, the infant's comfort is evaluated over the total score. Accordingly, 35 points signify the lowest comfort score, while seven points signify the highest comfort score. High score obtained from the scale signifies that the comfort level is low. If the total score is ≥17, this is the cut-off value of the scale. It was found that the Turkish version was a valid and reliable.</description>

    <description>Common procedure steps -Legal representatives of the infants will sign an informed consent form. Materials (soap, napkin, non-sterile gloves, diaper, wet cotton towels for newborns, waste container, diaper change mat) will be prepared.&#xD;
Hands will be washed and gloves will be worn. Tapes of the infant's dirty diaper will be opened.&#xD;
For the Control Group&#xD;
-The infant will be grasped on the legs, the legs will be given extension position and lifted up.&#xD;
The dirty diaper will be folded in two and the perineum area will be wiped with a wet cotton towel from the front to the back.&#xD;
The infant's feet will be freed. The dirty diaper will be removed and thrown into the general waste bin. The used gloves will be removed.&#xD;
The infant's legs will be given in extension position and a clean diaper will be placed under them.&#xD;
Tapes of the clean diaper will be fastened. Hands will be washed after the procedure Data will be collected before, during, after and 3 minutes after application.</description>

    <description>Procedure steps for the Experimental Group&#xD;
Common procedure steps&#xD;
The infant will be grasped on the legs; the legs will be kept in the flexion position and approached toward the abdomen.&#xD;
The dirty diaper will be folded in two and the perineum area will be wiped with a wet cotton towel from the front to the back.&#xD;
