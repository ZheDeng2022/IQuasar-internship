  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to determine the patients' perception and motivation to obtain additional&#xD;
      information on their preimplantation embryos' risks of polygenic disorders. Patients&#xD;
      undergoing IVF and genetic testing on their embryos for aneuploidies will be given the option&#xD;
      to obtain information of their embryos' polygenic disease risk after receiving genetic&#xD;
      counseling.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients planning to use PGT-A and who meet the inclusion criteria will be offered&#xD;
      participation by their IVF physician prior to initiating cycle stimulation. Eligible and&#xD;
      interested patients will be contacted, counseled and consented for participation in the study&#xD;
      by a Genetic Counselor at Genomic Prediction Clinical Laboratory. This will include genetic&#xD;
      counseling to address the benefits and limitations of PGT-A and PGT-P, the family history of&#xD;
      diseases currently tested under PGT-P, what diseases they may be interested in testing, the&#xD;
      process of obtaining saliva samples, and the information provided by PGT-P results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 500 patients will complete the study and may be recruited from any IVF clinic in&#xD;
      the United States. After being enrolled in the study, patients will have two options. One&#xD;
      option is to receive PGT-A results first and then decide if they wish to receive the PGT-P&#xD;
      results. A second option is to receive a single comprehensive report. All patients will&#xD;
      receive a report indicating the predicted karyotype of each embryo (PGT-A) and, according to&#xD;
      which option they elected, may also receive a report on any or all of the following elected&#xD;
      diseases: Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes, Coronary Artery Disease, Heart Attack,&#xD;
      Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Testicular Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Malignant Melanoma,&#xD;
      Breast Cancer, Basal Cell Carcinoma. Furthermore, a genetic ancestry test will be performed&#xD;
      on each submitted saliva sample to determine potential PGT-P performance and which disease&#xD;
      predictors can be computed based on the patients ethnic background.&#xD;
