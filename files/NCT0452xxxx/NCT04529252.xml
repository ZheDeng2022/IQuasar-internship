    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a repository for cerebellar ataxia and nucleotide&#xD;
      repeat diseases in order to fully investigate the genetic and phenotypic presentations of&#xD;
      both.&#xD;

      The investigators are initiating a new program dedicated to the research and study of&#xD;
      neurodegenerative forms of spinocerebellar ataxia as well and other nucleotide repeat&#xD;
      diseases with the exclusion of Huntington's Disease. The analysis will be conducted to&#xD;
      provide better clinical, genetic, and pathological characterizations of neurodegenerative&#xD;
      forms of spinocerebellar ataxia. The investigators would like to create a repository for&#xD;
      samples on these cases as well as prospective cases who are seen via clinic, support groups,&#xD;
      referrals etc. The investigators will perform clinical evaluations utilizing ataxia pertinent&#xD;
      scales. The investigators project to expand the present genealogical bank by collecting more&#xD;
      specimens and identify more families in the process. All this will be performed in&#xD;
      collaboration with basic scientists in order to conduct proper laboratory investigation that&#xD;
      will help arrive at a cure for neurodegenerative forms of spinocerebellar ataxia and&#xD;
      nucleotide repeat diseases excluding Huntington's Disease .&#xD;

      -  Blood draw, we will be collecting up to 100mL (about 7 tablespoons) during the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine, up to 20 mL of urine will be collected upon proper consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool sample can be collected upon consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 25 ml (about 5 teaspoons) of CSF will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsy will be obtained using 3 mm skin punch. We will only collect one sample on&#xD;
           the patient, but would like to collect an additional skin biopsy on research subjects if&#xD;
           the sample is not viable due to technical issues (possible contamination) or because of&#xD;
           lack of growth of fibroblasts or there is a need to obtain another sample in the future&#xD;
           to assess the progression of the disease.&#xD;

        Participants will be identified through investigator's clinical practice and their&#xD;
        relatives, health fairs, as well as support groups. Controls will be recruited from&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females over the age of 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We acknowledge that some participants may be unable to consent due to underlying&#xD;
             medical conditions; an eligible proxy may provide the informed consent and provide a&#xD;
             signature on the designated line.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a clinical diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia and other nucleotide&#xD;
             repeat diseases (not including Huntington's Disease) with or without a genetic&#xD;
             mutation and unaffected family members (grandparents, parents, brothers, sisters,&#xD;
             cousins, uncles and aunts) who may or may not carry a genetic mutation for the&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Spouses and caregivers of patients with spinocerebellar ataxia and nucleotide repeat&#xD;
             diseases (not including Huntington's Disease) may serve as controls in the study.&#xD;

          -  Allergy to study-related materials including lidocaine or iodine. We will make all&#xD;
             efforts to utilize alternative means when obtaining specimens (i.e. using rubbing&#xD;
             alcohol and obtaining blood samples instead of skin biopsies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential subjects will not be excluded based on being minorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant subjects will not be included in the study.&#xD;
