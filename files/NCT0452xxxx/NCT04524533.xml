  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to test whether a smoking cessation&#xD;
      induction intervention delivered during a dental cleaning appointment increases the&#xD;
      utilization of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for smoking cessation within 7 months&#xD;
      post-dental cleaning appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 400 cigarette smokers who are scheduled for a dental cleaning appointment at&#xD;
      the Boston University Goldman School of Dental Medicine (BUGSDM) patient treatment center&#xD;
      will be recruited and enrolled. Participants will be randomized to either the intervention or&#xD;
      control group&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 400 patients who have a scheduled prophylaxis, root planing and scaling dental&#xD;
      appointment at the BUGSDM patient treatment center will be recruited and enrolled in the&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. Participants who complete the baseline survey will be randomized&#xD;
      to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group will watch one of two&#xD;
      smoking cessation videos during the appointment (depending on readiness to quit), receive a&#xD;
      brochure about EBTs for smoking cessation, and participate in a 4-week tailored text message&#xD;
      program designed to motivate EBT utilization. After the 4-week text message program, the&#xD;
      intervention group will receive monthly assessment text messages for six months. The control&#xD;
      group will watch a control video during the appointment, receive the same brochure about EBTs&#xD;
      as the intervention group, and participate in an assessment-only 4-week text message program.&#xD;
      All videos are approximately 10 minutes long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the dental clinic appointment, all participants will complete an online questionnaire&#xD;
      and begin the 4-week text message program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 4-week text message program, and 3 and 6 months later, all participants&#xD;
      will complete online questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1: To test the efficacy of the intervention vs. control in increasing utilization&#xD;
      of EBTs over the course of follow-up (7-months). Hypothesis 1.1: Smokers randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention will be more likely to engage with (contact) EBTs. Hypothesis 1.2: Smokers&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention will have greater treatment utilization (e.g., more days in&#xD;
      the text message program, more days using smoking cessation medication, and more quitline&#xD;
      counseling sessions, greater number of EBTs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To test the effect of the intervention vs. controls on quit attempts and on motivation&#xD;
      to quit. Hypothesis 2: Smokers randomized to the intervention will have more quit attempts&#xD;
      and higher motivation to quit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To test the efficacy of the intervention vs controls on biochemically verified&#xD;
      abstinence. Hypothesis 3: Smokers randomized to the intervention will have higher quit rates&#xD;
      at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To assess the mechanisms through which the intervention effects occur (social&#xD;
      cognitive mediators) and to identify subpopulations for whom intervention effects differ&#xD;
      (moderators, e.g., readiness to quit, gender, race/ethnicity). Hypothesis 4: The intervention&#xD;
      will directly affect the putative mediators, which will in turn affect EBT utilization. The&#xD;
      role of moderators will be exploratory.&#xD;
