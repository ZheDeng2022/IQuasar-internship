    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyze the therapeutic effect of postoperative adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy with FOLFOX4 after hepatocarcinoma resection based on folate receptor-positive&#xD;
      circulating tumor cells. Patients receiving curative resection (R0) were randomized to&#xD;
      postoperative FOLFOX4 group and no FOLFOX4 group. The time to recurrence, the overall&#xD;
      survival as well as the incidence of complications after therapy was observed to confirm the&#xD;
      role of postoperative adjuvant therapy of FOLFOX4.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer death globally.&#xD;
      Hepatectomy remains the most widely practiced radical treatment for HCC despite having a high&#xD;
      associated recurrence rate, approximately 70% at 5 years after surgery, which often hampers&#xD;
      further improvement in survival for these patients. And until now although a lot of different&#xD;
      adjuvant therapies had been tried in the clinic, but their role in preventing recurrence&#xD;
      remain controversial. As a research of a phase â…¢ randomize study showed that FOLFOX4&#xD;
      (infusional fluorouracil [FU], leucovorin[LV], and OXA) served as palliative chemotherapy can&#xD;
      induce higher overall survival, progression-free survival and response rate comparing to&#xD;
      doxorubicin in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma from Asia. The safety data was&#xD;
      also acceptable. The chemotherapy of FOLFOX has been accepted by many guidelines and&#xD;
      recommended for systematic treatment of advanced HCC. However, the effect of this systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy for recurrent HCC after partial hepatectomy remains to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating tumor cells (CTC) have played an important role in early diagnosis of tumors,&#xD;
      monitoring of recurrence and metastasis, judgment of patient prognosis, and guidance of&#xD;
      postoperative adjuvant treatment. CTC counts can be used to assist diagnosis and evaluation&#xD;
      of postoperative prognosis. Previous studies have also shown that folate receptors (FR) are&#xD;
      highly expressed in HCC. The detection of circulating tumor cells based on folate receptor&#xD;
      (FR+CTC) has been proved to be a sensitive and effective method for detecting CTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with HCC who received curative liver resection and with the preoperative FR+CTC&#xD;
      level higher than 18.4FU/3mL were randomly assigned 1:1 by the doctors to receive&#xD;
      placebo(control group) or FOLFOX4 (treatment group). All patients in the treatment group&#xD;
      received FOLFOX4 at most 12 cycles beginning from the 4th week after liver resection. The&#xD;
      outcomes of patients were evaluated during the 3-years follow up.&#xD;
