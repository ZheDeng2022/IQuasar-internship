  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oesophageal stricture is a commonly encountered clinical problem, especially in&#xD;
      gastroenterology. It occurs due to narrowing of oesophagus, which results in swallowing&#xD;
      difficulty. Oesophageal stricture has two major types: benign and malignant. Malignant type&#xD;
      results from carcinoma but benign type has different causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amongst benign aetiologies, gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD), peptic injury,&#xD;
      oesophageal webs, radiation damage, caustic swallowing and anastomotic strictures are most&#xD;
      common. Corrosive intake is an important public health issue in developed countries and its&#xD;
      incidence is still increasing in developing countries. The problem is largely unreported and&#xD;
      its exact prevalence cannot be figured out due to the insufficient reporting or personal&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corrosives materials can damage the bodies' tissues, as they come in contact with them. They&#xD;
      are usually utilised to clean metals. It can cause severe health hazard, if swallowed&#xD;
      accidentally or intentionally. Epidemiological studies have documented corrosive intake as&#xD;
      the third most common cause of poisoning in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common symptom of oesophageal stricture is progressive dysphagia to solids followed&#xD;
      by inability to tolerate liquids. These strictures are diagnosed most commonly by using&#xD;
      barium swallow, endoscopy and biopsy. Endoscopic dilatation is the most applicable method to&#xD;
      treat oesophageal strictures, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are also used to inhibit acid&#xD;
      production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Kochman criteria, refractory or recurrent strictures are defined as an&#xD;
      anatomic restriction because of a cicatricial luminal compromise or fibrosis resulting in&#xD;
      clinical symptoms of dysphagia in the absence of endoscopic evidence of inflammation. This&#xD;
      may occur as the result of either an inability to successfully remediate the anatomic problem&#xD;
      to a diameter of at least 14 mm over five sessions at two-week intervals (refractory); or as&#xD;
      a result of an inability to maintain a satisfactory luminal diameter for four weeks once the&#xD;
      target diameter of 14 mm has been achieved (recurrent). This definition is not meant to&#xD;
      include patients with an inflammatory stricture (which will not resolve until the&#xD;
      inflammation subsides), or those with a satisfactory diameter but having dysphagia on the&#xD;
      basis of neuromuscular dysfunction (for example those with dysphagia due to postoperative&#xD;
      and/or postradiation therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal rehabilitation has been carried out for many years with different techniques,&#xD;
      depending on the experience of each physician, esophageal prostheses or splints, dilations&#xD;
      with balloons or Savary-Gilliard plugs, Hurst dilators, etc., have been used, but in reality,&#xD;
      there is no worldwide standardization for the management of these patients and even less so&#xD;
      for the use of certain substances such as triamcinolone acetonide applied intralesionally, or&#xD;
      more recently, topical mitomycin C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triamcinolone acetonide is a synthetic corticosteroid with a preventive effect on collagen&#xD;
      synthesis, fibrosis, and chronic cicatrization that has been used for many years, applied in&#xD;
      intralesional injection after esophageal dilations for the purpose of delaying cicatrization&#xD;
      and thus reducing the number of dilations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently, through many studies, it has been concluded that intralesional corticosteroid&#xD;
      injections can be added to standard treatment for corrosive oesophageal stricture.&#xD;
      International literature exhibited that intralesional steroid injections help in increasing&#xD;
      the diameter because of its anti-inflammatory action.&#xD;
