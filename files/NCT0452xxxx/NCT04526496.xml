    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase I, single-dose escalation and multiple-dose escalation&#xD;
      clinical trial for FTP-198 conducted in Australian healthy volunteers. The safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of FTP-198 suspension in healthy volunteers will be&#xD;
      evaluated using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial design.&#xD;
