  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Low physical activity and poor eating habits (incl. high fat and carbohydrates&#xD;
      but low fiber intake) are the main reason of obesity epidemic in western societies. The most&#xD;
      common clinical complication of this condition is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),&#xD;
      that can lead to liver cirrhosis and its complications. Recent studies show that gut&#xD;
      dysbiosis may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. On the other hand plant fiber&#xD;
      shows beneficial properties in remodeling of the gut microbiome. Aim: The project aims to&#xD;
      create low-calorie bars / snacks with an increased fiber content (12 g/bar), replacing the&#xD;
      second breakfast and/or afternoon tea. The main scientific aim is to examine the influence of&#xD;
      the extra supply of fiber on i. gut microbiota composition and metabolism and ii. liver&#xD;
      function in patients with NAFLD. Methods: Randomized placebo-controlled double blind study. A&#xD;
      group of patients diagnosed with NAFLD, divided into 2 groups: study (12% fiber bar) and&#xD;
      placebo (maltodextrin bar). Two study phases: preliminary study (5 weeks, 20 patients) and&#xD;
      main study (24 weeks, 120 patients). Both clinical and laboratory (stool and serum) aspects&#xD;
      will be analyzed, incl. anthropometric measurements, nutrition tests (food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire), health-related quality of life, liver ultrasound and elastography, serum and&#xD;
      stool biochemistry and microbiome analysis.&#xD;

      Background: High percentage of the Polish suffer from overweight and obesity. According to&#xD;
      previous report prepared for the government, the percentage of overweight and obese people in&#xD;
      Poland was 36.6% and 16.7% respectively, which constitutes 53.3% of the adult population in&#xD;
      Poland. This state that body mass of a statistical -adult inhabitant of Poland is over the&#xD;
      average one, calculated for 28 countries of the European Union. It was assumed that 25% of&#xD;
      individuals aged ≥15 years in 2015 experienced NAFLD in France, Germany, Spain and the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity results from unhealthy lifestyle - too high calorie intake, too little physical&#xD;
      activity and low fiber content in the diet. The most common clinical complication of&#xD;
      overweight and obesity is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In the United States,&#xD;
      20-30% of adults suffer from NAFLD, while in the European adult population the percentage&#xD;
      varies 14-21%. In addition, 30-50% of diabetics and 93% of people with hyperlipidemia suffer&#xD;
      from NAFLD. The incidence of NAFLD increases with age (the disease is diagnosed between 40-65&#xD;
      years of age predominantly), and is sex-dependent - males suffer from this disease most often&#xD;
      compared to women. NAFLD incidence within obese patients (BMI≥30) was found to be equal to&#xD;
      78%. The NAFLD risk factors include: obesity, environmental factors (low physical activity,&#xD;
      fructose in the diet) changes in the intestinal microbiome (induced by eg. too low fiber&#xD;
      supply) epigenetic factors, insulin resistance and genetic factors So far, there is no&#xD;
      effective drug that can be effective in NAFLD therapy. Current treatments include changes in&#xD;
      eating habits (proper composition of meals) leading to weight loss and thus remodeling the&#xD;
      gut microbiome, as well as adequate physical activity. One of ingredients with beneficial&#xD;
      effects for liver structure and function (liver cells - hepatocytes) is fiber. Plant fiber is&#xD;
      a key component of the diet, preferably regulating metabolic processes and maintaining a&#xD;
      healthy body. This is because the plant fiber acts as a nutrient for the intestinal flora&#xD;
      (microbiota) and it &quot;travels&quot; through the intestine, ensuring its good peristalsis and proper&#xD;
      stool formation. Undigested plant fiber including xylan polysaccharides, pectin,&#xD;
      arabinose-containing carbohydrates as vegetable pectins, cellulose, hemicellulose, resistant&#xD;
      starch reach unchanged into the colon, where they are metabolized by intestinal&#xD;
      microorganisms. The fiber serves as substrate for the synthesis of short-chain fatty acids&#xD;
      (SCFAs): propionate, acetate and butyrate. Especially the latter one - butyric acid&#xD;
      (butyrate) is considered as a potential therapeutic agent in NAFLD. Butyrate can be treated&#xD;
      exceptionally because of its high biological activity, which includes modulations of&#xD;
      epigenetic functions (butyrate is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor), energy functions&#xD;
      (70% ATP synthesis takes place in colonocytes) and functions as a G protein-coupled receptor&#xD;
      activator (GPCR). Consequently, the content of prebiotic vegetable fiber in the diet controls&#xD;
      the productions of butyrate. It was shown that already after 24 hours since higher fiber&#xD;
      supply (&gt; 30g per day), the diversity of the microbiota was higher and the SCFAs synthesis&#xD;
      increased. Meanwhile, the amount of fiber consumed in industrialized countries is very low.&#xD;
      It was estimated that adults in the US provide an average of 12-18 grams of dietary fiber per&#xD;
      day. In Europe the fiber intake varies between 16-29 g/day. At the same time in African&#xD;
      communities (Burkina Faso, Tanzania) dietary fiber intake is high providing balance within&#xD;
      microbial milieu within the gut, thus greater SCFA synthesis and lower titre of inflammatory&#xD;
      factors. In comparison, in Poland the average consumption of fiber in adults is 19 - 34 g /&#xD;
      day for men and 19 - 20 g / day for women. On the other hand most of the Nutritional&#xD;
      Societies in the world recommend fiber intake not less than 25 g / day for women and 38 g /&#xD;
      day for men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of inappropriate diet incl. low fiber intake obese patients show disturbances in&#xD;
      the microbiota composition and metabolism, what results in dysfunction of intestinal barrier&#xD;
      and increases the influx of proinflammatory substances to the liver. In this way gut&#xD;
      dysbiosis may trigger and aggravate the liver injury in NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The project aims to create low-calorie bars / snacks with an increased fiber content&#xD;
      (12 g / bar), which would be a convenient and easy-to-eat snack replacing the second&#xD;
      breakfast and/or afternoon tea. The main scientific aim is to examine whether a simple&#xD;
      correction of the diet consisting of the extra supply of fiber in NAFLD patients will improve&#xD;
      the microbiome composition and metabolism (inc. fermentation and production of SCFA), will&#xD;
      support the intestinal barrier and eventually improve liver function.&#xD;
