  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The World Health Assembly resolution 68.15 identified surgical and anesthesia care&#xD;
      as core components of universal health coverage. However, about 5 billion people worldwide&#xD;
      lack access to essential surgical and anesthesia services. Of the 313 million procedures&#xD;
      undertaken each year only 6% occur in the poorest countries with an estimated 30% of all&#xD;
      deaths globally associated with common surgical conditions. Patient safety in low-resource&#xD;
      settings is hindered by severe workforce shortages, lack of essential resources, hierarchical&#xD;
      culture and few opportunities for professional development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-technical skills (NTS), such as communication, team working, and task coordination, are&#xD;
      vital to patient safety. Up to 70-80% of untoward events in health care are associated with&#xD;
      errors in NTS8. The Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills framework (ANTS) describes behaviour&#xD;
      markers for NTS in anesthesia. This framework has been found applicable in low-resource&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation-based education is widespread for NTS training in well-resourced countries.&#xD;
      Traditionally, high costs have prohibited this modality in low-resource settings.&#xD;
      Foundational work in Rwanda and at Dalhousie University has demonstrated that effective&#xD;
      training in ANTS can be achieved through simple low-cost simulation. The Vital Anaesthesia&#xD;
      Simulation Training (VAST) Course is a three-day simulation-based program designed de-novo to&#xD;
      focus on core clinical practices and NTS that promote safe perioperative care in low-resource&#xD;
      settings. The course uses low-cost materials in an immersive simulated environment to&#xD;
      replicate common cases managed in district hospitals in low-resource settings. Realism is&#xD;
      created with simple mannequins, iPads with the SimMon App functioning as monitoring, basic&#xD;
      props (e.g., airway equipment, syringes, drapes), photographs of pathology, and briefing&#xD;
      cards for scenario role-play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To assess the impact of the VAST Course on ANTS and explore factors that influence&#xD;
      long-term retention of ANTS amongst anesthesia providers in a low-resource setting.&#xD;
