  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) refers to a group of permanent disorders that occur in the brain of the&#xD;
      fetus or infant, which are non-progressive, cause movement and posture disorder along with&#xD;
      activity limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The upper extremity is frequently affected in patients with CP. The prevalence of upper&#xD;
      extremity involvement has been reported between 60-83% in different studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality applications have been increasing recently in the field of neurological&#xD;
      rehabilitation. In this study, researchers aimed to investigate the effectiveness of virtual&#xD;
      reality-mediated upper extremity rehabilitation in patients with hemiplegic cerebral palsy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a group of permanent disorders of movement and posture development due&#xD;
      to non-progressive damage to the developing fetal or infant brain, causing activity&#xD;
      limitation. Motor disorders in CP are mostly accompanied by sensory and perceptual problems,&#xD;
      cognitive disorders, communicative and perceptual problems, epilepsy and secondary&#xD;
      musculoskeletal problems. CP is one of the most common causes of disability in childhood.&#xD;
      Brain damage that causes CP can occur in the prenatal, perinatal or postnatal period.&#xD;
      Accompanying epilepsy, cognitive disorders, learning impairment, communication problems,&#xD;
      perception limitation, behavioral problems, visual disturbances, hearing disorders, oral&#xD;
      motor function problems, dysphagia, constipation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, dental&#xD;
      problems, urinary symptoms, osteoporosis can be seen in patients with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technologies that are developing in rehabilitation are increasingly being used. Among these&#xD;
      technologies, the use of virtual reality by trained physiatrists and physiotherapists&#xD;
      provides an environment where children with cerebral palsy can exercise. In addition to&#xD;
      intense exercise, simultaneous visual and auditory feedback can be received. Virtual reality&#xD;
      can also provide a comparison between the degree of movement children perform in the real&#xD;
      world and the degree of movements they observe in the virtual environment. All these features&#xD;
      make virtual reality a potentially viable tool for improving the motor skills of children&#xD;
      with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality-based rehabilitation is an emerging treatment modality for the motor&#xD;
      rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy. Neuroplasticity studies have shown that&#xD;
      neurological development is positively associated with active participation and motivation&#xD;
      during virtual reality-based rehabilitation intervention. In addition to motivation, virtual&#xD;
      therapy also improves neural reorganization that optimizes rehabilitation outcomes in&#xD;
      children with cerebral palsy. The virtual scenario seems to encourage motor learning, the&#xD;
      retention of learned skills, and the transfer of skills to real-world situations. In many&#xD;
      studies, improvement in posture, balance, upper extremity functions, joint control and&#xD;
      walking has been detected with virtual therapy. Increased 'biofeedbacks' in neuromotor&#xD;
      rehabilitation allowed therapists to methodologically design and control their intervention&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 patients with a diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy who applied to the Pediatric Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Unit of Istanbul University Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Department of Physical Medicine and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation, who meet the inclusion criteria will be included in this randomized,&#xD;
      controlled, single blind and prospectively planned study. At the beginning of the study, 40&#xD;
      hemiplegic CP patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized into two groups&#xD;
      according to the random order created by the computer program after being numbered according&#xD;
      to the order of application to Istanbul University, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Department&#xD;
      of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Pediatric Rehabilitation Unit. Upper extremity&#xD;
      rehabilitation (bimanually 3 days a week for 6 weeks and 45 minutes per session) and&#xD;
      physiotherapy (TG: Treatment Group) will be given to the first group accompanied by virtual&#xD;
      reality, and only physiotherapy (CG: Control Group) will be given to the second group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the power analysis was performed to calculate the number of patients and when the&#xD;
      results obtained from other studies were taken into account, it was concluded that at least&#xD;
      18 patients should be included in each group to obtain 0.95 power at 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
      Considering that few people will be excluded from the study during the study, it was found&#xD;
      appropriate to include 20 patients in each group and to start the study with a total of 40&#xD;
      people. Before starting the study, the patients will be informed about the study and their&#xD;
      consent will be obtained and demographic characteristics such as age, height and weight will&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and their parents will be informed in writing and verbally about the purpose,&#xD;
      duration and method of application of the research, and the &quot;Informed Consent Form&quot; will be&#xD;
      signed after their consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned to be carried out in a single center in the Department of Physical&#xD;
      Medicine and Rehabilitation of Istanbul University Istanbul Medical Faculty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The virtual reality technology to be used in the study has temporary side effects such as&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, and dizziness, and side effects to increase epileptic seizures. For this&#xD;
      reason, patients with uncontrolled epileptic seizures were excluded from the study. If&#xD;
      effects such as nausea, vomiting and dizziness develop during the intervention, the session&#xD;
      will be terminated and symptomatic treatment will be given.&#xD;
