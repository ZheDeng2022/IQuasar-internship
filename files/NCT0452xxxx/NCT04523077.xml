  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid disease is a common endocrine disorder. Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic&#xD;
      autoimmune disease that occurs on the oral mucosa in 1-2% of the general population.The&#xD;
      purpose of this study was to determine whether there is an association between thyroid&#xD;
      disease and oral planus lichen in the population of our patients. In the last few years, a&#xD;
      couple of studies have been published in the world literature that have studied the possible&#xD;
      association of these diagnoses in different populations. Most of the results showed a higher&#xD;
      prevalence of thyroid disease in the population of lichen patients, compared with patients&#xD;
      without lichen, although some results are contradictory. Some authors believe that the onset&#xD;
      of OLP precedes thyroid dysfunction. In the population of Croatian patients with lichen, no&#xD;
      research has been done to study the possible connection between these two diseases. The&#xD;
      obtained results could help clarify whether there is a connection between these two diagnoses&#xD;
      in the population of our lichen patients and enable earlier detection of patients with&#xD;
      thyroid hypofunction.&#xD;

        The study included female patients of the Department of Oral Medicine, age matched, with&#xD;
        oral lichen planus and without oral lichen planus or other immune disorders. All patients&#xD;
        included in the study made blood test and the results were analyzed with statistical&#xD;
        methods.&#xD;
