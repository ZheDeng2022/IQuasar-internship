  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how certain factors in childhood and adolescence&#xD;
      relate to neural vulnerabilities for obesity in young adulthood. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      specific individual and environmental factors will significantly predict neural&#xD;
      vulnerabilities for obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies aimed at elucidating neural vulnerability factors for obesity - including high food&#xD;
      reward sensitivity and poor food regulation - hold particular promise. However, relatively&#xD;
      little is known about the modifiable factors that contribute to these neural vulnerabilities,&#xD;
      thus precluding the development of potentially powerful interventions to promote healthy&#xD;
      long-term weight trajectories. Further, the limited research in this area lacks critical&#xD;
      developmental and environmental context. The current proposal addresses these gaps by&#xD;
      examining the roles of selected modifiable cognitive (executive control), behavioral (diet,&#xD;
      sleep), affective (negative affect), and environmental (obesogenic environment) factors&#xD;
      throughout childhood and adolescence in predicting emerging neural vulnerabilities for&#xD;
      obesity during the pivotal transition to young adulthood. The specific aims are to: 1)&#xD;
      Determine the impact of executive control development across childhood and adolescence on&#xD;
      food reward sensitivity and regulation in young adulthood; 2) Determine the impact of a set&#xD;
      of behavioral and affective factors in adolescence (i.e., diet, sleep, negative affect) on&#xD;
      food reward sensitivity and regulation in young adulthood; and 3) Explore the impact of the&#xD;
      obesogenic environment encountered in adolescence on food reward sensitivity and regulation&#xD;
      in young adulthood.&#xD;
