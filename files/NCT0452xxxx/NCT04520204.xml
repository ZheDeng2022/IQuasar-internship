    <textblock>
      National, multi-center, observational, prospective, and retrospective cohort study. The study&#xD;
      does not provide for intervention in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Obtaining real-world evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of AIM in Russian hospitals,&#xD;
      including both long- and short-term findings and outcomes (i.e. during hospitalization,&#xD;
&#xD;
      and 6-12 months after the diagnosis establishment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the applied approaches to the management of AIM patients for compliance&#xD;
           with the clinical recommendations across various hospitals, with a breakdown by&#xD;
           equipment status;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of patients' treatment adherence after 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected project duration is 3 years. The study subjects will be recruited during the&#xD;
      first 24 months unless the investigators decide to terminate or extend the study period. The&#xD;
      period of observation for each patient is 6 to 12 months. The project involves retrospective&#xD;
      and prospective collection of information from medical records. All patient data shall be&#xD;
      recorded by the Investigator into an approved electronic case report form (eCRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment period: 2020-2022. Expected number of subjects: 10,000.&#xD;

      The Russian Registry of Acute Myocardial Infarction study is an independent study initiated&#xD;
      by the investigators;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The partner inpatient hospitals will provide data on every patient with known acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (I21) admitted between days 1 and 10 of each month during the&#xD;
      recruitment period.The Russian Registry of Acute Myocardial Infarction study is an&#xD;
      independent study initiated by the investigators;&#xD;
&#xD;
      For every engaged hospital (medical center) the investigators will designate a 2-3 person&#xD;
      task team, including a Team Leader;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants shall be kept informed and coordinated via email and messengers. The website&#xD;
      of the Russian Society of Emergency Cardiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be hosted by the CRM Quinta® platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration, data entry monitoring, and statistical processing will be carried out by&#xD;
      Aston Consulting (a certified personal data operator.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      AO Aston Consulting has a license for storage and processing of personal data in accordance&#xD;
      with the applicable legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Diagnosed acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non-ST elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (NSTEMI) (ICD 10 I21 ); the diagnosis is established based on the Fourth Universal&#xD;
      Definition of Myocardial Infarction Guidelines 2018 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. A patient or his/her legal representative did not sign IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ASSESSMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be collected and entered into CRF: Full name&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residential address&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone number of patients or their legal representatives' Demographic profile. Weight, height&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social status (education, job title, occupation status)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-morbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical signs and symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes during the hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug therapy and clinical outcomes in 6 and 12 months after the diagnosis establishment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitals wishing to join the study must contact any of the project coordinators and complete&#xD;
      the Participation questionnaire (Appendix 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Registry enrolment process starts in 2020 and will continue for 24 months. The hospitals&#xD;
      that will not be able to start the enrolment in 2020 will have the chance to do it before&#xD;
      December 31, 2022, and perform the follow-up monitoring for the next 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the moment of the enrolment, the patient's data are to be entered into the online&#xD;
      database. Any new data that might appear during the hospital stay will be successively or&#xD;
      immediately entered into the database at the moment of the patient's death/discharge. The&#xD;
      data received during an in-person or a phone contact 6 or 12 months after the enrolment will&#xD;
      also be entered into the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shall the initiators have any questions regarding the entered data, they will ask the&#xD;
      participants to elaborate, clarify, or correct the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient dies before the enrolment to the study, his/her data shall be entered into the&#xD;
      database retrospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients (or their legal representatives) enrolled to the Registry must be kept informed&#xD;
      about the inclusion in this observational program and give their written consent for&#xD;
      participation (patients who died or are otherwise unable to sign the consent to the&#xD;
      processing of personal data will be enrolled on a de-identified basis.)&#xD;
