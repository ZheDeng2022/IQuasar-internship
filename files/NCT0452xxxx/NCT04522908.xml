  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, single arm, multicenter phase II trial assessing the tolerability of a reduced&#xD;
      starting dose of 40 mg cabozantinib for 4 weeks and subsequent dose escalation to 60 mg&#xD;
      cabozantinib until disease progression or intolerable toxicities.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the tolerability of a reduced starting dose of 40 mg&#xD;
      cabozantinib once-daily for 4 weeks and subsequent dose escalation to 60 mg cabozantinib&#xD;
      once-daily to be maintained until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. Using the&#xD;
      same study treatment discontinuation criteria as in the pivotal CELESTIAL trial will allow&#xD;
      for comparison of treatment discontinuation rates due to treatment related adverse events&#xD;
      (TRAEs) defined as unresolved intolerable Grade 2 TRAEs or any unresolved Grade 3 TRAEs (see&#xD;
      Section 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible for this trial are cirrhotic HCC patients treated with sorafenib or&#xD;
      lenvatinib in first line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives comprise the assessment of overall survival (OS), progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) at 10 weeks, objective response rate (ORR), time on treatment, treatment&#xD;
      exposure (dose intensity/dose reductions), toxicity, and quality of life (QLQ-C30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, tissue samples (optional) will be analyzed for molecular parameters and immune&#xD;
      cell composition to identify biomarkers potentially associated with clinical efficacy (OS,&#xD;
      PFS and ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, single-arm, multicenter phase II trial. 40 patients suffering from&#xD;
      advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with compensated liver cirrhosis in second line&#xD;
      treatment, after first line treatment with sorafenib or lenvatinib, will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from up to 10 sites and patients withdrawn from the trial will not&#xD;
      be replaced.&#xD;
