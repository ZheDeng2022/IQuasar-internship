      This study compared pre-fabricated and custom resting hand splints among people who were in&#xD;
      inpatient rehabilitation after a cervical spinal cord injury.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was randomized parallel group controlled clinical trial where arms, not patients were&#xD;
      the unit of randomization. This trial was funded by the Craig H. Neilsen Allied Health&#xD;
      Professional Development Award of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA). This&#xD;
      research was conducted at a 32-bed spinal cord injury and multi-trauma rehabilitation unit in&#xD;
      an urban center. Participants were recruited from an inpatient spinal cord injury&#xD;
      rehabilitation unit. Eligible participants were 18 years or older and undergoing acute&#xD;
      rehabilitation after a cervical spinal cord injury with hand function impairment, and the&#xD;
      primary occupational therapist deemed splinting intervention was required. Each eligible&#xD;
      extremity was randomized to receive a custom or pre-fabricated resting hand splint for night&#xD;
      use.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in scores on The Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensation and Prehension (GRASSP).</measure>
    <time_frame>This assessment is completed within 5 days of initating the splinting intervention and within 3 days of discharge. Length of time between data collection was limited to 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This test is a hand function assessment for spinal cord injury consisting of four domains- upper extremity strength, sensation, qualitative prehension, and quantitative prehension. Total scores for each upper extremity are calculated 0-116. Assessment of the Hand in Tetraplegia Using the Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength Sensibility and Prehension (GRASSP): Impairment versus Function.&#xD;

    <measure>Splint Perception Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>This assessment was completed within 3 days of discharge and no more than 12 weeks after the intervention was initiated.</time_frame>
    <description>This survey gathered participant perceptions via a 5 point Likert scale on the participant's perceptions of the splint's comfort and impact on function and hand position. Additionally, participants were asked to provide their perceptions on challenges to using the splint and advice to future therapists and patients considering splinting.</description>
