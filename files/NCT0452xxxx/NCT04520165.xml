    <textblock>
      We will measure different cytokines in the sputum (IL3, GM-CSF, IL5, IL-13, IL-33, IL-4…) and&#xD;
      in the blood to evaluate their ability to predict the response after 6 months treatment with&#xD;
      a biologic treatment (anti-IgE, anti-IL5, anti-IL5R) in terms of reduction in exacerbations&#xD;
      and corticosteroid use, improvement in FEV1 (+200ml), in asthma control (ACQ decrease &gt;0.5,&#xD;
      ACT increase &gt;3), in asthma quality of life (increase in AQLQ score &gt; 0.5) and the effect on&#xD;
      sputum and blood inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe asthma is observed in 3 to 5% of the asthmatic population and is characterized by a&#xD;
      higher rate of exacerbations, poorly controlled asthma and/or a poor lung function. During&#xD;
      the last ten years, anti-IgE and anti-IL5 (and anti-IL5R) have considerably improved severe&#xD;
      asthma status. Treatment with chronic or oral course of corticosteroids is indeed responsible&#xD;
      for a lot of side effects. There is however a lack of biomarkers for the prediction of&#xD;
      responders to anti-IL5 and anti-IgE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have previously found that sputum eosinophil counts are good predictors for improvement in&#xD;
      lung function of severe asthmatics using anti-IL5 (Schleich et al, in press in Clin Exp&#xD;
      Allergy 2020). Sputum cells might not be the only relevant sputum marker for responders to&#xD;
      mepolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to evaluate the ability of sputum cytokines (protein levels and genes)&#xD;
      (IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-33 and GM-CSF) to predict the response of severe asthmatics&#xD;
      after 6 months treatment with biologics in terms of reduction in exacerbations and&#xD;
      corticosteroid use, improvement in FEV1, in asthma control, in asthma quality of life and the&#xD;
      effect on sputum and blood inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe asthmatics seen in the Asthma Clinic of CHU of Liege are very well characterized using&#xD;
      baseline measure of blood samples, induced sputum, lung function, FeNO, asthma control&#xD;
      questionnaires (ACT - ACQ) and asthma quality of life questionnaires (AQLQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on exacerbations during the previous year and current inhaled and oral treatment is also&#xD;
      recorded. If FEV1 value is upper than 70% of the predicted value, severe asthmatics also&#xD;
      perform a methacholine challenge to evaluate bronchial hyperresponsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these measures are repeated after 6 months treatment with mepolizumab. All the sputum&#xD;
      supernatants are stored at -80°C and RNA from sputum cells is also available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target sample size: 50 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to measure different cytokines in the sputum (IL3, GM-CSF, IL5, IL-13, IL-33, IL-4…)&#xD;
      and to evaluate their ability to predict the response after 6 months treatment with different&#xD;
      biologics in terms of reduction in exacerbations and corticosteroid use, improvement in FEV1&#xD;
      (+200ml), in asthma control (ACQ decrease &gt;0.5, ACT increase &gt;3), in asthma quality of life&#xD;
      (increase in AQLQ score &gt; 0.5) and the effect on sputum and blood inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthmatic patients are recruited through the outpatient clinic and pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      centre (CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege). Asthma is diagnosed as described in the GINA guidelines&#xD;
      (http://ginasthma.org/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sputum induction and processing. The sputum is induced and processed as previously described&#xD;
      (Delvaux Thorax 2014). The whole sputum is collected in a plastic container, weighed, and&#xD;
      homogenized with three volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), vortexed for 30 s, and&#xD;
      centrifuged at 800g for 10 min at 4° C. The supernatant is separated from the cell pellet by&#xD;
      filtration through 2 layers of sterile gauze. A mucolysis is performed by adding an equal&#xD;
      volume of 6.5 mM dithiothreitol and the suspension is rocked during 20 min. After a&#xD;
      centrifugation of 10 min at 550g, the squamous cells and total cell counts as well as the&#xD;
      cell viability are checked by trypan blue exclusion with a manual hemocytometer. The&#xD;
      differential leukocyte count is performed on cytospins stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa on&#xD;
      500 cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the quality criteria (&lt; 30% of squamous cells and viability &gt; 50%) are respected, the cell&#xD;
      pellet is mixed with 5 volumes of RNAprotect cell reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and kept&#xD;
      at -80 °C until RNA extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 50 patient with successful induced sputum supernatant samples before anti-IL-5,&#xD;
      anti-IL5R or anti-IgE therapy as well as 6 months after will be analysed. Regarding the&#xD;
      sputum cells, patients with good quality samples before and after therapy will allow gene&#xD;
      expression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunoassays: The concentrations of the mediators contained in the sputum supernatant are&#xD;
      assessed by ELISA Luminex performance assay (R and D systems, Minneapolis, USA) according to&#xD;
      the manufacturer's instructions. Spiking experiments of cytokines in sputum supernatants are&#xD;
      performed to check that the recovery is between 80% and 120% for all the analytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA extraction and RT-qPCR methods The mediator protein levels will be obtained using Luminex&#xD;
      performance XL discovery kit (R and D systems, Minneapolis, USA) for IL-3 and IL-4 (detection&#xD;
      limit : 0.09 pg/ml for both). A Luminex high sensitivity performance kit will be used for&#xD;
      IL-5, IL-13, IL-33 and GM-CSF. Detection limits are 0.4, 5.1, 1.8 and 1.6 pg/ml respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the mediator gene expression levels, the steps will be performed exactly as&#xD;
      recently described. Primers and probes will all beobtained from IDT (Integrated DNA&#xD;
      Technologies, Skokie, IL, USA). PCR efficiencies will be calculated using qbase+ qPCR&#xD;
      analysis software (Biogazelle, Zwijnaarde, Belgium). The same program will be used to obtain&#xD;
      relative quantitation in gene expression using the 2-∆∆Ct method. HPRT1 and GNB2L1 will be&#xD;
      used as reference genes as also previously reported. The patients will be compared with a&#xD;
      cohort of 7 healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These steps are performed according to the description of da Silva et al [Clin Exp allergy&#xD;
      2017] except that the Taqman PCR step is performed in 96-well plates and that for each&#xD;
      sample, 2 µl of cDNA (diluted 1:4) is used in a total reaction volume of 12.5 µl including&#xD;
      500 nM forward primer, 500 nM reverse primer and 250 nM probe for all the tested genes. Every&#xD;
      qPCR are realized in duplicate and included non-template controls for each gene.&#xD;
      Amplification is performed on the LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR (Roche, Pleasanton, CA, USA)&#xD;
      during 45 cycles as follows: initial activation step: 95 °C for 15 min; denaturation stage:&#xD;
      94 °C for 15 s; annealing and elongation stage: 60 °C for 1 min. Primers and probes are all&#xD;
      labeled with reporter and double-quencher dyes 5'6-carboxyfluorescein/ZEN/3' Iowa black FQ&#xD;
      (5'6-FAM/ZEN/3'IBFQ) and were obtained from IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Skokie, IL,&#xD;
      USA). Standard curves are generated for each gene using a 4 times serial dilution of stock&#xD;
      cDNA (pool of 4 cDNA) to check that all PCR efficiencies obtained are between 1.9 and 2.1.&#xD;
      Genomic DNA contamination is controlled by performing qPCR with each RNA sample without RT&#xD;
      step. Relative quantitation in gene expression is determined using qbase+ qPCR analysis&#xD;
      software (Biogazelle, Zwijnaarde, Belgium) using the 2-∆∆Ct method. HPRT1 and GNB2L1 are used&#xD;
      as reference genes as previously determined. All the procedure is done according to the MIQE&#xD;
      guidelines for the minimum information required for a qPCR experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokines will also be measured in the blood of a subset of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify predictors of reduction in exacerbations and in oral corticosteroids dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify predictors of improvement in ACQ (-0.5), ACT (+3pts), AQLQ (+ 0.5), sputum&#xD;
      eosinophils (&lt;3%), FEV1 (+ 200ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan or Data analysis The results will be expressed as mean¡SD or mean¡SEM for&#xD;
      continuous variables; median (range) for skewed distributions. For categorical variables, the&#xD;
      number of observations and percentages will be given in each category. Comparisons between&#xD;
      different subgroups will be performed with a Kruskal-Wallis test or paired t-test / Wilcoxon&#xD;
      signed rank test. The Spearman correlation coefficient will be used to measure the&#xD;
      association between clinical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations indicated a required total sample size of 50 subjects to confirm a change&#xD;
      in outcomes.&#xD;
