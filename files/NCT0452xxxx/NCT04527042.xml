  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Domestic and international guidelines for the management of pulmonary embolism have suggested&#xD;
      that the standard duration of anticoagulation should cover at least 3 months.Whether extended&#xD;
      anticogulation therapy shoud balance the efficacy and safety of the therapy.Nevertheless, the&#xD;
      concerning about bleeding may affect the decision on the extended anticoagulation for&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism patients who may benefit from continuing anticoagulation. Rivaroxaban is&#xD;
      an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, it does not require routine laboratory monitoring and has&#xD;
      no food interactions and only a few drug interactions compared to standard of care with the&#xD;
      recommendation for the treatment of pulmonary embolism by several guidelines.Our study aims&#xD;
      to acquire the data of effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban used in clinical practice of&#xD;
      extended anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism patients in China through this perspective&#xD;
      observational study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a perspective, multicenter, single-arm, non-interventional, and observational study.&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban used in&#xD;
      extended treatment of pulmonary embolism in a real-world.The secondary objective aims to&#xD;
      analyze the drug usage pattern of rivaroxaban, patient satisfaction and medical resource&#xD;
      utilization used in extended treatment of pulmonary embolism in a real-world.496 subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this study. The primary outcome of this study is net clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with rivaroxaban should be followed up to 12 months, or about 30 days after the&#xD;
      end of rivaroxaban treatment if discontinued before the completion of 12 months. Follow up&#xD;
      visits occur at initial visit, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after the initial visit, where such data&#xD;
      have been collected as part of routine clinical practice, by phone and or face to face&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each follow up visit, the date of visit, physical examination, ACTS and, as&#xD;
      applicable, changes in the concomitant medication, changes in concomitant disease,changes in&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism and/or treatment regimen, new diagnosis of venous thromboembolism, medical&#xD;
      resources utilization, and adverse events will be obtained and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting with the first application of rivaroxaban after enrollment into the study or&#xD;
      follow-up period, all AEs would be documented. For each AE, the investigator must assess and&#xD;
      document the seriousness, duration, relationship to product, action taken and outcome of the&#xD;
      event.&#xD;
