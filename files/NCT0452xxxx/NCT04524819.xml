      This study will characterise saliva and sputum FTIR spectral profiles in patients with COPD,&#xD;
      during exacerbations and stable disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common and treatable condition that is&#xD;
      characterised by predominately irreversible and progressive airflow limitation. COPD is a&#xD;
      leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and its prevalence is predicted to&#xD;
      increase substantially in the coming decade1. In the United Kingdom (UK) alone, COPD affects&#xD;
      an estimated 3 million people, with 1 million diagnosed and a further 2 million remaining&#xD;
      undiagnosed2. Delays in an accurate diagnosis impacts on quality of life and healthcare&#xD;
      resource utilisation. COPD is associated with a significant economic and social burden, with&#xD;
      a single severe exacerbation requiring admission to hospital costing up to £1600, therefore&#xD;
      having a major impact on NHS expenditure. COPD also has a personal burden, causing 24 million&#xD;
      lost working days annually, costing the UK economy £3.8 billion3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance is placed on early detection of exacerbations of COPD as delays in starting&#xD;
      treatment are associated with increased exacerbation severity, emergency healthcare use, a&#xD;
      higher mortality and a more rapid decline in lung function. There is therefore a recognised&#xD;
      need for widely accessible, easy-to-use tools to aid in the early detection of COPD&#xD;
      exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy is an emerging field of medicine which has&#xD;
      the potential to become established in the management of lung conditions. Previous studies4,5&#xD;
      have shown that sputum in patients with COPD analysed with infrared (IR) gave reproducible&#xD;
      biological IR spectra with distinct signatures in 5 key regions, namely Amide A, two&#xD;
      signatures in the Amide I region, Amide II and in glycoproteins. The additional information&#xD;
      on the spectral profiles gathered in this study on saliva and sputum from patients with COPD,&#xD;
      during both stable disease and exacerbations will help establish FTIR use in the management&#xD;
      of these lung conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide essential information in the development process of a hand held FTIR&#xD;
      spectroscope. Phase 1 will establish the infrared spectrum required for the analysis of&#xD;
      saliva and sputum, which will inform the design of the daisy chain device (a pre-prototype&#xD;
      device) used in phase 2. Phase 2 will test this infrared spectrum in the pre-prototype daisy&#xD;
      chain device with further saliva and sputum samples, before this spectrum is incorporated&#xD;
      into the eventual hand-held FTIR spectroscope.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of an exacerbation of COPD (aged ≥40 years),&#xD;
             n=40 (20 participants recruited in phase 1 and 20 participants recruited in phase 2)&#xD;
             who are able to spontaneously expectorates sputum during exacerbations and on at least&#xD;
             3 out of 7 days when well.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with other significant respiratory disease that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             clinical investigator, is the major cause of their respiratory symptoms (e.g.&#xD;
             pulmonary tuberculosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, pulmonary fibrosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with COPD whose deterioration in respiratory symptoms is not thought to&#xD;
             be due to an exacerbation of their COPD (e.g. pneumonia*, pneumothorax, pulmonary&#xD;
             embolus).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A member of the research study medical team will review the participant's chest&#xD;
                  X-Ray (CXR) to exclude any pneumonia, defined by consolidation on CXR before they&#xD;
                  are recruited onto the study if a CXR has been taken. In participants who have&#xD;
                  not had a CXR, exclusion of pneumonia will be based on clinical assessment.&#xD;
