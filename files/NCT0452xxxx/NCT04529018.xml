      The study is a Phase 1, single-centre, open label, micro-dosing study. The aim is to&#xD;
      investigate an innovative new tracer, [18F]CETO, as a potential alternative to adrenal vein&#xD;
      sampling for the lateralisation of primary aldosteronism (PA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At least one-quarter of the UK adult population has hypertension, a major risk factor for&#xD;
      heart attacks and stroke. Primary aldosteronism (PA), a treatable form of hypertension,&#xD;
      accounts for 5-10% of all cases, and 20-25% of difficult to control hypertension. It is&#xD;
      challenging to determine whether one adrenal gland is the source of PA (which is potentially&#xD;
      curable with surgery) or both glands (which would require long-term drug treatment). Existing&#xD;
      lateralising procedures (i.e. investigations to distinguish one from two gland involvement&#xD;
      e.g. CT or MRI scan) have significant limitations. Accordingly, most patients must undergo an&#xD;
      invasive procedure called adrenal vein sampling (AVS) in which small catheters are placed in&#xD;
      each adrenal vein. However, this is time-consuming, technically demanding, and fails in&#xD;
      20-50% of cases. To address this, researchers have adopted a novel approach using PET-CT as&#xD;
      an alternative to AVS. Currently, this uses a tracer called metomidate labelled with&#xD;
      carbon-11 (11C MTO), which is taken up preferentially by the adrenal gland, and in particular&#xD;
      by adrenal tumours causing PA. However, its utility is limited by a short half-life, which&#xD;
      means the scan can only be performed in centres with a cyclotron facility (currently less&#xD;
      than 10 NHS sites). The aim of this study is to investigate the safety of a new tracer with a&#xD;
      longer half-life, [18F]CETO, that could be made available for use in many more centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial objectives are outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety of up to two administrations of [18F]CETO in up to 6 patients with&#xD;
      primary aldosteronism and 5 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess [18F]CETO uptake by the adrenal glands&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate uptake in bilateral vs unilateral cases of PA following [18F]CETO&#xD;
           administration in up to 6 patients.&#xD;
