  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, no published systematic review and meta-analysis has compared AHI-CPAPflow and&#xD;
      AHI-PSGgold. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to compare published data for&#xD;
      AHI-PSGgold and AHI-CPAPflow in patients treated by CPAP.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate, in a manner similar to the primary objective, data&#xD;
      for apnoea indices (AI), hypopnoea indices (HI), respiratory disturbance indices (RDI) and&#xD;
      respiratory effort related arousals (RERAs) and to perform subgroup analyses focusing on the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion of central apnoea patients, BMI levels, CPAP device brands, pressure&#xD;
      titration modes, use of a predetermined and fixed pressure level or not, and the impact of a&#xD;
      4%-PSG desaturation criteria versus 3%-PSG on index accuracy.&#xD;

             fol-lowing tests to compare the previously mentioned PSG-vs-CPAP-derived data: a&#xD;
             bland-altman or correlation test, other conformity tests, tests of differences in&#xD;
             centrality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inappropriate PSG scoring 1: PSG-derived variables must be coded following the&#xD;
