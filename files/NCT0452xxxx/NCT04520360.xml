  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine the relative bioavailability of three carisbamate&#xD;
      formulations (Oral Suspension Type 1, Oral Suspension Type 2, and a 300 mg Oral Tablet) and&#xD;
      to assess the effect of food on the oral bioavailability of the Oral Suspension Type 2 and&#xD;
      the 300 mg Oral Tablet.&#xD;

      This is a single center, open-label, randomized, 5-period, 10-sequence study designed to&#xD;
      assess each treatment in 30 healthy subjects enrolled in the study. The five treatments&#xD;
      tested using a single oral administration will be: (1) Oral Suspension Type 1, 300 mg Oral&#xD;
      Tablet, Oral Suspension Type 2 all under fasted conditions and (2) Oral Suspension Type 2,&#xD;
      300 mg Oral Tablet under fed conditions. Each dose is followed by at least a seven-day&#xD;
      washout period. The sequence and period arrangement will be constructed based on the Williams&#xD;
      design to ensure the study is balanced with respect to first-order carry-over effects.&#xD;

    <description>Carisbamate is currently under investigation as an adjuvant antiepileptic therapy in Lennox-Gastaut patients. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a rare and highly debilitating form of childhood epilepsy that typically is diagnosed between 2 and 8 years of age, with peak onset at 3 to 5 years of age, and frequently persists into adulthood. Treatment options are limited and complicated by the multiple seizure types associated with LGS. Given the breadth of physical and cognitive disabilities associated with LGS, the development of antiseizure medications with appropriate oral dosing forms is needed to ensure administration feasibility and compliance in the target population.</description>
