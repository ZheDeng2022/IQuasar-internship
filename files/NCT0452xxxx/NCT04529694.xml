  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective registration. The study was conducted at The Ohio State University&#xD;
      from 2011 to 2012. This study was approved by an Institutional Review Board at The Ohio State&#xD;
      University. The investigators retroactively registered this trial to facilitate publishing&#xD;
      results in journal that now require registration. Any reference to the study's registration&#xD;
      will make it clear that the registration was retroactive. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      has been shown to be an effective treatment for depression. However, a substantial number of&#xD;
      patients do not respond to treatment or continue to be symptomatic at its conclusion. An&#xD;
      important goal of ongoing research is to find ways to enhance treatment outcomes. One&#xD;
      approach to doing this is to modifying existing treatments to individualize the approach to&#xD;
      better meet the needs of individual patients. In this study, the investigators tested two&#xD;
      main components of CBT to empirically evaluate patient characteristics that may predict&#xD;
      differential response to these components. By using components of CBT, any suggestions about&#xD;
      the strategies that are best suited to different patients are likely be easily implemented by&#xD;
      therapists providing CBT. The two treatment components the investigators examined were:&#xD;
      cognitive interventions (e.g., challenging negative automatic thoughts) and behavioral&#xD;
      interventions (e.g., engaging in activities to promote a sense of pleasure or&#xD;
      accomplishment). The investigators recruited adults with major depressive disorder and&#xD;
      randomized them to a cognitive or behavioral intervention. After 8 weeks of treatment,&#xD;
      patients were randomized again to a cognitive or behavioral intervention. Consequently,&#xD;
      participants were offered a total of 16 weeks of treatment. Depressive symptoms were assessed&#xD;
      with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression&#xD;
      (HRSD), with the latter being the primary outcome measure. Several variables that might serve&#xD;
      to predict differential response to cognitive and behavioral treatments were also assessed.&#xD;
      The results of this study may help to elucidate how cognitive or behavioral interventions&#xD;
      might be selected so as to enhance overall treatment outcomes.&#xD;
