      A phase 2 study with the primary objective of testing treatment compliance of Upfront&#xD;
      Intensity Modulated Proton Beam Therapy (IMPT) and Concurrent Chemotherapy (UPPROACH) for&#xD;
      Post-operative Treatment in Loco-regionally Advanced Endometrial Cancer is non-inferior to&#xD;
      the historic compliance rate of the chemoradiation arm of GOG 258 study&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While there is a consensus that both adjuvant ChT and RT benefit patients with respect to&#xD;
      locoregional and distant control, the sequencing of these therapies varies between&#xD;
      institutions. Common approaches include sequential treatment, with 4-6 cycles of ChT followed&#xD;
      by RT, sandwich therapy with RT sandwiched between 3 cycles of ChT, or concurrent CRT. Small&#xD;
      retrospective studies have shown a benefit with respect to PFS and OS in the sandwich&#xD;
      approach, however this has not been replicated in larger studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In more recent years, proton beam therapy (PBT) has become an increasingly common modality&#xD;
      for the treatment of uterine malignancies and is capable of even more precise dose&#xD;
      distributions than photon-based RT due to intrinsic properties of these much heavier&#xD;
      particles. Dosimetric/planning studies from other institutions confirm the significant&#xD;
      reduction of dose to critical normal tissues like bladder, bowel, rectum, and bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data from the University of Maryland Medical Center has suggested that IMPT using&#xD;
      pencil beam scanning is feasible in patients with endometrial cancer, with only 10% of&#xD;
      patients developing grade 2 GI toxicity and no patients developing ≥ grade 3 GI or GU&#xD;
      toxicities (abstract under review).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to test the hypothesis that in the postoperative setting,&#xD;
      patients with advanced endometrial cancer will be able to complete a course of full dose ChT&#xD;
      - carboplatin and paclitaxel - concurrent with upfront pelvic IMPT.&#xD;
