  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common disorders which occured during&#xD;
      pregnancy. GDM is not only associated with short-term maternal and fetal adverse outcomes,&#xD;
      but also related to a wide range of long-term consequences for both mother and child. The GDM&#xD;
      and Its Consequences for mothers and offsprings (GDMCMO) aims to establish a cohort to follow&#xD;
      both maternal and offsprings'short-term and long-term outcomes, including fetal malformations&#xD;
      including congenital heart diseases, birth weight, preterm birth, caesarean section delivery,&#xD;
      body growth and neurodevelopment after birth, obesity, type 2 diabetes and impaired insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and secretion, lung health and allergic diseases later in life for offspring, as&#xD;
      well as future type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors for mother after delivery.&#xD;
      Biological samples including blood and tissue samples of mothers and children are also&#xD;
      collected during pregnancy and after delivery.&#xD;

      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common disorders which occured during&#xD;
      pregnancy. GDM is not only associated with short-term maternal and fetal adverse outcomes,&#xD;
      but also related to a wide range of long-term consequences for both mother and child.&#xD;
      Although maternal hyperglycemia often become normal shortly after pregnancy, women with GDM&#xD;
      have crucially increased risk of development of type 2 diabetes later in life and the&#xD;
      mechanisms are not fully understand. Systematic follow-up of the outcomes related to GDM&#xD;
      would be ideal to observe the nature progression of GDM to diabetes and could help to develop&#xD;
      preventable targets for intervention. The risks of obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and type&#xD;
      2 diabetes in offspring of mothers with GDM significantly increased 1-7 folds than those&#xD;
      whose mothers didn't have GDM. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms behind the impaired&#xD;
      metabolic risk profile and other diseases in offspring are unknown, but environmental changes&#xD;
      including epigenetic changes induced by exposure to maternal hyperglycaemia and genetic&#xD;
      factors may play essential roles. The GDM and Its Consequences for mothers and offsprings&#xD;
      (GDMCMO) aims to establish a cohort to follow both maternal and offsprings'short-term and&#xD;
      long-term outcomes, including fetal malformations including congenital heart diseases, birth&#xD;
      weight, preterm birth, caesarean section delivery, body growth and neurodevelopment after&#xD;
      birth, obesity, type 2 diabetes and impaired insulin sensitivity and secretion, lung health&#xD;
      and allergic diseases later in life for offspring, as well as future type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors for mother after delivery. Biological samples including blood and&#xD;
      tissue samples of mothers and children are also collected during pregnancy and after&#xD;
      delivery. We also aim to identify the high-risk population of mother-child pairs who are more&#xD;
      likely to develop these adverse consequences, which might help to improve precise&#xD;
      intervention and resource saving and provide evidence for preventable targets development.&#xD;

    <measure>Change of obesity status during childhood and adolescence</measure>
    <time_frame>At age of 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, 6 years, 12 years and 18 year</time_frame>
    <description>Weight in kilograms and height in meters were measured by nurses in clinic using standard tools. Weight and height will be combined to report BMI in kg/m^2. Childhood obesity is defined as a BMI equal to or larger than the 95th percentile for age by sex based on WHO Child Growth Standards.</description>
