      Aim: To examine the effect of acupressure application on physiological parameters, anxiety&#xD;
      and sleep quality in patients with acute stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Randomized controlled trial will be carried out in the stroke patients in Turkey. The&#xD;
      research will include two groups, an intervention (n=32) and a placebo (n=32).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the critical period in the care of the patient who had an acute stroke is the first 72&#xD;
      hours;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An application and evaluation will be made every 12 hours after the first application.&#xD;
           In other words, a person will be given 2 applications a day with an interval of 12 hours&#xD;
           and a total of 6 applications within 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depending on the number of points selected and the duration of the print on each point;&#xD;
           the session duration of an individual will be approximately 25 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiological measurements will be made before and after the acupressure application.&#xD;
           Physiological measurements 10-15 min. From acupressure application. will be taken before&#xD;
           and the same measurements after acupressure 20-30. Will be taken again in the min&#xD;
           interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Application to acupressure points in a certain order; Baihui (GV20), Susanli (ST36),&#xD;
           Hegu (LI4), Shenmen (HT 7) and Quchi (LI11) will be held.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application steps of the placebo group will be the same as the acupressure application&#xD;
      steps. Unlike acupressure, it will be waited for 2 minutes only in contact with the thumb,&#xD;
      without any pressure or scrub on the bone protrusions, away from the real acupressure points,&#xD;
      where the meridian does not pass and there are no active points. To reduce the electrical&#xD;
      effect of the touch, gloves will be worn only in contact.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stroke is a medical emergency and 25% of patients experience neurological deterioration 24-48&#xD;
      hours after stroke. After stroke, 15-30% of patients live with permanent sequelae, and 20%&#xD;
      become in need of care. Therefore, the care provided in the acute period (24-72 hours) is&#xD;
      critical in shaping recovery and prognosis. It is possible to prevent neurological and&#xD;
      medical complications with safe and effective stroke care (Boyraz 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many factors that affect the occurrence of complications in patients with acute&#xD;
      stroke. The most common of these factors are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, fever, heart rate and respiratory rate physiological parameters. The follow-up&#xD;
      and control of physiological parameters is of vital importance, especially in patients with&#xD;
      acute stroke (Greer et al.2008; Uzuner, Steiner et al.2014; Kutluk and Balkan 2015). In&#xD;
      addition, it is stated that the sudden change in the health status of the individual, the&#xD;
      emergence of anxiety due to the hospitalization process and the inability to perform daily&#xD;
      life activities, the difficulty in adapting to the treatment process, and the disruption of&#xD;
      sleep patterns may be effective in the emergence of complications (Jariani et al 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the symptoms or complications of stroke, it is one of the most important goals of&#xD;
      health care to make patients feel good and help them to continue their daily life activities&#xD;
      (Ovayol and Ovayol 2016). Among the nursing interventions applied to relieve these symptoms&#xD;
      or complications, there are complementary and alternative treatment (CAM) methods (Khorshid&#xD;
      2005; Taşçı 2015). Many of the CAM methods are similar to nursing practices in terms of&#xD;
      focusing on the holistic concept (Taşçı 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, it is stated that acupressure application, which is among the CAM methods&#xD;
      in stroke patients, is frequently used and is an effective application (Song et al.2015; Shın&#xD;
      and Lee 2007; Kang, Sok, and Kang 2009; Yue, Jiang, and Wong 2012). Acupressure (Shiatsu) is&#xD;
      a massage technique applied with fingers and palms, based on traditional Chinese Medicine,&#xD;
      consisting of the words shi = finger = and atsu = pressure. Acupressure is one of the oldest&#xD;
      healing methods. This method ensures proper functioning of energy channels (such as blood&#xD;
      circulation) by applying pressure to acupuncture points with fingers, palms, tennis balls or&#xD;
      special stimulation tools to activate the self-healing power of the body, regulate energy&#xD;
      flow, and relieve uncomfortable symptoms. The acupressure technique is a noninvasive, safe,&#xD;
      effective method that has no side effects (Song et al.2015; Mucuk and Ceyhan 2015). Although&#xD;
      acupressure application is included in the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC), it is&#xD;
      a method that increases the independent functions of the nurse and improves the patient and&#xD;
      nurse interaction (Özkan and Balcı 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the literature review, it has been proven that acupressure applications are&#xD;
      effective in coping with many symptoms and complications in stroke patients, but there is no&#xD;
      study examining the effect of acupressure application on the control of physiological&#xD;
      parameters, anxiety and sleep quality in patients with acute stroke in the world and in our&#xD;
      country. Considering that acupressure application is a non-invasive, safe and effective&#xD;
      method, it is thought that the application of acupressure in the acute stroke period can&#xD;
      reduce the development rate of complications, increase the quality of healing, reduce the&#xD;
      patient's anxiety and increase the patient's sleep quality, and more evidence-based studies&#xD;
      can be undertaken to defend its effectiveness clearly. is needed.&#xD;

    <measure>Anxiety (Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory / STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Spielberger State Anxiety Scale: The scores obtained from the scale vary between 20-80, and high scores indicate high anxiety and low scores indicate low anxiety levels. The total score between 0-19 shows that there is no anxiety, the total score between 20-39 indicates mild, the total score between 40-59 indicates moderate, and the total score between 60-79 indicates severe anxiety.&#xD;
Continuity Anxiety Scale states how the person feels in the process, regardless of the situation and conditions. The scores obtained from the scale vary between 20-80. The average score level determined in the applications varies between 36 and 41. 0-30 shows low, 31-49 shows medium, 50-80 shows high anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Sleep quality (Richard-Campbell Sleep Scale (RCSS))</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The scale will be applied 3 times in total. The scale will be filled in after the night sleep after applying acupressure to the patient twice. In other words, the scale will be filled before acupressure applications on the second, third and fourth day of hospitalization.&#xD;
Each item of the scale is evaluated with visual analog scale technique ranging from 0-100. &quot;0-25&quot; score obtained from the scale indicates &quot;very bad sleep&quot;, &quot;76-100&quot; score indicates &quot;very good sleep&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The scale will be applied twice before and after acupressure applications. The highest score that can be obtained from the scale is 42. Having a high score on the scale is associated with high mortality. While the NIHSS score of more than 16 indicates serious insufficiency or high risk of death, less than 6 indicates that the prognosis will be good.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Barthel Daily Life Activities Index (BI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The scale will be applied twice before and after acupressure applications. The total score ranges from 0 to 100, showing 00-20 full addiction, 21-60 serious addiction, 61-90 medium addiction, 91-99 mild addiction, and 100 indicates full independence. Patients with a scale score below 40 cannot go home (cannot be discharged), they are addicted to their movement and personal care. A score of 60 indicates the dependence of patients with assisted independence. Patients scoring between 60 and 80 may need some help from community organizations to cope if they live alone. Patients who score above 85 can be discharged from the hospital to live in the community.</description>
