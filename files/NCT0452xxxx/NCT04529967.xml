  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Child-parent screening for familial hypercholesterolemia has been proposed to identify&#xD;
      children and their parent who are carrier of mutations and with high risk for inherited&#xD;
      premature coronary artery disease. The investigators assessed the efficacy and feasibility of&#xD;
      such screening in primary care practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      key scitific questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The 95th and 99th percentile of finger blood TC in children of 2 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mutations that contribute to high TC status ( serum TC &gt;99th percentiles) compared with&#xD;
           international FH48 panel for FH genetc screening.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition resulting in high levels of&#xD;
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and increased risk of premature coronary artery&#xD;
      disease in men and women. Child-parent screening for familial hypercholesterolemia has been&#xD;
      proposed to identify persons who are carriers of FH mutations and with high risk for&#xD;
      inherited premature coronary artery disease. The investigators will conduct a cross-sectional&#xD;
      community-based screening in children of 2 years old to detect FH children cases using finger&#xD;
      blood TC test first and followed by serum TC test and mutation test, and to identify and&#xD;
      diagnose their affected parents. This study aims to established the Child-parent screening&#xD;
      program and technique issues for early diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia families&#xD;
      for future early intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child-parent screening strategy in our study consists three steps: i. Apillary blood total&#xD;
      cholesterol test of children aged around 2 years; ii. re-test for children with&#xD;
      cholesterol&gt;95th percentile in the first step; iii. WES (whole exome sequencing) test for&#xD;
      &gt;P99 in the first two steps. iV: TC test and mutation test to the parents of the child FH&#xD;
      cases. The investigators will determine FH families based on the program. Children's Hospital&#xD;
      of Fudan University will provide treatment further.&#xD;
