  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is prospective randomized trial study. &quot;O&quot; type tracheal intubation tube is&#xD;
      anatomically consistent and will able to increase the success rate of first intubation&#xD;
      without any other external help.&#xD;

      This study is divided into two groups. : control vs. &quot;O&quot; shape endotracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator was studied 238 consecutive the American Society of Anesthesiologists'&#xD;
      physical grades I and II adult patients scheduled to undergo general anesthesia requiring&#xD;
      tracheal intubation for elective surgery. Exclusion criteria included a gross anatomical&#xD;
      abnormality, before surgery of the head, neck and cervical spine, previously difficult&#xD;
      tracheal intubation, loose teeth, or those requiring a rapid sequence or awake intubation,&#xD;
      moderate or severe obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease accompanied by pulmonary&#xD;
      function tests. Anesthesia was induced with remifentanyl 3ng/kg, propopol 1-2 mg/kg or TIVA&#xD;
      2% fresopol 4ug/dL, remifentanyl 3ng/dL and rocuronium 0.8 mg/kg to facilitate tracheal&#xD;
      intubation. Laryngoscopy was performed after the loss of the fourth twitch in the&#xD;
      train-of-four in response to ulnar nerve stimulation. All laryngoscopies using a #4 Macintosh&#xD;
      blade were performed with the patient placed in the sniffing position. Tracheal intubation&#xD;
      was performed without assistance (ex. External laryngeal manipulation, Used stylet). A single&#xD;
      experienced anesthesiologist, blinded to each group, performed all of the direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopies and classified the laryngoscopic view according to the modified Cormack and&#xD;
      Lehane grade, measured number of attempts, intubation time and blood pressure and heart rate&#xD;
      before/ after intubation.&#xD;
