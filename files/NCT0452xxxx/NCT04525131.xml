  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single center open label to determine safety, dose tolerance, PK and PD&#xD;
      of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CPX-POM administered in patients with any newly&#xD;
      diagnosed or recurrent bladder tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label study to determine the safety, dose tolerance, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics of CPX-POM in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent, untreated or&#xD;
      intravesical treatment completed &gt;6 months before the current diagnosis, resectable tumors.&#xD;
      Approximately 12 patients will be enrolled and treated with 900 mg/m2 CPX-POM administered IV&#xD;
      over 20 minutes once per day for 5 days followed by TURBT on Day 5 after the fifth dose.&#xD;
      TURBT will be performed 2 to 6 hours following drug administration on Day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pretreatment bladder tumor tissues will be obtained at the time of in-office cystoscopy by&#xD;
      cold cup biopsy within 4 weeks of TURBT. Posttreatment bladder tumor tissues will be obtained&#xD;
      at TURBT. Bladder tumor tissues will undergo pathological evaluation at each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to administration of the first CPX-POM dose on Day 1, pre-dose blood (plasma) and urine&#xD;
      (clean catch) samples will be collected. At the time of TURBT on Day 5, one 3-mL blood&#xD;
      (plasma) sample and a urine specimen will be collected for measurement of CPX-POM&#xD;
      concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for at least 30 days after the last dose of CPX-POM for safety&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in this&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients received prior intravesical therapy for bladder cancer within ≤6 months of&#xD;
             the current diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must not have had any of the following within 6 months before study drug&#xD;
             administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Severe/unstable angina&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Symptomatic congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Pulmonary embolism&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology&#xD;
             Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 grade 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV heart&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Uncontrolled hypertension (&gt;150/100 mmHg despite optimal medical therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has an uncontrolled or severe intercurrent medical condition. The decision to&#xD;
             exclude a patient from the study for an uncontrolled or severe intercurrent medical&#xD;
             condition will be made by the Principal Investigator. Examples could include epilepsy,&#xD;
             resistant infection, or any other neurological disease that would make clinical&#xD;
             assessment difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient underwent major surgery or radiation therapy within 4 weeks before the first&#xD;
             dose of CPX-POM or received an investigational drug or device within 4 weeks or 5&#xD;
             half-lives of that agent (whichever is shorter) before the first dose of CPX-POM. A&#xD;
             minimum of 10 days between termination of the investigational drug and administration&#xD;
             of CPX-POM is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. If female, patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient has evidence of a serious active infection (e.g., infection requiring&#xD;
             treatment with IV antibiotics).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient has a known, active Hepatitis A infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient has known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Hepatitis B, or C infection,&#xD;
             as such patients may be at increased risk for toxicity due to concomitant treatment&#xD;
             and disease-related symptoms may preclude accurate assessment of the safety of CPX&#xD;
             POM.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient has an important medical illness or abnormal laboratory finding that, in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion, would increase the risk of participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patient is taking warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients may not have another malignancy that could interfere with the evaluation of&#xD;
             safety or efficacy of the study drug. Patients with a prior malignancy will be allowed&#xD;
             without approval in the following circumstances:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Not currently active and diagnosed at least 3 years prior to the date of&#xD;
                  registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Non-invasive diseases such as low risk cervical cancer or any cancer in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Localized (early stage) cancer treated with curative intent (without evidence of&#xD;
                  recurrence and intent for further therapy), and in which no chemotherapy was&#xD;
                  indicated.(e.g., low/intermediate risk prostate cancer, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) for which treatment was completed &gt;6&#xD;
                  months before the current diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patient has known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of CPX-POM.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patient is taking any iron replacement therapy administered IV, intramuscularly, or&#xD;
             orally due to the potential for loss of anticancer activity due to drug and/or&#xD;
             metabolites chelating iron.&#xD;
