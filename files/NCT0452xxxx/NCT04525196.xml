  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is known to increase the risk of developing many diseases as&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, some cancers, and other chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of the inactivity is even higher in a fragile population as patients with Chronic&#xD;
      Renal Failure (CRF) who need dialysis. This can lead to serious adverse events during the&#xD;
      lifetime of these patients, such as arteriopathy which can result in amputation,&#xD;
      deterioration of general condition, loss of independence and depression of wasting away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the need to promote physical activity in this population of hemodialysis patients&#xD;
      with CRF, little is known about the effects of a supervised physical activity conducted in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study, the investigators propose to assess the effects of a physical activity&#xD;
      program on several parameters, in hemodialysis subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The health risk of a sedentary and inactive lifestyle is known in the general population,&#xD;
      increasing the risk of diabetes (+ 25%), obesity, arterial hypertension, stroke, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and the development of certain cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedentary lifestyle therefore decreases longevity and life expectancy by 5 and 8 years&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, the benefits of physical activity (PA) are recognized (the list is not&#xD;
      exhaustive):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factor for improving physical capacity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preventive effect on many cardiovascular risk factors,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement of psychological well-being (anxiety, depression, stress, etc.),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive functions, reduction in the rate of certain cancers (colon and breast mainly),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction of oxidative stress. The High Authority of Health (HAS) recognizes physical&#xD;
           activity as a therapy on its own in the prevention of chronic diseases after having&#xD;
           noticed the harmful effects of physical inactivity (PI) on life expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PI is believed to be responsible for 1.9 million deaths worldwide each year, increasing&#xD;
      public health costs, estimated at 150-300 euros per year and per citizen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population of patients with Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) on dialysis has a low physical&#xD;
      capacity, a low level of PA decreasing as the number of years of dialysis increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These parameters are correlated with mortality: a critical number of steps of less than 4000&#xD;
      per day, or activity less than 50 minutes per day without dialysis significantly worsens&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between mortality and level of PA is linear and this linearity is maintained&#xD;
      over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRF and dialysis promote catabolic factors in metabolism, decline in muscle mass and strength&#xD;
      to sarcopenia (associated with inflammation, hypoandrogenism, intakes of inadequate protein,&#xD;
      metabolic acidosis, insulin resistance and inactivity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decline in physical performance promotes falls, fractures, loss of autonomy, the number&#xD;
      of hospitalizations which indirectly increases public health costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown the benefit of developing a per-dialytic PA program providing&#xD;
      benefits in quality of life, physical capacity, reduction of hypotension blood pressure,&#xD;
      depression, and VO2 max. Resistance exercise also improves muscle mass and strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PA acts as a cardioprotector by lowering total cholesterol, triglycerides, improving blood&#xD;
      pressure profile, and consequently reducing the number of cardiovascular events on a&#xD;
      follow-up of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the DOPPS 2009-2011 observational study demonstrates the link between the level of&#xD;
      physical aerobic activity and the parallel decline in mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, peripheral vascular and arterial complications are common in patients with CRF&#xD;
      and dialysis. The prevalence of symptomatic Obstructive Arterial Disease of the Lower Limbs&#xD;
      is estimated between 20% and 25% but it reaches 40% in the Japanese study of Matsuzawa, and&#xD;
      70% if associating the numerous asymptomatic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associated with the aging of the population and increasing sedentary lifestyle, we are faced&#xD;
      with the appearance of extremely serious ischemic trophic disorders, difficult to treat,&#xD;
      despite taking appropriate medical, surgical and cicatricial load often resulting in&#xD;
      amputation, deterioration of general condition, loss of independence, depression of wasting&#xD;
      away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also an increased risk of associated cardiovascular mortality even in asymptomatic&#xD;
      patients. The more severe the arterial disease is, greater the risk is. Thus, patients with&#xD;
      critical ischemia have a one-year mortality of 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the importance of these data, associated with the individual consequences following&#xD;
      amputations, the medical interest in this pathology is relatively low, and there are only few&#xD;
      studies in hemodialysis subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise, especially walking, is recommended for patients at the stage of intermittent&#xD;
      claudication. A meta-analysis performed in the general population showed that gait training&#xD;
      improved walking ability by 150%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the clinical benefit of a physical activity&#xD;
      program in terms of performance on the 6-minute walk test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the secondary objectives of this study will be to assess the impact of a PA program on&#xD;
      the occurrence of Obstructive Arterial Disease of the Lower Limbs. The investigators want to&#xD;
      check whether the implementation of a program of per-dialytic physical activity would improve&#xD;
      the microcirculation of the lower limbs and reduce the complications of arteritis.&#xD;

The experimental group will therefore be offered 3 sessions of Physical Activity (PA) per week. The PA will be positioned in the first two hours after the start of the dialysis session. Each session will include 5 minutes of general warm-up, then 15 minutes of PA itself and finally 5 minutes of cool down period. The PA time itself will be increased as the sessions progress, according to the progress and improvement of physical capabilities of patients.</description>
