  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesise that high dose RIF (RIF35) will increase pericardial fluid RIF&#xD;
      exposure and so enhance mycobacterial clearance, compared to standard of care dosing (RIF10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 2b randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial will evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of RIF 35mg/kg compared 10mg/kg, added to standard first-line ATT, for the&#xD;
      treatment of PCTB.&#xD;

      IMPI-3 - A Randomized Controlled Trial of High vs. Standard Dose Rifampicin for Effusive&#xD;
      Tuberculous Pericarditis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2b Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will enroll 100 adult participants with pericardial TB from two research sites in&#xD;
      South Africa, with no exclusions being made on the basis of sex/gender, racial or ethnic&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting participants will be stratified by HIV status and PCF GX-Ultra status, then&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to receive either standard of care anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT) or&#xD;
      standard of care plus high dose Rifampicin (RIF), both administered orally for 2 months,&#xD;
      followed by a continuation phase of 4 months' RH at standard doses.&#xD;

After signing the informed consent document; eligible participants will be stratified by HIV status and then further stratified by GX-Ultra status to ensure equal allocation regardless of HIV status and likely subsequent culture status.&#xD;
An electronic randomization tool will be used to randomize the subgroups in a 1:1 ratio. The randomization list will be generated and updated by the study coordinator, trial pharmacist, or statistician who will have no direct contact with trial participants or involvement with the assessment for eligibility in the trial.</intervention_model_description>

Blinding will be maintained by manufacture of placebo tablets similar in appearance and packaging to that of the study drug, with centralized dispensing by the study pharmacist.

    <description>Simulations were performed to determine the dose of RIF required to achieve the most equitable drug exposures across the weight range, 30 to 100 kg. Demographic data of a reference cohort of TB patients (n = 1225), with or without HIV-1 coinfection, recruited in clinical trials conducted in West Africa and South Africa were used for the simulations35-38. An additional 12 250 virtual patients were generated using the weight and height distributions of the 1225 patients to increase the number of patients with a weight close to the boundaries of the weight range. Parameter estimates of the population PK model for RIF were used to simulate (100 replicates) RIF exposures22. Four dosing scenarios were evaluated using the weight-band based dosing with 4-drug FDC tablets and extra RIF tablets with each tablet containing 150 mg or 600 mg RIF. The FDC tablets were assumed to have 20% reduced bioavailability based on data from a clinical trial where the same formulation was used39</description>
