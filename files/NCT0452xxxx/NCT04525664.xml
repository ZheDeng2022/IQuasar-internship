  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic dyspepsia, or a sensation of indigestion, remains an underdiagnosed and often&#xD;
      inappropriately managed cause of morbidity in countries with limited medical resources. A&#xD;
      recent questionnaire of Eastern Ugandan residents identified chronic dyspepsia as the most&#xD;
      bothersome symptom in nearly 60% of respondents, resulting in significant morbidity and work&#xD;
      days missed. One of the most common causes for chronic dyspepsia worldwide is infection with&#xD;
      the stomach-adapted bacterium Helicobacter pylori (Hp), the most significant risk factor for&#xD;
      the development of stomach cancer. In developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa, the prevalence of Hp has not been accurately determined, often owing to a lack of&#xD;
      adequate diagnostic methods. More importantly, proper diagnosis and treatment of chronic&#xD;
      dyspepsia would limit morbidity and mortality and help decrease the likelihood of progressing&#xD;
      to stomach cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study are to identify the prevalence of chronic dyspepsia among&#xD;
      residents of eastern Uganda using a questionnaire, to assess how common Hp infection is using&#xD;
      fecal Hp antigen test kits, and to evaluate the efficacy of Hp eradication using standard&#xD;
      Ugandan treatment guidelines. Participants who test positive for Hp infection by fecal Hp&#xD;
      antigen testing will be offered Hp eradication treatment in the form of two antibiotics&#xD;
      (clarithromycin, amoxicillin) and an acid-suppression medication (omeprazole), according to&#xD;
      the current Ugandan guidelines. Patients with chronic dyspepsia who are negative for Hp (by&#xD;
      fecal antigen testing) will be given a one-month trial of omeprazole alone, according to&#xD;
      current American College of Gastroenterology guidelines, and their symptoms will be&#xD;
      reassessed. At the end of the treatment regimens, participants will have the option to&#xD;
      complete a follow-up questionnaire and provide stool samples for fecal antigen testing (if&#xD;
      they were Hp-positive).&#xD;

      This will be a prospective, controlled study that will be conducted in the Namutumba&#xD;
      district. This district was selected because in a preliminary study, the prevalence of&#xD;
      dyspeptic symptoms in this district was found to be 57%. Namutumba District has a population&#xD;
      of slightly over 210,000 people. The prevalence of chronic dyspepsia and their associated&#xD;
      symptoms will be determined using a questionnaire administered to all willing participants.&#xD;
      All participants, regardless of symptoms, will also be offered fecal Hp antigen testing.&#xD;
      Participants found to be infected with Hp will be given a 14-day course of antibiotics, per&#xD;
      the current Ugandan standards of care, and assessed one month following completion of&#xD;
      treatment. Participants with chronic dyspepsia who are negative for Hp will be given daily&#xD;
      omeprazole for one month, and their symptoms will be assessed after one month.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>We will use the lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) method. Households will be selected through random sampling, and each household will be asked for a list of all people over eighteen years old. Then, a person in the household will be selected using random sampling methods and be asked if they wish to participate in the study. Willing participants will provide informed consent and will be given a questionnaire to identify common symptoms of dyspepsia . All participants who complete the questionnaire will also provide a stool specimen (if willing) for fecal antigen testing. Participants who underwent Hp eradication therapy or empiric omeprazole treatment will also be given the opportunity to complete a follow-up questionnaire following completion of their treatment regimen.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>4-6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who initially test positive for Helicobacter pylori by fecal antigen testing will receive treatment for 14 consecutive days. Two to four weeks following treatment completion, participants will repeat fecal antigen testing to confirm eradication of Helicobacter pylori. The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of participants who initially tested positive for Helicobacter pylori and were found to be negative at the end of the treatment regimen.</description>

    <description>We will assess the efficacy of empiric omeprazole treatment in participants with chronic dyspepsia who are negative for Helicobacter pylori by fecal antigen testing. Efficacy of treatment will be determined by a comparison of dyspepsia scores before and after treatment, as assessed by the validated dyspepsia questionnaire.</description>
