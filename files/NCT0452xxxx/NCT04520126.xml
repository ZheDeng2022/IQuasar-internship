  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Olive extracts are considered to have antioxidant properties. The investigators will study&#xD;
      the effect of olive extracts containing hydroxytyrosol on endothelial, cardiac and vascular&#xD;
      function in patients with coronary artery disease .&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 patients with stable angiographically documented coronary artery disease will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive olive extracts with high concentration of hydroxytyrosol (10 mg po&#xD;
      twice per day included in Olivomed capsules) or placebo for three months and then they will&#xD;
      be switched off to the alternate treatment (placebo or Olivomed capsules) for another 3&#xD;
      months&#xD;

    <time_frame>three months</time_frame>
    <description>Olivomed effects on endothelial function. Endothelial function is assessed by measuring Flow Mediated Vasodilation (FMD) of the brachial artery using ultrasonography. During FMD test, vasodilation occurs following an acute increase in blood flow, typically induced via circulatory arrest in the arm (supra-systolic cuff occlusion) for 5 minutes. FMD is the percent of increase of the brachial artery diameter during hyperemia after release of the occlusion.</description>
