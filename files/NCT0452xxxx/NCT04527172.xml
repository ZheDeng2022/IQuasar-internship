      This study aims to evaluate the rule of NMUS in detection of peripheral neuropathy in SLE&#xD;
      patient and to correlate it to traditional neurophysiological studies, clinical signs and&#xD;
      activity of SLE.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The frequency of SLE peripheral neuropathy documented by electrophysiology has been estimated&#xD;
      to be approximately 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term peripheral neuropathies include symmetric polyneuropathy, single and multiple&#xD;
      mononeuropathy, and radiculopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been increasing interest in using ultrasonography (US) to aid peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
      diagnosis and studies have shown good correlation with other imaging modalities. US is a&#xD;
      non-invasive and inexpensive imaging device that has become widely available as a diagnostic&#xD;
      tool at many fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      so systemic lupus patients were enrolled in the study , performed nerve conduction study and&#xD;
      neuromuscular ultrasound for bil. median, ulnar, peroneal, tibial and sural nerves , on&#xD;
      statistics the cross sections were compared in neurophusiologically affected and non affected&#xD;
      nerves, also the sensitivity and specifity of NMUS in comparison to the traditional NCS was&#xD;
      calculated&#xD;

    <ipd_description>the priciple investigator only will know the results of neurophysiology done to the patients then the images were furtherly evaluated (offline) by another expert rheumatologist who was blinded to both clinical and electrophysiological data of the patients. Any conflict in reporting was refered to a third expert rheumatologist to put the final decision.</ipd_description>
