  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are many limitations in the current treatments of Inflammatory bowel disease(IBD). Some&#xD;
      patients have no or little reaction to the traditional drugs. Now the investigators realized&#xD;
      that the intestinal microbiota is closely associated with the development of IBD. In recent&#xD;
      years, a retrospective study showed that the overall efficiency of fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplantation (FMT) for IBD was 79%, the overall remission rate was 43%, which opened a new&#xD;
      chapter in the treatment of IBD. So the standardized fecal microbiota transplantation is&#xD;
      considered to be simple but effective emerging therapies for the treatment of IBD. In this&#xD;
      project the investigators intend to carry out a single-center, randomized, single-blind&#xD;
      clinical intervention study. The investigators plan to recruit patients with IBD (Ulcerative&#xD;
      Colitis and Crohn's Disease) in China. The patients will be randomly divided into two groups,&#xD;
      one group will be given treatment of standardized fecal microbiota transplantation, the other&#xD;
      will be simply treated with traditional drugs, followed up for at least 1 year. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to determine the efficiency, durability and safety of Fecal Microbiota&#xD;
      Transplantation for IBD treatment, and further to explore which major microbiota may effect&#xD;
      in this project.&#xD;

      In this projects the investigators aim to re-establish a gut balance of intestinal microbiota&#xD;
      through Standardized Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for IBD (UC and CD). We have&#xD;
      established a standardized isolation, store, and transport steps of fecal bacteria from&#xD;
      donated fresh stool in the laboratory. Then the bacteria will be transplanted to mid-gut by&#xD;
      capsule. Patients in this study will be assigned to receive standardized FMT three times or&#xD;
      not and would be followed up for at least 1 year. The clinical symptoms, sign, blood tests,&#xD;
      endoscopy and questionnaire will be used to assess the efficiency, durability and safety of&#xD;
      Standardized FMT at the start and end of the projects. At last, we will use 16S-rDNA to&#xD;
      estimate the change of intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
