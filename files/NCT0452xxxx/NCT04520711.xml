  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/Ib study of adoptively transferred T-cell receptor gene-engineered T cells&#xD;
      (TCR-T) targeting tumor-specific antigens, with in vivo CD40 activation and PD-1 blockade,&#xD;
      for patients with incurable cancers. The study design is a safety lead-in TCR-T with&#xD;
      CD40/PD-1 (3+3), followed by Simon's Two-Stage expansion design, 80% power and 5% one-sided&#xD;
      alpha: stage-one futility assessment at n = 10; stage-two assessment at n = 22, (accrual up&#xD;
      to 24 to allow for potential study drop-out).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be infused with T cells engineered to express TCRs targeting one to five&#xD;
      tumor-specific antigens expressed by their autologous tumor. The number of T cells infused&#xD;
      will range from 1e9 to 1e11. Monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1 (pembrolizumab) and CD40&#xD;
      (CDX-1140, Celldex Therapeutics)43 will be administered, in that order, starting within 24&#xD;
      hours of cell infusion and re-administered at approximately 3 week intervals. Clinic visits&#xD;
      will include longitudinal evaluation of toxicities and monitoring of immunological&#xD;
      parameters. The presence or absence of replication competent retrovirus (RCR) will be&#xD;
      evaluated for the first year following adoptive cell transfer, or longer, if there is&#xD;
      evidence of RCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor Response assessment by RECIST 1.1 is performed every 9-12 weeks. Study treatment&#xD;
      continues until progression. Option repeat TCR-T infusion is allowed and in addition may&#xD;
      incorporate preconditioning chemotherapy using a de-intensified non-myeloablative (NMA)&#xD;
      regimen consisting of a single dose of gemcitabine and a single dose of either&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide or epirubicin, designed to elicit immunogenic cell death and transient&#xD;
      lymphopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of the adoptive transfer of&#xD;
      TCR-gene engineered T cells targeting TSA in combination with CD40 and PD-1 immunotherapy.&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to determine whether this therapy can mediate objective clinical&#xD;
      responses as determined by objective criteria (e.g. RECIST 1.1). The study will also&#xD;
      characterize the differentiation and functional state of the TCR-gene modified T cells before&#xD;
      and after cell therapy and monitor their persistence in the patient after treatment. Up to 24&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in this study. Based on published trials treating patients with&#xD;
      TCR-transduced T cells, adverse events such as fever, chills, dyspnea, hypotension, fatigue,&#xD;
      edema, rash, and rarely acute cytokine release syndrome, may occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and immunological data will be analyzed which will determine whether this therapy is&#xD;
      safe and effective, and whether there are biomarkers or immunological signatures that&#xD;
      correlate to efficacy and/or lack of efficacy. This data will determine whether additional&#xD;
      studies are warranted.&#xD;

        diarrhea, active noninfectious pneumonitis, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
        would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs&#xD;
        or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of another primary malignancy except for:&#xD;
&#xD;

        exception of vitiligo, alopecia, and the laboratory values defined in the inclusion&#xD;
        criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with Grade ≥2 neuropathy will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis after&#xD;
        consultation with the Principal Investigator or one of the Co-Principal Investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with irreversible toxicity not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by study&#xD;
        treatment may be included only after consultation with the Principal Investigator or one of&#xD;
        the Co-Principal Investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;

        with a history of myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident, thrombosis or&#xD;
        pulmonary embolus within 12 months prior to the first dose of study treatment are excluded&#xD;
        from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that&#xD;
        could increase the risk associated with trial participation or trial drug administration or&#xD;
        could interfere with the interpretation of trial results and, in the judgment of the&#xD;
        investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who are pregnant, lactating or expecting to conceive, or men who father children&#xD;
        within the projected duration of the study.&#xD;
