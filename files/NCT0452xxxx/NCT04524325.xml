  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to explore the effects of chronic androgen exposure on&#xD;
      sympathetic nervous system activity (SNSA) and baroreflex control of blood pressure responses&#xD;
      in transgender men (trans men) taking gender affirming hormone therapy (HT). Blood pressure,&#xD;
      baroreflex gain, and frequency of sympathetic responses to changes in blood pressure will be&#xD;
      assessed in trans men and a control group of cisgender women. To fully understand HT effects&#xD;
      on blood pressure regulation in trans men, it is crucial to understand how both SNSA, and the&#xD;
      pattern of SNSA, can be influenced by high levels of androgen exposure in the female&#xD;
      cardiovascular system, as well as how the two regulatory components may interact.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study how testosterone affects blood pressure control in&#xD;
      trans men. High testosterone levels are detrimental to the female cardiovascular system in&#xD;
      that higher levels are associated with increased blood pressure. Humans control blood&#xD;
      pressure in the autonomic nervous system via the baroreflex mechanism. The arterial&#xD;
      baroreflex is a key autonomic homeostatic mechanism involved in maintaining arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure, and gain of the baroreflex is used as a measure of the sensitivity of sympathetic&#xD;
      responses that act to restore acute blood pressure fluctuations. This autonomic regulation of&#xD;
      blood pressure is also characterized by rhythmic activity (changes in cardiac frequency),&#xD;
      which can be observed by recording sympathetic nerve traffic. When the female cardiovascular&#xD;
      system is exposed to elevated androgens, baroreflex gain is impaired, and blood control is&#xD;
      less efficient during an orthostatic challenge. However, to best understand the effect of a&#xD;
      given stimulus on autonomic function, changes in frequency of the SNSA response must also be&#xD;
      quantified in addition to the gain. Sympathetic control of arterial blood pressure is most&#xD;
      effective in a narrow frequency range, and if this frequency range for responsiveness should&#xD;
      narrow further, control of arterial blood pressure becomes less efficient and presents as&#xD;
      dysfunction. The central hypothesis for this research is that dysregulation of blood pressure&#xD;
      in trans men taking testosterone for gender affirming HT is a function of both reduced&#xD;
      baroreflex gain and narrowed frequency-dependent relationship between arterial pressure and&#xD;
      peripheral sympathetic vascular responsiveness. Specifically, these studies test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that androgen supplementation with HT is associated with 1) lower baroreflex gain&#xD;
      during a lower body negative pressure (LBNP) challenge, and 2) a narrowed response frequency&#xD;
      range that precedes impaired sympathetic vascular response dynamics in trans men compared to&#xD;
      control cisgender women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures include an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), microneurography of the&#xD;
      median nerve in the forearm to assess SNSA, and 2 LBNP challenges designed to examine&#xD;
      baroreflex gain during static LBNP and then the frequency of SNSA during oscillating LBNP&#xD;
      (OLBNP). Participants complete 3 visits for this study. Visit 1 is for informed consent&#xD;
      procedures; Visit 2 is a pre-screening visit to complete the OGTT; Visit 3 is for&#xD;
      experimental testing to assess gain and the frequency range. Blood pressure, heart rate and&#xD;
      muscle SNSA (MSNA) are measured during LBNP and OLBNP. MSNA is recorded using 2&#xD;
      microelectrodes inserted through the skin of the forearm to record activity (firing) of the&#xD;
      median nerve. Blood samples are taken via IV placement to measure insulin and glucose during&#xD;
      the OGTT for Visit 2, and then sex hormones and catecholamines during Visit 3. Results from&#xD;
      the group of young trans men will be compared to a control group of cisgender women matched&#xD;
      for age and body mass index.&#xD;

    <measure>Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity (MSNA)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>MSNA is recorded continuously at rest and during O/LBNP protocols with a tungsten microelectrode (0.2 diameters insulated shaft tapered to an uninsulated tip of ~1-5 μm) inserted percutaneously into the median nerve. Multiunit, postganglionic MSNA is distinguished from other sources of nerve activity by the presence of spontaneous pulse synchronous bursts, increased activity when the subject holds their breath or clenches their first (stretches forearm muscles around median nerve), or if activity does not change when the skin is stimulated by light brushing or stroking (indicates lack of skin nerve activity). Bursts of MSNA at rest and during LBNP are quantified as total activity (AU/min), burst frequency (bursts/min) and burst incidence (bursts/100 heartbeats). The MSNA burst incidence is expressed in bursts/100 heartbeats to normalize for differences in heart rate among subjects.</description>

    <measure>Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>SBP is measured continuously with a Finometer beat-to-beat blood pressure measurement system at rest and during O/LBNP protocols. Units are mm Hg.</description>

    <measure>Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>DBP is measured continuously with a Finometer beat-to-beat blood pressure measurement system at rest and during O/LBNP protocols. Units are mm Hg.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>MAP at rest and during O/LBNP protocols is calculated as 1/3(SBP-DBP)+DBP using the beat-to-beat SBP and DBP measurements taken with the Finometer system. Units are mm Hg.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sympathetic Baroreflex (BR) Gain</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Sympathetic BR gain is used as an index of sympathetic (neural) control of blood pressure, where gain is determined by the slope of the linear relationship between MSNA (burst/100 heartbeats) and DBP (mm Hg) at rest and during LBNP. The relationship produces a negative slope in that for a given subject, when DBP falls below the normal level sustained at rest, sympathetic activity increases to restore DBP back to that normal level. Thus, more MSNA bursts are observed at lower levels of DBP and vice versa. A steeper (more negative) slope suggests greater sensitivity of the baroreceptors to changes in blood pressure, and thereby more effective sympathetic control of blood pressure. A flatter slope suggests impaired BR sensitivity and blood pressure dysfunction, which is expected for the trans men group compared to cisgender women controls.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency in the Neural Cardiovascular Control</measure>
    <time_frame>0.5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of SBP, DBP and heart rate during OLBNP is analyzed in Matlab in a linear time-invariant system (LTI) framework. Heart rate and BP measures taken during OLBNP are low-pass filtered (0.05 Hz estimated example) and corrected for end-effects using a Hamming window. The derived impulse responses (IRs) are 1/3rd octave smoothed before calculating the frequency power spectra (0.001-0.05 Hz estimated example). The power of DBP and SBP at the OLBNP frequency are anticipated to be independently inversely related to the efficiency of BP control. Further, the difference in heart rate and SBP, and in heart rate and DBP, power at those frequencies reflects the degree of autonomic function, analogous to baroreflex gain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Electrocardiogram (ECG)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>A 3-lead ECG is continuously recorded at rest and during the O/LBNP protocols. The R-wave of the QRS complex of the ECG recording will be used for measures of pulse interval by determining the amount of time in seconds between the R-waves of 2 consecutive QRS complexes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brachial Artery Mean Blood Flow Velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Mean blood flow velocity in the brachial artery will be examined at rest and during LBNP using Doppler ultrasound velocimetry. Blood flow velocity spectra and arterial diameter are measured simultaneously with a Doppler probe and SonoScape S2 ultrasound system. The brachial artery is imaged with a 6.0-MHz linear array probe positioned at a 45° angle over the skin at the distal one-third of the upper arm. Brachial blood flow is expected to decrease as the level of LBNP increases and induces a greater orthostatic challenge. For example, blood flow would be highest at the -10LBNP stage and continually decrease during the following stages of -20, -30 and finally -40LBNP, where blood flow would be the lowest.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiovagal Baroreflex (BR) Gain</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiovagal BR gain is determined by the slope of the linear relationship between R-R Interval (seconds) and SBP (mm Hg) at rest and during LBNP. R-R Intervals are obtained from the ECG recording and SBP is obtained from the beat-to-beat measures taken by the Finometer.</description>
