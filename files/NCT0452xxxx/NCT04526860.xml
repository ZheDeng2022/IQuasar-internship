  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global obesity epidemic has extended to low and middle income countries (LMICs) in which&#xD;
      in a dramatic nutritional transition has shifted from maternal/child undernutrition to&#xD;
      overnutrition. Within Brazil, maternal overweight/obesity (OW/OB) and childhood obesity have&#xD;
      dramatically increased. During developmental periods, exposure to maternal OB and high-fat&#xD;
      diet increases the risk of childhood and adult obesity, in part a result of increased food&#xD;
      intake. Studies confirm that offspring of overweight and obese (OW/OB) women are at increased&#xD;
      risk of newborn and age 1 year adiposity, and infant adiposity predicts childhood and adult&#xD;
      obesity. The investigators hypothesize that that infants of OW/OB mothers have both relative&#xD;
      increased appetite and are provided human milk with increased caloric composition. The&#xD;
      investigators propose that calibrating milk or formula intake in infants of overweight&#xD;
      mothers can reduce the incidence of infant obesity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical intervention study to calibrate infant milk or formula intake and modulate&#xD;
      infant weight gain to prevent the development of infant obesity. The studies will be&#xD;
      performed at the Ana Abrão Breastfeeding Center, Federal University of São Paulo, Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postpartum women will be with pre-pregnant BMI 30 who are providing exclusive human milk via&#xD;
      pumping and bottle (n = 50; 50 percent male and 50 percent female) will be recruited at the&#xD;
      7-9 week postpartum visit, Study women will be randomly assigned (computer generated; blocks&#xD;
      of 10) to a Standard Feed (SF) or Calibrated Feed (CF) groups. Both groups will be seen at 2&#xD;
      week intervals for assessment of infant weight, supine length, BMI and skinfold thickness.&#xD;
      Continuation of exclusive human milk will be confirmed with questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SF group, mothers will provide bottled human milk ad libitum. In the CF group, infant&#xD;
      weight will be assessed in relation to the daily milk volume and approximate caloric intake&#xD;
      (based upon maternal human milk sample analysis). Should infants be within 10th to 90th&#xD;
      percentile of WHO BMI growth curves, no intervention will be made. Should the infant be&#xD;
      greater than 90th percentile of WHO BMI, the provided human milk volume and daily calorie&#xD;
      intake will be adjusted in relation to previously established normal volumes for newborn age,&#xD;
      with the input of pediatric physician. In no case, will the daily milk volume or calorie&#xD;
      intake be reduced by more than 10%. At the subsequent visit, adjustments in milk volume and&#xD;
      calorie intake will continue, dependent upon the infant BMI trend, accommodating the normal&#xD;
      increase in milk intake with advancing age. Should the infant be less than 10th percentile of&#xD;
      WHO BMI, the maternal- infant dyad will be referred for a pediatric and nutrition consults to&#xD;
      assess the cause and treatment for potential nutrient deficiency. At 26 wks, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess the distribution of infant weight BMI between SF and CF groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An identical Study will be undertaken (Standard Feed and Calibrated Feed), with the exception&#xD;
      that only current formula feed mothers will be enrolled. All women will be provided a&#xD;
      standard brand of commercial formula feed, for which total caloric content and composition&#xD;
      will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis. The investigators will compare standard feed vs calibrated feed infant BMI&#xD;
      curves with repeated measures ANOVA (time, BMI) with covariates of the group assignment. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare infant weight and BMI curves by maternal BMI and infant birth&#xD;
      weight, and between human milk and formula groups. The investigators will analyze growth&#xD;
      curves of infants exceeding WHO standards which received adjustments in feedings to assess if&#xD;
      early changes in growth curves or milk composition is predictive of weight changes, so as to&#xD;
      determine the potential for interventions prior to 90th percentile.&#xD;
