      Reduxium is a dietary supplement that provides immune support. This natural compound is&#xD;
      orally-ingested in the form of droplets in water to boost the immune system and control&#xD;
      inflammation. There is not enough data on the mechanism associated with the action of&#xD;
      Reduxium or the extent of the immune response increase it produces. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators propose treating a group of healthy volunteers with Reduxium and investigate&#xD;
      the utility of this approach in boosting the native and adaptive immune responses that&#xD;
      correlate with immune protection. This may form the basis for a future study employing the&#xD;
      product in infectious disease patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      With the global population increasingly exposed to pandemic crises, permanent and expedient&#xD;
      solutions are needed at an affordable cost. Vaccination is less than ideal as the virus is&#xD;
      prone to a mutation that renders the previous generation of vaccine less effective. Epidemic&#xD;
      and pandemic of viruses infection has become more common and affects both developed and less&#xD;
      developed communities. Overcrowding and poor hygiene have been cited to be the major factors&#xD;
      in these epidemics, but the host immune system and the ability of the human system to ward&#xD;
      off virus infection is a factor less mentioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition is a critical determinant of immune responses and malnutrition the most common&#xD;
      cause of immunodeficiency worldwide. Protein-energy malnutrition is associated with a&#xD;
      significant impairment of cell-mediated immunity, phagocyte function, complement system,&#xD;
      secretory immunoglobulin A antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Deficiency of&#xD;
      single nutrients also results in altered immune responses: this is observed even when the&#xD;
      deficiency state is relatively mild. Of the micronutrients, zinc; selenium; iron; copper;&#xD;
      vitamins A, C, E, and B6; and folic acid have important influences on immune responses.&#xD;
      Adequate intake of vitamins B6, folate, B12, C, E, and of selenium, zinc, copper, and iron&#xD;
      supports a Th1 cytokine-mediated immune response with sufficient production of&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines, which maintains an effective immune response and avoids a shift to&#xD;
      an anti-inflammatory Th2 cell-mediated immune response and an increased risk of extracellular&#xD;
      infections. Supplementation with these micronutrients reverses the Th2 cell-mediated immune&#xD;
      response to a proinflammatory Th1 cytokine-regulated response with enhanced innate immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduxium, a dietary supplement that provides immune support, is a low-cost candidate to boost&#xD;
      immune response. Reduxium is a natural compound commercialised in the USA that helps restore&#xD;
      homeostasis and controls inflammation. As no toxins or allergens are used, but purely food&#xD;
      grade compounds, it is classified as a dietary supplement. Its current purpose is not to&#xD;
      treat, diagnose, prevent or cure any disease, but it has immunomodulatory properties.&#xD;
      Reduxium is manufactured using a proprietary reactor - a &quot;biochemical cavitation mixer&quot; that&#xD;
      allows to create a &quot;smart small molecule&quot;. The principal device belongs to the cavitation&#xD;
      technology family and is used for the intensification of technological processes in liquid&#xD;
      media (liquid processing, splitting of complex molecules, &quot;cold&quot; pasteurization, destruction&#xD;
      of solid inclusions). The usage of this process technology enables compression of a set of&#xD;
      molecules to 1/12th their original size. Its components are: Phosphoric Acid (58%),&#xD;
      Microelement Complex (33.6%) (Zinc, Copper, Iron Pyrophosphate, Potassium, Calcium, Silica,&#xD;
      Glycyrrhizic Acid (8.4%). The Microelement Complex is made up of a homogenized complex with&#xD;
      special indication, pH =0.0008-0.4, waterless in the final composition.The complex molecules&#xD;
      generated scan at the cellular level for the presence of pathogenic (bacterial, viral,&#xD;
      fungal) etiologies by reading the characteristics of the electron proton (KNa) pump on the&#xD;
      membrane. If these characteristics are violated, the supplement &quot;enters&quot; the cell. At the&#xD;
      intra-cellular level, the supplement scans the cell in search of pathology; this &quot;scanning&#xD;
      process&quot; is made on the basis of selectivity (healthy - do not touch/ill - induce apoptosis)&#xD;
      through the mechanism of mitochondria activity. Specifically, the complex molecules start a&#xD;
      cascade of biochemical processes (switching to mitochondria aerobic oxidation, restarting the&#xD;
      methyl group with the &quot;epigenetic&quot; effects on DNA, apoptosis). It is unclear how and to which&#xD;
      extent this mechanism contributes to innate immune activation following cellular damage and&#xD;
      stress, or how it contributes to the adaptive immune response of T and B cells. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to analyse the changes in the immune responses after two weeks of Reduxium&#xD;
      intake.The secondary objective is to analyse the safety and tolerability of Reduxium.&#xD;
