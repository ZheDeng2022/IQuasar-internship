  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most cancer-related deaths are caused by distant metastases, which are tumour cells that have&#xD;
      escaped from a primary tumour and passed into the bloodstream to colonize a new organ. In&#xD;
      this context, communication between tumour and stromal cells is essential. Indeed, tumor&#xD;
      cells interact with cells in the tumor microenvironment and are able to modify them to their&#xD;
      advantage. Both extracellular vesicles (EVs) and exosomes are heterogeneous populations of&#xD;
      small vesicles present in the tumor microenvironment and in body fluids that have recently&#xD;
      emerged as powerful mediators involved in this communication and their transport in fluids.&#xD;
      Tumor cells release large quantities of exosomes containing tumor markers, which can then&#xD;
      spread to distant locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exosomes are of endosomal origin. They are composed of proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA, and&#xD;
      they circulate in the bloodstream. They can be internalized by specific distant cells and&#xD;
      thus deliver a functional message. It has recently been shown that tumor exosomes containing&#xD;
      pro-metastatic factors form pre-metastatic niches, before the tumor cells actually arrive,&#xD;
      while determining the metastatic organotropism of tumors. These properties are now opening up&#xD;
      new avenues of research in tumor biomarkers. In recent years, several studies have&#xD;
      highlighted different markers contained specifically in exosomes derived from cancer cells.&#xD;
      Consequently, exosomes are considered as potential reservoirs of tumor biomarkers that could&#xD;
      be clinically useful for the non-invasive diagnosis of cancer, with the advantage of being&#xD;
      performed by liquid biopsy. The study of microRNA (miRNA) is of particular interest. Indeed,&#xD;
      miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs (between 21 and 25 nucleotides) involved in the regulation&#xD;
      of gene expression and which are frequently deregulated in cancer. Several studies underline&#xD;
      that the variation of free miRNAs in the blood is correlated with the progression of the&#xD;
      disease, particularly in colon cancer. However, the stability of free miRNAs is&#xD;
      controversial. Therefore, exosomes represent a very advantageous means of transporting miRNAs&#xD;
      in the blood, as they are able to protect miRNAs from degradation by RNAase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the project is that circulating exosomes derived from tumours contain&#xD;
      markers including specific miRNAs that could be used as biomarkers of early prognosis&#xD;
      (survival and progression), easily measured in blood samples from patients with colon cancer.&#xD;
      But other molecules contained in exosomes could also be of interest.&#xD;
