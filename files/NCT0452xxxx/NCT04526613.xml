  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 2 billion people worldwide are infected with tuberculosis (TB). Ninety percent of those&#xD;
      people have latent TB infection (LTBI). Risk factors like malnutrition, diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (DM), and helminth infection can affect the development of active TB. Researchers want to&#xD;
      study LTBI individuals with these issues to see how they may contribute to a person s higher&#xD;
      risk for developing active TB. This study will take place in Chennai, India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the prevalence of malnutrition, DM, and helminth infections in people with LTBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 14 65 with or without LTBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam focused on symptoms of&#xD;
      active TB. Those who have TB symptoms will not take part in the study. Those who do not have&#xD;
      TB symptoms will have a physical exam with vital signs, height, and weight. They will give&#xD;
      blood and stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to 1 of 6 groups. They will repeat some of the screening tests.&#xD;
      They will give urine samples. Some groups will have a chest X-ray. Some groups will have an&#xD;
      ultrasound of the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a survey about their history of smoking and drug and alcohol use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have data collected about their nutritional status and body composition.&#xD;
      Their skinfold thickness, ratio of waist/hip circumference, and grip strength will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with DM, malnutrition, or helminth infection will be given standard of care or&#xD;
      referred for follow-up treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last up to 6 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Approximately 2 billion people worldwide are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB),&#xD;
      with 90% of individuals having latent infection (LTBI). The control of TB requires clearly&#xD;
      delineated helper T cell (Th) 1 responses and, to a lesser extent, Th17 responses, which both&#xD;
      play important roles in the induction and maintenance of protective immune responses in mouse&#xD;
      models of TB infection and in the prevention of active disease, as seen in LTBI. During&#xD;
      latency, M. tuberculosis is contained in localized granulomas. Mycobacteria-specific T cells&#xD;
      mediate delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to purified protein derivative (PPD), and&#xD;
      this reaction is generally considered to indicate an LTBI status in the absence of&#xD;
      demonstrable active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the various risk factors that are known to play a role in promoting active TB, HIV is&#xD;
      the most well studied and described. However, in low-HIV-endemic countries like India, other&#xD;
      risk factors might play a more prominent role in active TB pathogenesis. These include&#xD;
      malnutrition, diabetes mellitus (DM), and helminth infections. LTBI individuals with these&#xD;
      comorbidities or coinfections could be at a higher risk for developing active TB than their&#xD;
      healthy LTBI counterparts without these comorbidities. Thus, it is imperative to study the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of TB infection and disease in these at-risk populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will estimate the prevalence of severe to moderate malnutrition,&#xD;
      uncontrolled DM, and helminth infections in LTBI-positive individuals. We will collect&#xD;
      samples from a cohort of individuals with LTBI, those with LTBI and coexistent malnutrition,&#xD;
      DM, or helminth coinfection, and those without any of these conditions. Individual&#xD;
      participation may last up to 6 months. The main objective of the study is to estimate the&#xD;
      prevalence of malnutrition, DM, and helminth infections in LTBI individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneously, we will perform transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic assays, including&#xD;
      profiles in serum and urine, to determine the biosignature portfolio of these individuals. In&#xD;
      addition, immunological assays examining cytokine/chemokine signatures as well as other&#xD;
      immune parameters related to innate and adaptive responses will be performed to enhance the&#xD;
      understanding of the immunological cross-talk between LTBI and malnutrition, DM, and helminth&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
