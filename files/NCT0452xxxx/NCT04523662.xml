  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Literature has shown that radiotherapy can promote tumor antigen presentation, mobilize and&#xD;
      activate T cells by enhancing activation signals and blocking inhibitory signals. It can also&#xD;
      lead to the normalization of blood vessels in the tumor microenvironment and the increase of&#xD;
      CXCL16 and other chemokines to activate T cells. The cells infiltrate the tumor tissues&#xD;
      better and promote the killing activity of T cells. Therefore, the combined application of&#xD;
      radiotherapy and immunotherapy may have a synergistic effect. Apatinib is a small molecule&#xD;
      tyrosine protein kinase inhibitor for VEGFR. Low-dose apatinib can induce the normalization&#xD;
      of abnormal blood vessels in tumors, effectively increase the infiltration of lymphocytes in&#xD;
      tumor tissues, and block immunosuppressive myeloid cells. Recruitment, reverse the&#xD;
      immunosuppressive state, effectively reduce the level of TGF-β, and make the tumor&#xD;
      environment tend to have an immune support phenotype. Apatinib combined with PD-1 antibody&#xD;
      karelizumab has been confirmed in a phase I study to have good efficacy and safety in&#xD;
      patients with advanced liver cancer. Therefore, this study intends to use the PD-1 antibody&#xD;
      carrelizumab combined with apatinib and radiotherapy to treat patients with advanced liver&#xD;
      cancer with extrahepatic metastasis, to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the combined&#xD;
      therapy, and to provide new clinical treatments for liver cancer Evidence-based medicine.&#xD;
