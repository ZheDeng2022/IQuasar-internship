    <textblock>
      This phase I trial investigates a new smartphone application (called Actify) for improving&#xD;
      population-level smoking cessation and mood management. Actify delivers behavioral activation&#xD;
      therapy for depression as part of a smoking cessation intervention and will be compared to&#xD;
      another smoking cessation smartphone application that is based on current clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of two smartphone&#xD;
      applications and accompanying text messages to help with quitting smoking and improved mood.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Participants use Actify app for smoking cessation for 8 weeks. Participants also&#xD;
      receive motivational messages and smoking cessation information via text messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Participants use United States (US) Clinical Practice Guidelines (USCPG) app for&#xD;
      smoking cessation for 8 weeks. Participants also receive motivational messages and smoking&#xD;
      cessation information via text messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>Satisfaction will be assessed with 8 items covering both overall satisfaction and satisfaction with specific app components. The satisfaction survey contains forced-choice response items assessing overall satisfaction, whether participants would recommend the program to a friend, and satisfaction with the program's content, organization, and ease of use. Open-ended questions will inquire about what participants liked most and least about their assigned intervention</description>

    <description>The BADS is a 25-item scale used to track changes in behaviors hypothesized to underlie depression and specifically targeted for change by behavior activation.
