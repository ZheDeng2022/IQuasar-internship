    <textblock>
      Since the 60's and 70's, the soar of audiovisual technologies allowed the development of&#xD;
      virtual reality (VR). These technologies were then adapted to help reducing anxiety and pain&#xD;
      during medical procedures. For visual or audio stimulation, the use of glasses or helmet is&#xD;
      frequent. However, little is know about the efficacy of technologies which are not isolating&#xD;
      the patient from his real environment during medical care. With this study, the investigators&#xD;
      will assess the impact of this kind of sensitive stimulation without isolating the patient,&#xD;
      on reducing the anxiety during intravenous treatment in patients with cancer. The machine the&#xD;
      investigators are using is projecting relaxing nature movies on the ceiling of the room, with&#xD;
      nature sounds or relaxing music.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of cancer and the treatments used may be the cause, for the patient, of a&#xD;
      significant emotional and psychological anxiety. For many years, several studies have&#xD;
      evaluated the impact of visual and sensitive techniques on the well-being of the patient:&#xD;
      landscaping of gardens,use of positive distraction means (decoration, brightness of spaces,&#xD;
      photographs, layout of natural scenes, aquarium installation, etc.). The objective of these&#xD;
      studies was to give to the patient a contact with nature reinforcing the positive emotions&#xD;
      and reducing stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized study including 37 patients who will undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy of&#xD;
      diagnosis, to receive during the intervention, audio stimulation, audio and visual&#xD;
      stimulation by glasses (Virtual IO, 1000 Leonora), or no stimulation. Audio and visual&#xD;
      stimulation reduced abdominal discomfort (measured using visual analog scale VAS) and a&#xD;
      decrease in anxiety (measured by the Stress Symptom Ratings scale) compared to the group&#xD;
      without stimulation (p &lt;0.05), but without solid evidence given the small number of patients&#xD;
      with an imprecise randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other distraction systems using paintings of nature scenes combined with a listening to the&#xD;
      sounds of nature were used during bronchoscopy: 80 patients were randomized (distraction&#xD;
      systems versus control group without stimulation): the decrease in pain (rated on a 5-point&#xD;
      scale from poor to excellent) was significantly greater in the intervention versus control&#xD;
      group (p &lt;0.015). There was no significant effect on anxiety measured by the S-STAI scale&#xD;
      compared to the control group (with a 6 point difference between groups). Another Chinese&#xD;
      prospective randomized controlled trial (Lee et al. 2004), conducted on 165 patients, has&#xD;
      shown that visual and audio distraction (by Eyetrek system, Olympus) could reduce the need&#xD;
      for sedatives used during colonoscopy compared to the group with visual distraction only and&#xD;
      in the distraction-free control group (p &lt;0.01). From the years 1960-1970, the development of&#xD;
      digital audiovisual technologies allowed to develop virtual reality techniques. The term&#xD;
      &quot;virtual reality&quot; (VR) refers to a computer technology that simulates artificially the user's&#xD;
      environment, with which the user can interact. In oncology, virtual reality (VR) techniques&#xD;
      have been used in 3 situations :&#xD;
&#xD;
      - during painful procedures: A randomized controlled study conducted on 30 adolescents with&#xD;
      cancer who will undergo a lumbar puncture, analyzed the impact of VR glasses on pain assessed&#xD;
      by VAS and the feedback of the patients. There was no statistically significant difference&#xD;
      between 2 groups but pain scores were lower in the VR group (The mean VAS in the VR group was&#xD;
      7 points with a range ranging from 0 to 48 while in the control group the average was 9&#xD;
      points with a range from 0 to 59).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another randomized study conducted on 59 children with cancer whose treatments required&#xD;
      access to a subcutaneous venous device assessed the value of VR distraction, non-virtual&#xD;
      distraction and the absence of distraction. Reductions in pain and anxiety have been observed&#xD;
      (measured by VAS) in children using VR distraction but were not significant given the small&#xD;
      sample size. However the reduction of the heart rate was significant in the VR distraction&#xD;
      group (p &lt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      - during hospitalization: This situation is considered stressful because it is linked to a&#xD;
      change in the state of health and because it introduces stressful conditions like lack of&#xD;
      autonomy, privacy, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study showed on 19 hospitalized patients with metastatic cancer, exposed to 4 sessions of&#xD;
      30 minutes for 1 week with a VR headset, an increase in joy over the 4 sessions (before and&#xD;
      after the test, p &lt;0.009) and a decrease in sadness over the 2nd session (before and after&#xD;
      the test, p &lt;0.003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study showed on 33 hospitalized patients with metastatic cancer under the same&#xD;
      conditions as the Banos study, an increase in positive emotions and a decrease in negative&#xD;
      emotions after each session (p &lt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      - during the chemotherapy infusion to reduce the symptoms related to the treatment or&#xD;
      disease: A study evaluated the interest of VR by head-mounted display (Sony PC Glasstron&#xD;
      PLM-S700) in 16 women aged 50 years and older during chemotherapy infusions. The symptoms&#xD;
      such as anxiety and fatigue were assessed (STAI scale and revised Piper scale PFS). Patients&#xD;
      were randomized to 2 chemotherapy sessions with the use of VR head-mounted display for one&#xD;
      session and without stimulation for the other session. A decrease in anxiety immediately&#xD;
      after the session was shown in this small number of patients (p = 0.10). On the other hand,&#xD;
      there was no difference for fatigue but the study was carried out only on one session of RV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was showed a benefit of VR in 123 patients with breast, lung or colon cancer, receiving 2&#xD;
      chemotherapy sessions: participants were randomized according to a cross-over design in order&#xD;
      to receive the VR intervention (by i-Glasses SVGA HeadMounted Display helmet) during one&#xD;
      chemotherapy session and to receive during the other session no VR intervention (control&#xD;
      arm), each patient being their own control. This technique was using a laptop, VR headset,&#xD;
      and software. The Symptom Distress Scale was used to assess symptoms of distress immediately&#xD;
      after the session and 48 hours after the session. No significant difference was found for the&#xD;
      symptoms of distress between the session receiving the VR intervention and the session not&#xD;
      receiving the intervention of VR. However, the study only assessed the use of VR over a&#xD;
      single treatment session. The patients who received the VR technique had a decrease in&#xD;
      anxiety during the initial session of chemotherapy (decrease of 3.34 points, p = 0.01). In&#xD;
      addition, the perception of the time during the chemotherapy session was significantly&#xD;
      altered, making the session more tolerable because it is shorter and thus validating the&#xD;
      distraction capacity of this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When it comes to physical variables (vital signs), 4 studies found a significant difference&#xD;
      in heart rate with a lower rate in the Virtual Reality group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, few studies in oncology have looked at non-isolating devices for VR (without helmet&#xD;
      or glasses), therefore without excluding the patient from his environment. This non-isolating&#xD;
      technology has also been considered as being able to offer the patient a more secure&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of this kind of stimulation during the&#xD;
      intravenous treatment in patients with cancer.&#xD;
