      Problem Description When cervical cancer screening is needed, the Pap test (or Pap smears) is&#xD;
      still the most common, although there are challenges that continue to prevent effective&#xD;
      screening services in many countries, poor quality testing, long delays until screening is&#xD;
      available, they give the results to women, poor population coverage and insufficient&#xD;
      follow-up treatment. HPV testing can remove barriers related to access to screening services,&#xD;
      since the woman can obtain the sample herself. Women's self-sampling for HPV testing has been&#xD;
      used in a programmatic context in some countries. For a good impact, screening coverage must&#xD;
      reach at least 70% of the target population. In the Region of the Americas, only seven&#xD;
      countries have reported this level of coverage, so there is a great need for improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several factors make it difficult to improve coverage: most screening programs are&#xD;
      unorganized, available mainly in urban areas, and based on the Pap test, which has been shown&#xD;
      to have low sensitivity, limited and requires multiple consultations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, screening alone is not enough to prevent cervical cancer. Follow-up treatment of&#xD;
      women with abnormal screening test results is necessary and remains a challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective To evaluate the effectiveness of cervicovaginal self-test in comparison with&#xD;
      direct sampling by the service provider, for the identification of HR-HPV DNA via real-time&#xD;
      PCTR and triage with dual staining biomarker p16 &amp; ki67.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Under inclusion and exclusion criteria and signed informed consent, cervical&#xD;
      sample will be taken with the corresponding method according to the randomization (self-test&#xD;
      or service provider) and certify that the device did not cause damage or lacerations in the&#xD;
      vaginal canal. In addition, an acceptability survey will be completed. All women with&#xD;
      positive p16 &amp; ki67 will be referred for colposcopy and biopsy. Patients will be informed her&#xD;
      results with a specialist physician for guidance and indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical study design is crossover, monocentric, randomized, open, and non-inferiority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical differences between self-test and service rpovider will be assesed.&#xD;

      STUDY POPULATION The target population is patients admitted to HGM Oncology Service for&#xD;
      cervical cancer screening through self-sampling and sampling by a service provider. Sample&#xD;
      size is 444 valid patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCESS Visit 1 is an inclusion visit. Participant will be included in the research protocol&#xD;
      in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria established by the protocol, and the&#xD;
      signed informed consent will be collected. Patient will be randomized and sample will also be&#xD;
      taken with the corresponding method and the patient will be completed to certify that the&#xD;
      device did not cause damage or lacerations in the vaginal canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 will be on the third day after taking the first sample. In this visit, the sample&#xD;
      will be taken with the corresponding method according to the randomization and the patient&#xD;
      will be completed to certify that the device did not cause damage or lacerations in the&#xD;
      vaginal canal. In addition, the acceptability survey will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 will take place 21 calendar days after the second visit, the results will be&#xD;
      delivered to the patient, all women with positive results of CINtec Plus (p16 &amp; ki67) will be&#xD;
      referred for colposcopy and biopsy; said biopsies will be submitted for the analysis of&#xD;
      over-expression of p16 protein. At this last visit, the patient will be informed of the&#xD;
      importance and need to discuss her results with a specialist doctor for guidance and&#xD;
      indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTIC ANALYSIS The information to be analyzed are the results and the final diagnosis&#xD;
      obtained by the self-test method (XytoTest device) and the service provider of the Oncology&#xD;
      Service of the Hospital General de México &quot;Eduardo Liceaga&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the non-inferiority of both samples, the Kappa index will be used and to&#xD;
      determine the significance through the Wilcoxon T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL AND BIOSAFETY ASPECTS The study complies with the ethical considerations&#xD;
      corresponding to the 1964 Helsinki World Assembly and with their respective modifications in&#xD;
      the World Medical Assembly, Hong Kong, September 1989 and Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000&#xD;
      and the Clarification note of Paragraph 29, added by the General Assembly of the WMA,&#xD;
      Washington 2002.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informed consent format is authorized by the ethics and research committee and strictly&#xD;
      adhere to the general health law and its regulations on research and the guidelines of the&#xD;
      international conference on Harmonization (ICH) on good clinical practice ( GCP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject is considered enrolled in the study when they have signed the informed consent&#xD;
      form, no form must be completed or any research or study procedure must be completed before&#xD;
      obtaining the written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any decision that might influence the subject's decision to remain in the study should be&#xD;
      made known to investigator immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality of the subject will be maintained, all persons involved in the research who&#xD;
      have access to the information, are obliged to refrain from disclosing the subject's&#xD;
      information or any personal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is subject to be audited by Mexican regulatory authorities, with or without prior&#xD;
      notice to the research site.&#xD;
