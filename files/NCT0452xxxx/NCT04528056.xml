  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension is characterized by decompensated increase of pulmonary&#xD;
      artery pressure owing to continuous progression of pulmonary vascular resistance and can&#xD;
      ultimately cause right heart failure even death. At present, the treatment of pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial hypertension is mainly the application of specific drug therapy. Specific drug&#xD;
      therapy involves the three major pathways of endothelin, nitric oxide and prostacyclin. The&#xD;
      main mechanisms of vasodilation and anti-proliferation are used to treat pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension. However, the price of specific drug therapy is too expensive, which puts huge&#xD;
      financial pressure on patients. Evidence shows that inflammation exists in the early stages&#xD;
      of pulmonary arterial hypertension and anti-inflammatory treatment is effective in animal&#xD;
      experiments. Under placebo control, the investigators intend to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of anti-inflammatory therapy and/or targeted drug therapy for early treatment of&#xD;
      patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.&#xD;

    <description>The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is a non-encouraged test, performed in a 30 m long flat corridor, where the patient is instructed to walk as far as possible, back and forth around two cones, with the permission to slow down, rest, or stop if needed. These guidelines were provided to all sites. For patients who had never performed a 6MWT previously, a training test was required before the qualifying tests for inclusion were performed.</description>
