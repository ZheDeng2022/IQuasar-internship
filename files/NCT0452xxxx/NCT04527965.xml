  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to investigate the long-term impact of a customized diet&#xD;
      aimed at reducing liver fat specifically and a healthy Nordic diet on ectopic fat (liver,&#xD;
      pancreatic and visceral) and cardiometabolic risk in individuals with prediabetes and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2D).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled studies investigating the impact of replacing dietary carbohydrates&#xD;
      with polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) on liver fat content and cardiometabolic risk in individuals&#xD;
      with prediabetes and T2D are lacking. Also, the effects of a Healthy Nordic Diet on liver fat&#xD;
      content and glycemic control have not be investigated. This study therefore aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the effects of the diets on liver fat content (primary aim)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the effects of the diets on pancreatic fat, visceral fat, lean tissue,&#xD;
           glycemic and lipid control&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the effects of the diets on plasma markers of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and&#xD;
           desaturation (i.e. stearoyl-Coenzyme desaturase 1, SCD-1) as well as on hepatic DNL&#xD;
           using MRI spectroscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate gene-diet interactions, especially if common gene variants (e.g. in PNPLA3)&#xD;
           known to increase liver fat and dyslipidemia, may modify the dietary effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform lipidomic analyses to identify potential mechanistic pathways that may associate&#xD;
           with diet-induced changes in liver fat, pancreatic fat, visceral fat, insulin&#xD;
           sensitivity, dyslipidemia or DNL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that a customized diet will effectively reduce liver fat through&#xD;
      suppression of hepatic DNL and SCD-1 activity, and thereby improve atherogenic dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in individuals with prediabetes and T2D.&#xD;
