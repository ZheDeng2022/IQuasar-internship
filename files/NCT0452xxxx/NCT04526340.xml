      Understanding the impact of food/nutrients on body fluid metabolism is important for&#xD;
      improving diagnosis and treatment of nocturia, polyuria in relation to lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions. This study on &quot;Food and Salt Handling in Diuresis&quot; examines the role of&#xD;
      certain food and nutrients in diuresis. The study design is to investigate the possible acute&#xD;
      effects and mechanisms of selected food (which are known to be diuretic) and nutrients (e.g.&#xD;
      salt) in diuresis in healthy individuals. The study will provide insights into the management&#xD;
      of nocturia, nocturnal polyuria or oedema which are common clinical sign in a wide range of&#xD;
      disorders as cardiovascular, renal and metabolic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study the volunteers will be asked to ingest a certain dosage of a food/nutrient&#xD;
      in capsules along with a defined amount of water (500 ml). 2 Blood and 3 urine samples will&#xD;
      be collected at different time points to measure the urine output and urine composition&#xD;
      derived by the ingestion of the particular food item. Renal Function Profiling is used as an&#xD;
      easy and cheap tool to understand the mechanism of action behind the observed effect in&#xD;
      diuresis. Renal function profiles distinguish the osmotic form water diuresis from a change&#xD;
      in filtration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA) is also used to evaluate oedema and fluid volumes in&#xD;
      body tissues. BIA is a non-invasive technique based on Ohm's law whereby the resistance of a&#xD;
      tissue against an electric current is inversely proportional to the water content and&#xD;
      directly proportional to the length of the tissue. For the BIA measurement, a device is used&#xD;
      in which 8 tactile electrodes are placed: 2 in contact with the thumb and middle finger of&#xD;
      each hand, and 2 in contact with the inside and outside of each foot. Before the start of the&#xD;
      measurements, the length and body weight are measured. The resistance of the arms, torso and&#xD;
      legs is measured at different frequencies.&#xD;

      Research design: Prospective intervention study to investigate the impact of food/nutrients&#xD;
      on urine production and fluid distribution in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sample: The sample size was calculated for a power of 80% and for control vs. treatment&#xD;
      using a paired-sample t-test at the 5% significance level. Thus 30 young healthy volunteers&#xD;
      for each food group (total 300 subjects for 10 food/nutrients groups as; leek, asparagus,&#xD;
      onion, garlic, cranberry, barley, parsley, cardamom, coffee and salt) with no acute or&#xD;
      chronic disease, no use of medication (except contraception), not being pregnant or&#xD;
      menstruating at the time of the study, no any food allergies and age between 20-35 years with&#xD;
      BMI 18.5-25 kg/m2 will be included. Volunteers with an implanted electronic device (e.g.&#xD;
      Pacemaker) will not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The subjects will be tested in fasted and sober state in the morning. No&#xD;
      food/drink 6hrs prior to the test. The subjects will be asked to take 2 different dosages of&#xD;
      testing nutrient and along with 500ml of water and only 500ml water for the control, on 3&#xD;
      different test days. Nutrients will prepared in 1g capsules. The test will last for 4 hrs&#xD;
      after taking of the capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: 3-Days food diary: Once only. For salt, caffeine and energy intake Anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements: at the beginning of each test day 2 Blood samples at the beginning and end of&#xD;
      the test: Haptoglobin phenotyping (serum), Haptoglobin concentration (μmol/l) (serum), Sodium&#xD;
      (mmol/l) (serum), Osmolality (mOsm/kg) (serum), Urea (g/l) (serum), Creatinine (g/dl) (serum)&#xD;
      3 Urine samples at the beginning, after 2 hrs and at the end of the test: Total voided&#xD;
      volume, Osmolality (mOsm/kg), Creatinine (g/dl), Sodium (mmol/l), Potassium (mmol/l), Urea&#xD;
      (g/l) Bio-impedance measurement (BIA): for every 30 min for 4 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample analysis and storage: Half of the urine samples and blood samples are sent immediately&#xD;
      after collection to the university hospital Gent clinical laboratory. The other half of the&#xD;
      samples will be stored for a certain time in a freezer at -80 °C and will be processed and&#xD;
      examined for a second time. The other urine samples and blood samples that are not used for&#xD;
      the research are stored as a bio-bank.&#xD;
