      The primary objective of this single arm, prospective feasibility study, Impact of Frailty on&#xD;
      Clinical Outcomes of Patients Treated for Thoracoabdominal and Complex Abdominal Aortic&#xD;
      Aneurysms with Physician-Modified Fenestrated and Branched Stent Grafts, is to assess the use&#xD;
      of the physician-modified fenestrated/branched endografts to repair thoracoabdominal and&#xD;
      complex aortic aneurysms in subjects having appropriate anatomy, at high risks for open&#xD;
      repairs. The primary intent of the study is to assess safety and preliminary effectiveness of&#xD;
      the device acutely (i.e., treatment success and technical success), at 30 days (i.e., the&#xD;
      rate of major adverse events (MAE)) and at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and annually to 5&#xD;
      years (i.e., the proportion of treatment group subjects that achieve and maintain treatment&#xD;
      success).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, this study will assess the degree of patient frailty before and after the&#xD;
      aneurysm repair, as well as the association between the preoperative baseline frailty and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes detailed above. This will help improve subject selection in identification&#xD;
      of high risk patients who would not only suffer poor clinical outcomes, but also experience&#xD;
      decline in their functional status.&#xD;

      Device Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two types of commercially approved thoracic aortic stent-grafts will be modified under the&#xD;
      aegis of a physician-sponsored IDE protocol (G200159). The Cook (Bloomington, IN) Zenith&#xD;
      Alpha proximal tapered mainbody thoracic stent-grafts and the Cook Zenith TX2 proximal&#xD;
      tapered mainbody will be modified to form the fenestrated/branched aortic components. The&#xD;
      Alpha thoracic stent-grafts are constructed of woven polyester graft sewn to discrete rows of&#xD;
      self-expanding Nitinol Z stents. The most proximal sealing stent is located internally with&#xD;
      fixation barbs that protrude through the graft material. The second proximal stent is&#xD;
      straight, and the third stent is tapered by 4mm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diameter of the TX2 proximal tapered stent-grafts will range from 32mm to 42mm, depending&#xD;
      on the size of the aorta at the proximal seal zone. The lengths will range from 154 to 210mm.&#xD;
      The TX2 thoracic stent-grafts are constructed with woven polyester graft sewn to discrete&#xD;
      rows of self-expanding stainless steel Z stents. The most proximal seal stent is sewn inside&#xD;
      the polyester fabric. The third stent is tapered by either 4mm or 8mm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modification design will be planned using a 3-D multiplanar reconstruction analysis of&#xD;
      the CT angiography. Proximal seal zone will be chosen at 2cm disease free parallel aortic&#xD;
      walls. Target vessel position will be determined by the longitudinal distance between the&#xD;
      proximal extent of the seal zone to the middle of the vessel orifice, as well as radial clock&#xD;
      position. Based on these measurements, patient specific modification map will be constructed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modification will be designed to incorporate visceral and renal branches, utilizing a&#xD;
      various combinations of fenestrations and branch cuffs. The choice between fenestrations and&#xD;
      branch cuffs will be made based on the aortic size and angulation at the level of the target&#xD;
      branches. For example, when the target branches are within the seal zone, fenestrations will&#xD;
      be chosen. Conversely, branch cuffs will be incorporated onto the mainbody if the aorta at&#xD;
      the level of the target branches is aneurysmal, or angulated where precise three dimensional&#xD;
      position of the target branch, hence fenestration, along the implanted stent graft is&#xD;
      difficult to predict.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modification Technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modification will be performed on the day of the operation using strict sterile technique.&#xD;
      Tapered low profile Cook Zenith Alpha proximal component thoracic stent grafts will be&#xD;
      unsheathed. One of the trigger wires is retrieved from the inner cannula of the delivery&#xD;
      system, to be used as a diameter constraining wire. This wire is rerouted posteriorly through&#xD;
      and through the fabric of the stent graft using a long 22-gauge needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fenestrations at planned locations will be created using an ophthalmic cautery, and&#xD;
      reinforced with a double layer of Amplatz Gooseneck Snare (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) wires&#xD;
      made up of braided Nitinol. The wires will be secured around the fenestration by tightly&#xD;
      spaced 5-0 Ethibond (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) locking sutures. Additional radiopaque markers&#xD;
      will be sutured around each fenestration. When necessary, directional branch cuffs will be&#xD;
      created by fashioning 8mm or 6mm Viabahn self expanding covered stents (Gore &amp; Associates,&#xD;
      Flagstaff, AZ) into 2cm long side branch cuffs. The branch cuffs will be sutured to the oval&#xD;
      fenestration created on the aortic stent grafts by running 5-0 Goretex sutures. Radiopaque&#xD;
      markers will be sutured around the entrance and exit of each branch cuff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to resheathing, the posterior aspect of Z-stents are constrained using loops of prolene&#xD;
      sutures as diameter reducing ties. Proximal fixation barbs will be removed using a wire&#xD;
      cutter. Fenestrations and branches designed to be catheterized from the brachial approach&#xD;
      will be pre-wired with 0.014 inch guidewires. The modified stent graft will be resheathed&#xD;
      using 2-0 Silk ties and Umbilical tapes.&#xD;
