  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to enhance patient comfort during magnetic resonance&#xD;
      (MR) exams by reducing anxiety and movement during the exam, thereby decreasing the time&#xD;
      spent in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner and potentially improving patient&#xD;
      satisfaction with the clinical care experience. This will be done with a trial focusing on&#xD;
      studying the effects of clinical hypnosis and focused communication training on patient&#xD;
      anxiety and other metrics during an MRI examination.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an increasingly common imaging modality used for the&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of disease. Given the closed bore nature of the MRI machine itself,&#xD;
      the need to hold still within the imaging bore, the high noise level, vibrations and other&#xD;
      uncomfortable sensations that can be experienced during MRI, anxiety and other&#xD;
      claustrophobia-related symptoms are relatively frequently reported . These symptoms may&#xD;
      result in premature termination/failure of the MRI examination, or excessive patient movement&#xD;
      which can degrade image quality and lengthen the time needed to perform the examination.&#xD;
      Additionally, patient satisfaction scores suffer due to these negative experiences during&#xD;
      MRI. This is especially important, as radiology departments are major influencers in overall&#xD;
      hospital patient satisfaction scores .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the substantial impact that anxiety and claustrophobia-related symptoms have on all&#xD;
      aspects of MRI, the most common intervention provided to patients who report such symptoms&#xD;
      are anxiolytic medications or sedation/anesthesia. These interventions can come at&#xD;
      significant cost to patients and radiology departments and carry medical risks to the patient&#xD;
      as well. Anxiolytic medications or sedation/anesthesia can lead to potential negative side&#xD;
      effects, such as cardiopulmonary depression, hypotension, tachycardia, dystonic reactions,&#xD;
      involuntary muscle movements . These adverse effects can even contribute to unsuccessful&#xD;
      imaging themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-medical interventions, such as clinical hypnosis and enhanced communication strategies&#xD;
      are not well studied in MR and have the potential to provide similar benefits of anxiolytic&#xD;
      medications or sedation in terms of reducing movement artifacts and anxiety, but with far&#xD;
      fewer side effects and safety concerns. For example, hypnosis can reduce anxiety and&#xD;
      operating room time during radiological procedures , reduce amounts of analgesic used , and&#xD;
      decrease behavioral issues related to claustrophobia during MRI . Additionally, enhanced&#xD;
      communication strategies can reduce MRI no-show and study failure rates and improve ratings&#xD;
      in national Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, there is evidence to support the use of hypnosis and communication training during MRI&#xD;
      in order to improve MR exam outcomes and patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that patients who participate in hypnosis prior to MRI will&#xD;
      experience less anxiety and demonstrate less movement during the exam. This will lead to&#xD;
      improved overall patient satisfaction, reduction in image repeat rates and the overall time&#xD;
      needed to perform the MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also hypothesize that patients who undergo MRI with a radiology technician&#xD;
      who has received training in enhanced communication skills will experience less anxiety and&#xD;
      demonstrate less movement during the exam. This will lead to improved overall patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and reduction in image repeat rates and the overall time needed to perform the&#xD;
      MRI.&#xD;
