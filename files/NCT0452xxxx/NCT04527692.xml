  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will propose to each family monitored by the teams to participate in the study&#xD;
      (children between 1 and 18 years old, families understanding and speaking a minimum of&#xD;
      French).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-directed interviews are organized with children/adolescents and their parents who have&#xD;
      agreed to participate in the study. The interviews are conducted by the care teams&#xD;
      themselves. Socio-demographic data are collected.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An information letter will be distributed to the children and parents and their non&#xD;
      opposition to their participation will be sought (or assent for the child via a written&#xD;
      document adapted to the age) will be systematically requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several instruments will be used by the members of the paediatric teams during their routine&#xD;
      home or hospital visits to children and their families: the CPOS (Downing 2018), the KINDL&#xD;
      (generic questionnaire on quality of life validated for healthy children, Erhart et al.&#xD;
      2009), the QOLLTI-F v.2 (questionnaire on quality of life for parents, Cohen 2007, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews will therefore be semi-directed interviews with children/adolescents and their&#xD;
      parents who have agreed to participate in the study. The interviews will be conducted by the&#xD;
      care teams themselves. In addition to the CPOS, KINDL and QOOLTI-F, socio-demographic data&#xD;
      are collected.&#xD;
