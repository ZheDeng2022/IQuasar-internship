  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to examine patients' and therapists' experiences with prenatal&#xD;
      psychotherapy provided to pregnant women with adverse childhood experiences and how this may&#xD;
      influence intergenerational transmission of risk. The investigators will explore a)&#xD;
      participants' perspectives on what promoted or prevented change in psychotherapy, b) how the&#xD;
      mothers' reflective function changes and possible factors associated with change in&#xD;
      reflective function. Up to 20 clinically referred women in gestational week 20-30 will be&#xD;
      included and assessed with qualitative interviews and questionnaires at the beginning of&#xD;
      treatment and when the baby is 4 months old. The quality of the mother-infant relationship&#xD;
      will be assessed. Seven therapists will be interviewed with a qualitative interview schedule.&#xD;
      Outcomes of the study will inform individual tailoring of psychotherapy for a high risk group&#xD;
      of patients and provide increased knowledge about how intergenerational risk factors change&#xD;
      during treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Even with the best evidence-based treatments, one is often unsuccessful in stopping&#xD;
      intergenerational transfer of trauma, abuse, and neglect. The implications for the next&#xD;
      generation are severe, affecting physical and emotional health, cognitive development, and&#xD;
      relational functioning. The perinatal phase may provide a window of opportunity in efforts to&#xD;
      prevent intergenerational transfer of risk factors associated with adverse childhood events.&#xD;
      There is a great need for more knowledge about how generational patterns develop and are&#xD;
      affected by psychotherapy during pregnancy, infancy and early childhood. Little is known&#xD;
      about patients' experiences with prenatal psychotherapy and such knowledge can inform better&#xD;
      tailoring of treatment. The present study is the first step of a planned longitudinal study&#xD;
      to explore the role of mothers' adverse childhood experiences and child development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to explore patients' experiences with prenatal psychotherapy&#xD;
      provided to pregnant women with adverse childhood experiences and their perspectives of what&#xD;
      promotes or hinders change in treatment. Second, aims of the study are to explore a)&#xD;
      therapists' experiences with psychotherapy for mothers with adverse childhood experiences,&#xD;
      and b) explore the development of intergenerational risk factors. Additionally the&#xD;
      investigators will explore the mothers' reflective function during the course of treatment,&#xD;
      the role of adverse and benevolent childhood memories, and mother-infant interaction when the&#xD;
      infant is four months old. Reflective function seems to be a key factor associated with&#xD;
      quality of care in spite of adverse events. Understanding factors associated with possible&#xD;
      change in reflective function is thus highly important. Up to 20 clinically referred women in&#xD;
      gestational week 20-30 will be recruited. Participants will be assessed at the beginning of&#xD;
      therapy and when the child is four months old. A combination of quantitative measures and&#xD;
      qualitative interviews will be used. The infant will be assessed with the neonatal&#xD;
      assessement scale at age 4-8 weeks and the quality of the mother-infant relationship will be&#xD;
      assessed using Parent-Child Relation Assessment at four months. In addition, seven therapists&#xD;
      will be interviewed about their experiences providing psychotherapy for this group of high&#xD;
      risk patients.&#xD;
