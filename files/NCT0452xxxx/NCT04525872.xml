  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose a prospective study to investigate the effect of full light protection&#xD;
      of the PN on cholestasis and other oxidative stress associated diseases in premature infants&#xD;
      when they receive PN for more than one week. Each infant enrolled in this study will receive&#xD;
      full PN light protection including the PN bag, lipids and tubing. Demographic&#xD;
      characteristics, clinical outcomes (incidence of cholestasis, feeding tolerance, BPD, ROP,&#xD;
      NEC and mortality) and oxidative stress markers (e.g., carboxyhemeglobin) will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Phase one of this study employed a retrospective chart review methodology to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of no PN light protection vs partial PN light protection (PN solution only while it's&#xD;
      the tubing and lipids remained exposed to light). Infants from phase one of this study will&#xD;
      serve as the controls in the evaluation the effect of full PN light protection on the&#xD;
      cholestasis, clinical outcomes and oxidative stress. Investigators propose to collect urine&#xD;
      and saliva samples in infants who we expect to receive PN for a minimum of 5 days, on days 0,&#xD;
      3, 5 and every 7 days after TPN initiation until 2 weeks after the end of IV nutrition to&#xD;
      evaluate oxidative stress.&#xD;
