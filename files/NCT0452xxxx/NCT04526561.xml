  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The latissimus dorsi flap is the oldest and most used technique for breast reconstruction.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, there are few studies evaluation the long-term effect of harvesting one of the&#xD;
      muscles of the back. This project has four parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Validation of scales/instrument for Swedish.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Long-term results after reconstruction with latissimus dorsi- a ten year retrospective&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Thoracodorsal artery perforator flap (TDAP) vs latissimus dorsi flap- a randomized&#xD;
           controlled trial - breast reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. TDAP vs Limber flap - a randomized controlled trial- reconstruction of axillary&#xD;
           hidradenitis suppurativa.&#xD;

    <description>EuroQol-5 (EQ5D) has two components health state description and evaluation.health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. It has five levels of severity: having no problems, having slight problems, having moderate problems, having severe problems and being unable to do/having extreme problems. It can define 3,125 (=55) different health states. In the evaluation part, the respondents evaluate their overall health status using the visual analogue scale (0-100). A higher scores indicate a better health-status</description>
