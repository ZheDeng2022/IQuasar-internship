      Management of excessive crying in children with cerebral palsy and communication deficits&#xD;
      [ECCCPCD] was guided by the associated clinical findings and investigations.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain treatments are frequently hit or miss, trial &amp; error, or because of the fear of&#xD;
      litigations, not offered at all, particularly in cerebral palsy. Pain is an under-suspected&#xD;
      and under-diagnosed cause of ECCCPCD. It was hypothesized that pain/discomfort was&#xD;
      responsible for ECCCPCD, and a vicious cycle of pain-spasm-pain aggravated the&#xD;
      pain/discomfort. So, the response of ECCCPCD to treatment guided by clinical findings &amp;&#xD;
      investigations was studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There was an initial placebo run-in period. This study was a prospective, single-center,&#xD;
      interventional, with initial placebo-control, double-blind for initial 110 days, open-label&#xD;
      for the next 290 days, fixed-sequence, two treatment, two-period, crossover clinical trial.&#xD;
      The placebo run-in period (15 days) was followed by the placebo period (15 days). After a&#xD;
      washout period (10 days), drug treatment (360 days) was started depending on the clinical&#xD;
      findings and investigations. The drugs used either singly or in various combinations were&#xD;
      GABA-B agonists, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines, inhibitors&#xD;
      of the vesicular monoamine transporter, antiepileptics, and tricyclic antidepressants. The&#xD;
      outcome measure was total, and unexplained mean cry durations in hours per day. The cry&#xD;
      duration was measured for one 10-day period while on placebo [days P6-P15], and four 10-day&#xD;
      periods while on treatment [T61-70, T241-250, T311-320, and T351-360]. Total and unexplained&#xD;
      mean cry durations in hours per day were calculated from 10-day measurements of cry&#xD;
      durations. From the 251st day of therapy, the dose was reduced by 5% every week until&#xD;
      [ECCCPCD] started to increase. This reduction of the dose was made to confirm the efficacy of&#xD;
      drugs and to check if the dosage requirement has reduced after 250 days of treatment. This&#xD;
      dose was maintained until the next measurement between T311 and T320. Then the dosages were&#xD;
      adjusted as necessary. The caregivers were allowed to volunteer any additional observations&#xD;
      of interest. Drug adverse effects were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological data, GMFCS levels, and MAS scores were noted at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
      Summary statistics were tabulated and plotted. Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests were done to&#xD;
      study the statistical significance.&#xD;

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The best and most reliable form of research is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that would eliminate the power of suggestion and prevent bias when patients' outcomes are evaluated thereby improving the reliability of clinical trial results.&#xD;
Our study was double-blind initially for 110 days until the 70th day of treatment (Figure. 1, Figure. 2.). The caregiver of the participant, the research nurse, and the outcome data collecting nurse were not aware of the drug or drug combination and the dosage. There was no contact between the research nurse, the pharmacist preparing the medicines, and the outcome data collecting nurse. The caregiver of the participant was unaware of other participants' details.&#xD;
Later, it was an open-label study for 290 days because double blinding for the total period of 400 days may not serve any additional purpose but increases the dropout risk.</masking_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        1. A child with cerebral palsy under the age of 15 years and could not communicate the&#xD;
             reason for excessive crying because of young age or global developmental&#xD;
             delay/profound intellectual retardation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Excessive crying of &gt;7.5 hours daily for 30 consecutive days unresponsive to treatment&#xD;
             by the pediatrician, orthopedic surgeon, gastroenterologist, and physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Minimum cry intensity for recording: If the intensity of crying was so high that the&#xD;
             caregiver could not hear radio, TV, or another person talking to her [sitting near&#xD;
             her], the cry duration was recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History, clinical, and neuroimaging findings (structural MRI) were suggestive of&#xD;
             chronic static encephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Motor impairment could be explained by an insult that occurred in the developing fetal&#xD;
             or infant brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Medicines used in the study were used in the previous 30 days, and it was impossible&#xD;
             to taper off the drugs without worsening of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Excessive crying due to known causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Progressive encephalopathies.&#xD;
