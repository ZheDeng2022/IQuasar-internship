    <textblock>
      This cluster randomized clinical trial at 18 nurse-led rural health centers in Lesotho will&#xD;
      test an automated differentiated service delivery model using viral load results, other&#xD;
      clinical characteristics and participants' preference to automatically triage participants&#xD;
      into groups requiring different levels of attention and care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To sustainably provide good quality care to increasing numbers of people living with HIV&#xD;
      (PLHIV) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), care delivery has to shift from a&#xD;
      &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; approach to differentiated care models. Such models should reallocate&#xD;
      resources from patients who are doing well to patient groups who may need more attention,&#xD;
      such as those with treatment failure or medical and psycho-social problems. Ideally, such a&#xD;
      reallocation allows health systems and patients to save resources while improving quality of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One proposed approach to differentiate care and intensity of monitoring is viral load-driven&#xD;
      differentiated service delivery. Reducing the intensity of monitoring in patients with&#xD;
      suppressed viral load (VL) and no other clinical problems would substantially reduce the&#xD;
      workload at health care facilities and save time and transport cost for patients, thus&#xD;
      potentially improve long-term engagement in care. Time and resources saved in patients with&#xD;
      suppressed VL and no other clinical problems would allow focusing on those participants with&#xD;
      elevated viral load and/or other clinical problems (like tuberculosis, which is the most&#xD;
      common cause of mortality among PLHIV in sub-Saharan Africa). This may potentially improve&#xD;
      PLHIVs' clinical outcome through intensified adherence support, clinical follow-up and timely&#xD;
      switches to second-line ART. In many settings in sub-Saharan Africa, however, the potential&#xD;
      of VL monitoring to differentiate care is not exploited and thus constitutes a missed&#xD;
      opportunity. In Lesotho it was shown that the majority of unsuppressed VLs are not acted upon&#xD;
      in a timely manner, be it due to providers and patients not being aware of the results or&#xD;
      health care providers not being proficient in the management of treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of the proposed automated differentiated service delivery model (aDSDM) is to use&#xD;
      VL results, other clinical characteristics (TB screening results and CD4 cell counts) and&#xD;
      participants' preference to automatically triage participants into groups requiring different&#xD;
      levels of attention and care. Innovatively, triaging of participants will be done&#xD;
      automatically capitalising on an existing VL database platform. The implemented aDSDM will&#xD;
      differentiate care according to three elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical characteristics (with focus on VL measurement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sub-population (women, men)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  participants' and health care providers' preferences&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure effective flow of information, VL results and other relevant information is sent&#xD;
      directly to participants' phones, whereas health care providers receive results directly on&#xD;
      their study tablet together with the recommended action. Further features of the platform are&#xD;
      preference-based tailored adherence reminders and automated calls to participants for&#xD;
      symptomatic tuberculosis screening. The proposed aDSDM is designed for being scaled up at&#xD;
      national and regional level as it mainly builds on automated triage and communication with&#xD;
      participants and health care workers, thus not requiring additional human resources.&#xD;
