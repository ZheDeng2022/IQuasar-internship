  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Having a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a minor stroke is a real risk factor not only for&#xD;
      early recurrent stroke but also for major extracranial vascular events. Despite these warning&#xD;
      events provide an opportunity for prevention usual post-discharge care of these subjects&#xD;
      (mainly at primary care) is not associated with an optimal control of cerebrovascular risk&#xD;
      factors (CRF). The investigators hypothesized that patients exposed to the intensified&#xD;
      integrated multifactorial interventional care program (ICP) model would exhibit better&#xD;
      management of CRF and receive more targeted advice than patients receiving standard care. A&#xD;
      second objective was to investigate the effect of the ICP model on stroke recurrence or the&#xD;
      appearance of major extracranial vascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis the investigators perform a controlled, randomized, single blind,&#xD;
      parallel trial. Subjects are recruited at the Stroke Unit and are randomized into two groups:&#xD;
      1. usual care (control group) and 2. ICP (intervention group). Patients assigned to receive&#xD;
      usual care (general practitioner with the possibility of being referred to specialists) are&#xD;
      compared to those assigned to undergo ICP. This ICP involves strict treatment goals&#xD;
      (LDL-cholesterol &lt;100 mg/dl, blood pressure &lt;130/80 mmHg, HbA1c&lt;7%, no smoking, regular&#xD;
      exercise and no excessive alcohol consumption) to be achieved through behavior modification&#xD;
      (diet, physical activity, smoking cessation, alcohol cessation) and a stepwise introduction&#xD;
      of pharmacologic therapy for the main CRF (hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and diabetes).&#xD;
      This multifactorial intervention is overseen in each primary care center by a trained general&#xD;
      practitioner and nursery. The treatment goals are the same for the control group and the&#xD;
      intervention group. General practitioners caring patients of each group are informed of these&#xD;
      strict treatment goals. Patients in the ICP group receive a minimum of four scheduled&#xD;
      individual consultations in one year (baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months). Primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are evaluated by an external Neurologist at 12 months after their inclusion.&#xD;
