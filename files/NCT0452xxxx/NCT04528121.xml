  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of CoDuSe balance training and step square exercises on the risk of&#xD;
      falls in multiple sclerosis. BACKGROUND: risk of fall &amp; balance disabilities are considered&#xD;
      serious problems in multiple sclerosis which results in loss of balance &amp; physical&#xD;
      inactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ………HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CoDuSe balance training and step square exercises will have a significant effect on the risk&#xD;
      of falling in multiple sclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is there an effect of CoDuSe balance training and step square exercises on risk of fall in&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty-two patients with multiple sclerosis will participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will randomly be divided into two equal groups; the control group which received&#xD;
      the conventional selected exercise program and the study group received the same exercise&#xD;
      training program in addition to CoDuSe balance training and step square exercises, three&#xD;
      times per week for four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Evaluation will done pre and post interventions included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biodex balance system (Risk falling), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) &amp; Morse Fall&#xD;
      Scale.&#xD;

    <description>The short physical performance battery (SPPB) is a group of measures that combines the results of the gait speed, chair stand and balance tests . It has been used as a predictive tool for possible disability and can aid in the monitoring of function in older people.&#xD;
The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)test is designed to measure functional status and physical performance.</description>

    <measure>Morse Fall Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Morse Fall Scale (MFS) is a rapid and simple method of assessing a patient's likelihood of falling A patient who scores under 25 points is considered to be at low risk of falling, a patient who scores between 25-45 points is considered to be at moderate risk of falling, and a patient who scores higher than 45 points is considered to be at high risk of falling.</description>

    <description>The standardized intervention targeted visual, somatosensory, and vestibular aspects of balance and will be included with balance exercises&#xD;
Examples of core stability exercises as follows: in supine position with knees bent, slowly slide one heel forward to straighten leg; and, in four-point kneeling position, slide one foot in a straight line away from the body and lift the leg off the floor.&#xD;
Examples of dual-task exercises as walking while turning one's head and juggling a balloon.&#xD;
Examples of sensory strategies as standing and walking on uneven surfaces and standing with eyes closed.</description>
