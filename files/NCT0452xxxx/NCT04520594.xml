  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if a plant-based resistant starch that is optimized&#xD;
      for the individual will target the underlying cause of inflammatory bowel disease and restore&#xD;
      a &quot;healthier&quot; gut microbiome in pediatric participants with inflammatory bowel disease.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Unblinding will occur only if necessary to ensure study participants safety, interim analysis at 5 ± 1 months, or eligibility for our associated open label trail (OARS trial). Only Dr. Mack (Co-PI) can request to break the blind for safety reasons or eligibility for the OARS Trial; only Dr. Stintzi (Co-PI) will request to break the blind for interim analysis. Once the blind is broken, the patient will be discontinued from study product.</masking_description>
