  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that causes recurrent episodes of&#xD;
      wheezing, breathing difficulties and coughing. The prevalence of asthma is 8% in school-aged&#xD;
      children and 30% in preschoolers, making asthma the first chronic disease in children.&#xD;
      Symptoms are due to diffuse but variable airway obstruction, reversible spontaneously or&#xD;
      after inhalation of beta2 agonists (β-2a) such as salbutamol. Exacerbations of asthma are&#xD;
      frequent and difficult to assess by parents and the patient himself. It is estimated that&#xD;
      approximately 2.5% of children with asthma are hospitalized annually. The global burden&#xD;
      caused by asthma can thus be reduced by improving early detection of bronchial obstruction,&#xD;
      prescribing immediate treatment with the appropriate background therapy, and reliably and&#xD;
      objectively assess response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The natural history of asthma symptoms in children shows a great intra and inter-individual&#xD;
      variability. The difficulty of assessing the severity of an attack by the parents or the&#xD;
      child himself, when he is old enough to control his chronic disease, is a key element in the&#xD;
      management of asthma and allows the treatment to be adapted quickly, sometimes avoiding&#xD;
      hospitalization. Healthcare professionals can assess the severity of the episode using the&#xD;
      Pediatric Respiratory Assesment Measure (PRAM) score, which has the advantage of being&#xD;
      adaptable at any age. The Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD)&#xD;
      integrates in its diagnostic strategy for chronic respiratory diseases, the lung function&#xD;
      test, which allows the quantification of respiratory function in the context of diagnosis and&#xD;
      long-term follow-up. Although spirometry are non-invasive tests, they still require a high&#xD;
      level of patient cooperation, which remains problematic before the age of 7 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The digital stethsocope integrates a capacity for recording auscultations and data&#xD;
      transmission to high-performance software. This has made it possible to extend auscultation&#xD;
      beyond what was audible to the human ear alone (over 20-20,000 Hertz).Auscultatory sounds&#xD;
      analysis, particularly those most often associated with obstructive syndrome could be simple,&#xD;
      reproducible and a reliable method of assessing the severity and response to treatment in&#xD;
      children's asthma. Major advances in signal processing and unsupervised learning in&#xD;
      artificial intelligence research provide the potential for high-performance analysis of&#xD;
      physiological measures.&#xD;

      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Develop an artificial intelligence based algorithm for unsupervised diagnostic and&#xD;
      classification of childhood asthma exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: A Longitudinal prospective monocentric observational study will be performed in&#xD;
      the Pediatric Emergency Division (PED) and the Pediatric Respiratory Unit (PRU) of the Geneva&#xD;
      University Hospitals (HUG) during 24 months. This clinical study will include patients aged&#xD;
      from 2 to16 years with acute asthma exacerbations. The intervention consists in recording&#xD;
      auscultation of asthmatic patients at rest, during acute exacerbation and after treatment by&#xD;
      bronchodilatators (β-2 agonists) inhalation in the PED, with a Digital Stethoscope (DS).&#xD;
      Auscultation will be recorded during hospitalization every day, at home 7 days after the&#xD;
      acute episode, combining intdoor and outdoor measures, and evaluating the exposome. A last&#xD;
      record will be done at 6 to 8 weeks after the acute episode, with a lung function test if the&#xD;
      patient is up to 7 years. A validation and training audio database will be constituted for&#xD;
      the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, allowing analysis of respiratory&#xD;
      rate, inspiratory/expiratory time ratio, PRAM score, wheezing variation of intensity and&#xD;
      unsupervised diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creation of a performant AI algorithm for unsupervised acute asthma exacerbation diagnosis,&#xD;
      with &gt; 70 % of Sensitivity and &gt; 70% of Specificity compared to the expert. Response to&#xD;
      treatment will improve patient empowerment and personalized medicine in childhood asthma&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
