  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the last 10 years many studies concerning the impact of physical training on&#xD;
      whole-body insulin sensitivity have been published, but there is a lack of an extended&#xD;
      investigation on the potential clinical benefits of novel circuit training-based on strength&#xD;
      and endurance exercises-relating to the optimization of insulin sensitivity and vascular&#xD;
      endothelial function. It is of interest to precisely determine the physiological and&#xD;
      biochemical effects of circuit training. An important aspect of the planned research will be&#xD;
      the analysis of the effects of physical training on the released during muscle contraction&#xD;
      myokines capable of modulating various metabolic processes. We hypothesized that in studied&#xD;
      participants 12 weeks of the novel form of training would result in improving insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and vascular endothelial function mainly via myokines released by contracting&#xD;
      skeletal muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following questions will be asked: (1) whether the 12-week circuit training (combined&#xD;
      strength and endurance exercises) performed by women with insulin resistance, improves&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and promotes the efficiency of&#xD;
      endothelial defense mechanisms? (2) whether the 12-week circuit training (combined of&#xD;
      strength and endurance exercises) changes the concentrations of transcription factors&#xD;
      regulating lipid and carbohydrate metabolism or the synthesis and/or secretion of myokines&#xD;
      and adipokines in women with insulin resistance? (3) whether the 12-week strength training,&#xD;
      interspersed with bouts of endurance exercise has a positive effect on cytokine profile? (4)&#xD;
      whether there is a relationship between changes in body composition, HOMA-IR, and the level&#xD;
      of myokines caused by physical training? (5) whether the 12-week circuit training reduces low&#xD;
      back pain symptoms, plantar stifness and improve functioning of the patient in everyday life?&#xD;
      A group of 80 women, aged 25 to 45 years, with diagnosed insulin resistance will participate&#xD;
      in the planned study. Participants will be enrolled in the research program based on medical&#xD;
      qualification. Before the intervention all women will have venous blood collected to&#xD;
      determine fasting glucose, hemoglobin glycosylated (HbA1C) and insulin levels and insulin&#xD;
      resistance by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) will be&#xD;
      calculated. The inclusion criteria will be as follows: (1) women, age: 25-45 years,&#xD;
      menstruating, (2) BMI 18,5-29,9 kg/m2, (3) insulin resistance based on HOMA-IR (cut-off point&#xD;
      2.5), (4) HbA1C ≤ 6.5%, (5) not contraindicated to physical activity. Participants meeting&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria will be randomly divided into two groups. The first group of women&#xD;
      will undergo circuit training, consisting of exercises performed on 7 machines arranged in a&#xD;
      circuit. Thanks to the use of adequate software the machines will automatically adjust their&#xD;
      parameters, such as seat height or resistance to the exercising person, and the training&#xD;
      progress will be individually monitored. The planned training will last for 3 months, during&#xD;
      which the patients will exercise 3 times a week for 30 minutes (2 circuits will be done&#xD;
      during each session). The planned duration of the training session will be controlled (one&#xD;
      minute for strength exercises, four minutes for endurance exercises and a 30-second break&#xD;
      between each exercise). In the training group, one-repetition maximum exercise test (1RM)&#xD;
      will be performed to determine the appropriate training load and later after the program to&#xD;
      verify the increase in muscle strength. The range of maximum heart rate (HRmax) will also be&#xD;
      determined in all exercising women. The second group of women, who will be asked to maintain&#xD;
      their current level of physical activity and their diet for a period of 3 months will serve&#xD;
      as a control group. Before and after the training program in all participants of the study&#xD;
      pulse wave velocity, anthropometric parameters and body composition will be assessed.&#xD;
      Concurrently venous blood will be taken to determine biochemical indicators related to&#xD;
      carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, vascular endothelium function,&#xD;
      inflammation and adipocytokines and myokines. In both groups of women, the questioners&#xD;
      concerning dietary intake and the level of daily physical activity will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be subjected to analysis involving descriptive, and advanced statistic method&#xD;
      among them analysis of correlations, regression, variance and cluster analysis. All&#xD;
      calculations and statistics will be performed using TIBCO Statistica 13.3 software (TIBCO).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The training program will be performed on 7 machinesin a circuit. The devices will be&#xD;
      controlled by a pre-programmed chip card, so that they will automatically adjust their&#xD;
      parameters, such as seat height or resistance to the patient, and it will be possible to&#xD;
      monitor the training progress of exercising women and their presence during training. Only&#xD;
      two people will be allowed in the room during the training. The planned duration of the&#xD;
      exercises will be controlled (one minute for strength exercises, four minutes for endurance&#xD;
      exercisesand a 30-second break between each exercise) and for each trainee the load will be&#xD;
      dosed using the electronic resistance motor system. Exercises in the training program are&#xD;
      planned in such a way that the different muscle groups of women exercising are loaded&#xD;
      alternately, which will ensure comprehensive training of the whole body. The range of&#xD;
      movement, exercise duration and breaks will be controlled automatically by the system and the&#xD;
      software of the devices and will not require additional training attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the training group, one-repetition maximum exercise test (1RM) will be performed to&#xD;
      determine the appropriate training load and later after the program to verify the increase in&#xD;
      muscle strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HR max range will be determined for exercising women by the indirect method using the&#xD;
      formula: training HR = 220 -subject age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristics of exercises in the circuit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The training circuit starts with an exercise on a cycloergometer -&quot;bike&quot;, which lasts 4&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second exercise -&quot;abdominal crunch&quot;, shapes the strength of the abdominal muscles&#xD;
           and together with exercise number six, it not only improves muscle strength parameters,&#xD;
           but also shapes balance and maintains the correct position of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The third exercisein a circuit-&quot;leg curl&quot;, shapes the muscular strength of the back of&#xD;
           the thigh (biceps femoris muscleand muscles adjacent to it).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The fourth exercise -&quot;lat pulldown&quot;, trains the strength of the latissimus dorsi muscle,&#xD;
           shoulder girdle muscles and upper chest. In addition to improving the strength and&#xD;
           function of the muscles mentioned above, the exercise also perfectly stimulates the&#xD;
           auxiliary respiratory muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Fifth exercise -&quot;crosswalker&quot;.This exercise trainsmost of the body's muscles, itlasts 4&#xD;
           minutes and, like training on a cycloergometer, primarily shapes thephysical capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The sixth exercise -&quot;back extension&quot;trains the strength of the abdominal muscles,&#xD;
           erector spinae and other muscles of a back.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The seventh exercise -&quot;legabductor&quot;, the last in the series, is an exercise that shapes&#xD;
           the gluteal muscles, as well as hip adductor and abductor muscles. This exercise&#xD;
           fulfills the function of shaping strength and securing the hip joint, by training the&#xD;
           muscle parts less frequently used in everyday life, the more difficult to be kept fit as&#xD;
           the years go by and the level of physical activity decreases.&#xD;
