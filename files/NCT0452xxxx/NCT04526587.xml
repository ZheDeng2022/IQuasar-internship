    <textblock>
      This study investigates the clinical course of CDK4/6 inhibitor treated patients in the&#xD;
      real-world setting among patients with breast cancer. CDK4/6 inhibitors may stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Studying samples of&#xD;
      blood, tissue, ascites or pleural effusions, and fresh body fluids or fresh biopsy, from&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer that has spread to the other places in the body (metastatic) may&#xD;
      help doctors learn more about cancer and the development of drug resistance in patients, and&#xD;
      predict how well patients will respond to treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Delineate clinical features of disease progression and responses to subsequent therapy&#xD;
      following progression on ciclib-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Define pharmacogenomics relationships that could provide a more precise approach to drug&#xD;
      dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Interrogate biomarkers related to response and acquired resistance in standard clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Develop patient-derived models from resistant disease to functionally assess the&#xD;
      mechanisms occurring with resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Elucidate the socio-demographic features related to the use of ciclibs clinically in the&#xD;
      Roswell Park catchment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients electronic medical records are reviewed to capture clinical information, and&#xD;
      patients undergo collection of blood, tissue, ascites or pleural effusions, and fresh body&#xD;
      fluids or fresh biopsy samples for diagnosis/treatment decision, biomarker assessments, and&#xD;
      description of mechanisms of resistance/response related to ciclib-therapy.&#xD;
