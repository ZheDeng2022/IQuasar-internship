  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization (TACE) combined with the anti-angiogenic targeted drugs and ginsenoside Rg3&#xD;
      versus TACE alone in patients with unresectable Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage&#xD;
      B/C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), who has normal liver function and no extrahepatic&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TACE is widely used in patients with unresectable HCC, which has been proved to significantly&#xD;
      improve the survival time by the results from some randomized controlled studies and&#xD;
      meta-analyses. However, due to the different blood supply characteristics and biological&#xD;
      heterogeneity in HCC nodules, the therapeutic effect of TACE is limited, and which is still&#xD;
      considered as a non-radical treatment. Furthermore, vascular embolization by TACE may result&#xD;
      in hypoxia in tumor tissue, which will induce increased secretion of angiogenic factors such&#xD;
      as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor angiogenesis, promote proliferation of&#xD;
      residual tumor cells, and enhance tumor invasive and metastasis. Accordingly, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of TACE is still unsatisfying as a single treatment for HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both anti-angiogenic targeted drugs and ginsenoside Rg3 have showed synergistic effect with&#xD;
      TACE in patients with unresectable HCC. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of the combination of anti-angiogenic targeted drugs and ginsenoside Rg3 plus TACE&#xD;
      comparing to TACE alone in patients with unresectable HCC.&#xD;
