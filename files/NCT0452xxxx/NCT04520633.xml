  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Severe asthma affects only 5% of asthmatics, but has a considerable impact on patients owing&#xD;
      to the respiratory disability linked to asthma but also complications from oral&#xD;
      corticosteroid (OCS) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biologics have recently been made available, and improve quality of life (QoL)severe asthma&#xD;
      patients. Having a reproducible and reliable measuring tool of QoL for severe asthmatics&#xD;
      would be useful for assessing the impact of the various interventions proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QoL questionnaires currently used in respiratory diseases are not specific to severe asthma.&#xD;
      They are very focused on respiratory disability, but for example do not take into account the&#xD;
      impact of treatments, especially oral steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Severe Asthma Questionnaire (SAQ) is the very first tool specifically designed to assess&#xD;
      the health related quality of life of severe asthma population. The development of its use&#xD;
      goes through the validation of this questionnaire in its French translation available since&#xD;
      September 2019. &quot;&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Difficult to treat asthma affects about 17% of the asthma population, among which 5% have&#xD;
      severe asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these patients, the disease is often a burden to their professional, family and personal&#xD;
      life, significantly altering their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current recommendations on medical management aim at asthma control and reduction of&#xD;
      exacerbations. While there are now biologics that effectively address these objectives, they&#xD;
      are still struggling to demonstrate their effectiveness in term of quality of life&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although in real life, patients well responding to biologics often report &quot;&quot;a changing&#xD;
      life&quot;&quot;, this is not well demonstrated in clinical trials, which only bring out modest&#xD;
      variations in quality of life (mainly AQLQ) and asthma control scores. This may be due to the&#xD;
      fact that currently used scores, measure either the quality of life in a generic way, or&#xD;
      asthma control (dyspnea, use of rescue treatments) rather than asthma specific quality of&#xD;
      life, and do not take into account the burden of oral steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this specific population of asthmatics, even the dedicated scores (11 scales in the adult&#xD;
      population and 6 in the pediatric population) have trouble measuring variations in quality of&#xD;
      life. They hardly ever manage to demonstrate a difference in quality of life between mild&#xD;
      asthma and severe asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, just like oral steroids sparing, improving quality of life is of concern for&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) instruments follows rigorous scientific&#xD;
      methodology. The Severe Asthma Questionnaire (SAQ) is a specific instrument for measuring&#xD;
      quality of life in severe asthma. It was developed and validated in English by the University&#xD;
      of Plymouth in 2018, according to the current recommendations, in an attempt to respond to&#xD;
      the lack of specificity of the former quality of life tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has gone through forward and backward translation process into French thanks to the Mappy&#xD;
      Trust organization. It seems important to validate, in its French translation, the&#xD;
      psychometric properties of the SAQ questionnaire, a specific instrument measuring quality of&#xD;
      life for severe asthmatics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Useful data cf primary and secondary objectives will be collected at the first and the&#xD;
           6th month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard Operating Procedures: Patient recruitment will only take place in Bichat&#xD;
           Hospital. Questionnaires and forms will be lend to the severe asthmatics coming to&#xD;
           consultation and day hospital thanks to clinical research associate. Data will be&#xD;
           anonymized and collected by a clinical research associate (fulfilled forms and&#xD;
           questionnaire and medical file). Data management, data analysis will be ensured by&#xD;
           Clinical Research Unit of Bichat Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size assessment : estimated on FALISSARD assumption: 320 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plan for missing data: usual way for each quality of life questionnaire, enlarged 6th&#xD;
           month visit period to collect 6th month reevaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis plan: cf section primary and secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality assurance plan: Data validation and registry procedures, including any plans for&#xD;
           site monitoring and auditing will be ensured by the Clinical Research Unit of Bichat&#xD;
           Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data checks: Predefined rules for range will be pre-configure in the eCase Report Form&#xD;
           (CRF) computed in REDCap. The data dictionary that contains detailed descriptions of&#xD;
           each variable used by the registry (cf inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary and&#xD;
           secondary outcome), including the source of the variable, and normal ranges is described&#xD;
           in a specific document based on which the eCRF will be built. &quot;&#xD;
