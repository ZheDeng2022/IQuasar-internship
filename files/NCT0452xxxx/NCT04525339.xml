      Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis in elderly patients represents a surgical challenge for&#xD;
      cardiac surgeons due to heavy calcifications and associated comorbidities. Such conditions&#xD;
      usually are associated with dramatic intra and postoperative complications leading to many&#xD;
      cases being declined for open surgical replacement. Many treatment modalities were described&#xD;
      including trans-catheter valvutomy but with only temporary improvements and high rates of&#xD;
      recurrence. Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) has offered an alternative&#xD;
      solution to such cases in which open surgery is deemed too risky or prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common comorbidity in patients undergoing TAVI. It has&#xD;
      been reported with 40-75% of the patients with increased adverse outcomes.Despite performing&#xD;
      TAVI alone in these patient has shown significant improvement, yet CAD has showed increased&#xD;
      risk in terms of hemodynamic instability and risk of myocardial infarction during rapid&#xD;
      pacing which is an important step during the TAVI procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the AHA/ACC guidelines, in patients undergoing Aortic valve replacement/ repair&#xD;
      (AVR) who also have significant CAD, the combination of Coronary artery bypass grafting&#xD;
      (CABG) and AVR reduces the rates of perioperative Myocardial Infarction, perioperative&#xD;
      mortality, late mortality, and morbidity when compared with patients not undergoing&#xD;
      simultaneous CABG, even though the combined operation carries a small but real increased risk&#xD;
      of mortality (Class II A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been the commonly used treatment modality for&#xD;
      (CAD) which is usually carried out pre TAVI or less commonly simultaneously with TAVI (mainly&#xD;
      due to access limitation after valve implantation). In patients with intermediate or high&#xD;
      SYNTAX scores, CABG remains the standard therapy. Off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB)&#xD;
      procedure has demonstrated excellent results in these patients, due to the avoidance of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass and manipulation of the aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a few studies in the literature have reported the combined approach of CABG and TAVI in&#xD;
      treatment of coronary artery disease and severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Here the&#xD;
      invesigators decided to study the early three months outcomes of patients undergoing TAVI and&#xD;
      surgical revascularization.&#xD;
