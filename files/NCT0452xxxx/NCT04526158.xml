  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this two-phase project is to reduce chronic pain and co-morbid&#xD;
      conditions among Veterans, through scalable, non-pharmacologic evidence-based strategies that&#xD;
      are &quot;Veteran-Centric,&quot; designed to optimize engagement, adherence and sustainability, and are&#xD;
      deliverable to large numbers of Veterans.&#xD;

      The investigators will conduct a 4-site 3-arm pragmatic clinical trial (N = 750) to test&#xD;
      effectiveness of 2 Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs), Mobile+Group LAMP and Mobile LAMP,&#xD;
      compared to usual practice. Effectiveness will be assessed by pain functioning over the&#xD;
      12-month follow-up period using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) interference score. The&#xD;
      investigators will test the following primary hypotheses: (1) Mobile LAMP will be more&#xD;
      effective at improving chronic pain (as measured by change in the BPI interference score over&#xD;
      the 12-month follow-up period) compared to usual practice, (2) Mobile+Group LAMP will be more&#xD;
      effective at improving chronic pain (as measured by BPI interference score change over the&#xD;
      12-month follow-up period) compared to usual practice, and (3) Mobile+Group LAMP will be more&#xD;
      effective at improving chronic pain (as measured by BPI interference change over the 12-month&#xD;
      follow-up period) compared to Mobile LAMP without the group component. The investigators will&#xD;
      test the following secondary hypotheses: (1) Comparison of intervention group with secondary&#xD;
      outcomes listed below, and (2) primary and secondary hypotheses comparisons will be confirmed&#xD;
      in gender-specific strata. The primary outcome will be measured as change in BPI interference&#xD;
      score over the 12-month follow-up period. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported&#xD;
      measures related to pain, comorbid mental health conditions and function, expected mediators&#xD;
      of treatment effects, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects and measures captured in&#xD;
      electronic health records. These outcomes will be assessed at 10 weeks, 6 months and 12&#xD;
      months. Implementation data will be collected and described, using the guided Reach,&#xD;
      Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework.&#xD;
