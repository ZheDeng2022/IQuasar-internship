  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An observational study of the relationship between fat free mass and toxicity of cytostatics&#xD;
      in cancer patients, at the department of Clinical Oncology at Zealand University Hospital,&#xD;
      Roskilde, Denmark. Fat free mass will be measured by bio impedance spectroscopy and data on&#xD;
      toxicity will be obtained from medical records and interviews/questionnaires with the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With a prospective observational design, this study will examine whether there is a&#xD;
      correlation between the total dose of cytostatics per measured fat-free mass (FFM) (mg&#xD;
      cytostatic agent/kg FFM) and toxicity of cytostatics among cancer patients. The study will&#xD;
      include patients with a primary diagnosis of any stage colorectal or pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is, that a higher total dose of cytostatics per FFM will correlate to more&#xD;
      frequent and/or more severe toxicity than a lower total dose. In extension to this, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that a loss of FFM during treatment, and thereby an increased total dose of&#xD;
      cytostatics per FFM, will lead to more frequent and severe toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and data collection will take place at the department of Clinical Oncology at&#xD;
      Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde over about a five month period. Each patient will be&#xD;
      included for two-four cycles of cytostatic treatment. FFM will be measured by bio impedance&#xD;
      spectroscopy as close to the first day of each cycle of cytostatic treatment as possible.&#xD;
      Information about toxicity will be obtained from patient records and through interviews with&#xD;
      the patients. Interviews will be conducted at day 5 (4-6) of each cycle and at the end of&#xD;
      each cycle. The interviews include questionnaires about specific toxicities, using National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria&#xD;
      for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), and overall health and quality of life, and 24-hour recall of&#xD;
      dietary intake and questions about physical activity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In short, relevant outcomes are change in FFM, hematology, grade 3/4 hematological toxicity&#xD;
      as defined by NCI CTCAE, dose-limiting toxicity, hospitalization, patient-reported adverse&#xD;
      events, overall health and quality of life, and nutritional intake.&#xD;
