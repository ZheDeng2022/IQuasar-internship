  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot was to study how body water behaves between the different internal&#xD;
      water pools of the human body, what the role and influence of the interstitium is and what&#xD;
      the effect is of body position on the distribution and allocation of BW between different&#xD;
      body parts (trunk, legs, arms). To study this, 2 techniques that have not been used before in&#xD;
      urological research were tested on their usefulness:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first technique is a recent BIA device, which distinguishes itself from earlier&#xD;
           devices by measuring impedance at different electrical currencies in different body&#xD;
           parts (arm/limb/trunk). This technique made it possible to observe the influence of body&#xD;
           position on the distribution of BW in these body compartments. Rationale for this&#xD;
           research question is mainly the link between NP and edema that was found in earlier&#xD;
           research and the fact that body position seemed to have an impact on the size of edema.&#xD;
           For this reason, it can be suggested that body position and thus edema will have an&#xD;
           impact on whether or not NP occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second technique uses deuterium as a biological marker. With this technique the&#xD;
           distribution, storage, allocation and excretion of BW was examined among the urological&#xD;
           most relevant water pools (blood, urine and interstitium).&#xD;
