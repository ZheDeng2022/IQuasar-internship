      The current study is utilizing a nurse led discharge program based on the Re-Engineered&#xD;
      Discharge program (Project-RED) ( Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2013)&#xD;
      which is a package of services designed to minimize discharge failures and minimize&#xD;
      re-admissions, reduce mortality, morbidity, complication and improve patients outcomes.&#xD;
      Project-RED aims to reduce hospital re-admissions through a series of structured steps led by&#xD;
      a nurse called discharge advocate. The intervention will be used to discharge patients post&#xD;
      Coronary artery bypass graft surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the main threats to human lives (Benjamin et al., 2018).&#xD;
      Around 17.9 million deaths worldwide were attributed to CVD (Benjamin et al., 2018); Which&#xD;
      Represents 31 % of the global deaths (Benjamin et al., 2018). Coronary artery disease is one&#xD;
      of the CVD. Coronary artery disease prevalence among United State (US) adults aged 20 years&#xD;
      and above is 6.3 %. It is responsible for 43.8 % of the deaths worldwide. (Benjamin et al.,&#xD;
      2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Jordan, CVD is the leading cause of death. During 2016; 37 % of all deaths among Jordanian&#xD;
      population were due to CVD. Coronary Artery Disease is responsible for 18 % of the deaths&#xD;
      (Centers of Disease Control [CDC], 2016) Coronary artery diseases currently are managed with&#xD;
      medical treatment, percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) or Coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
      (CABG) surgery (Habib et al., 2015). Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is the indicated&#xD;
      choice for multi-vessel coronary disease (Habib et al., 2015). It is defined as a&#xD;
      revascularization procedure used for the treatment of CAD. It involves establishing a graft&#xD;
      from another vessel of the body to bypass the narrowed coronary artery and restore blood flow&#xD;
      to the cardiac muscle (Urden, Stacy, &amp; Lough, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery is believed to provide more complete&#xD;
      revascularization and leading to improved long term outcomes than PCI (Hillis et al., 2011);&#xD;
      the recovery process after hospital discharge might be complicated by the occurrence of Major&#xD;
      Adverse Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Events (MACCE) (Goldfarb et al., 2015). Major&#xD;
      Adverse Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Events consist of mortality, myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (MI), stroke and need for repeat revascularization (Goldfarb et al., 2015). Mortality leads&#xD;
      to losing the patient after a major and costly surgery, while; MI, stroke and need for&#xD;
      reopening or repeat revascularization leads to patient readmission to the hospital and might&#xD;
      end up with increased mortality rate (Goldfarb et al., 2015; Hillis et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality rate after CABG ranges from 1.1% -24 % (Grundeken et al., 2013; Jose et al., 2019;&#xD;
      Shah et al., 2019; Wrobel et al., 2015). Among the Jordanian CABG population; all-cause&#xD;
      mortality reported 30 day after surgery was 5.9 % in 1046 patients (AlWaqfi, Khader, &amp;&#xD;
      Ibrahim, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The readmission rate of CABG patients within 30 days is seriously high (Feng, White,&#xD;
      Gaber-Baylis, Turnbull, &amp; Rong, 2018). More specifically; Feng et al., (2018) reported that&#xD;
      28601 adult CABG patients out of 177229 (16 %) in the united States (US) were readmitted&#xD;
      within 30 days (Feng et al., 2018). Another study revealed that more than 60 % of CABG&#xD;
      patients readmissions occur within the first week post discharge (Price, Romeiser, Gnerre,&#xD;
      Shroyer, &amp; Rosengart, 2013). Several reasons stand behind hospital readmissions after CABG&#xD;
      surgery (Mary, 2017; Seifert, 2017). Price et al., (2013) reported that 25% of 13% hospital&#xD;
      readmissions after CABG surgery were attributed to cardiac reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial Infarction after CABG surgery is Type 5 MI (Thygesen et al., 2018). Shah et al.,&#xD;
      (2016) reported that out of 2215 CABG patients 5.8 % developed acute MI post-surgery while&#xD;
      3.8 % required repeat revascularization. Repeat revascularization is a new CABG or PCI&#xD;
      procedure needs to be done due to documented ischemia or graft failure and it is one of the&#xD;
      MACCE that might occur within 30 days after CABG surgery (Takagi et al., 2013). The incidence&#xD;
      rate of repeated revascularization among CABG patient is ranging from 0.5 % -1.3 % (Deppe et&#xD;
      al., 2016; Taggart et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2015) Stroke is an acute focal neurological&#xD;
      deficit lasting â‰¥ 24 hours with or without confirmatory imaging (Goldfarb et al., 2015).&#xD;
      Around 1.3% of CABG patients developed stroke after the surgery which causes near 20 %&#xD;
      mortality rate perioperative (Gaudino et al., 2019). Among Jordanian population; CABG&#xD;
      Patients who had stroke were 2.3 % of the sample (1046 patients). Of these; 33.3 % were died&#xD;
      (AlWaqfi et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing mortality and hospital readmission following cardiac surgery has become a national&#xD;
      priority in the US and worldwide. Unclear discharge instructions and lack of follow up plans&#xD;
      are among the reported reasons for hospital readmissions (Amoah &amp; Mwanri, 2016). Patient&#xD;
      experience with discharge instructions show that patients who discharged with sufficient&#xD;
      information and provided follow-up care were better in managing postoperative problems and&#xD;
      experienced improved post discharge outcomes (M. Akbari &amp; Celik, 2015). Therefore; have a&#xD;
      better health-related quality of life (HRQOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study intervention is a nurse led discharge program based on the Re-Engineered&#xD;
      Discharge program (Project-RED) ( Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2013)&#xD;
      which is a package of services designed to minimize discharge failures and minimize&#xD;
      readmissions (Jack et al., 2009; S. Mitchell, Weigel, Laurens, Martin, &amp; Jack, 2017; S. E.&#xD;
      Mitchell et al., 2016; Patel &amp; Dickerson, 2018), reduce mortality, morbidity, complication&#xD;
      (Ceppa et al., 2015) and improve patients outcomes (Adams, Stephens, Whiteman, Kersteen, &amp;&#xD;
      Katruska, 2014; Berkowitz et al., 2013; Cancino et al., 2017) . Project-RED aims to reduce&#xD;
      hospital readmissions through a series of structured steps led by a nurse called discharge&#xD;
      advocate. (Jack et al., 2009)&#xD;

    <description>a discharge planning program. It is a modified discharge planning program depends basically on the Re-Engineered Discharge program which is a program developed by Boston Medical Center in collaboration with AHRQ , 2013. The intervention consists of several components. The program components include making appointments for follow-up care (e.g., medical appointments and post discharge tests/labs). Plan for the follow-up of results from tests or labs that are pending at discharge. Identify the correct medicines and a plan for the patient to obtain them. Teach a written discharge plan the patient can understand. Educate the patient about his or her diagnosis and medicines. Review with the patient what to do if a problem arises. Assess the degree of the patient's understanding of the discharge plan and provide a telephone reinforcement of the discharge plan</description>
