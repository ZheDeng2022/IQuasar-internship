    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, single arm, Phase II study designed to explore the efficacy of OMT-111&#xD;
      in patients with terminal stage solid tumors resistant to standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who voluntarily provide written consent to participate in this study undergo&#xD;
      screening tests within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of investigational product. Those who&#xD;
      meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria are enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 cycle consists of 4 weeks (28 days). Each week consists of 5 days of treatment and 2 days&#xD;
      of treatment-free interval (20 days of treatment and 8 days of treatment-free interval per&#xD;
      cycle in total). This study is planned to enroll approximately 76 subjects including 42&#xD;
      subjects with lung cancer, 22 subjects with breast cancer, and 12 subjects with pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. Treatment will be provided for 12 cycles (48 weeks). During the study, tests and&#xD;
      procedures to evaluate the efficacy and safety will be carried out according to the planned&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
