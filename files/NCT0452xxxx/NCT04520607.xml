  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a long-term extension to the Phase 3 parent-study SM04690-OA-11. It&#xD;
      aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term use of lorecivivint (LOR) in subjects&#xD;
      with knee osteoarthritis (OA). The first 48 weeks will be single-blind and placebo-controlled&#xD;
      while the remainder of the study will be open-label and uncontrolled. Subjects must enroll no&#xD;
      later than 6 weeks following completion of the parent-study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the first visit (Day 1), all subjects will complete Patient Acceptable Symptom State&#xD;
      (PASS) and pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) assessments and then receive a blinded study&#xD;
      injection into their target knee (the same target knee injected in the parent study), with&#xD;
      subjects receiving the same treatment (either 0.07 mg LOR or placebo) as they received in the&#xD;
      parent study. Subjects will have clinic visits for pain and function assessments, collection&#xD;
      of adverse events, and knee radiographs. At Week 48, all subjects, regardless of previous&#xD;
      treatment, will receive an injection of 0.07 mg LOR into their target knee. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive injections of 0.07 mg LOR into their target knee every 52 weeks thereafter until end&#xD;
      of study.&#xD;

The WOMAC is a widely-used, proprietary outcome measurement tool used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of subjects with OA of the knee and hip, including pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions), and physical functioning (17 questions) of the joints. Each question is measured on a scale from 0 (lowest pain/lowest stiffness/highest function) to 10 (highest pain/highest stiffness/lowest function). The WOMAC Function subscore ranges from 0 to 170.</description>
