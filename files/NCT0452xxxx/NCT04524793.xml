      The purpose of this study is to assess change in patient's symptoms before and after&#xD;
      Endovenous Microwave Ablation (EMA) as treatment for varicose veins. At the same time, it is&#xD;
      to evaluate the effectiveness of EMA and its treatment outcomes over a period of 1 year.&#xD;

      Healthy leg veins have valves that allow blood to move in one direction from the lower leg to&#xD;
      the heart. These valves open when blood is flowing toward the heart and then quickly close to&#xD;
      stop any backward flow. When veins weaken, their valves cannot close properly, causing&#xD;
      reversal of blood flow in the vein or venous reflux. Venous reflux due to the incompetent&#xD;
      valves in the superficial venous system is the most common form of venous insufficiency, also&#xD;
      known as varicose veins. This happens most often in the veins closest to the skin; the&#xD;
      superficial veins. Varicose veins may or may not have associated symptoms and can look like&#xD;
      twisted, bulging, rope-like cords or even small spider veins. While sometimes asymptomatic,&#xD;
      varicose veins can be associated with pain, aching or cramping in the legs, heaviness or a&#xD;
      tired sensation, paresthesia, pruritus, edema, inflammation with superficial phlebitis or&#xD;
      thrombophlebitis, ulceration, bleeding from ulcerated varicosities, ecchymosis from&#xD;
      subcutaneous rupture of varicosities, and deep venous thrombosis from extension of&#xD;
      superficial thrombophlebitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous insufficiency of lower extremities is a very common condition that is influenced by&#xD;
      genetic and mechanical factors, and is a chronic and progressive disorder. Prevalence&#xD;
      estimates vary widely by geographic location, with the highest reported rates in Western&#xD;
      countries, including Western Europe and the United States. Prevalence estimates of varicose&#xD;
      veins range from &lt;1% to up to 73% in females and 2% to up to 56% in males. The reported&#xD;
      prevalence ranges presumably reflect differences in the population distribution of risk&#xD;
      factors, accuracy in application of diagnostic criteria, and the quality and availability of&#xD;
      medical diagnostic and treatment resources. Risk factors for venous insufficiency include&#xD;
      older age, female gender and pregnancy, family history of venous disease, obesity and&#xD;
      occupations associated with prolonged standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of treatment options available to subjects with varicose veins, including&#xD;
      vein stripping surgery, and thermal ablation; for example, Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA),&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and sclerotherapy. Recent technological advances have also&#xD;
      brought about new treatment methods that are non-thermal, non-tumescent (NTNT). These include&#xD;
      Venaseal and Clarivein. The goal of each of these treatment regimens is to eliminate source&#xD;
      of reflux in order to control the progression of the disease, improve symptoms, promote ulcer&#xD;
      healing, and prevent recurrence or a combination of these. The latest treatment available&#xD;
      uses microwave ablation, which is a sub-type of radiofrequency and has the same&#xD;
      characteristics as radiofrequency ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to report a collaborative, prospective Singaporean experience using&#xD;
      the ECO Varicose Veins Therapeutic Unit from ECO (Nanjing ECO Microwave System Co., Ltd) for&#xD;
      Endovenous Microwave Ablation (EMA) to treat primary great and short saphenous vein reflux&#xD;
      and to evaluate its safety, efficacy and performance.&#xD;
