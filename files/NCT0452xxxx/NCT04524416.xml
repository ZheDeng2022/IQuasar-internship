  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the long-term (up to 5 years) safety and performance in patients with&#xD;
      open-angle glaucoma uncontrolled by topical hypotensive medications who had previously been&#xD;
      implanted with a MINIject glaucoma implant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess long-term safety and performance of MINIject glaucoma implant up to&#xD;
      5 years post-implantation. Patients who received implant and were followed for 2 years in a&#xD;
      previous study, will be invited to continue long-term follow-up from 2 to 5 years&#xD;
      post-implantation at annual intervals. Standard ophthalmologic assessments including&#xD;
      measurement of intraocular pressure, fundus examination, ocular imaging, assessment of any&#xD;
      untoward ocular events etc. will be performed.&#xD;
