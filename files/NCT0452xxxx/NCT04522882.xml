  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to collect the evolution of blood glucose levels in type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2D) patients under different conditions of their daily life: physical activity,&#xD;
      meals, sleep, etc. This data will be used to develop a test bench to evaluate insulin&#xD;
      delivery algorithms to treat patients with insulin-resistant T2D using a closed loop.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      T2D is a condition that combines insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. The T2D&#xD;
      naturally progresses towards an increasingly pronounced insulin deficiency that leads to the&#xD;
      need for pancreatic replacement, by administering insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) requires a complete and immediate substitution of pancreatic insulin&#xD;
      secretion. Currently, patients need to be involved in managing their disease by deciding how&#xD;
      much insulin to administer based on the results of glucose monitoring. Artificial&#xD;
      intelligence, thanks to a self-learning algorithm, enables the automation and customization&#xD;
      of insulin administration. These devices, known as closed loops, bring real benefit to the&#xD;
      patients included in the studies, by improving glycemic balance, by decreasing the number of&#xD;
      hypo- and hyperglycemia but also by decreasing the mental load associated with the disease,&#xD;
      improving their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These very significant benefits in the T1D treatment open the possibility of obtaining&#xD;
      similar benefits in the T2D treated by the basal-bolus type insulin regimen. This study aims&#xD;
      to develop a specific algorithm of T2D to meet its particular characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to collect the evolution of blood glucose levels in T2D&#xD;
      patients under different conditions of their daily life: physical activity, meals, sleep,&#xD;
      etc. This data will be used to develop a test bench to evaluate insulin delivery algorithms&#xD;
      to treat patients with insulin-resistant T2D using a closed loop.&#xD;
