  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare brain changes in individuals with overweight or obesity&#xD;
      enrolled in either the Noom Healthy Weight program or a matched control. The study objectives&#xD;
      (primary and secondary) are to measure brain change reported as ERP and EEG data over a&#xD;
      16-week timeframe. Additionally, we will explore changes in the default mode network&#xD;
      (resting-state asymmetry in EEG measurements), changes in executive functioning, quality of&#xD;
      life, mood, and salivary markers as they relate to EEG data.&#xD;

There are 52 weeks of curriculum with 1-3 articles to read per day. Users are requested to perform weight logging once daily and food logging after each meal. Users are assigned human coaches and are able to interact with them via in-app messaging or phone communication. Users are also assigned to support groups via in-app messaging.</description>
