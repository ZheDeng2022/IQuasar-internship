  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recently completed study suggested that processing speed and attention (PS/A) oriented&#xD;
      cognitive training (VSOP) produced robust effect on PS/A and working memory, but not in&#xD;
      cognitive control or episodic memory, and long-term effects were overall modest. The proposed&#xD;
      R01 renewal proposes to identify additional attributes to further enhance transferred and&#xD;
      long-term effects of PS/A training in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (MCI) by addressing adaptation capacity that underpins adaptive learning and neuroplasticity.&#xD;
      The goal of the stage II double-blinded randomized trial is to test whether adding resonance&#xD;
      frequency breathing (RFB) training to VSOP will strengthen multiple contributors to&#xD;
      adaptation capacity, particularly the central and peripheral pathways of autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system (ANS) flexibility, which will strengthen VSOP training effect on cognitive and brain&#xD;
      function and slow the progress of dementia in MCI. The central hypothesis is that&#xD;
      strengthening adaptation capacity, via improving autonomic nervous system (ANS) flexibility,&#xD;
      will enhance neuroplasticity and slow progress of dementia in MCI, since adaptation capacity&#xD;
      is critical for neuroplasticity of VSOP, but compromised in neurodegenerative process. Older&#xD;
      adults with MCI (n = 114) will be randomly assigned to an 8-week combined intervention&#xD;
      (RFB+VSOP), VSOP with guided imagery relaxation (IR) control, and a waitlist IR control, with&#xD;
      periodical booster training sessions at follow-ups. Mechanistic and distal outcomes include&#xD;
      ANS flexibility and multiple markers of dementia progress. Data will be collected across a&#xD;
      14-month period. The two primary aims are to examine long-term effects of the combined&#xD;
      intervention on ANS flexibility (Aim 1), as well as the cognitive, behavioral, and functional&#xD;
      capacity (Aim 2). The exploratory aim will be to determine the preliminary long-term effect&#xD;
      of the combined intervention on neurodegeneration. This can be a reasonable renewal plan from&#xD;
      the completed study, aiming to identify additional attributes to further enhance transferred&#xD;
      and long-term effects of cognitive training in MCI. This will be among the first randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials to examine a novel, combined intervention targeting adaptation capacity in&#xD;
      MCI, with an ultimate goal for slowing neurodegeneration.&#xD;
