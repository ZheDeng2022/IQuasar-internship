    <textblock>
      This study was planned as a quasi-experimental pre-test post-test control group design in&#xD;
      non-randomized groups to determine the effect of the preoperative visit by the operating room&#xD;
      nurse on the postoperative anxiety level and pain severity of patients undergoing open heart&#xD;
      surgery.After approval of the ethics committee and institutional permission, 64 patients who&#xD;
      were operated in Cardiovascular Surgery between September 1, 2020 and April 1, 2020 and met&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria will be included in the study.Sample size and power analysis of the&#xD;
      research was calculated by using the Clinical Calculator program,reported academic studies&#xD;
      was determined as effect value (size) d = 2.0935, α = 0.05 (margin of error), 1-β = 0.80&#xD;
      (Power).It was decided to include 64 people (32 per group). operated with the CPB&#xD;
      (cardiopulmonary bypass) method were included. The assignment to the control group and the&#xD;
      experimental group of patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in&#xD;
      the study will be made with the random numbers table created using the create number function&#xD;
      in the Excel program.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients who will undergo cardiac surgery between 01 September 2020 and 01 April 2021 and&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria will be able to participate in the study with their verbal and&#xD;
      written consents. The assignment of the patients to the control or experimental group will be&#xD;
      done with the random numbers table created using the generate number function in the Excel&#xD;
      program. This study will be conducted in 64 patients (32 patients in each group) who will be&#xD;
      operated in cardiac surgery at Istanbul Yeni Yüzyıl University GOP hospital. In order to&#xD;
      determine the postoperative anxiety and pain management effects of the patient visit of the&#xD;
      operating room nurse, the pre-test-post-test control group design will be made&#xD;
      quasi-experimental in non-randomized groups. The variables of the study were anxiety, pain,&#xD;
      and analgesic use. As data collection tools, 'Sampling Criteria Form' will be used for&#xD;
      sampling and 'State Trait Anxiety Scale I-II ' will be used for anxiety assessment. &quot;VAS&#xD;
      (Visual Analogue Scale)&quot; will be used for pain assessment, and &quot;Analgesic Follow-up Form&quot;&#xD;
      developed by the researcher will be used for the recording of analgesics. The &quot;Data Recording&#xD;
      Form&quot; created by the researcher will be used to record the demographic and medical data of&#xD;
      the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will apply the &quot;State-Trait Anxiety Scale&quot; to determine the level of anxiety&#xD;
      after visiting the patient's room and obtaining verbal and written permission from the&#xD;
      patient. If the patient is in the control group, it will be ensured that the institutional&#xD;
      procedures are implemented and followed without any intervention (without visiting and verbal&#xD;
      training printed booklet). In the experimental group,the operating room nurse, who is given&#xD;
      intervention training , will be provided to visit the patient before surgery. After the&#xD;
      verbal training of the operating room nurse, a printed booklet will be left for the patient&#xD;
      to read. It will be ensured that the nurse visiting the patient in her room will be welcomed&#xD;
      in the operating room. After the operation, the pain level of the patient will be monitored&#xD;
      by the Visual Assessment Scale (VAS) in the intensive care and inpatient floor. Pain level&#xD;
      and use of analgesics will be monitored at the first 72 hours and thereafter until the&#xD;
      thoracic tubes are removed. The analgesics ordered for the patient will be recorded according&#xD;
      to time, name, dose and route of administration. For these records, &quot;Analgesic Registration&#xD;
      Form&quot; developed by the researcher will be used.Patients with prolonged intensive care stay&#xD;
      (over 96 hours) and returning to intensive care will be excluded from the evaluation. If&#xD;
      these patients are excluded from the study, an &quot;intention to treat&quot; (ITT) analysis will be&#xD;
      performed to assess the realistic effect of the intervention. &quot;State-Trait Anxiety Scale&quot;&#xD;
      will be applied again by the researcher on the 24th hour to determine the postoperative&#xD;
      anxiety level of all patients.&#xD;

The trait anxiety scale-II, requires one out of four options to mark how the individual usually feels (1) almost never, (2) sometimes, (3) much time, (4) almost always.&#xD;

Assigned Interventions The level of anxiety experienced by the patients increases the postoperative perception and analgesic need, increasing the sequence and anesthetic substance. For these reasons, there is a need for studies to reduce pain distribution and severity by directly dealing with pre- and postoperative anxiety and anxiety levels. Similarly, the role of the operating room nurse in reducing patient anxiety is increasingly recognized. It is observed that the pre-operative visit and education reduce the pre-operative anxiety level in patients undergoing surgical intervention, and the pre-operative visit of the operating room nurse is on the agenda.</description>
