    <description>Evaluate both image quality and myocardial blood flow at different imaging time points.&#xD;
Image quality provides higher count Density and high spatial resolution, which makes it easier to see the heart vessels, and myocardial blood flow is measured in mL/g/min. Both measurements will be agregated to arrive at one reported value helps determine the balance of heart disease and in small and large vessels</description>

&#xD;
          -  &quot;Healthy adult volunteer subject&quot; is someone who is volunteering to undergo imaging&#xD;
             procedures and based on screening procedures has no known significant health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease that are scheduled to&#xD;
             have or have undergone a clinically indicated conventional rest/stress SPECT MPI and&#xD;
             no intervention between SPECT and PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must not be pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has any condition that, in the opinion of the Sponsor-Investigator or designee could&#xD;
             increase risk to the subject, limit the subject's ability to tolerate the research&#xD;
             procedures, or interfere with collection of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have abnormal findings on any screening/baseline procedure, e.g. physical examination,&#xD;
             laboratory tests, electrocardiogram that suggest the subject might have a condition&#xD;
             that could, in the opinion of the Sponsor-Investigator, affect the subject's response&#xD;
             to the radiopharmaceutical or related research procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is deemed likely to be unable to perform all research procedures for any reason,&#xD;
             (e.g., subjects unable to lie still or inability to tolerate up to 60 minutes in a&#xD;
             supine position with arms up during the PET imaging procedures due to chronic&#xD;
             back/shoulder pain or arthritis as assessed by physical examination and medical&#xD;
             history).&#xD;
