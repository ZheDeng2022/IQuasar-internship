  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two arms&#xD;
      study with 60 patients designed to evaluate the efficacy of Leronlimab (PRO 140) SC in&#xD;
      patients with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) for 13 weeks. Leronlimab (PRO 140 700 mg&#xD;
      dose) or placebo will be weekly administered subcutaneously by a licensed healthcare&#xD;
      professional at the clinic sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Follow Up visit will be conducted 28 (± 3) days after receiving the last study treatment&#xD;
      (i.e., after last dose of Leronlimab (PRO 140) or placebo).&#xD;
