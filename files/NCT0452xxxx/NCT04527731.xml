  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines (1) the extent and intensity of physical activity among women in&#xD;
      different phases of their pregnancy and (2) the relationship between patterns of physical&#xD;
      activity in pregnancy and well-being.&#xD;

      This study examines physical activity in different phases of pregnancy using accelerometry.&#xD;
      The recruitment of pregnant women (N=30) in the first or second trimester (until week 23)&#xD;
      will be realized over different channels (e.g, local newspapers, facebook, and leaflets in&#xD;
      gynecological practices, shopping centers, and nurseries).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent consists of: (i) activity recording over seven consecutive days using an&#xD;
      accelerometer, (ii) completion of standardized questionnaires, (iii) participation in a&#xD;
      cardiac ultrasound examination in the German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK) -&#xD;
      examination center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are asked to wear an accelerometer at daytime, and over seven consecutive days,&#xD;
      in trimester 1 (week 9-12), trimester 2 (week 23-26), and trimester 3 (week 36-39). Women who&#xD;
      are attended the study in the first trimester wear the device up to three time whereas those&#xD;
      who are attended the study in their second trimester wear the device up to twice. At the end&#xD;
      of each measurement period women are invited to fill in a self-administered questionnaire.&#xD;
      Also they are invited to participate in a cardiac ultrasound examination. Optionally,&#xD;
      participants may receive feedback on their physical activity measured by accelerometer as&#xD;
      well as about results of cardiac ultrasound examination upon completion of the study.&#xD;
