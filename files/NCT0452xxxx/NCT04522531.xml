  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercises used in shoulder rehabilitation compose of open kinetic chain and closed kinetic&#xD;
      chain exercises.The force formed on the trunk and legs is transferred to the shoulder in open&#xD;
      and closed kinetic chain exercises before shoulder muscles activation. It was shown that&#xD;
      trunk and leg muscle activity changes when they are performed in different ground. But it is&#xD;
      unknown how this alteration effect shoulder muscle activity. This will be provide a&#xD;
      significance approach due to incremented of shoulder muscle activity is important for&#xD;
      shoulder rehabilitation setting. To achieve this aim that is rising of muscle activity,&#xD;
      various approach is applied including alteration of ground which individual performed&#xD;
      exercise on it. And, it was shown that closed cinetic chain exercise which performed on&#xD;
      different ground change shoulder muscle activity. However, it is unknown whether alteration&#xD;
      of ground effect shoulder muscle activity or not in open cinetic chain exercise. That's why&#xD;
      the aim of this study is to investigate alteration of scapulothoracic shoulder muscle&#xD;
      activity in open cinetic chain shoulder exercise which enforced different ground.&#xD;

    <description>EMG analysis will be performed scapulothoracic muscle including upper trapezius, middle trapezius, lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscle. EMG sensors will be placed for each muscle according to SENIAM guidlines. Maximal voluntary isometric contraction will be performed three times for each muscle according to Kendal. Data will be collected during exercise performance which performed on stabil ground as well as unstabil ground using a BOSU (BOSU, Fitness, LLC, San Diego, CA).</description>

    <description>Muscle thickness will be analysed including upper trapezius, middle trapezius, lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscle during resting and each exercise performance. For muscle thickness evaluation SHMADZU SDU-1200PRO Diagnostic Ultrasound System (Shimadzu, Japan) device will be used.</description>

This exercises will be include PNF (flexion-adduction-external rotation pattern), PNF (flexion-abduction-external rotation pattern), scapular plan abduction, external rotation while keeping shoulder in 45 degree abduction. The weight which used during exercise planned according to individuals body weight: 0-59 kg: 3 kg; 60-69 kg: 4 kg; 70-85 kg: 5Kg. Exercises will be carried out in 3 phases consisting of concantric, isometric and eccentric phases. Each phase will be lasted 3 seconds. The time will be checked by using a metronome.</description>

    <description>Open cinetic chain shoulder exercise will be performed on BOSU which provides an unstabil ground. This exercises will be include PNF (flexion-adduction-external rotation pattern), PNF (flexion-abduction-external rotation pattern), scapular plan abduction, external rotation while keeping shoulder in 45 degree abduction.
