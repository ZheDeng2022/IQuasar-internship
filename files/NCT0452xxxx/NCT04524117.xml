  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the PVCFD trial is to predict vulnerable plaque confirmed by OCT using coronary CT&#xD;
      angiography and computational fluid dynamics in patients with acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndrome（ACS）mainly includes unstable angina, non-ST-segment elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, which is the leading&#xD;
      cause of death around the world. The main pathophysiological feature of ACS is the rupture of&#xD;
      vulnerable plaque, which can be recognized by coronary artery angiography (CAG),&#xD;
      intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Compared with CAG and&#xD;
      IVUS, OCT is the best intravascular imaging technique so far. But all these examinations are&#xD;
      invasive and expensive. Recently, coronary CT angiography derived adverse plaque&#xD;
      characteristics (APC) and hemodynamic forces defined by computational fluid dynamics (CFD)&#xD;
      can reflect plaque vulnerability and hemodynamic forces acting on the plaque, which are&#xD;
      important factors in the progress of the rupture of vulnerable plaque. So, we want to explore&#xD;
      predictive value of coronary CT angiography (CTA)and computational fluid dynamics for&#xD;
      vulnerable plaque in ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PVCFD trial is a prospective and single center study, patients with ACS will be arranged&#xD;
      to complete coronary CTA before CAG. OCT will be used to detect the characteristics of&#xD;
      coronary atherosclerotic plaques confirmed by CAG. Lipid plaques with fibrous cap thickness&#xD;
      less than 65um, erosion and coronary artery dissection are defined as vulnerable plaque.&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into vulnerable plaque group and stable plaque group according to&#xD;
      this. The coronary CTA images will be screened for APC and CFD analyses at core laboratories&#xD;
      of Shanghai tenth's hospital. Lesions with diameter stenosis (DS) &gt;30% based on coronary CTA&#xD;
      evaluation were included for subsequent APC (low-attenuation plaque, positive remodeling,&#xD;
      napkin-ring sign, and spotty calcification) analysis and hemodynamic forces (FFRCT,ΔFFRCT,&#xD;
      WSS and PWS) defined by CFD. Three prediction models (Model 1: percent diameter stenosis +&#xD;
      lesion length, Model 2: Model 1 + APC, Model 3: Model 2 + hemodynamic force) will be&#xD;
      constructed to identify vulnerable plaque confirmed by OCT.&#xD;
