      The purpose of the present study will be to evaluate the efficacy of a single dose of&#xD;
      botulinum toxin (BTX) at the Yonsei point for the treatment of gummy smile (GS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this double-blind single-site randomized clinical trial, A total number of 36 patients&#xD;
      with gummy smile will be enrolled in the study at Peking University School and Hospital of&#xD;
      Stomatology over a period of 12 months. Patients will be included and randomized 1:1 to two&#xD;
      groups for BTX-A treatment at different injection point. For experimental group, Three units&#xD;
      of onabotulinumtoxinA (BTX-A) per site (90 hemifaces) will be initially injected at the&#xD;
      Yonsei point. For control group，the same dose of BTX will be injected into the levator labii&#xD;
      superioris alaeque nasi muscle, and the injection point is located 3 to 5 mm lateral to each&#xD;
      nostril, which was a classical injection point of this treatment. The patients will be then&#xD;
      assessed at 2, 4, 12, 36 and 72 weeks postinjection. All subjects underwent standardized&#xD;
      measurements by a single examiner, including dynamic and static measurements and a lateral&#xD;
      cephalometric radiograph. In addition, facial photos and videos and a questionnaire of&#xD;
      self-assessment will be obtained. The primary outcome measurement is the anterior gingival&#xD;
      exposure measurements when the subject get an achieve full, unrestricted, spontaneous smiles&#xD;
      2 weeks postinjection.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gummy smile (GS), also known as excessive gingival display, is a common unaesthetic clinical&#xD;
      condition. Recent evidence showed that botulinum type A (BTX-A) injection is a promising,&#xD;
      simple, corrective method for GS. However, Currently, there is no standardized approach for&#xD;
      the treatment of excessive gingival exposure with botulinum toxin, and controversies still&#xD;
      exist and due to different injection methods, the efficiency of BTX-A for GS treatment shows&#xD;
      great variation in different studies, with the improvement rate of gingival exposure (GE)&#xD;
      ranging from 62% to 98%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment goal is to identify a consistent, minimally invasive alternative for the&#xD;
      correction of GS caused by hyperfunctional upper lip elevator muscles. In 2009, Hwang et. al.&#xD;
      described the Yonsei point, which is the confluence of three muscles - the levator labii&#xD;
      superioris (LLS), the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi (LLSAN), and the zygomaticus&#xD;
      minor (Zm). These three muscles are primarily responsible for the smile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to minimize the complications associated with multiple injections of BTX, the&#xD;
      present study is designed with the prime purpose of evaluating the efficacy of one injection&#xD;
      of BTX at the Yonsei point as a minimally invasive approach in the treatment of GS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this double-blind single-site randomized clinical trial, A total number of 36 patients&#xD;
      with gummy smile will be enrolled in the study at Peking University School and Hospital of&#xD;
      Stomatology over a period of 12 months. Patients will be included and randomized 1:1 to two&#xD;
      groups for BTX-A treatment at different injection point. For experimental group, Three units&#xD;
      of onabotulinumtoxinA (BTX-A) per site (90 hemifaces) will be initially injected at the&#xD;
      Yonsei point. For control group，the same dose of BTX will be injected into the levator labii&#xD;
      superioris alaeque nasi muscle, and the injection point is located 3 to 5 mm lateral to each&#xD;
      nostril, which was a classical injection point of this treatment. The patients will be then&#xD;
      assessed at 2, 4, 12, 36 and 72 weeks postinjection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measurement is the anterior gingival exposure measurements when the&#xD;
      subject get an achieve full, unrestricted, spontaneous smiles 2 weeks postinjection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study Design and Participants This double-blind single-site randomized clinical trial&#xD;
           will be conducted in Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology from October&#xD;
           of 2020 to 2021, approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Peking University&#xD;
           Health Science Center (No: 202056097) and conducted in accordance with the tenets of the&#xD;
           Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A total number of 36 patients with gummy smile will be enrolled in the study. The&#xD;
           inclusion criteria will be as follows: ≥3.0-mm GE upon unrestricted, &quot;full-blown&quot;&#xD;
           smiling and age between 18 and 60 years. The exclusion criteria will be contraindication&#xD;
           of BTX-A, previous diseases or treatments affecting the position of the gingiva or upper&#xD;
           lips, history of BTX-A injections to the head or neck region, facial paralysis, and/or&#xD;
           subject's refusal to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preintervention measurements Before injection, all subjects underwent standardized&#xD;
           measurements by a single examiner, including dynamic and static measurement. In&#xD;
           addition, facial photos and videos and a questionnaire of self-assessment will be&#xD;
           obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Dynamic measurements Extremely funny jokes, statements, singing, and/or dancing will&#xD;
           be played out to the subjects to achieve full, unrestricted, spontaneous smiles as&#xD;
           described by Sarver and Ackerman.7 The measurements will be taken individually during 3&#xD;
           different spontaneous smiles to ensure maximal smile for each measured area. Dynamic&#xD;
           measurements included anterior GE, bilateral posterior GEs, bilateral distance from&#xD;
           commissures to the dental midline, and bilateral vertical positions of commissures.&#xD;
           Anterior GE presented the severity of GS as the primary indicator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Static measurements The following measurements will be performed with the patient in&#xD;
           a relaxed state (resting jaw position). Lip-teeth relationship included the exposed&#xD;
           medial incisor (the distance between the inferior margin point of the right incisor and&#xD;
           the lower margin of the upper lip) and the upper lip length. Dental factors included the&#xD;
           upper right incisor length, width-to-length ratio of the upper medial incisor, and the&#xD;
           overbite and overjet of the anterior teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Interventions Patients will be included and randomized 1:1 to two groups for BTX-A&#xD;
           treatment at different injection point. For all patients, Lyophilized 100 U of BTX-A&#xD;
           (Botox, Allergan, Irvine, CA) will be reconstituted in 2.5 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride&#xD;
           solution.21 A uniform BTX-A injection technique22 with single-site injection will be&#xD;
           administered by the same doctor. For experimental group, Three units of&#xD;
           onabotulinumtoxinA (BTX-A) per site (90 hemifaces) will be initially injected at the&#xD;
           Yonsei point. For control group，the same dose of BTX will be injected into the levator&#xD;
           labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle, and the injection point is located 3 to 5 mm&#xD;
           lateral to each nostril. No anesthesia will be given during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow-up The patients will be then assessed at 2, 4, 12, 36 and 72 weeks postinjection.&#xD;
           All dynamic measurements; some static measurements (exposed medial incisor, upper lip&#xD;
           length, and medial incisor length); and facial photos and videos will be repeated.&#xD;
           Questionnaires will be provided to patients to determine patient satisfaction, side&#xD;
           effects, willingness to undergo a repeat treatment, and an improvement in their&#xD;
           nasolabial fold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical analysis Data entry will be managed using EpiData 3.1 (EpiData Association,&#xD;
           Denmark) and accuracy will be ensured by double entry and validation. The normality of&#xD;
           numerical variables will be assessed using a Shapiro-Wilk test. The mean and standard&#xD;
           deviation will be used to describe normally distributed numerical values, and an&#xD;
           independent-samples t test will be used to compare the 2 groups. Non-normally&#xD;
           distributed numerical values will be described using the median and interquartile range&#xD;
           (25th percentile, 75th percentile). The difference between the 2 groups will be compared&#xD;
           using a Mann-Whitney U test. For categorical variables, the fraction of the treatment&#xD;
           group that belonged to the given category will be used, and the difference between the 2&#xD;
           groups will be compared using a x2 test (Fisher exact probability method). All&#xD;
           statistical analyses will be carried out using SPSS(Statistical Product and Service&#xD;
           Solutions) software v. 20.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY). A 2-tailed P value less than .05&#xD;
           will be considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Data will be&#xD;
           analyzed by the Research Center of Clinical Epidemiology (Peking University, Beijing,&#xD;
           China).&#xD;
