      The investigators will evaluate whether a system involving Female Community Health Volunteers&#xD;
      (FCHVs) and facility-based community health workers (FB-CHWs) of Health Post (Auxiliary&#xD;
      Health Workers, Auxiliary Nurse Midwives and Health Assistant) can contribute to improving&#xD;
      hypertension care in rural Nepal. This study will be conducted in Rupa (active group) and&#xD;
      Biruwa (comparison group) Rural Municipality of Gandaki province and enroll at least 736&#xD;
      hypertensive adults (322 in Rupa Rural Municipality and 414 in Biruwa Rural Municipality) who&#xD;
      are aged 25-70 years, not taking antihypertensive medication, not pregnant and not&#xD;
      breastfeeding, free of prior cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. In&#xD;
      Rupa Municipality, eligible participants will be able to receive amlodipine, one of the most&#xD;
      frequently used antihypertensive medications, from FB-CHWs at Health Posts and five times&#xD;
      (including baseline and end of study) of lifestyle counseling by FCHVs, whereas participants&#xD;
      in Biruwa Municipality will receive the usual care plus three times (including baseline and&#xD;
      end of study) of lifestyle counseling by FCHVs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite a large body of evidence on the effectiveness of hypertension treatment in reducing&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the control rate of hypertension is low in many low&#xD;
      and middle-income countries. The shortage of skilled workforce diagnosing and managing&#xD;
      hypertension is one of the major barriers. A promising option is to involve community health&#xD;
      workers (CHWs) in hypertension care, who have shown promising results for improving maternal&#xD;
      and child health. However, the evidence on whether CHWs can diagnose and treat hypertension&#xD;
      under the supervision of a physician has not been systematically tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this study will evaluate whether existing Facility Based-Community Health Workers&#xD;
      (FB-CHWs) and Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) of the Ministry of Health can safely&#xD;
      and effectively diagnose hypertension and initiate/maintain protocol-based hypertension&#xD;
      treatment. This study will be conducted in Rupa (active group) and the Biruwa (comparison&#xD;
      group) Rural Municipality of Gandaki province. All adults aged 25-70 years of age who reside&#xD;
      in the Rupa and Biruwa municipalities are eligible for the initial screening by data&#xD;
      enumerators of the Nepal Development Society (NeDS). Only eligible participants who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rupa Rural Municipality will allow the initiation of antihypertensive medication (amlodipine)&#xD;
      by FB-CHW at Health Posts under the supervision of a study physician. Biruwa Rural&#xD;
      Municipality will follow usual care, which is a referral to healthcare facilities currently&#xD;
      providing hypertension care. FCHVs will provide lifestyle counseling and follow up the&#xD;
      adherence to hypertension treatment three times in Rupa Rural Municipality and once in Biruwa&#xD;
      Rural Municipality.FCHV in Rupa Rural Municipality will make three home visits (at 3, 6, and&#xD;
      9 months) whereas FCHV in Biruwa Rural Municipality will make one home visit after 3 months&#xD;
      of baseline. The end of the study survey will be carried out after one year by FCHV and NeDS&#xD;
      data enumerators. The primary study outcome is a net change in systolic blood pressure among&#xD;
      hypertensive participants 12-months after confirming hypertension in the active vs. the&#xD;
      comparison group.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be first screened for their blood pressure and asked a few questions to determine eligibility. For eligible participants, FCHV will visit within ~1 week and measure blood pressure again. If found high, the participant will be referred to the nearest Health Post. At the Health Posts, if FB-CHWs confirms the diagnosis of hypertension, they will prescribe amlodipine 5 mg/d according to the study protocol and ask the patient to return in ~2 weeks. If blood pressure is controlled (&lt;140/90 mmHg) after ~2 weeks, FB-CHWs will refill amlodipine 5 mg/d for 3 months. If not, FB-CHWs will increase the dose to 10 mg/d and follow up in ~2 weeks. If still not controlled with amlodipine 10 mg, FB-CHWs will refer the patient to the Regional Hospital in Pokhara. In addition, FCHVs will visit patients' homes 3 times (at 3-, 6-, and 9-month), provide lifestyle counseling, and follow up the adherence to hypertension treatment.</description>
