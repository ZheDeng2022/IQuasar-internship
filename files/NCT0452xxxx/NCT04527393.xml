  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized clinical trial is to assess the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      post-adenotonsillectomy analgesia with individualized opioid analgesia regime in children.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomly assigned to individualized opioid analgesia regimen group or&#xD;
      conventional opioid analgesia regimen group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous 1μg/kg fentanyl is administered as a test in patients with spontaneous breath&#xD;
      after sevoflurane induction. A positive result is defined as a decrease of more than 50% in&#xD;
      spontaneous respiratory rate (rate after fentanyl test versus rate before fentanyl test).&#xD;
      Otherwise it is defined as a negative result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients are given regular paracetamol and ibuprofen after surgery. The addition of&#xD;
      rescue oral morphine is given as needed. The dose of oral morphine is determined according to&#xD;
      the results of fentanyl test in the individualized group, while the patients in the&#xD;
      conventional group are given the routine dose. The Faces Scale is used to assess analgesic&#xD;
      effectiveness by parents from postoperative day 1 to day 10. If the Faces Scale score &gt; 6,&#xD;
      the child receive rescue oral morphine analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the preoperative appointment, parents are provided with a pulse oximeter including oxygen&#xD;
      saturation sensors to take home. The oxygen saturation per night during sleep will be&#xD;
      monitored using the pulse oximeter by parents from postoperative Day 1 to Day 10. The&#xD;
      research team will instruct parents on how to properly apply the oximeter to the child and&#xD;
      repeat these measurements. The primary outcome measure is desaturation events during sleep&#xD;
      per night.&#xD;
