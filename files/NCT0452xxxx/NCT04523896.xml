  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dose escalation is nowadays a standard strategy in radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Besides,&#xD;
      it is believed that due to the radiobiology characteristics of prostate cells (low alpha/beta&#xD;
      ratio), the delivery of higher radiation doses per fraction could theoretically improve the&#xD;
      efficacy of the treatment. In this context, the combination of prostate brachytherapy and&#xD;
      external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) has proven to be the most effective method of dose&#xD;
      escalation significantly improving disease control in randomized clinical trials.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, this strategy is also associated with an increased risk of acute and late&#xD;
      adverse events compared to conventional EBRT alone. It has been proposed that this increase&#xD;
      in adverse events could be related to the use Low-Dose-Rate (LDR) brachytherapy and that&#xD;
      High-Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy (a more modern and accurate procedure) could reduce this&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) is a high-precision radiation&#xD;
      technique that allows the delivery of higher doses per fraction in fewer sessions, reducing&#xD;
      the total treatment time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that the combination of two highly conformal radiation&#xD;
      techniques (HDR brachytherapy and SABR) could be well tolerated, while reducing total&#xD;
      treatment time and therefore improving patient quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single arm Phase II clinical trial designed to test the feasibility, tolerability&#xD;
      and impact on quality of life of the combination of High-Dose-Rate prostate brachytherapy and&#xD;
      SABR for patients with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer.&#xD;
