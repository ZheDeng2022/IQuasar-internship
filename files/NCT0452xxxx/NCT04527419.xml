      Systematically mediastinal lymph node dissection or not in clinical stage T1 ground-glass&#xD;
      dominated invasive lung adenocarcinoma: a multi-center, prospective clinical trial&#xD;

      Patients who signed informal consent would be evaluated for inclusion criteria and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. He/she would then enter one group of the study according to a random number table.&#xD;
      The patients in SLND group would receive systematically mediastinal lymph node dissection&#xD;
      (SLND), while those in non-SLND group would not receive systematically mediastinal lymph node&#xD;
      dissection. Finally, 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) would be recorded in the follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation: In a previous study, the 3-year DFS was 96.6% for patients who were&#xD;
      diagnosed as cT1 GGO dominated invasive lung adenocarcinoma and received lobectomy and SLND.&#xD;
      We hypothesized that if the 3-year DFS was over 91.6% for patients who were diagnosed as cT1&#xD;
      GGO dominated invasive lung adenocarcinoma and received lobectomy and without SLND, we&#xD;
      regarded that non-SLND group is no inferior to SLND group. In this context, the estimated&#xD;
      sample size was 636. Considering 10% enrolled patients would loss in follow-up or not meet&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria, the final sample size was 700.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to render the patients recruited in accordance with distribution of tumor location,&#xD;
      we designed the random number table with stratification. In a previous study, for tumor&#xD;
      location for cT1 GGO dominated invasion lung adenocarcinoma, 24.7% was in left upper lobe,&#xD;
      13.2% was in left lower lobe, 37.6% was in right upper lobe, 6.6% was in right middle lobe&#xD;
      and 17.9% was in right lower lobe. Thus, we designed random number tables for each lobe&#xD;
      according to the above proportion. The random number table for left upper lobe included 87&#xD;
      patients for either group. The table for left lower lobe included 46 patients for either&#xD;
      group. The table for right upper lobe included 132 patients for either group. The table for&#xD;
      right middle lobe included 23 patients for either group. The table for right lower lobe&#xD;
      included 63 patients for either group. The total number of patients designed to enroll was&#xD;
      702.&#xD;
