      Lack of research oriented health care facilities especially rehabilitation department in&#xD;
      Pakistan. 30-50 % of population of age 65 years and above have some problems with balance (3)&#xD;
      and 75 % of people aging 70 years and above have poor balance which leads to fall related&#xD;
      injuries (5). So fall and related injuries are major problem in this age group. All studies&#xD;
      conducted so far addresses only one or two aspects of balance training not to all. This study&#xD;
      will address all the aspects and develop a comprehensive balance training protocol and will&#xD;
      try to contribute to this under research area.&#xD;

      will address all the aspects and develop a comprehensive balance training protocol and will&#xD;
      try to contribute to this under research area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost effective treatment for patients. To meet the expectation of patient to improve their&#xD;
      quality of life and improvement of their satisfactory level. It will be interesting for&#xD;
      patient to visualize the activity patient is performing and comparison of effectiveness of&#xD;
      comprehensive fall prevention protocol with traditional balance training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will reduce the occurrence of fall episodes and hence reduce the cost to treat these fall&#xD;
      and fall related injuries. Older adult will be less dependent, and more mobile and&#xD;
      contributing member of the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the effect of comprehensive fall prevention protocol (CARE) on fall risk as&#xD;
           compared to conventional training in elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the effect of comprehensive fall prevention protocol (CARE) on Mobility Level&#xD;
           as compared to conventional training in elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the effect of comprehensive fall prevention protocol (CARE) on Wii Fit&#xD;
           balance as compared to conventional training in elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the effect of comprehensive fall prevention protocol (CARE) on Dynamic&#xD;
           Balance as compared to conventional training in elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare the effect of comprehensive fall prevention protocol (CARE) on Quality of&#xD;
           life as compared to conventional training in elderly.&#xD;
