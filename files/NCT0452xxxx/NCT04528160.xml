    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using pain neuroscience education for older&#xD;
      adults with chronic pain from primary care services. It will have a group of participants&#xD;
      receiving pain neuroscience education and exercise and a group receiving usual care.&#xD;
