  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Want to know the effect of dexmedetomidine during opioid free anesthesia on postoperative&#xD;
      recovery after gastrectomy. Patients undergoing open gastrectomy are divided into&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine group and control(remifentanil) group, administered during surgery, and&#xD;
      compared with the speed of postoperative intestinal function recovery. Based on our&#xD;
      institution's previous record, the average recovery time was 6 ± 1.4 days. Given that it is&#xD;
      clinically significant to reduce recovery time by 20%, Alpha 0.05 and Power 80% require 31&#xD;
      samples per group, and assuming a 10% dropout rate, the total number of samples needed is&#xD;
      68.Subjects are patients aged 19 to 75 who are subject to open gastretomy planned by a&#xD;
      gastric cancer. The exclusion criteria include American Society of Anesthesiology grade 3 or&#xD;
      higher, patients who have previously been treated for cancer, patients with cancer other than&#xD;
      the stomach, patients with drug allergies, weight less than 60kg, BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2, patients&#xD;
      who are unable to communicate and are unable to read consent (e.g., illiteracy, foreigners,&#xD;
      etc.). The research method is a Randomized double-blind controlled study, and the assignment&#xD;
      of both drugs is unknown and is used to maintain anesthesia in the form of continuous&#xD;
      injection during surgery. Primary outcome is the recovery period satisfying the following.&#xD;
      1)intestinal gas passage 2) tolerance of soft bland diet (SBD) for 24 hr. 3) safe ambulation&#xD;
      without assistance 4) no requirement iv analgesics after discontinuation of PCA (VAS &lt;4). 5)&#xD;
      no abnormal physical signs or laboratory test. The secondary outcomes are maximum VAS,&#xD;
      post-operative hospital stay, complications and readmission rate at 3 months F/U time,&#xD;
      post-operative period analgesic requirement, incidence of opioid related side effect.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Patients are divided into the Dexmedetomidine group / control group by random assignment. Using a table of computer-generated random numbers(s), assign 68 people to each county by 34 people. Random tables, in turn, seal the results in an opaque envelope. An anesthesiologist who is unaware of the content of this study and does not participate in the study receives information only about drug administration and is in charge of anesthesia, and does not disclose information about the assigned group to postoperative observers. Also, they don't disclose information about the assigned group to the surgeon.</masking_description>

    <description>The prepared drug marks the assigned group as unknown. In both groups, the test drug marked as unknown begins to be administered in an anesthetic induction. When the patient arrives in the operating room, electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, and bispectral index (BIS) monitoring is performed. In both groups, 2 mg/kg of propofol induces general anesthesia, intubates after administration of rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg, and maintains anesthesia with sevoflurane 1.5-2.5 vol%. Use 0.075 mg of palonosetrone as an antiemetics after inducing anesthesia. Adjust the inhalation anesthetic to maintain BIS 40-60 , mechanical ventilation to maintain the Tidal volume of 8 ml/kg, PEEP 5 mmHg and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) of 35-40 mmHg. Push 1mcg of fentanyl and 1g of acetaminophen per kg for pain control 20 minutes before the end of surgery.</description>
