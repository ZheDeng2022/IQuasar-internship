  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the tolerability, feasibility, and efficacy of the AKST1210&#xD;
      apheresis column in subjects with end-stage renal disease with cognitive impairment (ESRD-CI)&#xD;
      undergoing hemodialysis 3 times per week.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, approximately 26 men and women on dialysis due to end stage renal disease and&#xD;
      who have cognitive impairment will be randomly assigned to receive AKST1210 or control during&#xD;
      each hemodialysis session for 3 months. The primary objective is to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of AKST1210, and secondary objectives include changes in cognitive assessments&#xD;
      as well as the feasibility of using AKST1210 in this setting.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the MoCA, which assesses attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuo-constructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. The MoCA has a score from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating better cognition.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Computer-based Cognitive Assessment (CogState) Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in CogState Composite Score. CogState is a simple, brief computerized neuropsychological battery to evaluate cognitive impairments. The composite CogState score assesses attention and memory functions - including Verbal episodic memory, Visual Episodic Memory, Psychomotor function, Visual attention and working memory. CogState scores are measured on a linear scale (with no minimum or maximum score) and a reduction in scores compared to baseline indicates an improvement in cognitive functions.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in quality of life per the SF-36, which evaluates quality of life measures. The SF-36 score ranges from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating less disability.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the PHQ-9, which evaluates the severity of depression. Symptoms are rated from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in sleep quality per the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in sleep quality as measured by the PSQI, which measures the quality and patterns of sleep in older adults. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep by measuring 7 domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The subject self-rates each of these 7 areas of sleep. Scoring of the answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. A global sum of &quot;5&quot; or greater indicates a &quot;poor&quot; sleeper.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in fatigue per the Fatigue Questionnaire - Functional Assessments of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in fatigue as measured by the FACIT, which measures an individual's level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week. The level of fatigue is measured on a 4-point Likert scale (4 = not at all fatigued to 0 = very much fatigued). The score range 0 to 52. A score of less than 30 indicates severe fatigue. The higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>
