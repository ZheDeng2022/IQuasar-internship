  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Boys with posterior urethral valves have bladder dysfunction of varying severity. Early&#xD;
      treatment of these children with anticholinergics is recommended by some teams, although&#xD;
      there have never been any clear studies on the subject. To our knowledge, no comparative&#xD;
      study of the evolution of valve bladders with or without treatment has been carried out to&#xD;
      date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticholinergic treatment, although it may be beneficial in patients with abnormal bladder&#xD;
      function, such as the neurologic bladders ( in Spina Bifida) for example, may have side&#xD;
      effects and may not be of benefit for this valve population. The evolution of the valves&#xD;
      could be spontaneously favorable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would be the first randomized clinical trial of early therapeutic drug&#xD;
      intervention in the posterior urethral valve population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posterior urethral valves (VUPs) are the leading cause of subvesical obstruction in children&#xD;
      with an incidence between 1 / 3,000 to 1 / 8,000 births. 25-45% of patients will have chronic&#xD;
      renal failure and 10-20% will require a transplant. The association between long-term&#xD;
      prognosis and bladder dysfunction is well known, leading many teams to suggest early&#xD;
      initiation of treatment with anticholinergics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this treatment has never been properly evaluated. In fact, a single study carried&#xD;
      out in boys with valves taking oxybutynin from the age of 3 months to 2 years without a&#xD;
      control group concluded that &quot;the early use of anticholinergics in boys with VUP presenting&#xD;
      high voiding pressures and low bladder capacity has a beneficial effect on bladder function.&#xD;
      It is true that in children with neurologic bladders as in Spina Bifida, early treatment with&#xD;
      anticholinergics seems to provide a benefit, but VUPs are not strictly speaking neurologic&#xD;
      bladders. In addition, treatment with anticholinergics can have side effects and could even&#xD;
      be harmful to the bladder, leading to myogenic bankruptcy. The only way to properly assess&#xD;
      oxybutynin in this population is to conduct a prospective randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study includes a group treated with oxybutynin and a group without. Boys who&#xD;
      have had valve resection for VUP within the first three months of life and who present an&#xD;
      abnormal urodynamic assessment 3 months after valve resection will be included. Oxybutynin&#xD;
      will be given at a dose of 0.1 mg / kg 2x / day, as syrup, in the treatment group. The&#xD;
      control group will not have any treatment affecting bladder function. The pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      oxybutynin will be studied. Several urodynamic parameters including capacity or volume,&#xD;
      voiding pressure and compliance will be studied. The objective is to perform a composite&#xD;
      analysis that can reflect the complex functioning of the bladder. The children included will&#xD;
      have urodynamics at the end of the study, after 9 months of treatment. The performance of&#xD;
      urodynamic examinations will be standardized and there will be an external centralized&#xD;
      analysis to validate the urodynamic results.&#xD;

Oxybutynin (0.1 mg/kg twice daily) during 9 months.&#xD;
No oxybutynin To determine whether the observed effects of oxybutynin are really due to the treatment we need to perform a randomized clinical trial. There is insufficient evidence in the literature about the natural evolution of the bladder in boys with PUV.&#xD;
Given the paucity of literature data, our objective is not to formally test the superiority of oxybutynin versus no drug but to detect and quantify the effect of oxybutynin. This is why our clinical is randomized but non-comparative.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Investigational Medicinal Product of this study is Oxybutynin 1 mg/ml Syrup (see Annex 1 for the Monograph of PMS-Oxybutynin provided by ANSM under the ATU.). It will be administered at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg/twice a day to patients randomized to the study treatment group. The dose will be adapted to the child's weight to the nearest kilogram.&#xD;
The recommended dosage for older children with neurologic bladder is 0.3 to 0.4mg/kg/day, whilst the dosage we will be using is effectively 0.2mg/kg/day. This is because we are taking into account the absence or pharmacological studies of oxybutynin use in children &lt;1 year of age, as well as their specific liver metabolism. Furthermore, the dose of 0.1mg/kg twice daily is the dose used in children within the same age group in the study by Casey et al, 2012</description>
