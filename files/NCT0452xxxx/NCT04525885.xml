  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the efficacy of gefapixant (MK-7264)&#xD;
      in reducing cough frequency as measured over a 24-hour period. It is hypothesized that at&#xD;
      least one dose of gefapixant is superior to placebo in reducing coughs per hour (over 24&#xD;
      hours) at Week 24.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will have a main 24-week treatment period and a 28-week extension period of&#xD;
      treatment. The China extension to MK-7264-030 (NCT03449147) will enroll a total of&#xD;
      approximately 160 Chinese participants. The initial China Extension protocol (amendment 3)&#xD;
      will include the Gefapixant 15 mg BID treatment arm; this treatment arm will not be included&#xD;
      in subsequent protocol amendments (eg amendment 5).&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the efficacy of gefapixant based on the percentage of participants with ≥2.7-point reduction of the mean weekly CSD total score at Week 24. Participants will record their cough frequency, intensity, and disruption due to cough using the 7-item CSD. Participants will rate each item using an 11-point scale ranging from 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating greater severity.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the efficacy of gefapixant based on improvement from Baseline in cough severity, assessed by the proportion of participants with a ≥30 mm reduction from baseline in Cough Severity VAS score at Week 24. The VAS is a single-item questionnaire with the response on a 100- point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;No Cough&quot;) to 100 (&quot;Extremely Severe Cough&quot;).</description>
