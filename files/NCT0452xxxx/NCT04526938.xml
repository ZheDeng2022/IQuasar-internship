  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the use of a physician-modified Cook Alpha&#xD;
      Thoracic Endovascular Graft in the repair of complex aortic aneurysms and thoracoabdominal&#xD;
      aortic aneurysms and aneurysms secondary to aortic dissections in high-risk patients having&#xD;
      appropriate anatomy. The primary intent of the study is to assess the safety and preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of the device. Additionally, the study will assess renal function, radiation&#xD;
      exposure, and quality of life.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, single-center, non-randomized, single-arm study. Each enrolled&#xD;
      subject will undergo periodic follow-up evaluations involving physical exams, computed&#xD;
      tomography angiography (CTA) of chest, abdomen and pelvis, abdominal duplex ultrasound,&#xD;
      creatinine measurement, quality of life questionnaire at specific, protocol-defined intervals&#xD;
      for a period of five years following the physician-modified Cook Zenith® Alpha Endovascular&#xD;
