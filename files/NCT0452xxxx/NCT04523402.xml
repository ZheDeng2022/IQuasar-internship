  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled, open label, phase II clinical trial is designed to target patients&#xD;
      with resectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) with high risk of lymph node metastasis&#xD;
      as evaluated by our previously established radiomics model, which has low postoperative&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival. In this study, we aim to compare the prognosis of ICC patients who&#xD;
      undergo liver resection (LR) following preoperative oxaliplatin and gemcitabine (GEMOX)&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy (experimental arm) versus LR alone (control arm).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most common liver cancer, and its&#xD;
      incidence and mortality have been rising worldwide over the past two decades. Liver resection&#xD;
      (LR) remains the only potentially curative treatment for ICC. However, the long-term outcome&#xD;
      after LR is still dismal, and the 5-year survival after curative-intent resection was up to&#xD;
      35%. Lymph node (LN) metastasis is found in about 40% of ICC patients and is known to be one&#xD;
      of the most important adverse prognostic factors. Considering such circumstances, it is&#xD;
      crucial to determine the validity of routine LN dissection for ICC during LR, but there is so&#xD;
      far no definitive evidence about the use of this surgical procedure. Preoperative&#xD;
      individualized LN status assessment is beneficial for clinical decision of LN dissection and&#xD;
      stratifying patients who may benefit from preoperative neoadjuvant therapy. The conventional&#xD;
      and qualitative radiological characteristics in abdominal computerized tomography (CT)&#xD;
      exhibited limited accuracy for preoperative assessment of LN status. Radiomics, a novel&#xD;
      approach in medical image analysis, involves high-throughput extraction of quantitative image&#xD;
      features and then associates these features with clinical concerns. The radiomic approach has&#xD;
      been employed into preoperative diagnosis and prediction of prognosis. We have proposed a&#xD;
      nomogram, incorporating conventional clinico-radiological characteristics and novel radiomic&#xD;
      features in CT scan, provided accurate LN metastasis prediction in ICC patients and may aid&#xD;
      the treatment decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant therapy refers to some treatments taken before surgery for newly treated tumor&#xD;
      patients who have not found distant metastasis, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy,&#xD;
      targeted therapy, etc., to reduce tumors, reduce tumor stages, and reduce postoperative&#xD;
      recurrence rate, prolonging survival time. As suggested by the results from previous studies,&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin plus gemcitabine for locally advanced ICC may be an&#xD;
      effective downstaging option, facilitating secondary resectability in patients with initially&#xD;
      unresectable disease (53%, 39 in 74 patients received secondary resection). In addition, for&#xD;
      selected patients with locally advanced ICC who showed pre-transplant disease stability on&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy could obtain 50% 5-year recurrence-free survival and 83.3% 5-year&#xD;
      overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These evidences suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with GEMOX regimen may be an ideal&#xD;
      modality for patients with resectable ICC with high possibility of LN metastasis to reduce&#xD;
      potential risk of recurrence, which is worth more investigation.&#xD;
