  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research has the following specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To elucidate how within-person variation in lifestyle factors affect fluctuations in&#xD;
           blood glucose concentrations in individuals at high risk of diabetes.This study will&#xD;
           elucidate how variation in food intakes, physical activity, and psychological stress&#xD;
           affect variation in blood glucose concentrations throughout the day. These results can&#xD;
           identify potential targets for interventions to reduce excessive fluctuations in blood&#xD;
           glucose concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe to what extent the response of individuals to a standardized meal tolerance&#xD;
           test can predict real-life variation in blood glucose concentrations. This study will&#xD;
           evaluate how much variation in glucose concentrations under real-life conditions can be&#xD;
           explained by an individual's response to a standardized mixed meal tolerance test. This&#xD;
           will provide insight into the relative importance of variation in dietary and other&#xD;
           lifestyle behaviours on an individual's predisposition to higher blood glucose&#xD;
           responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To elucidate the role of oral processing behaviour and saliva properties on blood&#xD;
           glucose concentrations. This study will elucidate whether variation in oral processing&#xD;
           behaviours (e.g. number of chews taken, oro-sensory exposure time) and saliva properties&#xD;
           (a-amylase activity, flow rate) predicts variation in blood glucose concentrations&#xD;
           across individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess whether research collecting multiple repeated measures of food intake,&#xD;
           activity, and stress is feasible in large-scale epidemiological studies.This study will&#xD;
           provide important insights into the feasibility over the long-run to collect multiple&#xD;
           repeated data points on lifestyle behaviours through mobile phone applications and&#xD;
           24-hour glucose and physical activity monitoring in large scale studies in the Singapore&#xD;
           population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study in free-living participants over up to 14 consecutive days.&#xD;
      The rationale is that this period will provide sufficient intra-individual data for exploring&#xD;
      behavioural and psychological determinants of blood glucose fluctuation. Multiple repeated&#xD;
      data points on lifestyle behaviours will be collected through mobile phone applications, and&#xD;
      24-hour glucose concentrations and physical activity will be monitored objectively over the&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a pilot study, 36 participants will be recruited with anticipated 15% dropout&#xD;
      resulting in 30 remaining participants. The recruitment target is determined based on what is&#xD;
      financially feasible and sufficient to meet the study aims.Hierarchical clustering will be&#xD;
      used to identify subjects with similar continuous blood glucose trajectories over 1 week by&#xD;
      classifying them into groups. Followed by assessing whether the group labels from the cluster&#xD;
      analysis are associated with the variation in dietary intakes, physical activity and&#xD;
      psychological stress using Chi-square test or Fisher Exact test where appropriate. To&#xD;
      quantify the effect of specific events (e.g., dietary intake, physical activity and stress&#xD;
      affect) on continuous blood glucose trajectory within the two hour window after an event,&#xD;
      linear models with generalized estimating equations will be used, where the characteristics&#xD;
      of the event, socio-demographic variables of the subject and time since event are predictors&#xD;
      in the model while accounting for the correlations from repeated continuous blood glucose in&#xD;
      the same individual from multiple events. This study will also assess whether the&#xD;
      characteristics of the event and sociodemographic variables are potential effect modifiers on&#xD;
      the association between time and continuous blood glucose. To allow for flexibility in&#xD;
      modelling time and continuous blood glucose, smoothing spline will also be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of the Singapore Population Health Studies cohort who have agreed to be&#xD;
      contacted for other studies, will be contacted by telephone and invited to participate in the&#xD;
      present study (Telephone script and screening questionnaire; and this will be done in&#xD;
      compliance with Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) 2012. Eligible participants will be&#xD;
      invited to attend NUH Investigational Medicine Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to refrain from strenuous exercise for 48 hours before the&#xD;
      procedure, and to undergo overnight fasting (10-12 hours) before the start of the procedure.&#xD;
      No alcohol may be consumed for 24 hours before the study procedure. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to refrain from taking Vitamin C, multivitamins, and aspirin during the eleven day&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEST SESSION 1 (DAY 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first study visit will take approximately 3 hours. At the clinic visit, informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained in a private space, a mobile phone application will be downloaded onto&#xD;
      participants phones to ensure compatibility, and blood pressure, height, weight, and waist&#xD;
      circumference measured. A continuous glucose monitor (Freestyle Libre; Abbott Diabetes Care,&#xD;
      Witney, Oxon, UK) will be fitted on the upper part of their non-dominant arm. If the&#xD;
      participant has a lot of arm hair, the area will be shaved. A waterproof plaster will be&#xD;
      placed over the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) will be conducted. The duration of MMTT will last for&#xD;
      about 2 out of the 3 hours allocated for test session 1. Participants will be asked to sit on&#xD;
      a bed and a cannula will be fitted in one of the antecubital veins in the pit of the elbow on&#xD;
      the participants arm with a 3-way stopper. A blood sample will be taken via the cannula.&#xD;
      Participants will then be asked to ingest a standardized meal (fried rice). While eating the&#xD;
      standardised meal, participants will be video-recorded using a laptop webcam at face-level.&#xD;
      Post-meal satiety responses using a visual analogue scale will be collected on a laptop every&#xD;
      15 minutes. Blood samples will be collected via an antecubital catheter before eating (11ml)&#xD;
      and then at 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, 90 min and 120 min (8ml each)&#xD;
      after completion of the meal. The total blood volume taken will be 65-75ml. Blood will be&#xD;
      sent immediately to NUH Referral Lab for analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be administered on demographics and lifestyle, including usual diet (FFQ&#xD;
      with frequency rating from &quot;never or rarely&quot; to &quot;6+ a day&quot;) and physical activity (GPAQ&#xD;
      Questionnaire-Yes/No and input of actual activity duration), eating behaviours (TFEQ&#xD;
      Questionnaire on 4-point scale from &quot;definitely true&quot; to &quot;definitely false&quot;), alcohol&#xD;
      consumption (Yes/No), smoking (Yes/No), stress (K10 on likert scale from &quot;All of the time&quot; to&#xD;
      &quot;None of the time&quot;, where higher score indicate greater stress), and sleep (Pittsburgh sleep&#xD;
      quality index-input of sleep time and duration and questions on 4-point scale from &quot;Not&#xD;
      during the past month&quot; to &quot;Three or more times a week&quot;). Glucose and level of daily physical&#xD;
      activity will be monitored using a continuous glucose monitor sensor and a wrist worn&#xD;
      accelerometer. Food intake, physical activity and sleep time will be recorded by participants&#xD;
      through an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) survey pushed out via mobile phone&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral processing behaviours and saliva properties of test meal bolus: Bolus particle size&#xD;
      (oral processing behaviour measure) and saliva uptake (saliva properties) will be assessed by&#xD;
      having participants will be asked to chew a fixed mouthful of the test meal until ready to&#xD;
      swallow, then expectorating it in a cup. The duration of oral processing behaviours and&#xD;
      saliva properties measures will last for about 10 minutes out of the 3 hours allocated for&#xD;
      test session 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MMTT is complete, vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) will be measured. The&#xD;
      cannula will be removed, and pressure applied locally on the site of bleeding. Researchers&#xD;
      will ensure the participant is feeling well and is not giddy before continuing with the&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAY 2 to 10 (OFF-SITE):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to wear the continuous glucose monitor sensor continuously&#xD;
      for 10 days. Participants will be asked to scan the sensor with a reader device at least&#xD;
      every 6 hours during waking hours, and immediately before and after sleeping. The reader&#xD;
      display will be masked with a sticker so participants will not be able to see their glucose&#xD;
      readings. Participants will also be fitted with a wrist-worn accelerometer (Actigraph - Model&#xD;
      wGT3x+ BT), a small tamper-proof electronic device that can be worn on a non-removable strap&#xD;
      on the wrist of the non-dominant hand. Although the accelerometer may be worn during&#xD;
      showering and swimming, participants will be given one additional strap in case removal is&#xD;
      required.Participants will be guided on use of the ecological momentary assessment (EMA)&#xD;
      mobile phone application during the baseline visit, and be asked to record within the app,&#xD;
      their food intake, physical activity, and sleep times. A trained interviewer will demonstrate&#xD;
      how the use the app and the participant will have a chance to ask questions. Participants&#xD;
      will receive a reminder via the app, and will be asked to start recording activities&#xD;
      prospectively from day 4 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From day 4 onwards, participants will receive one-minute time-triggered surveys via the app&#xD;
      up to six times per day in which participants will be asked about hunger levels, stress, and&#xD;
      psychological states. A phone number and email address will be provided to participants for&#xD;
      them to contact the study team if participants face problems during the study. Participants&#xD;
      will also be issued with a paper handout with reminders about using the app and sensor.&#xD;
      Participants with phone models that are discovered to be incompatible with the app during&#xD;
      study visit 1 or later in the study period will be issued with a phone handset on which&#xD;
      participants can complete lifestyle tracking and EMA surveys. At the end of day 4,&#xD;
      participants will be telephoned and asked if participants experienced any technical issues.&#xD;
      For issues that cannot be resolved over the telephone, participants will be asked to meet&#xD;
      researchers at Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, or a place of their convenience. If the&#xD;
      issue relates to the glucose sensor, if necessary participants will be asked to restart the&#xD;
      monitoring period, and will be fitted with a new glucose sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEST SESSION 2 (DAY 11):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final study visit will occur on day 11 and will take approximately 2 hours. Participants'&#xD;
      body composition will be measured using a BOD POD Gold Standard Body Composition Tracking&#xD;
      System (COSMED, Concord, CA, USA) is an air displacement plethysmograph which uses whole-body&#xD;
      densitometry to determine body composition (fat and fat-free mass). Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to change into swimwear and sit inside the machine for 5 minutes. Participants will be&#xD;
      provided with results on their body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral processing behaviours and saliva properties: Saliva measures will be taken from the&#xD;
      participant. Resting saliva will be taken by asking the participant to expectorate into a&#xD;
      tube (approximately 5ml) while stimulated whole saliva samples will be collected by asking&#xD;
      the participant to chew on a clean, non-toxic inert Parafilm square and expectorating over a&#xD;
      period of 5 minutes (approximately 5-10ml). The duration for saliva measures in about 30&#xD;
      minutes. Mouth volume will be measured by asking the participants to take in the maximum&#xD;
      volume of filtered water participants can hold and then expectorating it into a volumetric&#xD;
      cylinder. Participants will also be asked to chew on 3 test foods (white rice, rice cake, raw&#xD;
      carrot) using a fixed chew protocol (i.e. 15 chews, 30 chews and chew until point of first&#xD;
      swallow) and then expectorating the bolus to assess their oral processing behavior based on&#xD;
      bolus properties including saliva uptake and particle size distribution. The duration is&#xD;
      approximately 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return the accelerometer, glucose monitor reader, and study phone (if&#xD;
      issued). A research assistant will remove the glucose sensor from the participant's arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before leaving the unit, participants will be asked to take part in a 15 minute open-ended&#xD;
      interview about taking part in this research, focusing on their experiences using the glucose&#xD;
      monitor and research app. Participants will receive a letter reporting the following&#xD;
      measurements and results collected during the study: blood pressure, height, weight, BMI,&#xD;
      HbA1C concentration, and fasting glucose concentration. The report will include information&#xD;
      on interpreting the results, and occasions when it is advised to see a doctor&#xD;
