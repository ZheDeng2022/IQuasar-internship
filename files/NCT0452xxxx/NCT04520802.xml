  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major cardiovascular surgery is associated with postoperative cognitive decline (POCD), with&#xD;
      a deterioration in memory, attention and speed of information processing. A multifactorial&#xD;
      pathophysiology is presumed but this study focuses on the role of (neuro)inflammation in the&#xD;
      development of POCD after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic inflammation can activate the innate immune cells of the brain inducing&#xD;
      neuroinflammation, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disease. Major cardiovascular surgery induces a severe systemic inflammatory response.There&#xD;
      is growing support that neuroinflammation is a pivotal factor in the development of&#xD;
      postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) due to surgery-related systemic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the neuroinflammatory hypothesis is scientifically accepted, in vivo human data&#xD;
      supporting the role of neuroinflammation in severe systemic inflammation such as major&#xD;
      surgery are still lacking. In the last decades, several nuclear imaging tracers have been&#xD;
      developed that can quantitatively measure microglial and astrocytic activation in vivo, by&#xD;
      targeting the mitochondrial 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that cardiac surgery induces a neuroinflammatory response and&#xD;
      that its presence is related to acute and long term brain dysfunction postoperatively. This&#xD;
      will be studied by pre- and postoperative PET brain imaging using a 18F-DPA-714 tracer&#xD;
      targeting TSPO, combined with longitudinal neuropsychological examinations. Structural&#xD;
      changes in the brain will be recorded on MRI prior to and after cardiac surgery to enable us&#xD;
      to correct for the potentially confounding effects of neurovascular events on cognitive&#xD;
      outcomes after CABG surgery.&#xD;
