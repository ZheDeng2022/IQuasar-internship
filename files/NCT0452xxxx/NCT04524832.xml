  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study a known investigational medicinal product called semaglutide will be tested in&#xD;
      four different tablet versions. In addition to semaglutide, the different tablet versions C,&#xD;
      D, E and F contain different helping agents in different amounts. All tablet versions have a&#xD;
      helping agent called SNAC. All tablet versions are tested for the treatment of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Recently the European Medicines Agency approved semaglutide in tablet form and&#xD;
      currently, tablets in the doses 3 mg, 7 mg and 14 mg can be prescribed in some countries. The&#xD;
      main aim of this study is to test oral semaglutide doses of 25 mg and 50 mg. These are higher&#xD;
      dosages of oral semaglutide than can be prescribed today. With the 50 mg dose, we expect the&#xD;
      amount of semaglutide in the blood to be higher than what has been tested before. Further&#xD;
      aims of this study are to find an optimal version for the semaglutide tablets, and to examine&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of the different tablet versions. For this purpose, the amount of&#xD;
      semaglutide in the blood will be measured after taking different semaglutide tablets, in&#xD;
      different doses. The version of the tablet participants will receive (i.e. the treatment arm&#xD;
      participants will be assigned to) is decided by chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In treatment periods 1 and 2 participants will receive one tablet daily over 2 weeks for each&#xD;
      period. For treatment periods 3 to 5 participants will receive one tablet daily over 4 weeks&#xD;
      for each period (participants may get 2 tablets per day in treatment period 5). This means&#xD;
      that treatment will take 16 weeks in total. The tablets should be taken in the morning&#xD;
      together with no more than half a glass of water (120 mL), after an overnight fast of at&#xD;
      least 6 hours (no food or drinks). Water is also not allowed from 2 hours before dosing.&#xD;
      After dosing participants must wait 30-35 minutes before they eat or drink. At home,&#xD;
      participants must take their breakfast 30-45 minutes after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No oral medication (which are taken by mouth) can be taken from 2 hours before and until 30&#xD;
      minutes after each dosing with semaglutide. The study can last for up to 24 weeks for each&#xD;
      participant. This includes a screening period (up to 3 weeks), a treatment period (16 weeks)&#xD;
      and a follow-up visit (5 weeks after the last dosing). Participants will have 11 clinic&#xD;
      visits with the study doctor. Some of the visits include overnight stays. Participants will&#xD;
      have blood tests at every visit. Participants must be healthy and have a body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) between 21.0 and 29.9 kg/m^2 For women: Women cannot take part in this study if they&#xD;
      are pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to become pregnant during the study period.&#xD;
