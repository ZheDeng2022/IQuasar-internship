      Monocentric prospective non-randomized observational study with subgroup analysis on the&#xD;
      assessment of the day hospital at the Aging Biennial Hospital of Saint-Etienne.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to investigate the factors limiting or encouraging adherence to&#xD;
      recommendations in a population aged over 65, fragile or pre-fragile, autonomous and living&#xD;
      at home or in a shelter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will benefit from a multidisciplinary assessment including a geriatric assessment&#xD;
      standardized by a geriatrician, an evaluation by a dietician, an evaluation by an&#xD;
      occupational therapist. They will then be exposed to a personalized plan of care in the form&#xD;
      of a recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed at home to evaluate the implementation of their personalized care&#xD;
      plan at 3 months of their assessment day at the day hospital, then at 6 and 9 months. The&#xD;
      study will take place over a period of approximately 24 months.&#xD;
