  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction is common among people with Multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      with a pooled prevalence of 68.41% using self-report measures and 63.95% using urodynamic&#xD;
      studies. Transcutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TTNS) is a non-invasive treatment option to&#xD;
      manage bladder storage symptoms, however, the potential efficacy of TTNS among people with&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis is based on a small number of studies with the absence of high-quality&#xD;
      evidence relating to efficacy, and lack of clarity of the optimal electrical stimulation&#xD;
      parameters and frequency, duration and number of treatment sessions. The feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of TTNS to manage storage bladder symptoms using Transcutaneous Electrical&#xD;
      Nerve Stimulation (TENS) needs to be established before proceeding with a definitive&#xD;
      randomised trial. This study aims to assess whether TTNS is feasible and acceptable as a&#xD;
      treatment for bladder storage symptoms in people with MS&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use a single-arm experimental study to explore the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of TTNS in the treatment of bladder storage symptoms in multiple sclerosis. The&#xD;
      CONSORT extension for pilot and feasibility studies will be followed to standardise the&#xD;
      conduct and reporting of the study. The recruitment plan is twofold: 1) Open recruitment for&#xD;
      people with MS through MS Ireland's communication channels; 2) Recruitment from a convenience&#xD;
      sample of people with MS who have previously participated in a qualitative study. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess recruitment/retention rates, the urinary symptoms changes and the&#xD;
      effect on quality of life using International classification of incontinence questionnaire -&#xD;
      overactive bladder (ICIQ-OAB), 3-day bladder diary, King's Health Questionnaire and collect&#xD;
      self-reported data on adherence and adverse events and acceptability of using TTNS.&#xD;

    <description>Changes in the severity of scores for bladder storage symptoms experienced by participants measured using ICIQ-OAB. It has grade A for validity, reliability and responsiveness to change established with rigour on one data set. The total score ranges from 0 to 16 with higher values indicating increased symptom severity. Bother scales are not incorporated in the overall score.</description>

Each domain within the Kings Health Questionnaire is scored on a 0 (best) to 100 (worst) scale. A change from baseline of 5 points or higher on most of the King's Health Questionnaire domains represents a clinically meaningful improvement in health-related quality of life after treatment.</description>

    <description>Transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation will be applied as follows: 18 sessions of 30 minutes duration, delivered three times a week over a 6 week period using TENS device with 10 Hertz (Hz), and pulse width 200µs. The intensity of stimulation will be at the sensory and motor threshold by tingling sensation on sole of the foot with flexion of big toe and /or fanning of other toes.</description>

    <description>Transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation is a non-invasive electrical stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve, a branch of the sciatic nerve via sacral plexus. In our study the tibial nerve will be stimulated using Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) unit with two surface adhesive electrodes. The anode will be positioned between 5-10 cm above medial malleolus and posterior to the edge of the tibia and the cathode will be positioned distally on arch of the foot .</description>
