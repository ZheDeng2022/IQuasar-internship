  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the preventive efficacy of a 6-week prophylactic&#xD;
      administration of Probiokid® on the incidence of respiratory infections and related&#xD;
      complications in frequently sick children.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The microbiota is very important for the development of the immune system in children. Lactic&#xD;
      acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, are usually administered as&#xD;
      probiotics (defined as live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts,&#xD;
      confer a health benefit on the host). Some probiotics were shown to sustain the development&#xD;
      of immune competency in newborns, as well as to modulate the adaptive immune response and&#xD;
      response to infections. For example, previous research suggests that probiotics decrease the&#xD;
      incidence of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Probiokid® is a commercially-available&#xD;
      formulation that consist of probiotics (Lactobacillus helveticus, Bifidobacterium infantis,&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium bifidum) and fructooligosaccharides. This formulation has been shown to&#xD;
      decrease the rate of respiratory infection in children supplemented for 3 to 9 months.&#xD;
      Therefore the aim of this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy of Probiokid® supplemented&#xD;
      for 6 weeks on the prevention of URTI and related complications among children (aged 3 to 10&#xD;
      years-old) that frequently suffer of acute respiratory infections. In addition, the impact of&#xD;
      a prophylactic intervention with Probiokid® on the number of physician visits and antibiotic&#xD;
      courses prescribed is assessed.&#xD;
