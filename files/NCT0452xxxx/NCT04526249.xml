  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective chest compressions are essential to survival in an arrest patient receiving CPR&#xD;
      (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). A challenge in providing effective chest compressions is&#xD;
      frequent interruption of compressions. A major cause of a recurrent interruption of chest&#xD;
      compressions is pulse checks. Pulse checks are difficult to quickly and accurately perform in&#xD;
      the AHA recommended time interval of under 10 seconds for reasons ranging from inexperience&#xD;
      to body habitus. Unnecessarily long pulse checks often delay reinitiating chest compressions&#xD;
      leading to a fall in perfusion pressure to the coronary arteries lowering the chances of&#xD;
      return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). To potentially solve the issues of evaluating the&#xD;
      chest compression effectiveness and minimize the time interval of pulse checks, the authors&#xD;
      have constructed a novel device that can be rapidly applied to an arresting patient and&#xD;
      evaluate the current state of the circulatory system. The device is called the Rapid Pulse&#xD;
      Confirmation (RPC) device. It is designed to applied over a major artery (radial, ulnar,&#xD;
      brachial, carotid, and femoral) and detect Doppler shift of red blood cells to gauge red&#xD;
      blood cell velocity and rate of pulsation. Feasibility testing on the device was carried out&#xD;
      using patients requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. Arrest and return of spontaneous circulation&#xD;
      during cardiopulmonary bypass is predictable and provided an ideal environment to test the&#xD;
      initial performance of a device meant to detect return of spontaneous circulation. The&#xD;
      primary working hypothesis was that there would be no significant difference in time of&#xD;
      detection of ROSC between the arterial line catheter and the RPC device at the end of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass. The secondary hypothesis was that there would be no difference in&#xD;
      pulse rate reading between the arterial line catheter and the RPC device.&#xD;
