      The aim of this study is to estimate the efficacy of apremilast compared to placebo in the&#xD;
      treatment of oral ulcers in pediatric participants from 2 to &lt; 18 years of age with oral&#xD;
      ulcers associated with Behçet's disease (BD) through week 12.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The participants will be randomized to receive apremilast or placebo in the double-blind 12 week treatment phase. Then, the participants will all receive apremilast for a further 40 weeks in the active treatment phase. The participants will then complete the 30 days safety follow-up period after the last dose of apremilast in the active treatment phase.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Pain of oral ulcers will be measured by a visual analog scale (VAS). The participants will be asked to place a vertical line on a 100 mm VAS at the point that represents the severity of oral ulcer pain. The scale will range from &quot;no pain&quot; (left hand boundary) to &quot;worst possible pain&quot; (right hand boundary).</description>

    <measure>Change from Week 0 to Week 12 in Disease Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Disease activity is measured by Behçet's Disease Current Activity (BDCAF) scores. The BDCAF consists of 3 component scores: the Behçet's Disease Current Activity Index (BDCAI) score, the Patient's Perception of Disease Activity, and the Clinician's Overall Perception of Disease Activity. The BDCAI score ranges from 0 to 12. A higher score indicates higher level of disease activity (worsening), and a negative change from baseline indicates improvement. The Patient's Perception of Disease Activity and the Clinician's Overall Perception of Disease Activity were assessed by the subject and the clinician, respectively, using a scale of 1 to 7, where a higher score indicates a higher level of disease activity.</description>

    <description>The SF-10 Health Survey for Children is a parent-completed survey that contains 10 questions adapted from the Child Health Questionnaire. The SF-10 is intended to produce physical and psychosocial health summary measures. Each of the 10 questions responses is scored with a point value from 1 to 6 (1 is the worst possible condition and 6 is the best possible condition). The SF-10 physical and psychosocial measures are scored such that higher scores indicate more favorable functioning.</description>

    <description>The C-SSRS is an assessment tool that evaluates suicidal ideation and behavior. Number of participants with suicidal ideation or behavior is defined as the number of participants who answer &quot;yes&quot; at any time during the study (up to end of safety follow-up, Week 56) to one of the 10 categories:&#xD;
Category 1: Wish to be dead Category 2: Non-specific active suicidal thoughts Category 3: Active suicidal ideation with any methods (not plan) without intent to act Category 4: Active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan Category 5: Active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent Category 6: Preparatory acts or behavior Category 7: Aborted attempt Category 8: Interrupted attempt Category 9: Actual attempt (non-fatal) Category 10: Completed suicide</description>
