  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In July 2015-November 2016, a phase II/III randomized, observer-blind,controlled study of two&#xD;
      acellular Pertussis vaccines (aP standalone and TdaP combined vaccines) manufactured by&#xD;
      BioNet-Asia Co., Ltd. (Bionet) and chemically-detoxified Adacel Tdap vaccine was conducted in&#xD;
      Bangkok, Thailand in healthy participants aged 12-17 years (Protocol No. TDA202;&#xD;
      http://clinicaltrials.in.th;Study ID:TCTR20150703002). A total of 450 participants were&#xD;
      enrolled into the study at 2 study sites (Site No.1:Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital;&#xD;
      Site No.2:Vaccine Trial Centre (VTC), Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University) with&#xD;
      equal number of 225 participants enrolled at each study site. During the study, the&#xD;
      participants had been randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to received intramuscularly a booster dose&#xD;
      (0.5 mL) of the study vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is further follow-up from TDA202 clinical trial, which was completed on 29 November&#xD;
      2016. Target population for this study is the group of participants who had received one dose&#xD;
      of one of the three study vaccines in the TDA202 trial at site VTC and who had completed the&#xD;
      study follow-up at 1-year after vaccination (223 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this current study, the long-term persistence of pertussis antibodies induced by a booster&#xD;
      dose of recombinant acellular Pertussis based vaccines (Pertagen and Boostagen) manufactured&#xD;
      by Bionet will be evaluated and compared to the conventional chemically-inactivated Tdap&#xD;
      vaccine (Adacel) at 5 years after previously immunized in the TDA202 study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will included all participants who participated in the TDA202 study at&#xD;
      the Vaccine Trial Centre (VTC), Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from all 3 vaccine groups (i.e., participants who had received a single dose of&#xD;
      one of the 3 study vaccines (Boostagen®, Pertagen®, or Adacel®) and completed 1-year&#xD;
      follow-up visit at Day 336±28 days during the TDA202 study will be called in for informed&#xD;
      consent process at Visit 1 at approximately 5 years after vaccination (±56 days) based on&#xD;
      Vaccination Date in the TDA202 study. Participants aged ≥18 years who have signed the written&#xD;
      Informed Consent Form or participants aged less than 18 years who have co-signed the Informed&#xD;
      Consent Form with their parent/legal will be screened for general health status (a survey for&#xD;
      medical history, immunization history, history of receiving blood, blood component,&#xD;
      immunoglobulin, immunosuppressive drugs or systemic corticosteroid and physical examination)&#xD;
      and those who fulfill the pre-defined inclusion criteria and do not meet an exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled, a blood sample (approx. 5 mL) will be taken from all participants. After blood&#xD;
      collection, this will be considered as study end for all participants. Participants will be&#xD;
      offered a licensed influenza vaccine at the end of Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples collected from all participants who have come back for the 5-year follow-up&#xD;
      visit (Visit 1) will be processed for serum preparation. Serum samples will be stored at the&#xD;
      laboratory at the study site and will be further shipped to BioNet Human Serology Laboratory&#xD;
      where immunogenicity testing (ELISA antibodies against Pertussis Toxin (PT), Filamentous&#xD;
      hemagglutinin (FHA), Diphtheria Toxin (DT), and Tetanus Toxin (TT) and PT-neutralizing&#xD;
      antibody by Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells assay) will be performed. ELISA testing to&#xD;
      detect antibodies against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis antigens (PT and FHA) will be&#xD;
      performed for all enrolled participants while CHO cells assay to detect PT-neutralizing&#xD;
      antibody will be performed only in the same subset of participants who had been selected for&#xD;
      PT-neutralizing antibody study in the initial TDA202 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge from this long-term 5-year antibody persistence study will provide supportive&#xD;
      data to identify the best alternative acellular pertussis vaccines to conventional&#xD;
      chemically-inactivated vaccines for controlling the resurgence of pertussis disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and statistical analysis will be performed by Center of Excellence for&#xD;
      Biomedical and Public Health Informatics (BIOPHICS), Bangkok, Thailand.&#xD;
