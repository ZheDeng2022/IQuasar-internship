  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to characterize the diet and iron status of young female elite&#xD;
      football players and examine the relationship between iron intake, iron status, hemoglobin&#xD;
      levels, intestinal health and sports performance. In addition, the effects of low-dose iron&#xD;
      supplements on iron stores will be investigated and whether such supplementation affects&#xD;
      intestinal health, microbiota composition and biomarkers for oxidative stress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency can lead to fatigue and anemia. Because iron is necessary for the formation&#xD;
      of new blood cells (hematopoiesis), it is an extensive practice internationally among&#xD;
      athletes to take iron supplements in the belief that this will improve endurance performance&#xD;
      and oxygen transport capacity by increasing red blood cell production. Although iron intake&#xD;
      in menstruating women has shown to reduce the prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency as&#xD;
      well as increasing hemoglobin values and iron stores. However iron supplementation increases&#xD;
      the risk of iron excess and can result in undesirable effects such as constipation and&#xD;
      abdominal pain as well as negative impact on intestinal epithelial permeability and increase&#xD;
      in oxidative stress. Because iron is important for the replication and survival of almost all&#xD;
      bacteria, with few exceptions, the intake of iron also affect the composition of the&#xD;
      intestinal bacteria. Not surprisingly, both high and low iron levels affect the composition&#xD;
      of the microbiota in the gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not known if young menstruating Norwegian female athletes cover their need for iron via&#xD;
      the diet or whether extra intake in the form of a low-dose supplement could be beneficial in&#xD;
      terms of hemoglobin levels and sports performance. Because iron preparations are not&#xD;
      prescription and are sold in pharmacies, health food stores and larger grocery stores, this&#xD;
      can lead to uncritical intake of iron. Since the use of iron preparations has been documented&#xD;
      to be widespread in foreign sports environments, it is important to both characterize the&#xD;
      iron status of Norwegian athletes and at the same time examine the beneficial value of iron&#xD;
      supplements on sports performance as well as monitoring effects on microbiota composition and&#xD;
      intestinal health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is therefore to characterize the diet and iron status of young female&#xD;
      elite football players and examine the relationship between iron intake, iron status,&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels, intestinal health and sports performance. In addition, the effects of&#xD;
      low-dose iron supplements will be investigated in relation to iron stores, hemoglobin levels&#xD;
      and sports performance and whether such supplementation affects intestinal health, microbiota&#xD;
      composition and biomarkers for oxidative stress.&#xD;
