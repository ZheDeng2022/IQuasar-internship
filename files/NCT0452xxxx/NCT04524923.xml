    <textblock>
      Recent literatures are associating digital technology extensive and addictive use with&#xD;
      physical, psychosocial and cognitive inverse consequences. This research focuses more on&#xD;
      number of touch screen devices; age started using devices and usage time in relation to&#xD;
      cognitive function in preschoolers.&#xD;

      A hundred typically developing preschool children of both genders with age ranges from three&#xD;
      to five years will be included in this study. Visual motor integration, quality of life and&#xD;
      cognitive function were assessed by the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale, the Pediatric&#xD;
      Quality of Life Inventory™ and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ cognitive functioning&#xD;
      scale respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size To avoid type II error, sample size calculation was based on data from a pilot&#xD;
      study on correlation between touch screen usage time and visual motor integration. Using&#xD;
      G*POWER statistica software (version 3.1.9.2; Franz Faul, Universitat Kiel, Germany)&#xD;
      [Correlational study, α=0.05, β=0.2, and medium effect size = 0.3] revealed that the&#xD;
      appropriate sample size for this study was N=84 Therefore, one-hundred children were&#xD;
      recruited for possible dropouts during assessment.&#xD;

    <description>The Peabody Developmental Motor Scale will be used to assess visual motor integration. It is a standardized, norm-referenced test used for the assessment of upper limb functions. It is an early childhood motor development program that provides (in one package) both in depth assessment and training of gross and fine motor skills. It can be used by occupational therapists, physical therapists, psychologists, and others who are interested in examining the motor abilities of young children. It is composed of six subtests:-Reflexes (8 items), stationary (30 items), locomotion (89 items), object manipulation (24 items), grasping (25 items) and visual motor integration (72 items). The results of the subtests may be used to generate 3 global indexes of motor performance called (composites). These composites are gross motor quotient, fine motor quotient and total motor quotient with higher scores represent better performance</description>

    <description>The Pediatric quality of life inventory™ generic Arabic parent proxy-report for children from two to five years was used to assess quality of life. It was developed to quantify health- related quality of life (HRQoL) of children and adolescents aged 2-18 years. It consists of 23 questions and evaluate how frequently of a trouble the child has had over the past month. Interpretation of the scale reveals the mean performance as total scale score, physical functioning score (eight questions), emotional functioning score (five questions), social functioning score (five questions) and school function scores (five items). the scores are from 0 to 100 with higher results reflecting better performance.</description>

    <description>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ Cognitive Functioning Scale will be used to assess cognitive function. It was developed as a brief generic symptom-specific instrument to measure cognitive functioning. The 6-item scale was designed as a brief and easy-to-administer patient self-reported and parent proxy-reported generic symptom specific instrument to measure cognitive functioning across pediatric populations, originally developed in a pediatric cancer population. The PedsQLTM Cognitive Functioning Scale includes format, instructions, Likert scale from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better cognitive function.</description>
