  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish the safety and effectiveness of the DragonFly transcatheter mitral valve repair&#xD;
      system in symptomatic patients with moderate to severe and severe mitral regurgitation who&#xD;
      have been determined to be at an high risk of mortality with mitral valve surgery by the&#xD;
      cardiac surgeon with concurrence by the local Heart Team&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects with moderate-to-severe (3+) and severe (4+) mitral valve regurgitation (MR) at&#xD;
      high or prohibitive surgical risk will be evaluated by the study sites, and study eligibility&#xD;
      confirmed by the echocardiographic core laboratory and eligibility committee. Those&#xD;
      qualifying will then be treated with Dragonfly transcatheter mitral valve repair system after&#xD;
      signing the informed consent. The follow-up will be conducted at discharge, 30 days, 6 months&#xD;
      and 12 months after the operation. The primary endpoints are the incidence of major adverse&#xD;
      events (MAE) at 30 days, and acute procedural success. Acute procedural success is defined as&#xD;
      placement of one or more Dragonfly devices on the mitral valve with reduction of MR to 2+ or&#xD;
      less. The secondary endpoints include all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality,&#xD;
      incidence of serious adverse event, cardiovascular rehospitalization, NYHA functional class,&#xD;
      mitral valve hemodynamics, acute technical success rate and device success rate at 6 months.&#xD;
      Acute technical success is defined as no procedural mortality, successful in access,&#xD;
      delivery, and retrieval of the device delivery system, and no emergency surgery or&#xD;
      reintervention related to the device or access procedure in the catheterization laboratory.&#xD;
      Device success is defined as no procedural mortality, proper delivery and deployment of the&#xD;
      device, no unplanned surgical or interventional procedures related to the device, no specific&#xD;
      device-related technical failure and or complications, function improvement of MR without&#xD;
      significant stenosis (MR ≤ 2+) and without associated hemolysis or thrombogenesis.&#xD;
