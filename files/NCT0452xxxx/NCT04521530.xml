      comparing immediate functionally loaded implants and immediate non functionally loaded&#xD;
      implants in the posterior mandibular region on bases of bone density and bone loss evaluated&#xD;
      by cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).&#xD;

      Patients are more demanding after the revolution in immediate implant dentistry which reduces&#xD;
      implant procedure nowadays according to literature and research. In response to patients'&#xD;
      demands not only implants are immediately placed but also immediately loaded within 72 hours&#xD;
      reducing the time for prosthetic loading and also improving bone formation according to some&#xD;
      studies. The debate in modern implant dentistry is whether to immediately load the implants&#xD;
      in functional occlusion or non-functional occlusion and which will improve the&#xD;
      osseointegration and reduce crestal bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implants of the BioInfinity system were placed in 16 subjects divided into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (A): 8 patients with missing posterior mandibular teeth whom will be rehabilitated with&#xD;
      immediate functionally loaded implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (B): 8 patients with missing posterior mandibular teeth in whom immediate&#xD;
      non-functionally loaded implants were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups were evaluated at baseline, immediately after implant placement and 4 months&#xD;
      postoperative to evaluate crestal bone level and quantitative radiographic bone density using&#xD;
      CBCT.&#xD;
