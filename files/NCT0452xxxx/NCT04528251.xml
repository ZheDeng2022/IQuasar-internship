  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no consensus around the world on the treatment of preterm rupture of membranes,&#xD;
      which is one of the important causes of early neonatal sepsis and one of the common causes of&#xD;
      prematurity. Different countries, hospitals and physicians can determine different treatment&#xD;
      approaches. There is very little scientific data on the benefit of commonly used treatment&#xD;
      regimens other than experience. In this study, scientific results will be obtained by&#xD;
      comparing the efficacy of treatments (Sulbactam ampicillin or azithromycin ampicillin) in two&#xD;
      different hospitals (Hacettepe University Perinatology Clinic and Ankara City Hospital&#xD;
      Perinatology Clinic), and it will be shown which treatment regimen reduces early neonatal&#xD;
      sepsis and inflammation better. Some samples (vaginal IL-6, vaginal-cervical swab samples for&#xD;
      atypical bacteria, cervical swab samples for direct microscopy, serum IL-6) will be taken&#xD;
      from pregnant women who develop membrane rupture and these samples will be used as initial&#xD;
      inflammation markers. Each physician will decide on the treatment of his own patient, there&#xD;
      will be no intervention in the treatment of the patient within the scope of the research.&#xD;
      Patients will continue their routine follow-up after receiving their treatment. When the&#xD;
      delivery occurs, the level of IL-6 in the cord blood will be examined with other inflammation&#xD;
      markers (procalcitonin, crp, complete blood count), and the neonatal inflammation status of&#xD;
      the baby will be determined. The low inflammation markers detected in the babies of pregnant&#xD;
      women with high initial inflammation values will be compared and it will be determined which&#xD;
      treatment is more effective. At the same time, routine neonatal intensive care follow-ups of&#xD;
      these babies will be continued and treatment efficiency in terms of early neonatal sepsis&#xD;
      will be determined. This study will present scientific data on which treatment is effective&#xD;
      in the literature and will guide international treatment guidelines. At the same time,&#xD;
      preterm rupture of membranes will show which bacterial agent plays a more role in the&#xD;
      etiology and which of the inflammation markers have more sensitivity and specificity, as well&#xD;
      as the success of the treatment, which is the subject of the study. The routine use of some&#xD;
      examinations (such as cervical PCR) performed before the treatment begins, is a guide in the&#xD;
      selection of agent-specific treatment and may shorten the unnecessary drug use and hospital&#xD;
      stay; The management of patients may vary according to the initial inflammation parameters.&#xD;
      Physicians evaluating the results of this study can evaluate the risk of their babies in&#xD;
      terms of early neonatal sepsis according to the initial inflammation values of their&#xD;
      patients, and increase and decrease the length of hospital stay.&#xD;
