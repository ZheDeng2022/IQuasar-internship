  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Speech disorders affect more than 90% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Neither of&#xD;
      conventional drugs nor surgery can effectively improve speech function. Western speech&#xD;
      rehabilitation is effective for speech disorders, but the domestic use of those methods used&#xD;
      is limited. Our preliminary results revealed that traditional Chinese Yi jin jing tiger&#xD;
      roaring speech rehabilitation is effectively in the treatment of speech disorders in PD,&#xD;
      however, high-quality clinical evidence is still scarce. In order to solve this problem, we&#xD;
      will conduct a prospective cohort study to explore the effects of Yi Jin Jing tiger roaring&#xD;
      speech rehabilitation with real-time feedback technique on speech disorders in PD patients.&#xD;
      This study will help to establish a set of Chinese Medicine treatment and objective&#xD;
      evaluation methods for PD speech disorders.&#xD;

    <measure>Differences in Voice Handicap Index (VHI) between treatment conditions in the on- and off- medication states</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Voice Handicap Index is a self-administered instrument, comprising 30 items on voice-related dysfunction. VHI has a range of 0 (normal voice function) to 120 (severe voice dysfunction).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in voice parameters between treatment conditions in the on- and off- medication states</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Voice recording at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz using 16-bit quantification will be conducted in a sound-treated room using a microphone and a digital voice recorder with a mouth-to-microphone distance of 15 cm. The recorded voices will then be used for a composit acoustic analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire (SDQ) scores between treatment conditions in the on- and off- medication states.</measure>

    <measure>Differences in Burg Balance Scale (BBS) scores between two treatment conditions in the on- and off- medication states.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Burg Balance Scale measures patients' static and dynamic balance abilities. BBS score has a range of 0 (severe balance problems) to 56 (no balance problems).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in Water Swallow Test (WST) scores between treatment conditions in the on- and off- medication states.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Water Swallow Test is frequently used in clinical practice as a functional assessment to detect dysphagia, with stage 1 indicating severe dysphagia and stage 6 indicating normal swallowing function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores between Treatment conditions.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Depression Inventory is a self-administered Instrument, contains 21 self-report items. The items are scored as 0, 1, 2, or 3. The score range is 0 (no depression) to 63 (severe depression).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scores between treatment conditions.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BAI is a rating scale used to evaluate the severity of anxiety symptoms. It contains 21 self-report items. The items are scored as 0, 1, 2, or 3. The score range is 0-63. A total score of 0-7 is considered minimal range, 8-15 is mild, 16-25 is moderate, and 26-63 is severe.</description>
