  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crying is a survival mechanism for babies and their almost exclusive means of expression&#xD;
      until the age of 4 months. Babies 'cry is mostly related to pain, a feeling of hunger,&#xD;
      discomfort or separation following the departure of a parent around. Crying is a complex but&#xD;
      essential means of communication and information between a baby and his parents that raises&#xD;
      the question of their meaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very few longitudinal studies have been produced on preterm's crying. As the term approaches,&#xD;
      the characteristics of preterm babies' crying are similar to those of term infants. But these&#xD;
      studies date back more than 30 years and are obsolete in terms of the quality and performance&#xD;
      of sound recording equipment and signal processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study has looked at the genesis of the cry itself and the varieties of the cry of the&#xD;
      preterm baby, depending on whether it was in a situation of hunger, pain, discomfort (bath).&#xD;

      This longitudinal study recordings of crying babies from 26 amenorrhea week to 33 amenorrhea&#xD;
      week, 24 hours per week, each week until the return home. In the same time, parents will be&#xD;
      asked to know the situation of the baby (hunger, pain, bath).&#xD;
