      Examine the association of chronic liver diseases (including hepatitis B, hepatitis C,&#xD;
      alcoholic liver disease, fatty liver, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma) with&#xD;
      other systemic diseases by retrospectively analyzing the data from the Hospital Database of&#xD;
      Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The global population is growing older over the next several decades. An essential component&#xD;
      to keep people healthy, even with aging, is to prevent chronic disease progression and reduce&#xD;
      associated complications. About 80% of older adults have one chronic condition, and 50% have&#xD;
      at least two chronic disorders. Efforts to identify strategies to prevent or reduce the risk&#xD;
      of chronic diseases and injuries and to widely apply effective interventions must be pursued.&#xD;
      Because the liver is the largest solid organ in the human body with multiple functions,&#xD;
      including nutrition, metabolism, proteins and biochemicals synthesis, and detoxification, its&#xD;
      function is vital for the homeostasis of our body. The impairment of liver function may cause&#xD;
      dysfunction or even shut down other systems in our body. Therefore, a better understanding of&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of the liver disorder is not only a key issue in medical science, but it may&#xD;
      also affect the general health and diseases of other body systems in a variety of ways.&#xD;
      Finally, causing significant public health and economic losses globally. However, the impact&#xD;
      and interactions of liver disorders on the progression, treatments, and prognosis of other&#xD;
      systemic disorders, or vice versa, remain largely unknown. Recent studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      the interactions between diabetes mellitus and liver diseases, and implying a possible&#xD;
      deteriorating effect of diabetes on liver disease progression, treatment outcomes, and&#xD;
      hepatic carcinogenesis. These lines of evidence not only verify the need for a better&#xD;
      understanding of the interactions between liver and other disorders, but also justify a more&#xD;
      extensive exploration of the interactions between liver diseases and other systemic&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to examine the association of chronic liver diseases&#xD;
      (including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, fatty liver, liver cirrhosis&#xD;
      and hepatocellular carcinoma) with other systemic diseases by retrospectively analyzing the&#xD;
      data from the Hospital Database of Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation. The investigators&#xD;
      will examine the impacts of different systemic diseases on the disease progression and&#xD;
      prognosis of Taiwanese patients with liver diseases and vice versa. Moreover, the&#xD;
      investigators will also examine the different therapeutic strategies (including western,&#xD;
      traditional Chinese medical, surgical or varied treatments) used for the treatments of liver&#xD;
      diseases or systemic diseases, and their effects on the disease progression, long-term&#xD;
      outcomes and prognosis of patients with chronic liver diseases or other systemic diseases in&#xD;
      Taiwan.&#xD;
