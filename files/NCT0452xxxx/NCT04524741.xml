  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 40 patients with atrial fibrillation were scheduled to receive left atrial&#xD;
      appendage occlusion, which were divided into two groups. The operation was performed under&#xD;
      the guidance of intracardiac echocardiography and left atrial appendage radiography,&#xD;
      respectively (allocation ratio 1:1). During the operation, the total amount of contrast&#xD;
      medium injected, the fluoroscopy time and the time from femoral vein puncture to transseptal&#xD;
      puncture to closure were recorded in all patients. The diameter and depth of the left atrial&#xD;
      appendage opening were measured by angiography in group A(ICE group), and measured by ICE in&#xD;
      group B(radiography group). The size of the occluder device was selected according to the&#xD;
      measurement size of the two groups, the occluder device success rate of the two groups was&#xD;
      compared, and the relationship between measurement size and the size of the occluder device&#xD;
      was obtained.&#xD;
