  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alpelisib (BYL719) is a PIK3CA-specific inhibitor, which was developed by Novartis (Basel,&#xD;
      Switzerland). Our group conducted pre-clinical study of alpelisib in eight gastric cancer&#xD;
      cell lines: four PIK3CA wild-type (SNU638, SNU668, SNU1, and SNU16) and four PIK3CA mutant&#xD;
      (SNU719, AGS, SNU601, and MKN). As a result, alpelisib preferentially inhibited the growth of&#xD;
      gastric cancer cells with PIK3CA mutations. In addition, alpelisib inhibited cell growth via&#xD;
      G1 arrest and subsequently induces apoptosis in GC cells, and this effect is more remarkable&#xD;
      in cells harboring PIK3CA mutations. Moreover, alpelisib in combination with paclitaxel&#xD;
      showed synergistic cytotoxic effects and significantly increased apoptosis compared with&#xD;
      alpelisib or paclitaxel monotherapy in GC cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to define the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase&#xD;
      II dose (RP2D) of paclitaxel and alpelisib combination therapy in patients with advanced&#xD;
      tumors and to evaluate the efficacy of paclitaxel and AZD8186 combination therapy as a&#xD;
      second-line therapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer with PTEN aberrations. This&#xD;
      study is divided into Phase IB and Phase II.&#xD;
