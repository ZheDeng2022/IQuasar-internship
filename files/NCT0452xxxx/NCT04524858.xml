      This is a Phase 2a, Open-Label, Single-Arm Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of&#xD;
      ATI-450 for the Maintenance of Remission in Patients with Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic&#xD;
      Syndrome (CAPS) Previously Managed with Anti-IL-1 Therapy. The study will consist of up to an&#xD;
      8-week screening period, a 12-week treatment period, and a 4-week safety follow-up period.&#xD;
      The total duration of the study for patients remaining until their final follow-up assessment&#xD;
      will be up to 24 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Remission is defined as a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score of absent or minimal. The Physician's Global Assessment of Autoinflammatory Disease Activity (PGA) is a measure to be completed by the investigator or designee. The PGA uses a 5-point rating scale: absent, minimal, mild, moderate, and severe. The investigator will select a rating based on the patient's current disease activity at the time of the visit. Lower PGA scores represent better outcomes.</description>
