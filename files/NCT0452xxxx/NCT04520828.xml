  <brief_summary>

      To determine the effectiveness of a single 10-min postural repositioning session on the&#xD;
      maximum phonation duration in individuals with acquired dysarthria.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impact of dysarthria goes beyond communication. However, there have been no clear&#xD;
      directives guiding clinical practice to date, and despite increasing evidence directing&#xD;
      treatment, research remains limited and predominantly consists of case studies or case&#xD;
      series. Despite the importance of postural control in voice production, the effects of&#xD;
      postural alignment on speech production efficiency are either little investigated or not at&#xD;
      all explored in the dysarthric population. This study determined the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      single 10-min postural repositioning session on the maximum phonation duration (MPD) in&#xD;
      individuals with acquired dysarthria.&#xD;

    <description>The 10-min transdisciplinary intervention aimed (1) to facilitate and activate axial extension during standing and then during sitting; (2) to actively mobilize the trunk, cervical spine, and pelvic and shoulder girdles during standing and then during sitting; and (3) to adjust the seated position, as needed, with supports to ensure its maintenance throughout the experiment. Cushion, balls, boxes, or rolls were used to stabilize the final seated position.</description>
