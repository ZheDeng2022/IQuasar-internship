  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of stress in daily human life increase in the investigator's modern life&#xD;
      style. Short stress, could be benefit for memory, but prolonged stress may conduct to&#xD;
      disturbance in cardiovascular, neuroendocrine and central nervous systems. Moreover, it is&#xD;
      well established that stress is the most common risk factor for the development of mood and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder.&#xD;
      In response to stress, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis is one of activated&#xD;
      pathway, which induce the cortisol release. Certain natural products could increase&#xD;
      resilience to stress. Indeed, several preclinical studies have already showed that botanical&#xD;
      extracts inhibited the typical plasmatic corticosterone elevation induced by an acute stress&#xD;
      challenge. Therefore, the aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the acute effects of a&#xD;
      botanical extract and one of his major compound, both delivered as sublingual single dose, on&#xD;
      cortisol level, cardiac parameters, and psychometric response, in healthy adults exposed to&#xD;
      an acute psychological stress.&#xD;
