        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Completed the DA07976 Study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. In the opinion of the investigator, if the subject were to be removed from study and&#xD;
             associated therapy, subject would have worsening/increase in disabling seizures.&#xD;
             Disabling refers to seizures that are severe enough to cause injuries, or&#xD;
             significantly impair functional ability in domains including employment, psychosocial&#xD;
             education and mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is taking currently approved AED medication(s) (but is not on valproate or&#xD;
             divalproex sodium).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has seizures that are distinct, stereotypical events that can be reliably&#xD;
             counted, in the opinion of the Investigator, by the subject or caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has hearing, vision, and physical abilities adequate to perform assessments,&#xD;
             with or without corrective aids, including keeping a seizure and medication diary&#xD;
             during study follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject understands study procedures and has voluntarily provided signed, informed&#xD;
             consent in accordance with institutional and local regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Needs be literate in English or native language of the country of the study enrollment&#xD;
             to complete neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject can be reasonably expected to maintain a seizure diary alone or with the&#xD;
             assistance of a competent individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of childbearing potential must be using a medically accepted method of&#xD;
             contraception and have a negative qualitative β-human chorionic growth hormone (β-HCG)&#xD;
             pregnancy test result from a urine or blood sample collected per SOE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Subject has any significant neurologic disease other than epilepsy. 2. Subject has&#xD;
             had status epilepticus refractory to benzodiazepines and phenytoin in the past year 3.&#xD;
             Subject is currently taking oral valproic acid or sodium divalproex. 4. Subject has&#xD;
             known allergy to valproic acid, divalproex sodium, Epilim, or Depacon.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Subject has unstable depression or any major psychiatric disorder including&#xD;
             psychosis, major depression, bipolar disorder that in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
             would put the subject at risk as a participant in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Subject has history or evidence of congestive heart failure, clinically significant&#xD;
             peripheral edema, or anemia with a hematocrit &lt;30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Subject has current diagnosis of cancer requiring treatment. 8. Subject in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator, is not a suitable candidate for cranial surgery for any&#xD;
             reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Subject has known HIV infection or known or suspected prion disease. 10. Subject&#xD;
             has known allergies to drugs or excipients. 11. Subject is breastfeeding, pregnant, or&#xD;
             expressed intent on becoming pregnant during the course of the study and Investigator&#xD;
             feels pregnancy is a likely outcome during the study 12. In the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, the subject has a clinically significant or unstable medical condition&#xD;
             (including alcohol and/or drug abuse) or a progressive CNS disease that in the opinion&#xD;
             of the Investigator would put the subject at risk as a participant in the study.&#xD;
