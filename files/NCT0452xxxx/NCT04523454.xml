  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to expand upon and update this body of work. It will explore the knowledge&#xD;
      and understanding women with diabetes have around pregnancy and conception, as well as&#xD;
      establish how well prepared these women are for a pregnancy. Using this data, we will develop&#xD;
      better services to inform women with diabetes about the contraception and pregnancy, as well&#xD;
      inform the development of pre-conception counselling services for women with diabetes. If&#xD;
      successful, we would anticipate seeing an improvement in performance in future National&#xD;
      Diabetes in Pregnancy audits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, 44% of pregnancies are unplanned; in the UK 45% of pregnancies and one third of&#xD;
      births are unplanned. If a woman wants 2 children, she will spend, on average, 5 years trying&#xD;
      to conceive or being pregnant, and 30 years trying to prevent pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with diabetes are known to have 'high-risk' pregnancies. Complications for the mother&#xD;
      include worsening diabetic control, particularly with increased hypoglycaemia in the 1st&#xD;
      trimester; deterioration in retinopathy and nephropathy; pre-eclampsia; birth trauma due to&#xD;
      fetal macrosomia. For the fetus, there are increased risks of congenital abnormalities;&#xD;
      macrosomia with resultant birth trauma including shoulder dystocia; intrauterine growth&#xD;
      restriction; miscarriage; still birth; neonatal unit admission and neonatal death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NICE guidance (NG3) contains a number of recommendations to prepare women with diabetes for a&#xD;
      healthy pregnancy, and recommendations to avoid a pregnancy in poorly controlled diabetes; it&#xD;
      also has recommendations about contraception. However, the National Diabetes in Pregnancy&#xD;
      Audit 2019 shows that seven out of eight women are not adequately prepared pre-pregnancy, and&#xD;
      there are still increased numbers of neonatal deaths, stillbirths, congenital anomalies,&#xD;
      large and small for gestational age babies and neonatal unit admissions, compared to&#xD;
      pregnancies in women without diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause for these poor outcomes, despite the NICE guidance, needs to be understood to&#xD;
      enable pregnancy outcomes to improve. One likely factor is poor patient knowledge about the&#xD;
      complications associated with pregnancy. One study, undertaken in 2009, showed that only 35%&#xD;
      of women with diabetes of reproductive age recalled having any discussion about pregnancy,&#xD;
      and only 25% were aware of any of the risks associated with pregnancy. Another study in women&#xD;
      with diabetes seen in an antenatal clinic showed that even if a woman was aware of the risks&#xD;
      associated with diabetes in pregnancy, she often did not attend for pre-conception&#xD;
      counselling and preparation. The reasons for this were multifactorial, including falling&#xD;
      pregnant faster than expected, and pervious poor interactions with healthcare professionals.&#xD;
