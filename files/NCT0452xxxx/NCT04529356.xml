  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Headache is a very common main complaint of patients with GH pituitary tumor, which has&#xD;
      seriously affected the normal work and life of patients. Although the current surgery and&#xD;
      drugs have a certain effect on patients with headache, the overall effect is not satisfied.&#xD;
      However, the use of COX-2 inhibitors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other&#xD;
      analgesics are only effective for some patients with headaches, and long-term use has adverse&#xD;
      reactions. Therefore, it is necessary to seek new treatments for postoperative headaches in&#xD;
      patients with GH pituitary tumors. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) modulates the&#xD;
      excitability of the underlying cerebral cortex by applying a rapidly changing magnetic field&#xD;
      on the surface of the scalp. It is a relatively simple and safe method. It is currently&#xD;
      approved for treating depression, migraine, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease. Several small clinical studies have proven that rTMS can be used to prevent and&#xD;
      treat Headache. Therefore, this study aims to observe the efficacy and safety of TMS in the&#xD;
      treatment of postoperative headache in patients with GH pituitary tumors.&#xD;

    <description>During the experiment, patients will be required to record the dosage of acetaminophen they used. Our anticipated secondary outcome is the decreased usage of painkiller in the rTMS treated patients.The total dosage of acetaminophen used in 1st month and the 6th month during the study will be recorded and the changes of the dosage will be compared among the 3 groups.</description>

    <description>By using different frequency of TMS, the device can generate different effects. For low frequency, such as 1HZ, it mainly generates inhibition on the brain cortex; while high frequency (usually higher than 10HZ) can generate stimulation effects. The later one could be used to treat different central nervous disease.</description>

    <description>Acetaminophen is used as the painkiller to alleviate patients' headache before and during the clinical trial. In order to decrease the medication bias, we required these patients to only use acetaminophen instead of other non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. In the meantime, participants are requested to recorder the frequency and dosage of acetaminophen they used during the treatment course.</description>
