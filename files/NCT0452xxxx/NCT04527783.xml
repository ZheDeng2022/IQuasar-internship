  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke often results in impairments of upper extremity, including coordination deficits,&#xD;
      reducing of force, weakness and changes in the kinetic and kinematic workspace of fingers&#xD;
      with 75% of stroke survivors facing difficulties performing activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to oppose the fingertip of the thumb to each fingertip of the same hand is the&#xD;
      basis of grasping objects of various sizes and operating tools and assessing and improving&#xD;
      distal upper extremity function is of primary goal in the rehabilitation of stroke survivors.&#xD;
      Moreover, repetitive movement practice seems to be crucial for maximizing therapeutic&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies, proposed an engineered glove to assess motor performance during&#xD;
      finger-to-thumb opposition movements and to provide objective and reproducible measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same tool can be integrated with Virtual Reality and serious games to provide repetitive&#xD;
      practice of activities improving motivation and adherence with therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators developed a new integrated glove and virtual reality to facilitate the&#xD;
      recovery of hand functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of the engineered glove in the&#xD;
      assessment and treatment of hand dysfunction in people with Stroke.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Manual Ability Measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline- immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self reported questionnaire to rate perceived manual ability on a scale ranging from 0 (impossible to complete any of activity cited) to 100 (every activity cited is accomplished without any difficulty).</description>

    <measure>Change in the instrumented indexes</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline- immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects perform a repetitive finger-to-thumb opposition sequence (index, medium, ring and little finger) with their affected hand at maximal velocity and with the two hands simultaneously at a frequency of 2 Hz paced by a metronome. The testing session includes one 60sec trial per condition.&#xD;
They wear a sensor-engineered glove on both hands to quantitatively assess finger motor performance</description>
