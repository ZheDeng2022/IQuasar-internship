  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative concomitant radiochemotherapy is a treatment that is difficult to achieve for&#xD;
      several reasons. First of all, and by definition, these patients have had recent surgery,&#xD;
      most often accompanied by several weeks of hospitalization and weight loss. In addition, the&#xD;
      functional recovery of feeding capacity is not always complete at the time of the start of&#xD;
      irradiation. In addition, concomitant radiochemotherapy is responsible for very frequent&#xD;
      radiomucitus which alters the feeding capacity of patients during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, the rate of complete radiochemotherapy (3 cures of cisplatin administered) varies&#xD;
      from 50 to 70% depending on the studies, which were carried out in selected populations&#xD;
      within the framework of an experimental clinical trial and without distinguishing between&#xD;
      positive and negative Human Papilloma tumours . In our experience, in a population with a&#xD;
      very high preponderance of non-Human Papilloma-related tumours and not selected by&#xD;
      participation in an experimental trial, complete radiochemotherapy is only possible in about&#xD;
      40% to 50% of cases.However, the amount of cisplatin actually administered is correlated with&#xD;
      overall survival. Therefore, it is logical to assume that increasing the number of patients&#xD;
      receiving full treatment may result in increased survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the need for nutritional care during radiotherapy is clearly established, its modality&#xD;
      remains debated. Recently, a randomised study of 159 patients treated by radiotherapy (or&#xD;
      radiochemotherapy) showed that the simple systematic prescription of oral food supplements&#xD;
      (500 kcal/d) in addition to the usual dietary advice was associated with a lesser reduction&#xD;
      in weight at the end of radiotherapy (main objective) but also with an improvement in the&#xD;
      tolerance of the treatments. Overall, nutritional management during treatment varies greatly,&#xD;
      ranging from simple dietary monitoring to prophylactic gastrostomy and the insertion of a&#xD;
      nasogastric tube on demand during treatment. This heterogeneity of management found in the&#xD;
      literature is also observed at the regional level. This project will also make it possible to&#xD;
      propose a harmonized support strategy at the inter-regional level.&#xD;
