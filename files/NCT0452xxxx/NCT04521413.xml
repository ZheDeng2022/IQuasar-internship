  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of an investigational drug called CFI-402411&#xD;
      alone and in combination with pembrolizumab and to study its effects in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors who have progressed following previous therapies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a first-in-human study evaluating the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      CFI-402411 in subjects with advanced solid malignancies, when CFI-402411 is administered as a&#xD;
      single agent or in combination with pembrolizumab. CFI-402411 is an oral pill that blocks the&#xD;
      function of HPK1. Blocking HPK1 could stimulate an immune response against the tumor in&#xD;
      patients. This immune response could be further enhanced when combined with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
      The data obtained from this study will determine the dose and schedule and subject selection&#xD;
      for further clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical findings support further development of CFI-402411 as a novel anti-cancer agent,&#xD;
      and the combination of CFI-402411 with pembrolizumab as a potential strategy to improve&#xD;
      outcomes of subjects with advanced malignancies.&#xD;
