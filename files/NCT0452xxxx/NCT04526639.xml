    <textblock>
      Childhood traumatic brain injury (TBI) poses significant impairment in children's executive&#xD;
      functions (EFs) for moderate to severe injuries, yet interventions specifically designed for&#xD;
      children's EF rehabilitation post-TBI and rigorous clinical trials to establish the efficacy&#xD;
      of such interventions remain unavailable. In this study, the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a novel virtual reality (VR)-based&#xD;
      training program for EF rehabilitation for childhood TBI.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of acquired disability in U.S. children, with&#xD;
      an estimated 700,000 cases every year, presenting in 75% of children with trauma and&#xD;
      accounting for 70% of deaths from childhood trauma. Childhood TBIs often result in&#xD;
      significant impairment in cognitive functions,1 particularly in core executive functions&#xD;
      (EFs) due to the vulnerability of the frontal lobes, especially after a moderate to severe&#xD;
      TBI. Core EF is composed of three skills: inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive&#xD;
      flexibility. These skills are associated with impaired EF behaviors, increased attention&#xD;
      problems, and lower health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL). However, evidence-based EF&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs are lacking. Although a combination of diverse cognitive&#xD;
      interventions may improve children's EF, limited affordability, accessibility, adherence, and&#xD;
      generalizability hamper clinically adapting and implementing such interventions in the&#xD;
      rehabilitation setting. Virtual reality (VR) offers an exciting alternative strategy for EF&#xD;
      rehabilitation of childhood TBI due to its flexibility, accessibility, and immersive&#xD;
      experiences in three dimensions. These properties may increase adherence to training and&#xD;
      foster an enhanced transfer of learned EF skills to untrained tasks in everyday life. Thus&#xD;
      far, rigor-ous randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have not been conducted to establish the&#xD;
      efficacy of VR-based EF reha-bilitation for childhood TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of the project is to assess the efficacy of a novel VR-based interactive&#xD;
      cognitive training (VICT) program for EF rehabilitation in children with TBI with the&#xD;
      following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Examine VICT's efficacy in improving core and daily EF skills among children with TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1: Children in the intervention group will show enhanced improvement over&#xD;
      controls in trained VR-based EF tasks and untrained NIH Toolbox tasks from baseline to&#xD;
      post-intervention and follow-up visits; Hypothesis 1.2: The intervention group will show&#xD;
      better reported daily EF than controls at the follow-up visit; Hypothesis 1.3: Children in&#xD;
      the intervention group will show faster improvement than controls in daily-reported EF skills&#xD;
      between post-intervention and follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Examine VICT's efficacy in reducing attentional problems among children with TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.1: Children in the intervention group will show a greater reduction in&#xD;
      attentional problems as measured by testing on the Conners Continuous Performance Test 3rd&#xD;
      Editionâ„¢ (Conners CPT 3TM) from baseline to the post-intervention and follow-up visits than&#xD;
      controls; Hypothesis 2.2: Children in the intervention group will show fewer everyday&#xD;
      attentional problems on the Be-havior Assessment System for Children 3rd Ed (BASC-3) self-&#xD;
      and parent-ratings of attention at the follow-up visit than controls; Hypothesis 2.3: The&#xD;
      direct effect of the VICT program in reducing attention problems will be mediated by&#xD;
      children's EF behaviors as measured by the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function,&#xD;
      Second Edition (BRIEF2) at the follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Examine VICT's efficacy in improving HRQOL among children with TBI. Hypothesis 3.1:&#xD;
      The intervention group will show higher levels of reported HRQOL than controls at follow-up;&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3.2: The direct effect of the VICT program on HRQOL at follow-up will be mediated&#xD;
      by children's EF skills and ratings of EF behaviors and attention at the post-intervention&#xD;
      and follow-up visits.&#xD;
