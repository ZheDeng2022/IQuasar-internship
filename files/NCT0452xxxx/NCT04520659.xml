      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the infectivity, safety, and immunogenicity of a&#xD;
      single dose of a recombinant, live-attenuated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine,&#xD;
      LID/ΔM2-2/1030s, in RSV-seronegative infants and children 6 to 24 months of age.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the infectivity, safety, and immunogenicity of a single dose of a&#xD;
      recombinant, live-attenuated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, LID/ΔM2-2/1030s, in&#xD;
      RSV-seronegative infants and children 6 to 24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups to receive a single dose of&#xD;
      intranasal RSV LID/ΔM2-2/1030s vaccine or placebo at study entry (Day 0). Group 1 (intensive)&#xD;
      and Group 2 (less intensive) will differ only in the frequency of study visits and nasal swab&#xD;
      collections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study product between April 1 and October 15, outside of the RSV&#xD;
      season, and will remain on the study until they complete the post-RSV season visit between&#xD;
      April 1 and April 30 in the calendar year following enrollment. Participants' total study&#xD;
      duration is between 6 and 13 months, depending upon time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend several study visits throughout the study, which may include blood&#xD;
      collection, nasal swabs, and physical examinations.&#xD;
