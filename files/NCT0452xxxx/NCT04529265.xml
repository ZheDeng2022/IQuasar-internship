    <textblock>
      Postoperative Neurocognitive Disorders are the most common neurological complications after&#xD;
      major surgery, which are associated with higher increased mortality and morbidity in elderly&#xD;
      patients undergoing major surgery. Until now highly effective intervention has not been&#xD;
      established yet. Recent preclinical studies suggest mithochiondrial dysfunction may be linked&#xD;
      to pathogensis of POD and POCD. As Methylene blue(MB) is a mitochondrial protective agent and&#xD;
      a safe drug with long history of clinical use, we propose that mitochondrial-targeted&#xD;
      interventions may be useful to prevent POD/POCD in elderly surgical patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is one of the most common incident cancers that causes cancer death in&#xD;
      China. Its prevalence increases with age, and over 50% of patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer are older than 70 years of age, who are vulnerable to Postoperative&#xD;
      Neurocognitive Disorders(PND), including postoperative delirium(POD) characterized by an&#xD;
      acute change in cognition with altered consciousness and impaired attention, and&#xD;
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction(POCD) mainly manifested as reduced ability of learning&#xD;
      and memory. It is reported that POD occurred in 10% - 60% of elderly surgical patients,&#xD;
      varying by surgical procedure, while the incidence of POCD is approximately 25%-40%. Although&#xD;
      it was reported that small dosage of intravenous dexmedetomidine maybe reduce the incidence&#xD;
      of POD/POCD, a large number of studies had also shown that dexmedetomidine would promote&#xD;
      breast cancer, liver cancer and lung cancer cells' proliferation and migration, which urged&#xD;
      to find more effective and safer treatment strategies to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction in elderly cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated anesthesia/surgery-induced&#xD;
      neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are strongly associated with postoperative&#xD;
      neurocognitive disorders. The mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases, leading to neuronal death, neuroinflammation, metabolic&#xD;
      disturbance, and excessive reactive oxidative species(ROS) production. Actually, recent&#xD;
      experimental evidences have linked anesthesia/surgery-induced mitochondrial dysfunction to&#xD;
      POCD, and the available data support that restoration of mitochondrial function could reduce&#xD;
      postoperative cognitive impairments in developing and aging animals. Therefore, we propose&#xD;
      those mitochondrial-targeted interventions may be useful to prevent POD/POCD in elderly&#xD;
      surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methylene blue(MB) is a diaminophenothiazine with a long history of clinical use due to its&#xD;
      safe profile. The studies have indicated that MB, as a redox mediator in the electron&#xD;
      transfer chain (ETC), restores mitochondrial function and enhances brain metabolism. In&#xD;
      recent years its role as a mitochondrial protective agent has elicited much of its renewed&#xD;
      interest, especially its neuroprotective effects in clinical studies against ischemic stroke,&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced encephalopathy and neurodegenerative disorders associated with&#xD;
      psychoses. MB has been proposed to protect selective regions of the brain, wherein memory is&#xD;
      encoded and processed in various models of brain dysfunction-induced amnesia, and&#xD;
      importantly, enhances learning and memory in patients with mental diseases and healthy human&#xD;
      through its beneficial brain network effects. Now its emerging role as neuroprotectant and&#xD;
      memory-enhancer makes this old drug become a promising cure for neurodegenerative diseases.&#xD;
      Our previous clinical study ( NCT04341844) found that the single dosage of 2mg/kg MB was safe&#xD;
      to the elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, and was effective to prevent of the&#xD;
      incidence of POD and early POCD. However, the long-term cognitive reserve of MB remains&#xD;
      unclear. Since MB has a half-life of approximately 24 h, whether multiple dosages of MB could&#xD;
      prevent long-term cognitive impairments need further investigation. Therefore, we design this&#xD;
      prospective randomized controlled clinical trial to test whether multiple dosages of MB could&#xD;
      decrease the incidence of POD/POCD in elderly patients undergoing colorectal cancer&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;
