  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how well paricalcitol and hydroxychloroquine work when&#xD;
      combined with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that&#xD;
      has spread to other places in the body (advanced or metastatic). Paricalcitol (a form of&#xD;
      vitamin D) works by blocking a signal in the cancer cells that leads to growth and spreading&#xD;
      of the tumor. Hydroxychloroquine (an autophagy inhibitor) enhances the activity of standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy on cancer cells and prevent them to utilize energy to grow. Chemotherapy drugs,&#xD;
      such as gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving paricalcitol and hydroxychloroquine together with standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) may work better in treating patients with pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      compared to either paricalcitol or hydroxychloroquine alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the combination of paricalcitol plus&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine (PH) when added to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel treatment by assessing&#xD;
      the overall response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of paricalcitol plus&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine (PH) when added to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel treatment in patients&#xD;
      with advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the combination of paricalcitol plus&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine (PH) when added to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel treatment by assessing&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the effects of PH on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and immune cells using&#xD;
      mass cytometry (CyTOF) to characterize the presence and distribution of these cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate these pathways including TGF-beta1,&#xD;
      TGF-beta1 RII, SMAD4, LC3 in addition to markers of fibrosis (collagen) and tumor&#xD;
      (cytokeratin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning day -14, patients receive paricalcitol intravenously (IV) three times weekly and&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Patients also receive gemcitabine IV over&#xD;
      30 minutes and nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and every 12 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants with uncontrolled brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical&#xD;
             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive&#xD;

             adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of medications that prolong QT interval unless approved by principal&#xD;

             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known G6PD deficiency, severe psoriasis, porphyria, macular degeneration&#xD;
             or severe diabetic retinopathy are ineligible because of the potential for greater HCQ&#xD;
             toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the use of agents with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with study drugs, breastfeeding should be discontinued&#xD;
