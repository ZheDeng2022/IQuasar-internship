      This prospective observational study aims to describe the effectiveness of MC on pain,sleep&#xD;
      and /or anxiety/depression in a cohorts of patients authorized to use MC, using pre-defined,&#xD;
      validated self assessment scales.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the recent legislative changes, medical cannabis has quickly garnered attention in&#xD;
      clinical research as a potential pharmacotherapy to treat mood disorders, anxiety/depression&#xD;
      disorders, sleep disorders and pain (neuropathic and non-cancer chronic pain)-conditions with&#xD;
      often debilitating patient impact, substantive economic burden, and limited treatment&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is growing evidence that MC may be an effective therapeutic option for patients&#xD;
      suffering from chronic medical conditions, clinical research on medical cannabis has focused&#xD;
      primarily on short-term outcomes, with limited attention to long-term benefits of specific&#xD;
      strains, dosing regimens or treatment modalities. In addition, patients using MC generally&#xD;
      are unable to maintain a defined treatment regimen (whether defined by strain name,&#xD;
      biochemical composition, or mode of ingestion) over a long period of time. Even for patients&#xD;
      desiring to maintain treatment with the same regimen, it may be impossible to do so, given&#xD;
      the tendency for recreational and licensed medical producers to change their strains and&#xD;
      product line up without notice. Such changes complicate MC users' efforts to optimize their&#xD;
      overall health outcomes, as well as researchers' ability to study long-term effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of MC in general, and specific strains in particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last few years, there has been an influx of new growers and an introduction of many&#xD;
      new cannabis strains, each with a different representation of at least 500 known metabolites.&#xD;
      Subtle changes in strain composition may have significant clinical effects. With so many&#xD;
      strains available, and with limited information on strain composition and genetics, patients&#xD;
      have little ability to control what they are taking over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current real-world study addresses these complexities by providing patients defined MC&#xD;
      strains and products, allowing them to maintain their treatment if desired or alter its&#xD;
      composition in order to identify dosing regimens that work for them. With the introduction of&#xD;
      TruTrace™ verification, cannabis products can now be &quot;genetically finger-printed&quot; and clearly&#xD;
      identified. Key information, including DNA genetics and cannabinoid and terpene compositions&#xD;
      can be collated into a Master Strain Certificate. This certification can then be embedded&#xD;
      into a cannabis barcode that carries comprehensive information about the strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With TruTrace™ verification, product quality and genetics can now be fully tracked and traced&#xD;
      throughout the supply chain, from genome to patient. Thus:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who want to maintain a consistent MC treatment regimen will be able to do so&#xD;
           using TruTrace™ verified products&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When patients desire a product and/or dosing change, TruTrace™ verification provides&#xD;
           them accurate information about their starting strain and other strains that could&#xD;
           replace or supplement it&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide much-needed pragmatic and objective information for patients and&#xD;
      their clinicians about the effectiveness of TruTrace™ verified MC products in the real-world&#xD;
      setting using validated patient report outcome (PRO) tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first study, of its kind in Canada, aims to recruit 2000 participants across the country.&#xD;
      Digital patient consent will occur at the time of registration on the SDM e-commerce platform&#xD;
      when the study participant registers to purchase their MC and agrees to be part of the MC-RWE&#xD;
      observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a study participant is registered in the study, they will be given access to TruTrace™&#xD;
      verified medical cannabis products (i.e., dried flower, oils, extracts and other cannabis&#xD;
      product as they become approved and available) on the SDM e-commerce platform. This is a&#xD;
      novel innovation within the Canadian Cannabis Industry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be administered a number of validated questionnaires upon study&#xD;
      initiation, including an enrollment questionnaire that asks about medical history and&#xD;
      specific questionnaires for pain, sleep, anxiety/depression. In addition, all participants&#xD;
      will complete a health-related quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All questionnaires will be self-administered online at time points Baseline, 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain intensity from baseline to week 24 post-authorization of MC: Measured using the numerical rating scale (NRS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 11-point NRS ranges from '0' being no pain to '10'' being the worst pain imaginable.&#xD;
Higher pain scores indicate greater pain intensity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain interference from baseline to week 24 post-authorization of MC: Measured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Pain Interference short form 6a.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS-short form 6a measures six items on 5-point scales (1=not at all, 2=a little bit, 3=somewhat, 4=quite a bit and 5=very much) for pain interference on aspects of daily life. Scores are calculated from the total of item responses, with higher scores reflecting greater pain interference.</description>

    <measure>Sleep: Change in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) from baseline to week 24 post-authorization of MC</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI contains 19-self rated questions and 5-questions rated by the roommate or bed partner. The 19 self-rated questions are combined to form seven component scores, each of which has a range of 0-3 points (0=no difficulty to 3=severe difficulty). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety: Change in the symptoms from baseline to week 24 post-authorization of MC; Measured using Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This 7-item scale assesses the signs of GAD (e.g. ''Feeling afraid as if something awful might happen&quot;) with response option of : 0= Not at all, 1=Several days, 2= More than half the days and 3= Nearly everyday. Scores are calculated from the total of item responses, with higher scores reflecting greater anxiety.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression: Change in the symptoms from baseline to week 24 post-authorization of MC. Measured by Patient Health Questionnaire 9 item scale (PHQ-9).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 assesses the signs of depression (e.g. Little interest or pleasure in doing things) with response option of : 0= Not at all, 1= Several days, 2= More than half the days, 3= Nearly everyday. Scores are calculated from the total of item responses, with higher scores reflecting the severity of depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life from baseline to Week 24: Measured using EuroQuol-5D-3-level health questionnaires(EQ-5D-3L) assessment scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L assesses health state in each of 5 domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) on 3-point scale (no problems, some problems, extreme problems). Patients also rate their health on a vertical visual analogue scale with the endpoints &quot;The best health you can imagine&quot; and &quot;The worse health you can imagine&quot;.</description>
