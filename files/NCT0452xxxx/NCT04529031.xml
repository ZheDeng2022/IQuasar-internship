  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder in&#xD;
      children and is associated with increased neurovascular inflammation, suicidality, adulthood&#xD;
      mental health disorder, and major adverse events. Reminder focused positive psychiatry (RFPP)&#xD;
      has been shown as well tolerated feasible trauma focused intervention that is associated with&#xD;
      improved core PTSD symptoms, decreased severity of reactivity to PTSD trauma reminders, and&#xD;
      increased vascular function. This study evaluates the clinical and biomolecular&#xD;
      characteristics of RFPP in adolescents with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design/Overall Impact: After obtaining parents' informed consent and adolescent's&#xD;
      assent, 60 adolescents aged 11-15 years old with PTSD, and free of known medical and other&#xD;
      major psychiatric disorders will be recruited from the pool of eligible adolescents at Olive&#xD;
      View UCLA Pediatrics Clinics (&gt;3000 adolescents with PTSD). Eligible adolescents will be&#xD;
      randomized to 1) RFPP group intervention, or 2) an attentional control condition (group&#xD;
      process). Thirty subjects in each group will receive twice weekly telehealth intervention of&#xD;
      either RFPP or group process, for 6 weeks, and undergo 4 blinded neuropsychiatric assessments&#xD;
      at baseline, 3, 6, and 24 weeks. Parents will receive weekly interventions of either positive&#xD;
      psychoeducation or group process, for 6 weeks and undergo baseline, 3, 6- and 24-weeks&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric assessment. Vascular function, inflammatory biomarkers including CRP,&#xD;
      homocysteine, and stress involved gene expression biomarkers (i.e. changes in gene expression&#xD;
      of FKBP5, DDX6, B2M, LAIR1, RTN4, NUB1, and a multi-gene Conserved Transcriptional Response&#xD;
      to Adversity score (CTRA) will be measured at baseline and 6-week. The primary and secondary&#xD;
      endpoints are a) changes in PTSD core and reactivity to trauma reminder severity score in&#xD;
      response to RFPP intervention, b) changes in wellbeing, biopsychosocial trait, vascular&#xD;
      function, neuroinflammation and gene expression biomarkers in response to RFPP, and c)&#xD;
      changes in parents' wellbeing and biopsychosocial trait as well as child-parent interactions.&#xD;
