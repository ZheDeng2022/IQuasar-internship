  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to study whether the use of painting art therapy has an influence on&#xD;
      the quality of life, the complication rate and the general outcome of major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery. The painting art therapy is carried out according to the protocol of (LOM® Solution&#xD;
      Centered Art Therapy) by trained painting art therapists.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The interest in alternative and complementary medical treatments has increased significantly&#xD;
      in recent years and several studies showed a positive effect on the healing process of&#xD;
      patients undergoing surgery. Painting art therapy represents another possible form of such a&#xD;
      complementary medical treatment. However, the effect in the context of major abdominal&#xD;
      surgical interventions has not yet been investigated, which is why the investigators are&#xD;
      conducting this study. Selected patients referred to the Department of Visceral and&#xD;
      Transplantation Surgery with operable pathologies of the pancreatic and the lower&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract are subjected to perioperative painting art therapy. It is carried out&#xD;
      according to the protocol of (LOM® Solution Centered Art Therapy) by trained painting art&#xD;
      therapists. The investigators want to evaluate the effectiveness of perioperative painting&#xD;
      art therapy by analyzing the results of several questionnaires regarding anxiety and&#xD;
      depression levels as well as health related patient data to observe the short/long term&#xD;
      outcome and the psychological well-being of patients undergoing major surgery in case of&#xD;
      carcinoma. The aim of the study is to assess if painting art therapy, more precisely the&#xD;
      LOM®-method, is effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgery. When it appears that the application of perioperative painting art&#xD;
      therapy has a major influence on the postoperative outcome in cancer patients, some patients&#xD;
      could benefit from a noninvasive, low-risk and easy additional treatment option. This study&#xD;
      is a collaboration with the Institute of Complementary and Integrative medicine of the&#xD;
      University Hospital Zurich.&#xD;
