      PURPOSE: To compare between the effect of aerobic exercise and resistance exercises on&#xD;
      patients with obese chronic kidney diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND: excessive adiposity is well recognized as an amplifier for the risk of renal&#xD;
      disease progression in patients with chronic kidney diseases of various aetiology. Renal&#xD;
      alterations induced by obesity include hyperfiltration, pathological proteinuria/ albuminuria&#xD;
      and reduced glomerular filtration rate HYPOTHESES: There will not significantly effect of&#xD;
      neither aerobic nor resistance on obesity, in patient with chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION: Aerobic exercise and resistance exercise which of them has significant&#xD;
      effect on obesity in patient with chronic kidney disease?&#xD;

      Questions: Does exercise improve physical performance, activity, and quality of life in obese&#xD;
      diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease? Design: Randomized controlled trial with&#xD;
      concealed allocation, intention-to-treat analysis, and blinded assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Sixty people aged between 35and 60 years were admitted to a department of&#xD;
      Internal medicine .Cairo University hospitals divided randomly into two Groups Intervention:&#xD;
      group 1 received aerobic exercises. Patients exercise at 40 to 60% of maximum heart rate. The&#xD;
      exercise period comprised the following: the warming up phase (3-5 min), which included&#xD;
      aerobic movement exercise of range of motion joints: rotating the wrist (20 rpm clockwise and&#xD;
      20 rpm counter clockwise), wrist up and down (up to 20 moves on the forearm), ankle twisting&#xD;
      motion (40 rotations clockwise and counterclockwise around the ankles), and ankles up and&#xD;
      down (20 times); the actual phase (20-30 min), which included cycle ergo meter exercise with&#xD;
      12-13 rated perceived exertion; and finally the cooling down phase (3-5 min) in the form of&#xD;
      the same aerobic movements as performed in the warming up phase. Exercises done three times&#xD;
      per week for three months and group 2 received resistance exercises.training of the lower&#xD;
      extremities was performed three times per week for three months. Starting weights for knee&#xD;
      extension and hip abduction and flexion were determined from a three-repetition maximum&#xD;
      repetition maximum(RM) using ankle weights that can be adjusted in 1 lb. increments. A RM is&#xD;
      the maximum weight that can be lifted three times with proper technique. Training started at&#xD;
      approximately 60% of 3 RM for two sets of 10 repetitions and was increased to three sets as&#xD;
      tolerated. When patients could perform three sets with correct technique, the weight was&#xD;
      increased. In addition to knee extension and hip flexion and abduction, ankle dorsiflexion&#xD;
      and plantar flexion were performed during each exercise session Outcome measures: physical&#xD;
      activity was measured via timed up and go test, sit to stand test, number of&#xD;
      sit-to-stand-to-sit cycles in 60 seconds, 6 minutes walking test. Obesity was measured by&#xD;
      BMI, waist circumference and waist to hip ratio. Also Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressures, Mean blood pressure, heart rate and blood glucose were measured before&#xD;
      exercise. The perception of exercise intensity was assessed by Original Borg Scale. All&#xD;
      measurements were taken at the beginning and after three months of treatment.&#xD;
