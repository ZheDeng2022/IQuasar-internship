  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to find out if a smoking cessation medications, either varenicline&#xD;
      or nicotine replacement products (patches or lozenges), are effective when given to smokers,&#xD;
      remotely, as a one-time sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will either receive a sample of varenicline, nicotine patches and lozenges, or&#xD;
      neither. This will be decided randomly. Participants have a 50%chance of receiving&#xD;
      varenicline, a 25% chance of receiving nicotine products, and a 25% chance of receiving&#xD;
      neither. If the participant is assigned to a group that receives free samples, they will be&#xD;
      mailed to them free of charge. There is no requirement to use them, and it is completely up&#xD;
      to the participants. There is also no requirement to quit in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study lasts for six months, and will involve six total surveys. In addition,&#xD;
      investigators ask that participants complete daily diaries (about 1 minute each) for the&#xD;
      first 4 weeks of the study. Both varenicline and nicotine replacement products are&#xD;
      well-established medications that help smokers quit.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to receive a 4-week sample of varenicline, NRT, or not, with outcomes assessed through 12 weeks of follow-up. Participants in the varenicline sampling group will be given standard instructions on titration but ultimately will decide on their own as to if and how it is used. Dosing is lower than most industry trials of varenicline (1mg BID) but consistent with two trials of lower dosing that showed efficacy and with fewer side effects. Varenicline participants can choose to titrate 2mg if they wish, with shorter duration of sampling experience. Participants in NRT group will receive 28 day supply of nicotine patch (1patch x 28 days @ 14mg) and lozenge (14 per day x 28 days @4mg) with instructions to use based on number of cigarettes smoked per day. Like varenicline participants, smokers in NRT group can use as much or as little of the NRT as they wish.</intervention_model_description>
