  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer was mostly diagnosed at late stage (III/IV) with high rate of recurrence after&#xD;
      first line of therapy by optimal cytoreductive sugery and 6cycle of TP chemotherapy. There is&#xD;
      no standard maintainance therapy for BRCA1/2 wide-type ovarian cancer. We developed an&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy of &quot;three steps&quot; (ACTS). It is adding CTX+VP-16(second step) 6cycle and&#xD;
      CTX+CBP(third steps) to firstline chemotherapy (first step). The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      verify the effectivity and safety of ACTS in BRCA1/2 wide-type ovarian cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 70 percent of ovarian cancer patients were diagnosed in the advanced stage.&#xD;
      Currently the 5-year disease free survival (DFS) of stageⅢ-Ⅳovarian cancer patients was about&#xD;
      10 percent after first line chemotherapy. Dr Cai shumo developed adjuvant chemotherapy of&#xD;
      &quot;three steps&quot; (ACTS) for advanced ovarian cancer after cytoreductive surgery, based on his&#xD;
      60+ years experience on gynecologic oncology. After the first step 6-8 cycle paclitaxel plus&#xD;
      carboplatin chemotherapy, the chemo-sensative cancer cells were killed, but&#xD;
      resistant/dormancy cell remained. The second step chemotherapy which is 6 cycle CTX+VP-16&#xD;
      every 4weeks, using different mechanism to kill cancer cells, may decrease the rate of&#xD;
      recurrence within 6 month after first step chemotherapy, prolong platinum-free duration and&#xD;
      also with acceptable side effects. After second step chemotherapy, in absence of 6 months&#xD;
      platinum treatment, the previous G0 dormancy cell may become flexible to platinum treatment.&#xD;
      Therefore, in the third step chemotherapy, CTX+CBP is used in every 8 week for 6 cycles.&#xD;
      Comparing to using targeted therapy for maintaining therapy, the ACTS cost less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the previous observation study(CHINA ONCOLOGY 2013 Vol.23 No.12 p980), In study arm A, the&#xD;
      patients received three-step chemotherapy after primary debulking surgery, step one with&#xD;
      paclitaxel plus carboplatin (TC regimen), every 3 weeks for 6 to 8 cycles; step two with&#xD;
      etoposide plus cyclophosphamide, every 4 weeks for 6 cycles; step three with carboplatin plus&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide every eight weeks for six cycles. In control arm B, investigators&#xD;
      retrospectively analysed 51 cases withⅢC-Ⅳstage ovarian cancer, who had completely response&#xD;
      after standard chemotherapy with six to eight cycles of TC after primary surgery during 2007.&#xD;
      Investigators compared the 5-year DFS between the two arms. Results: The 5-year DFS of 15&#xD;
      cases in arm A was 80%(12/15), which was signiifcantly higher than that of arm B (5.9%, 3/51,&#xD;
      P&lt;0.01). Therefore we start this randomized open control clinic trial to evaluated the effect&#xD;
      of ACTS on overall survival and its safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In2015, we launched ACTS study (NCT02562365), and the primary results showed benefit of ACTS&#xD;
      on PFS and acceptable AE. Currently, PARP inhibit was shown to be effective in maintainance&#xD;
      therapy in ovarian cancer especially approve for BRCA1/2 mutated pateints. However there is&#xD;
      no standard maintainance therapy for BRCA1/2 wide-type ovarian cancer. Here we started ACTS-2&#xD;
      study to verify the effectivity and safety of ACTS in BRCA1/2 wide-type ovarian cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
