      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novelty The global assays of coagulation, namely the viscoelastometric tests and clot&#xD;
      waveform has never been studied in detail before in snakebite victims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of VICC including specific factor deficiencies and serial trend in blood&#xD;
      cell indices amongst various hematotoxic snakebite in the region is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No Indian study to date has systematically examined the changes in early laboratory tests&#xD;
      results in envenomed and non envenomed snakebite victims.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Snakebite is a neglected disease of the poor in India. Nearly 50,000 individuals die of snake&#xD;
      bite every year in the country, making it the region with most number of snakebite related&#xD;
      deaths in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Snakebite though is one of the leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally, it is in&#xD;
      fact a &quot;local&quot; problem which warrants a regionalized approach. The venom characteristics of&#xD;
      snakes and their response to treatment vary across geographical regions, even within the same&#xD;
      species.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the venom sourcing for antivenom production, to clinical characterization of&#xD;
      snakebites needs to be regionalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical profiling of snakebite has been done in many observational studies across the region&#xD;
      but a comprehensive prospective regional profiling of laboratory parameters including the&#xD;
      global assays have not been done to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health care in India is mostly out of one's own pocket, and the victims are of the lower&#xD;
      socio economic strata the health care costs are seldom affordable. Research in the field is&#xD;
      also sparse due to lack of funding for the same. The investigators through this research aim&#xD;
      to study the clinical and laboratory profile of snakebite victims presenting to a tertiary&#xD;
      care snakebite treatment centre in central Kerala and the role of global coagulation assays&#xD;
      in the management of the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How does the research question addresses the problem?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once answered, the research question, would provide a better understanding of the hematotoxic&#xD;
      snakebite in the region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It could aid in better patient care strategies, including possible determination of a better&#xD;
      test for coagulopathy, judicious antivenom and blood product usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its relevance in local, national and international context:.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Snakebite being region specific warrants a region specific approach to the problem. Venomous&#xD;
      species like Humpnosed pit viper (Hypnale hypnale) envenomation which is the second most&#xD;
      common snakebite (first being Daboia russelli ) in the region is a serious problem that needs&#xD;
      better understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This would be a model which can be replicated in selected tertiary care snakebite centers&#xD;
      across the country. Answering these research questions across the country would lead to&#xD;
      better understanding of coagulopathy in snakebite, its response to antivenom and blood&#xD;
      products in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It may also lead to quantifying the need for region specific antivenom in the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No Indian study has systematically examined the changes in early laboratory tests results in&#xD;
      envenomed and non envenomed snakebite victims to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the exception of a few case reports there has been no studies that has looked at the&#xD;
      performance of global coagulation assays in the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The country that becomes the largest contributor of global burden of snake bite in terms of&#xD;
      mortality is India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This model if applicable in India, should be replicable elsewhere too. Ten years back, the&#xD;
      investigators would not have been able to envision this study, since the understanding of the&#xD;
      process of snake bite related coagulopathy was limited, and it was national projects like the&#xD;
      Australian snake bite project implemented elsewhere that form the basis for the current&#xD;
      understanding of the problem of snakebite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the international context many other low and middle income countries that are burdened by&#xD;
      snake bites would benefit from any result in terms of a better bedside coagulation test (like&#xD;
      CWA or MLW) or a cheaper blood indices (DNI) to prognosticate snake envenomation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The understanding of coagulopathy in snakebite is now changing. Conventionally, although this&#xD;
      coagulopathy is likened to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), in the recent years,&#xD;
      it has been described as venom-induced consumptive coagulopathy (VICC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VICC defers from DIC in its rapidity of both onset and resolution. It used to be compared to&#xD;
      Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation, but now the understanding of the same is changing and&#xD;
      more recently the term VICC- Venom induced consumptive coagulopathy has been introduced. The&#xD;
      snake venom in India are known to contain Factor V activators (D russelli), Factor X&#xD;
      activators (D russelli), prothrombin activators (PTA) (Echis sp.), thrombin like enzymes&#xD;
      (TLE) and fibrinogenases (Trimeresurus sp,. Hypnale hypnale). The above mentioned findings&#xD;
      are mostly from studies in Srilanka, with assays done in samples frozen and sent to&#xD;
      Australia, by the same team of investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are not many properly conducted study from any region of India that helps understand&#xD;
      the pathophysiology better.&#xD;
