    <textblock>
      it is randomized control study. two groups of children (n=191) were divided into two groups A&#xD;
      and B. Group A included children subjected to the classical protocol of diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      appendicitis. this protocol consisted of pediatric appendicitis score evaluation, pelvi&#xD;
      abdominal ultrasound and measurement of serum CRP. Group B, children had the same previous&#xD;
      assessment plus measurement of urinary 5-HIAA.&#xD;

      1.1- Study design: Patients were randomly categorized into two groups A and B. Randomization&#xD;
      was achieved using closed envelop method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (n= 95) included patients that were evaluated using our institutional protocol. This&#xD;
      protocol consists of assessment of children using PAS, ultrasound of abdomen and pelvis and&#xD;
      serum levels of C-reactive protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (n= 96) included children that were evaluated by our institutional protocol. In&#xD;
      addition, all children gave a mid- stream urine sample for spot urinary 5-HIAA detection.&#xD;
      Detailed history was taken. This mainly was to exclude cases with history of foods or drugs&#xD;
      that may affect level of serotonin in urine such as mono amino oxidase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All related clinical data and laboratory investigations were recorded. 1.2- Quantitation of&#xD;
      urinary 5-HIAA level: From each participant, a random urine sample was obtained to assess the&#xD;
      urinary 5-HIAA level using a solid phase competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay&#xD;
      (ELISA) technique. The commercial kit was purchased and provided by LDN, DN Labor Diagnosika&#xD;
      Nord GmbH &amp; Co. Nordhorn, Germany; Catalog #: BA E-1900. As stated by the manufacturer, the&#xD;
      urine samples were methylated to derivatize the 5-HIAA. On the provided microtitre plate, the&#xD;
      methylated standards, controls and samples are added. 5-HIAA antiserum was then added and&#xD;
      incubated for 1 hour. After equilibration, excess free antigen and antigen-antibody complexes&#xD;
      are washed out. The affixed bounded antibodies to the solid phase were detected by an&#xD;
      anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase conjugate using TMB as a substrate. The reaction is measured on a&#xD;
      microplate reader (Tecan Spectra II, Switzerland), at 450 nm. Quantification of unknown&#xD;
      sample concentration is processed by drawing a standard curve with known standard&#xD;
      concentrations. The results of 5-HIAA were divided by urinary creatinine and expressed as&#xD;
      mg/g creatinine. The inter-assay and intra-assay coefficient of variation were 10.8% and 8.6%&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3- Clinical outcome: Diagnosis of acute appendicitis was confirmed by histopathological&#xD;
      examination of resected appendix. According to operative findings and pathological reports,&#xD;
      the condition ranged from negative appendix to different types of acute appendicitis&#xD;
      (catarrhal, suppurative, perforated or gangrenous).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children did not full filling the requirements for diagnosis as acute appendicitis were&#xD;
      discharged on symptomatic treatment or after referral to pediatric emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Readmitted cases were recorded. 1.4- Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis was done&#xD;
      using IBM SPSS V. 24 (IBM, NY, USA). A descriptive analysis was obtained for patients&#xD;
      included in the study. Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted to check for normal distribution of&#xD;
      dependent variables, such as urinary 5-HIAA, CRP and histopathological findings. X2 test was&#xD;
      used to compare the categorical data. Student T-test was used to compare the normally&#xD;
      distributed variable between two groups. Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test were&#xD;
      used for comparing the non-normally distributed variables of two and more than two groups,&#xD;
      respectively. Binary logistic regression was performed to determine the independent&#xD;
      predictors for acute appendicitis and to combine 5-HIAA and PAS results in both groups.&#xD;
      Pearson correlation was used for correlating the urinary 5-HIAA with other acute appendicitis&#xD;
      predictors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to assess the&#xD;
      diagnostic efficacy of acute appendicitis predictors. The optimal cutoff value for each&#xD;
      predictor was assessed via the Youden index. The value of AUC ranged from 0.5 to 1.0. The&#xD;
      ability of a diagnostic test to identify patients with appendicitis was considered optimal as&#xD;
      AUC value reached closer to 1.0. P-value &lt;0.05 was considered significant&#xD;
