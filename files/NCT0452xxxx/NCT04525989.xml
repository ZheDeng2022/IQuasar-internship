      To investigate a potential toxicity benefit of preoperative radiation therapy with protons&#xD;
      compared to conventional photon beam radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      rectal cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether proton beam radiotherapy in locally advanced&#xD;
      rectal cancer can offer meaningful reductions in acute gastrointestinal toxicity compared to&#xD;
      standard treatment with photons which may improve patient's tolerability of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no published clinical reports evaluating the use of proton therapy in the&#xD;
      upfront treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer. There are further no published&#xD;
      randomized trials comparing radiotherapy with photon vs proton in locally advanced rectal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized trial, initially run at the limited number of centres but&#xD;
      later expanded to other centres participating in the Skandion network. Patients will be&#xD;
      treated with short course 5 x 5 Gy radiation scheme with either photons (standard arm) or&#xD;
      protons (Skandion clinic) followed by four to six cycles of combination chemotherapy&#xD;
      (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) and surgery. The rectal tumour will be removed by TME/PME&#xD;
      surgery or more extensive surgery if required because of tumour extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive at least 4 courses of CAPOX (Capecitabine b.i.d.1000 mg/m2 day 1-14&#xD;
      every 3 weeks, Oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 day 1 every 3 weeks) week 3-14, followed by surgery at&#xD;
      week 17-20.&#xD;

Patient reported side-effects will be assessed by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire, the QLQ-C30, version 3. The QLQ-C30 will be supplemented with the disease specific module (rectal-cancer) QLQ-CR29. During radiotherapy, daily reported symptoms will be investigated by a newly developed symptom scale, Radiotherapy related symptom assessment scale (RSAS). The questionnaire includes 13 items specific for current diagnose. The RSAS is a validated instrument for assessing symptom intensity and distress in patients with different cancer disease undergoing radiotherapy, with psychometric properties within the expected range.</description>
