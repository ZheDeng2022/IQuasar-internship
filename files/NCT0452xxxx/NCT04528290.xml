  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, single-dose study. Approximately&#xD;
      56 participants will be enrolled and randomized into 1 of the 2 treatment groups, with 28&#xD;
      participants in each treatment group as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Group A (reference): Current ozanimod capsule formulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Group B (test): Ozanimod granule formulation participants will be screened&#xD;
           within 28 days prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be admitted to the clinical research unit one day before dosing&#xD;
      (Day -1) and will be domiciled until Day 15. On Day 1, a single oral dose of 0.92 mg of&#xD;
      ozanimod will be administered using either the current capsule formulation (Group A) or the&#xD;
      granule formulation (Group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by telephone 30 ± 5 days after dosing for a follow up safety&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
