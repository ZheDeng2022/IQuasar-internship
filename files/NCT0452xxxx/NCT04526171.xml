    <textblock>
      Vaparshun intervention aimed to inspire the target audience to use a toilet. It aimed to&#xD;
      revalue their toilets by recognizing that they provide benefits associated with the motives&#xD;
      of hoard, create, convenience (comfort) and affiliation, and provide a reward pathway for&#xD;
      transitioning to a new toilet use routine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our intervention consists of four different streams of activity. The outcome is that family&#xD;
      members and men improve and use their contractor-built toilets. The activities are listed&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Create Motive:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Toilet Makeover: Conduct a lottery and perform makeovers of select government built&#xD;
           toilets in the village, with the involvement of the community. Demonstrate improvements&#xD;
           in comfort (light, space, ventilation, latrine chair/handle) and aesthetics (stencil&#xD;
           painting of door and walls).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Challenge/Opportunity: Many of the 'contractor' toilets are built with low engagement&#xD;
           from family members and are uncomfortable to use. People are left with toilets they are&#xD;
           not proud of or engaged with.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Insight (from 'makeover' trial): If families invest in creating an attractive toilet&#xD;
           they are be more likely adopt and use them.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inputs: Materials for the physical and aesthetic improvement of a toilet, manuals for&#xD;
           conducting the community event.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outputs: Greater engagement with, and pride in, the toilet after makeover; others in the&#xD;
           village inspired to conduct their own makeover. Those who use the upgraded toilet find&#xD;
           it a more comfortable experience than they had expected causing reinforcement learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hoard motive:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pit Emptying Demo and Pit Filling Estimation Demo&quot; A community event-based discussion of&#xD;
           the 'real' aspects related to pit filling/emptying designed to graphically overcome&#xD;
           their perceptual barriers (e.g., squeezing a watermelon to show how little material&#xD;
           there is in faeces).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Challenge/Opportunity: People over-estimate the speed at which a pit fills and are&#xD;
           uncertain about the emptying process. Therefore they hoard the 'limited' pit space by&#xD;
           using the toilet only partially.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Insight from FR: There are gaps between perception and reality which can be addressed.&#xD;
           For example; water doesn't stay in the pit but seeps into the soil, faeces are composed&#xD;
           mainly of water, decomposition reduces volume, compost doesn't smell and twin pits can&#xD;
           be used interchangeably forever.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inputs: Films and 'emo-demos' (emotional demonstrations). Outputs: Participants are less&#xD;
           anxious about pit filling and emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Affiliation/convenience motives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Community Motivational Events: Small and large community events such as street plays,&#xD;
           films, posters and pledging activities to bring alive convenience/comfort motives by&#xD;
           amplifying problems associated with OD and rewards of using toilets; use of affiliation&#xD;
           through testimonials films, posters, village maps, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Challenge/Opportunity: Even if the barriers around pits and toilet comfort are&#xD;
           addressed, it may still not be enough to motivate men with entrenched habits of OD to&#xD;
           start using toilets.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Insights: Convenience/comfort can be a powerful drive for toilet usage. Those who use&#xD;
           toilets in the village (women, children and elderly) find it is much more convenient and&#xD;
           therefore do not return to OD. However, men who are non-users may not have experienced&#xD;
           this and need to be convinced. Affiliation can be another strong drive for toilet usage.&#xD;
           It is possible to exploit the emerging norms of toilet use and encourage men 'not to be&#xD;
           left behind'.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inputs: Scripts, props, invitations, loud hailers, audio-visual equipment, etc. Outputs:&#xD;
           Men use toilets because they 'get' how convenient they are, and so as not to be 'left&#xD;
           behind'.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Transition to a new toilet use This would include testimonial videos of toilet users and&#xD;
           toilet board of household members who improved their toilets. Providing certificate to&#xD;
           households who improved their toilets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Challenge/Opportunity: Those who use toilets for a specific period tend to stick with the&#xD;
      habit; however, some people, especially men, do not try out the toilet or find the first&#xD;
      experience unpleasant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insight: Reward the use of toilets for a specific period so new habits can form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inputs: Stimuli and nudges. Outputs: The entire family, especially men, form the habit of&#xD;
      using a toilet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, village authorities will also be recruited to support delivery of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study was a cluster-randomised trial with 47 intervention and 47 control clusters, with a baseline and an endline survey conducted in the district of Bhavnagar, Gujarat, India. Briefly, 94 villages were randomised to intervention or control groups. We carried out a household census and from this we selected 10 households with a functional 'government' toilet for a baseline and 30 for follow up at endline using random sampling from the census list for each village. Outcomes were measured as the proportion of households where all members were reported to use the toilet and the overall usage of toilets by individuals, employing a standard questionnaire.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In intervention clusters, two full day events, with a gap of 4 weeks between the two events, were organized at cluster level. Eligible households with a government or contract tor built toilet were invited to enroll for a toilet makeover. Intervention activities, delivered at cluster level, included films on toilet improvement, comfort and convenience of toile use, addressing pit filling anxiety and celebrating proud toilet owners by providing certificates and acknowledging them during the events.</description>
