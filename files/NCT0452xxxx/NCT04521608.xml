  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test the comparative effectiveness of participating in a&#xD;
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program at home using new technology and health coaching following&#xD;
      dismissal from the hospital compared to the referral to a center based pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation that may include the choice of center based or telehealth.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite proven benefits, the proportion of people with COPD who receive Pulmonary&#xD;
      Rehabilitation (PR) is very small. The current model of a center-based PR program fails to&#xD;
      address the needs of many patients with COPD. After the COVID epidemic, telehealth is an&#xD;
      option for individuals referred to patients referred to center based rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The direct referral to home-based, unsupervised PR has been proposed as an alternative model&#xD;
      to hospital-based programs and has been found to be safe and effective. The refined&#xD;
      home-based PR program from the pilot portion of the study supported by a separate grant&#xD;
      mechanism (R61HL142933/NCT03865329) will be tested in this second part randomized control&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with a COPD-related hospitalization (exacerbation or pneumonia) will be randomized&#xD;
      after hospital discharge to either home-based PR or Choice (referral to conventional&#xD;
      center-based PR or telehealth-based PR).&#xD;

    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life as measured by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CRQ will be completed by participants several times during the study. The questionnaire measures health related quality of life and is a validated tool. This questionnaire measures both physical and emotional aspects of chronic respiratory disease. Higher scores indicate better health related quality of life. (numerical, 1-7 point Likert Scale, emotional and physical summary scores will be reported )</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self Management</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Management Ability Scale (30) item questionnaire that measures ability and function. A higher score indicates more ability and function in everyday life. Scores on the subscales and the total score are transformed into scores ranging from 0 to 100 (higher number is best). Each question has a range from 1-5.</description>

    <description>8 item questionnaire that measures the amount of social support and availability of help from family and friends. The answers range from 1 &quot;Much less than I would like&quot; to 5 &quot; As much as I would like&quot;. The scores from all 8 questions are summed (maximum 40) and then divided by 8 to get an average score. The higher the average score, the greater the perceived social support.</description>
