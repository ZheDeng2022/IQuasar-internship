    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Z-338 of&#xD;
      pediatric patients with functional dyspepsia (FD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, the pharmacokinetics and safety of single oral dose of Z-338 100 mg are evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, the efficacy and safety of Z-338 100 mg orally 3 times daily before meals are&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is comprised by the double-blind phase and the open-label phase. In the double-blind&#xD;
      phase, subjects will take Z-338 or placebo for 28 days. In the open-label phase, all subjects&#xD;
      will take Z-338 for 28 days.&#xD;
