    <textblock>
      We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 28-week trial. 300&#xD;
      non-diabetic obese subjects or overweight subjects with co-morbidities were randomly&#xD;
      assigned. Eligible participants were randomized 2:1 to once-daily subcutaneous injections of&#xD;
      either liraglutide or placebo. The primary outcome is to investigate the composition of the&#xD;
      gut microbiota from baseline to end of treatment.&#xD;

      We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 28-week trial. 300&#xD;
      individuals (18-75 years of age, body-mass index ≥30 kg/m2 or BMI 27-30kg/m2 accompanied by&#xD;
      at least one weight-related complication (treated or untreated hypertension, dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      pre-diabetes)) were randomly assigned. All the patients provided written informed consent&#xD;
      before participation. Key exclusion criteria were type 1 or 2 diabetes, the use of&#xD;
      medications that cause clinically significant weight gain or loss, previous bariatric&#xD;
      surgery, a history of pancreatitis, a history of major depressive or other severe psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders, and a family or personal history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 or&#xD;
      familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Eligible participants were randomized 2:1 to once-daily&#xD;
      subcutaneous injections of either liraglutide or placebo using a computer-generated,&#xD;
      centrally administered procedure. Patients, investigators, and the sponsor were unaware of&#xD;
      the study-group assignments. The primary outcome is to investigate the composition of the gut&#xD;
      microbiota from baseline to end of treatment.&#xD;
