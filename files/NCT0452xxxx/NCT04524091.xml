      Spontaneous Breathing (SB) can be potentially harmful in patient with Acute Respiratory&#xD;
      Distress Syndrome (ARDS) during the transition phase of passive ventilation to partial&#xD;
      ventilatory support. The application of high Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) during&#xD;
      SB has shown to ameliorate the progression of lung injury by decreasing the TP and esophageal&#xD;
      pressure (EP) swings and the stress / strain applied to the lung. The mechanisms proposed to&#xD;
      be responsible for these effects are the activation of Hering Breuer reflex, the recruitment&#xD;
      of previously collapsed tissue, the homogenization of lung and the improvement of respiratory&#xD;
      system compliance and the impairment in the length - tension relationship of the diaphragm.&#xD;
      If all the previously explained mechanisms have an effect on the control of inspiratory&#xD;
      effort, a decrease in the intensity of effort is expected during an end-inspiratory occlusion&#xD;
      in patients who will respond to high PEEP application. Based on this rationale, the&#xD;
      investigators developed an index called &quot;Inspiratory Ratio&quot; (IR) to predict the response of&#xD;
      patient's inspiratory effort to the application of high PEEP without need of esophageal&#xD;
      manometry.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spontaneous Breathing (SB) can be potentially harmful in patient with Acute Respiratory&#xD;
      Distress Syndrome (ARDS) during the transition phase of passive ventilation to partial&#xD;
      ventilatory support. A high respiratory drive and consequently, a strong inspiratory effort,&#xD;
      may produce large transpulmonary pressure (TP) swings mainly in dependent lung regions closer&#xD;
      to the diaphragm and cause alveolar rupture and inflammatory mediators release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of high Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) during SB has shown to&#xD;
      ameliorate the progression of lung injury by decreasing the TP and esophageal pressure (EP)&#xD;
      swings and the stress / strain applied to the lung. The mechanisms proposed to be responsible&#xD;
      for these effects are the activation of Hering Breuer reflex caused by a greater stretch of&#xD;
      the lung parenchyma at the end of inspiration; the recruitment of previously collapsed&#xD;
      tissue, the homogenization of lung (&quot;fluid like behavior&quot;) and the improvement of respiratory&#xD;
      system compliance (Crs); and the impairment in the length - tension relationship of the&#xD;
      diaphragm which produces mechanical disadvantage to generate force due to a higher lung&#xD;
      volume. However, it is uncertain which patient will respond adequately to the application of&#xD;
      high PEEP and consequently will reduce the inspiratory effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If all the previously explained mechanisms have an effect on the control of inspiratory&#xD;
      effort, in patients who will respond to high PEEP application, a decrease in inspiratory&#xD;
      effort is expected during an end-inspiratory occlusion. At end-inspiration lung parenchyma is&#xD;
      more homogeneous, the lung volume is higher and the diaphragmic dome is flatter compared to&#xD;
      the physiological condition end of expiration, where the lung volume is lower, the parenchyma&#xD;
      is more heterogeneous and the diaphragmatic neuromechanical coupling is better. Based on this&#xD;
      rationale, the investigators developed an index called &quot;Inspiratory Ratio&quot; (IR) to predict&#xD;
      the response of patient's inspiratory effort to the application of high PEEP without having&#xD;
      to measure esophageal pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IR will be calculated using the following formula: (IPSexp - IPSinsp ) / (IPSexp) x 100&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPSexp = negative deflection in airway pressure expiratory pause; IPSinsp = negative&#xD;
      deflection in airway pressure end inspiratory pause&#xD;

    <description>Initially, the patients will be ventilated using pressure support ventilation with an inspiratory pressure adjusted to achieve 6 - 8 ml/kg of PBW with a minimal esophageal pressure swing of 5 cmH2O and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. After 5 minutes, we will measure five IPSexp and five IPSinsp in random order and considering a resting period between each occlusion in order to avoid learning effect and disconfort. The IR will be calculated using the average of the measured IPSexp and the average of the IPSinsp. Besides, we will register the average of esophageal pressure and transpulmonary pressure swings continuously. The same procedure will be carried out with 10 and 15 cmH2O of PEEP. Inspiratory pressure will be kept constant throughout the protocol.</description>
