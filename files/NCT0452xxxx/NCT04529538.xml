      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety (primary objective) and immunogenicity&#xD;
      (secondary objective) and fecal shedding of vaccine viruses (secondary objective) of two&#xD;
      novel oral polio vaccines, nOPV1 and nOPV3, as compared to Sabin monovalent vaccine controls,&#xD;
      in 230 healthy adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter trial is the first-in-human assessment of two novel oral polio vaccines for&#xD;
      poliovirus type 1 and type 3. It will be an 8-arm, randomized, observer-blind, controlled&#xD;
      trial, with Sabin monovalent vaccines serving as the control for each type. Two hundred and&#xD;
      thirty healthy, adult participants will be recruited, 80 participants with an exclusive&#xD;
      inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) prior vaccination history and 150 participants with an&#xD;
      oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV)-containing prior vaccination history.&#xD;
