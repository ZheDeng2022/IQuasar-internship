  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, 2-period, 2-sequence, cross-over study designed to determine&#xD;
      the effect of ALXN1840 on the metabolism of bupropion, a sensitive cytochrome P450 2B6&#xD;
      (CYP2B6) substrate, in healthy male and female participants. The safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      ALXN1840 will be determined along with ALXN1840 pharmacokinetics (PK) in plasma as measured&#xD;
      via total molybdenum with the coadministration of bupropion.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted as a randomized, 2-period, 2-sequence, cross-over study to&#xD;
      determine the effect of a single dose of ALXN1840 (perpetrator) on the single-dose bupropion&#xD;
      (victim) kinetics in healthy male and female participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -2), two 11-day study periods (Day 1 to Day&#xD;
      11) with a minimum of 14 days between doses of bupropion, and an End of Study Visit (Day 15 ±&#xD;
      2 days) after Period 2 dosing. Participants will report to the clinical research unit on the&#xD;
      day prior (Day -1) to both dosing periods. All participants will receive 1 treatment in each&#xD;
      study period; treatment order will be defined based on randomization: Treatments A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time between dosing bupropion alone or in combination with ALXN1840 in each treatment&#xD;
      sequence will be a minimum of 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PK profile of ALXN1840 and bupropion will be determined by blood sampling following&#xD;
      single dose administration.&#xD;
