      This 12 week placebo-controlled study evaluates the efficacy and safety of E. hallii&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an increased awareness that the bacteria which forms our microbiome, plays a crucial&#xD;
      role in human health and diseases. Numerous studies have highlighted the therapeutic&#xD;
      potential of specific bacteria in preventing and treating metabolic, gastrointestinal and&#xD;
      other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is evaluate the effect of administration of a next generation probiotic,&#xD;
      Eubacterium hallii, versus placebo on insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, in volunteers&#xD;
      with some markers of metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive their randomized study product daily for 12 weeks. The target&#xD;
      population will be otherwise healthy hyperglycaemic males.&#xD;
