      Increased glycaemic variability is associated with worse outcome in patients with diabetes&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with diabetes who have a stroke have worse outcomes (Burton JK et al. 2019; Muir KW et&#xD;
      al. 2011; Masrur S et al. 2015). Evidence for tight glycaemic control (e.g. maintaining blood&#xD;
      glucose between 4.0 and ~7.5mmol/L) on the days immediately after stroke is lacking; studies&#xD;
      have not shown improved outcomes and have noted higher rates of hypoglycaemia in intensively&#xD;
      treated patients (Bellolio MF et al. 2014; American Heart Association. 2019). However the&#xD;
      National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Guidance states that, 'People with acute&#xD;
      stroke should be treated to maintain a blood glucose concentration between 4 and 11mmol/L and&#xD;
      hyperglycaemia (determined by both admission blood glucose and HbA1c) is associated with&#xD;
      adverse outcomes (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. 2017). In practice,&#xD;
      maintaining blood glucose levels below 12mmol/L in people with acute stroke can be&#xD;
      challenging, in particular when parental feeding is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent glucose measurement and measures of protein glycation provide limited&#xD;
      information on the dynamic changes in glucose over time and do not take into account&#xD;
      variability in glucose concentrations. Glycaemic variability (GV) is the consequence of&#xD;
      multiple endogenous and exogenous factors and is a measurable variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure GV a data series of glucose values is required. These may be derived from&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring and may be from within one time period (such as a day) or over&#xD;
      several periods, allowing comparisons between periods. Initial methodologies for GV&#xD;
      calculation were defined for self-monitoring data and newer methodologies have been expressly&#xD;
      designed for continuous monitoring data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no minimum length of time defined for satisfactory glycaemic variability calculation&#xD;
      but, as with all statistical measures, the larger the dataset the more robust the metrics.&#xD;
      Glucose concentration is not normally distributed about the mean. There is a long 'tail' to&#xD;
      the glucose distribution extending into the hyperglycaemic range. Measures such as standard&#xD;
      deviation do not take into account this asymmetric distribution and are thus relatively&#xD;
      insensitive to hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia is a significant barrier to improving glycaemic&#xD;
      control and is a source of anxiety to people with diabetes. Not only that, it is unpleasant,&#xD;
      is associated with morbidity and mortality and contributes to the global healthcare and&#xD;
      financial burden of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro data has suggested that GV is more deleterious than consistent hyperglycaemia. Human&#xD;
      umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to a glucose concentration alternating between 5 and&#xD;
      20mmol/L every 24 hours show significantly more apoptosis than cells exposed to a constant&#xD;
      concentration of 5mmol/L or 20mmol/L over 14 days (Risso A, et al. 2001). Using the same&#xD;
      constant and alternating glucose concentrations in human umbilical vein endothelial cells&#xD;
      overproduction of reactive oxygen species is highest with oscillating glucose concentrations&#xD;
      (Quagliaro L, et al. 2003). In the same sequence of studies expression of the cytokine IL-6&#xD;
      was highest with oscillating glucose concentrations (Piconi L, et al. 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In human proximal tubular cells exposed to increased glucose concentrations (25mmol/L), cell&#xD;
      growth, collagen synthesis and cytokine production are elevated, and this is increased&#xD;
      further by oscillating the glucose concentration between 25mmol/L and 6.1mmol/L (Jones SC, et&#xD;
      al. 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the critical care scenario, where glucose control is considered important, even in people&#xD;
      without diabetes, variability is associated with mortality. In 7049 critically ill subjects&#xD;
      the SD of blood glucose concentrations was a significant independent predictor of mortality&#xD;
      in the intensive care unit and in hospital (Egi M, et al. 2006). These data have been&#xD;
      confirmed by other authors in 3250 subjects with a five-fold mortality increase between the&#xD;
      lowest and highest quartiles of standard deviation (Calles-Escandon J, et al. 2010) and in&#xD;
      5728 patients in a study which demonstrated that high variability accompanied by a high mean&#xD;
      glucose conferred the highest mortality (Hermanides J, et al. 2010). These data have also&#xD;
      been shown in a paediatric intensive care unit where a retrospective review of 1094 patients&#xD;
      showed that those in the highest quintile of glycaemic variability had a longer length of&#xD;
      stay and significantly elevated mortality (Wintergerst KA, et al. 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In people with stroke, GV has been investigated in people with and without diabetes using&#xD;
      finger-prick glucose testing. Increased GV on day 1 after acute ischaemic stroke has been&#xD;
      associated with poor functional outcome on hospital discharge but this effect was lost at 3&#xD;
      months follow-up (Camara-Lemarroy et al. 2016.). Early neurological deterioration in acute&#xD;
      ischaemic stroke has also been associated with GV (Hui et al. 2018) In people without&#xD;
      diabetes, more pronounced stress hyperglycaemic responses measured by continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring over the initial 72 hours after acute stroke were associated with death or&#xD;
      dependency at 3 months (Wada et al. 2018).&#xD;
