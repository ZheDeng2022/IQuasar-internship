  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      24-week, open-label, single-arm longitudinal study of patients with AD, including a&#xD;
      comparison between baseline values for adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD and&#xD;
      untreated normal control patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with AD: ≤24 to 29 weeks, including the screening period Normal control patients: ≤2&#xD;
      days to 5 weeks, including the screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with AD: adults with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease cannot be adequately&#xD;
      controlled with topical medications or for whom topical treatment is medically inadvisable&#xD;
      (eg, intolerance, other important side effects or safety risks)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal control patients: adults without AD or other atopic disease&#xD;
