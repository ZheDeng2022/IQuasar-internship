  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Babies born very early (at less than 32 weeks) usually need help to breath right at birth,&#xD;
      also called neonatal resuscitation. Healthcare providers (HCPs) are specially trained to&#xD;
      provide this help. HCPs uses information about the baby's condition, such heart rate and&#xD;
      oxygen levels, to decide whether they giving the baby effective help, or whether other&#xD;
      actions are needed. It can be very stressful for even experienced HCPs to interpret all this&#xD;
      data, coordinate a team, make decisions, and perform specialized skills all at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, new ways of monitoring how a baby is doing neonatal resuscitation has been&#xD;
      studied. Respiratory function monitoring (RFM) is a machine that can measure how much air is&#xD;
      going into the lungs. This is important as too much air can lead to lung damage, while too&#xD;
      little air means that the baby isn't breathing effectively. Another measure is called&#xD;
      cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (cNIRS), which measures oxygen levels in the brain using&#xD;
      a probe placed on the forehead. Providing the right amount of oxygen to the most vulnerable&#xD;
      organ - the brain - can be important in lowering the risk for injuries to the brain such as&#xD;
      brain bleeding. While these machines give us more information, it can also make it even&#xD;
      harder for HCPs to focus on the task, adding more complexity to making decisions, adding to&#xD;
      their workload, and causing more stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effect RFM and cNIRS may have on how affects HCPs workload and stress, the&#xD;
      investigators will study HCPs self-reported workload during three time periods - first, doing&#xD;
      resuscitations only using basic information (Group 1: heart rate, oxygen levels, direct&#xD;
      observations of the baby), second, adding RFM (Group 2), finally adding both RFM and cNIRS&#xD;
      (Group 3). A survey called NASA Task Load Index will be used to study HCPs workload. On a&#xD;
      small number of teams, the investigators will also track where the leader of the team is&#xD;
      looking using eye-tracking glasses, how stressed the leader is by measuring their heart rate,&#xD;
      skin sweat, and pupil dilation. Finally, the investigators will collect some information&#xD;
      about the baby's resuscitation and hospital stay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to study 93 resuscitations of very preterm infants (23+0-31+6 weeks),&#xD;
      in consecutive groups of 31. First, as a baseline, 31 infants will be resuscitated using the&#xD;
      standard approach, with vital signs monitoring only. Subsequently, 31 infants will be&#xD;
      resuscitation with the addition of Respiratory Function Monitor (RFM) to measure VT. Finally,&#xD;
      31 infants will be resuscitated using vital signs monitor, RFM, and cerebral near-infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy (NIRS). Study participants will be health care providers, and the primary&#xD;
      endpoint is based on the recruitment of 93 team leaders (31 in each group). Other team&#xD;
      members will also be recruited, to an estimate of 3-5 team members per resuscitation in total&#xD;
      (N=279 to 465). Throughout the study, HCPs will be trained to incorporate the use of RFM and&#xD;
      NIRS in their resuscitation decision-making, using a combination of weekly in-situ&#xD;
      simulations and incorporation of NIRS and RFM teaching into ongoing resuscitation team&#xD;
      educational sessions and practice updates. Suggested tidal volume and NIRS goals will be&#xD;
      posted as cognitive aids in the resuscitation rooms throughout the study. This sequential&#xD;
      approach will allow for resuscitation teams to become acclimatized to the use of RFM and NIRS&#xD;
      as routine practice. The sequential approach will also allow the investigators to study&#xD;
      time-based changes in perceived mental workload as teams acclimatize to the use of additional&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each resuscitation, all team members involved will be asked to complete a brief&#xD;
      workload questionnaire (NASA-Task Load Index), which will be linked to the resuscitation.&#xD;
      Resuscitations will be video-recorded for analysis of i) resuscitation steps required (e.g.&#xD;
      basic steps, bag-mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation, chest compressions, medications),&#xD;
      and ii) frequency of use of additional monitoring data (RFM, NIRS) for decision-making. In a&#xD;
      subset of resuscitations, the team leader will also be equipped with eye-tracking glasses to&#xD;
      record visual attention and pupillary dilatation, and Empatica wristband to record the team&#xD;
      leader's heart rate and EDA. Parents of the infants will then be approached for permission to&#xD;
      collect more detailed information for the infant's resuscitation and subsequent&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed to compare i) team leader subjective mental workload, ii) composite&#xD;
      team mental workload, iii) other workload measures (physical demand, temporal demand,&#xD;
      performance, effort, frustration), iii) percentage of visual attention focused on infant,&#xD;
      monitoring devices, and other HCPs, iv) frequency of visual access to each monitor display&#xD;
      type (vital signs, RFM, NIRS), iv) respiratory function (VT, PIP), v) cerebral NIRS, vi) time&#xD;
      to placement of monitoring probes (ECG leads, pulse oximetry, cerebral NIRS), vii) time to&#xD;
      first reading for each monitoring device, and viii) time to target HR and SpO2. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be the perceived mental workload of the team leader. Data will be compared&#xD;
      between the three groups. In addition, time-dependent changes in team leader and composite&#xD;
      mental workload will also be analyzed using a run chart approach. Deferred consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from each infant's parents / guardians for collection of hospital course data&#xD;
      including: i) incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage, ii) respiratory supports needed, iii)&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks, iv) death / survival to discharge.&#xD;
