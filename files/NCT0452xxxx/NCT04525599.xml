  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of three dose levels of&#xD;
      ASP3772 in comparison to the active comparator Prevnar 13® (PCV13) in toddlers who have&#xD;
      previously been administered the routine three-dose series of PCV13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate the immunogenicity (production of an immune response) of three&#xD;
      different dose levels of ASP3772 in comparison to the active comparator PCV13 in toddlers who&#xD;
      have previously been administered the routine three-dose series of PCV13.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After screening, participants will be randomized to ASP3772 or PCV13 on Day 1. A single dose&#xD;
      of ASP3772 will be administered on Day 1 as an injection into the right or left thigh muscle&#xD;
      at one of three dose levels. The participants randomized to PCV13 will receive a single&#xD;
      intramuscular injection of the approved dose of PCV13 into the right or left thigh muscle.&#xD;
      All participants will remain at the study site for approximately 30 to 60 minutes following&#xD;
      vaccination in order for study site personnel to evaluate any immediate reactions, if needed.&#xD;
      The participant's parent/legal guardian will observe for reactions, including daily body&#xD;
      temperature measurements and tolerability assessments, from Day 2 through Day 7 and record&#xD;
      observed events in the electronic diary device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have study visits on Day 7 (+ 1 day) and Day 30 (± 5 days)&#xD;
      post-vaccination. The Day 7 visit may be conducted on site or by telephone call.The&#xD;
      end-of-study visit will occur on Day 180 (± 14 days), which will be a safety follow-up by&#xD;
      telephone call.&#xD;

    <description>Local reactions are tenderness, movement restriction, redness/erythema and swelling and induration. Local reactogenicity will be evaluated at approximately 30 to 60 minutes post-dose by study site personnel and recorded in an electronic diary device by the participant's parent/legal guardian while at the study site on day 1. The participant's parent/legal guardian will observe reactogenicity and tolerability from day 2 through day 7, and record observed events daily in the electronic diary device. Grades range from 1 (mild) to 4 (potentially life-threatening).</description>

    <description>Systemic reactions are vomiting, diarrhea, fever, irritability, decrease of appetite and increase or decrease in sleep. Body temperature will be assessed pre-dose and approximately 30 to 60 minutes post-dose. The participant's parent/legal guardian will be asked to observe the systemic reactogenicity symptoms from day 2 through day 7 and record observed events daily in the electronic diary device.
