  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previously, many studies have been conducted on mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone&#xD;
      marrow or subcutaneous fat, but interest in cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cell&#xD;
      treatments has been increasing recently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of cord blood as a source, the isolation of mesenchymal stem cells is easier than&#xD;
      bone marrow or fat tissue, and cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells have an advantage as&#xD;
      a treatment because they have faster population doubling time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no clinical research on the treatment of patients using cord blood-derived&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells has been reported in the literature, but there have already been&#xD;
      registered at clinicaltrials.gov and currently being conducted overseas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will study the safety and effectiveness of RDEB patient treatment using&#xD;
      cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells with these advantages.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until now, all clinical trials for Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) have&#xD;
      examined the potential of bone marrow-derived MSCs. However, umbilical cord blood (UCB) is&#xD;
      another important source of stem cells, since its non-invasive collection procedure and rapid&#xD;
      availability from cord blood banking. Human UCB-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) exhibit high&#xD;
      proliferation capacity and low immunogenicity. A few data support that UCB-MSCs may have&#xD;
      significantly greater immunosuppressive potential than other sources of MSCs. A preclinical&#xD;
      study has demonstrated that systemic infusions of human UCB-derived unrestricted somatic stem&#xD;
      cells, a subpopulation of non-hematopoietic stromal stem cells, significantly extended the&#xD;
      life span and reduced blistering of RDEB mice model. Given the promising results of the&#xD;
      preclinical study, we conducted a first-in-human, phase 1/2a clinical trial of intravenous&#xD;
      administrations of allogeneic hUCB-MSCs in patients with RDEB to determine the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and potential efficacy.&#xD;
