  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research study is being conducted to compare methods of virtual genetic counseling for&#xD;
      people with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research will evaluate different virtual methods of pre-test genetic counseling and&#xD;
      post-test genetic results disclosure in people with Parkinson's disease. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive different methods of genetic counseling using web-based, telephone, or&#xD;
      telehealth methods. In both pre- and post-test counseling phases, remote genetic counseling&#xD;
      methods will be compared to demonstrate equivalence. The primary outcomes will be equivalence&#xD;
      on genetics knowledge and outcomes scales, and the revised impact of events scale. The&#xD;
      purpose is to develop effective and scalable approaches to genetic counseling. This work is&#xD;
      crucial for patient safety and will improve access to care through novel genetic counseling&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;

    <description>The Interactive, Multimedia Approach to Genetic Counseling to INform and Educate in Parkinson's Disease (IMAGINE-PD) is a novel, interactive, web-based, audiovisual, self-guided, genetic counseling tool in the development phase. Essential genetic counseling themes, outlined by a senior certified clinical genetics counselor in accordance with national guidelines, are presented in a web-based format, utilizing videos, text, pictures, and audio. Participants can interact with IMAGINE-PD at their own pace, with the ability to move backward and forward, repeat sections, and have the ability to submit questions to the genetic counselor via e-mail.</description>
