    <textblock>
      In the current clinical context, drug dosing in oncology is dictated by toxicity. The optimal&#xD;
      dosages of drugs in combinatory regimens for solid tumours are not clear, and the typical&#xD;
      physician's decision on dose adjustment is a clinical judgement based on the degree of&#xD;
      toxicity experienced by the patient. CURATE.AI - a small data, AI-derived technology platform&#xD;
      - allows personalised guidance of an individual's dose modulations based only on that&#xD;
      individual's data. Additionally, CURATE.AI is mechanism-independent, and dynamically adapts&#xD;
      to changes experienced by the subject, providing dynamic dose optimisation throughout the&#xD;
      duration of the subject's treatment. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of&#xD;
      applying CURATE.AI in standard of care settings for treatment of solid tumours. An additional&#xD;
      objective is to explore tumour markers in serial measurements at weekly frequency of probing,&#xD;
      with modulated doses.&#xD;

      Cancer patients are given drug combinations that promote cancer cell elimination. The final&#xD;
      drug concentration in the body must fall within a narrow range that maximises cancer&#xD;
      elimination while minimizing toxic side effects. The complexity of this task increases&#xD;
      significantly with the number of drugs given in combination due to increasing parameters and&#xD;
      stochastic behaviour of a biological system. Currently, the established approach is to select&#xD;
      maximum tolerated doses (MTD) - the highest drug doses that do not cause unacceptable side&#xD;
      effects. Treatment efficacy does not guide dose selection. Combined with limited&#xD;
      personalisation, this dosing strategy often results in suboptimal outcomes of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CURATE.AI is an AI-derived, mechanism-independent, small data technology platform for&#xD;
      personalised, dynamic dosing. CURATE.AI uses a quadratic equation to generate individualised&#xD;
      CURATE.AI profile and dosing recommendation based on only that individual's medical data:&#xD;
      drug doses and the corresponding response marker (e.g. blood tumour markers). Profile&#xD;
      recalibration via CURATE.AI facilitates dynamic dosing and personalised care throughout the&#xD;
      treatment duration, aimed at achieving the highest efficacy within pre-specified safe dose&#xD;
      ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CURATE.AI is an indication-agnostic platform that has already been applied clinically for a&#xD;
      range of indications including in oncology. CURATE.AI can be applied to indications that&#xD;
      demonstrate regularly measured dose-dependent relationship between the treatment dose and the&#xD;
      treatment response (i.e. biomarker level). Currently, the gold standard of monitoring&#xD;
      treatment response in solid tumour is via radiology (using criteria such as RECIST), which is&#xD;
      usually done at the end of a few cycles of systemic therapy and therefore not suitable to be&#xD;
      used as a CURATE.AI input signal for drug dose adjustment between cycles.. Additionally,&#xD;
      haematological neoplasms often cannot be monitored with imaging. Waldenström&#xD;
      macroglobulinaemia treatment response is assessed using an adaptation of the response&#xD;
      criteria from the Eighth International Workshop on Waldenström macroglobulinaemia (IWWM-8)&#xD;
      that includes blood markers. Blood-based tumour markers, e.g. carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)&#xD;
      and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) markers, are more suitable&#xD;
      to be implemented into CURATE.AI. Apart from these traditional tumour markers, recent&#xD;
      advances in genomic sequencing have led to the application of plasma circulating tumour DNA&#xD;
      (ctDNA) level as a novel marker of tumour burden. In addition, the serum free light chain&#xD;
      (sFLC) has been widely used to assess treatment response for patients with multiple myeloma&#xD;
      and other plasma cell dyscrasias, and has shown potential as a novel marker for disease&#xD;
      burden in Waldenström macroglobulinaemia. Therefore, serial ctDNA and sFLC measurements, may&#xD;
      be an appropriate input for CURATE.AI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Pilot Clinical Trial aims to set foundation to investigate the applicability and&#xD;
      feasibility of the CURATE.AI platform within the current clinical setting for guided dosing&#xD;
      of various systemic therapies commonly used for solid and haematological neoplasms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individualised CURATE.AI profiles will be generated based on each participant's response to a&#xD;
      set of drug doses. Subsequently, the personalised CURATE.AI profile will be used to recommend&#xD;
      the efficacy-driven dose. CURATE.AI will operate only within the safety range for each drug&#xD;
      prespecified for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Pilot Clinical Trial and feasibility study will inform the investigators on the&#xD;
      logistical and practical aspects of performing a large-scale randomised study and on the&#xD;
      suitability of CURATE.AI for guided dosing of a wider range of chemotherapy regimens. An&#xD;
      additional objective is to explore the utility of CEA, CA19-9, Ig M, ctDNA and sFLC as tumour&#xD;
      markers in serial measurements at weekly frequency of probing, with modulated doses. ctDNA&#xD;
      and sFLC will be also explored as an input for CURATE.AI to generate dose recommendations,&#xD;
      however this analysis will not be used to prospectively guide dosing.&#xD;

A decision on whether we &quot;successfully apply&quot; the CURATE.AI profile requires expert judgement and cannot be made based on a purely numerical process. The expert panel will consider the following factors with careful regard for the individual circumstances of each participant:&#xD;
Error/variance (biological/analytical) is sufficiently small to allow accurate predictions&#xD;
Profile can be generated sufficiently early for the participant to potentially benefit;&#xD;
Dose-dependent relationship is observed;&#xD;
Profile is actionable (i.e. fulfils the clinical investigator's pre-specified safety requirements);&#xD;
Systemic changes in the participant which require profile recalibration are rare or readily assimilated into the CURATE.AI algorithm.</description>

    <description>For CURATE.AI profile generation, a minimum of 3 dose levels and corresponding tumour marker (CEA/CA19-9/Ig M) readouts are needed for the modulated drug. After obtaining the first tumour marker readout a set of potential doses of capecitabine or Ibrutinib to pick from will be recommended by the CURATE.AI team with calibration-intent, based on the mathematical requirements of the method.&#xD;
If the modulations do not yield a dose-dependent response (e.g. biomarker readouts were affected by the factors unrelated to capecitabine or Ibrutinib modulation) a new data pair will have to be acquired according to calibration-intent recommendation from the CURATE.AI team.&#xD;
