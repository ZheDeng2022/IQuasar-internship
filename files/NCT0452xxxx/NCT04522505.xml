    <textblock>
      This observation study is planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the subjects who&#xD;
      received CS20AT04 in the phase 1 clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subjects who participated in the phase 1 clinical trial voluntarily agree to&#xD;
      participate in this observation study, visit 1 and visit 2 will be conducted every 3 months&#xD;
      according to the clinical trial protocol until 6 months after administration of CS20AT04 in&#xD;
      the phase 1 clinical trial. And Visit 3 after 6 months, Visit 4~Visit 7 will be conducted&#xD;
      every 12 months. During each visit, subjects are assessed for the efficacy and occurrence of&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lupus is a representative autoimmune disease that affects the whole body. It is occurred by&#xD;
      generation of autoantibody and immune complex due to abnormal activation of the immune cells&#xD;
      on the basis of abnormal immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although about 50% of lupus patients have lupus nephritis, there is no therapeutic product&#xD;
      targeting for the lupus nephritis so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator has performed the pre-clinical and clinical studies using allogenic bone&#xD;
      marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells in SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CS20AT04 has anti-inflammatory effects, controls activity of immune cells and reduces&#xD;
      generation of autoantibodies. So, it is expected to have therapeutic effects on lupus&#xD;
      nephritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 clinical trial was conducted as a single center, open-label.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main component of CS20AT04 is bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. And the risk of&#xD;
      tumor formation is low. Through the repeated administration and long-term observation with&#xD;
      mouse model, it was confirmed that there was no oncogenicity. In addition, it was confirmed&#xD;
      through the cell residual tracking test of the animal model that the in vivo residual period&#xD;
      was shorter than 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, since long-term safety has not been evaluated after administering CS20AT04 to&#xD;
      humans, the investigator will confirm the safety of stem cells for up to 5 years according to&#xD;
      the risk management plan for stem cell products of the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety and&#xD;
      already approved phase 1 clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also In the phase 1 clinical trial that only confirmed safety and tolerability for 28 days&#xD;
      after administration of CS20AT04, it is difficult to confirm the continuous change of the&#xD;
      indicator for evaluating efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, it is necessary to check the efficacy in this observation study.&#xD;
