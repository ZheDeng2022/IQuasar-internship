Only Dr. Mack (Co-PI) can request to break the blind for safety reasons or eligibility for the OARS Trial; only Dr Stintzi (Co-PI) will request to break the blind for interim analysis.

    <description>The Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) measures disease inflammation (0 to 2= inactive, 3 to 6 = mild, 7 to 15 = moderate, &gt;16 = severe). Mayo Endoscopic Sub Scores range from 0 to 3, with 0 representing a normal mucosa or inactive disease and 3 representing severe activity (spontaneous bleeding and large ulcerations). The Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) ranges from 0 to 8 (0 to 1 = remission, 2 to 4 = mild, 5 to 6 = moderate, and 7 to 8 = severe).</description>

    <time_frame>Enrollment, and 5 ± 1 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Naini and Cortina score ranges from 0 to 10 for ileitis and 0 to 17 for colitis. For ileitis, the histopathological support for having IBD is either low (score &lt; 2), moderate (score is 3 to 4), or high (score ≥ 5). For colitis, the likelihood of having IBD is either low (≤3), moderate (score is 4 to 8), or high (score ≥ 9). The Robarts Histopathological Index score ranges from 0 to 33 with a higher score representing more severe inflammation.</description>
