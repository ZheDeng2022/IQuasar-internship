  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test self-control as a behavior change mechanism for physical&#xD;
      activity and to investigate whether a smartphone-based self-control intervention can increase&#xD;
      physical activity among sedentary middle-aged adults.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is widely known that being physically active is beneficial for one's health and&#xD;
      well-being, yet only a small percentage of adults engage in the recommended amounts of&#xD;
      physical activity. Research has shown that health-damaging behaviors such as a sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle can be attributed in part to a lack of self-control. There is some evidence that&#xD;
      self-control strategies can be improved with targeted interventions. The overall aim of the&#xD;
      proposed study is to test self-control as a behavior change mechanism for physical activity&#xD;
      and to investigate whether a smartphone-based self-control intervention can increase physical&#xD;
      activity among sedentary middle-aged and older adults. To test the effect of this&#xD;
      self-control intervention, participants will be randomized into two conditions: The&#xD;
      self-control treatment group and the control group. Both groups will track their daily&#xD;
      physical activity using a Fitbit step counter over eight weeks. Additionally, the&#xD;
      self-control intervention group will receive a 7-week smartphone-based self-control&#xD;
      intervention to learn strategies how to potentiate desirable impulses or weaken undesirable&#xD;
      ones. It is expected that the self-control treatment group will show greater increases in&#xD;
      physical activity and that changes will last longer compared to the control group.&#xD;
      Self-control is expected to mediate the relationship between condition and physical activity.&#xD;
      It is predicted that the self-control treatment group will show greater changes in&#xD;
      self-control compared to the control group and that people who increase more in self-control&#xD;
      also increase more in their physical activity. Two versions of the MindHike smartphone&#xD;
      application will be used to communicate with all participants. The self-control treatment&#xD;
      group will receive a version delivering a self-control intervention. The control group will&#xD;
      receive a minimal version without the interventional components. Both groups are matched in&#xD;
      terms of contact frequency.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in objective physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Daily step counts of the Fitbit step counter. A higher score means more daily steps.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pretest), Week 8 (Posttest), Week 12 (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire - short version (IPAQ-short; Craig et al., 2003). A continuous score will be calculated expressed as MET (Metabolic Equivalents) minutes per week: Total MET-min/week = (Walk METs*min*days) + (Mod METs*min*days) + Vig METs*min*days). A higher score means higher level of physical activity.</description>

    <measure>Change in self-control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pretest), At the end of weeks 1-7, Week 8 (Posttest), Week 12 (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS; Tangney, Baumeister, &amp; Boone, 2004). Items are assessed from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). A mean across all items will be calculated. A higher score means a higher score in self-control.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Big Five personality traits</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pretest), Week 8 (Posttest), Week 12 (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Big Five Inventory 2 (BFI-2; Soto &amp; John, 2017). Items are assessed from 1 (disagree strongly) to 5 (agree strongly). A mean across all items per personality trait will be calculated. A higher score means a higher score on a personality trait.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in exercise self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pretest), Week 8 (Posttest), Week 12 (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise self-efficacy (Neupert, Lachman, &amp; Whitbourne, 2009). 9 items will be used to assess how sure participants are that they will exercise under certain circumstances (e.g., when you are feeling under pressure or when you are away from home). Items are assessed from 1 (very sure) to 4 (not at all sure). A mean across all items will be calculated. A higher score means lower exercise self-efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in satisfaction with life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pretest), Week 8 (Posttest), Week 12 (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with life scale (SWLS; Diener et al., 1985). Items are assessed from 1 (disagree strongly) to 7 (agree strongly). A mean across all items will be calculated. A higher score means a higher satisfaction with life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sense of control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pretest), Week 8 (Posttest), Week 12 (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Sense of control (Lachman &amp; Weaver, 1998). 12 items will be used to assess sense of control. For example: &quot;There is little I can do to change many of the important things in my life.&quot; Items are assessed from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). A mean across all items will be calculated. A higher score means a lower sense of control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in attention, executive function, inhibitory control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pretest), Week 8 (Posttest), Week 12 (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Stop &amp; Go Switch Task (Lachman et al., 2013). A higher score means a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in working memory capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pretest), Week 8 (Posttest), Week 12 (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The backward digit span test from the WAIS-III (1997) will be used. The task includes increasingly longer series of digits, ranging from two to eight digits. Participants attempt to repeat them in the reverse order from which they were shown. The score is the longest string that is repeated exactly in reverse order. Digits are presented at a rate of one per second, beginning with a set size of two digits and progressing to eight digits. The accuracy score is the largest set size that was correctly reproduced. A higher score means a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in immediate verbal memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pretest), Week 8 (Posttest), Week 12 (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Immediate episodic memory for verbal materials are tested using free recall of a word list drawn from the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT; Rey, 1964; Lezak, 1995; Taylor, 1959). Participants are instructed to read carefully a list of 15 words which are presented at a rate of one second per word, and then to recall as many words as possible. In scoring the accuracy measure, one point is given for each correct response. A higher score means a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Participants will wear a Fitbit for 8 weeks to record their daily activity data. The first week of the study will provide a baseline measurement of activity. Across the 8 weeks, participants receive daily reminders to wear their Fitbit. After the baseline week, participants will also receive interventional components that target self-control via the smartphone application MindHike. This intervention should help them achieve their activity goals. The self-control intervention teaches strategies how to potentiate desirable impulses and how to avoid undesirable impulses in daily life.</description>
