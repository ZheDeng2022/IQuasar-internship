    <time_frame>Up to 3.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess quality of life of cancer patients, it is composed of 30 questions (items) resulting in 5 functional scales, 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales, and 6 single items. Scoring of the QLQ-C30 is performed according to QLQ-C30 Scoring manual. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. Higher score for the functioning scales and global health status denote a better level of functioning (i.e. a better state of the participant), while higher scores on the symptom and single-item scales indicate a higher level of symptoms (i.e. a worse state of the participant).</description>

    <measure>European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions 5 Levels Instrument (EuroQOL EQ-5D-5L) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standard measure of health-related quality of life. The tool consists of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive part and the EQ visual analogue scale (VAS). The descriptive part comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each of these 5 dimensions has 5 levels (no problem, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems). Results for each of the 5 dimensions are combined into a 5-digit number to describe the participant's health state.&#xD;
The EQ-VAS records the participant's health on a 0-100 mm VAS scale, with 0 indicating &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot; and 100 indicating &quot;the best health you can imagine.&quot; Higher scores of EQ VAS indicate better health.</description>
