  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will test the effectiveness of a prenatal provider education and training&#xD;
      program designed to facilitate provider adoption of evidence-based practices for the&#xD;
      treatment of OUD during pregnancy. Findings from this research will provide high quality&#xD;
      evidence about how to increase evidence-based treatment for pregnant women with OUD and&#xD;
      subsequent maternal-child health outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) during pregnancy has quadrupled over the past&#xD;
      decade, as have maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality related to substance use.&#xD;
      Medication assisted treatment (MAT) use during pregnancy reduces adverse outcomes and is the&#xD;
      recommended, evidence-based practice (EBP) for OUD treatment during pregnancy. Despite this,&#xD;
      40% of pregnant women with OUD do not receive MAT. Currently, there are no effective&#xD;
      strategies to expand MAT access and availability for pregnant women, especially in rural,&#xD;
      low-resource settings where maternal opioid use is disproportionately high. As an initial&#xD;
      step to address this gap, the investigators engaged key stakeholders across a large health&#xD;
      system in Pennsylvania to determine barriers and facilitators to expanding treatment services&#xD;
      in high need, low-resource obstetric settings. The stakeholders identified a critical need&#xD;
      for a women-centered, low resource, sustainable, provider-level intervention to facilitate&#xD;
      the adoption of MAT in obstetric settings. Therefore, the investigators objective is to test&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a prenatal provider education and training program designed to&#xD;
      facilitate the adoption of EBP for OUD during pregnancy called Project STEPuP (Substance&#xD;
      abuse Treatment and Education during Pregnancy and Postpartum). Project STEPuP, grounded in&#xD;
      preliminary and pilot work conducted by the research team, has 4 components designed to&#xD;
      address barriers to MAT and EBP adoption: 1) a &quot;hub and spoke,&quot; remotely-supported provider&#xD;
      education and training program, 2) addiction teleconsultation support, 3) case management and&#xD;
      telepsychiatry support, and 4) a partnership with health system administrators and payers to&#xD;
      address administrative and reimbursement related needs. To achieve this objective, the&#xD;
      research team will conduct a cluster-randomized clinical trial across 12 obstetric sites in&#xD;
      Pennsylvania and New York. Outcomes among 870 patients will be assessed during pregnancy, at&#xD;
      delivery and through 1 year postpartum. The investigators central hypothesis is that Project&#xD;
      STEPuP will facilitate EBP adoption, increase MAT utilization and improve health outcomes&#xD;
      among pregnant and postpartum women with OUD and their children. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to: 1) Create organizational readiness to facilitate Project STEPuP&#xD;
      implementation; 2) Assess the effect of Project STEPuP on provider adoption of EBP for OUD&#xD;
      during pregnancy; and 3) Evaluate the effect of provider adoption of EBP on maternal and&#xD;
      child health outcomes. The investigators research is significant by addressing the&#xD;
      substantial knowledge gap of how to increase MAT use in pregnancy and innovative by examining&#xD;
      the role that prenatal providers can play in expanding treatment access.&#xD;
