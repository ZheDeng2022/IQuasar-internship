  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart transplantation is the best way to treat terminal heart failure, which can improve the&#xD;
      quality and life expectancy of patients, as well as contribute to their social and labor&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Actually, the procedure of heart transplantation is a complex procedure that&#xD;
      requires the coordinated work of cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, anesthetists, perfusionist,&#xD;
      nurses, as well as the administration of medical organizations. It is known that the&#xD;
      restriction of motor activity in patients with heart failure leads to a loss of muscle mass,&#xD;
      as well as a decrease in its strength and endurance. In patients with heart failure, the low&#xD;
      functional status of skeletal muscle is associated with poor prognosis, regardless of gender,&#xD;
      age, and concomitant coronary heart disease. Optimization of drug therapy and appropriate use&#xD;
      of resynchronization therapy can improve functional status, as can patient engagement in&#xD;
      exercise. Although exercise is recommended as a component of heart failure management,&#xD;
      adherence is consistently low. This is particularly troubling because exercise has great&#xD;
      potential as a low-risk, low-cost intervention to improve functional status and quality of&#xD;
      life while decreasing heart failure symptoms and hospitalizations in patients with heart&#xD;
      failure. Low adherence is due in part to inadequate strength and inability to tolerate or&#xD;
      sustain even low levels of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we propose to use neuromuscular electrical stimulation to assist patient&#xD;
      initiation of quadriceps strengthening in order to progressively increase low exercise&#xD;
      tolerance.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single-blinded, randomized longitudinal study design to determine if NMES will increase muscle mass and strength and improve exercise capacity and right-ventricle diastolic function in patients with advanced HF. Patients will be randomized to either intervention that includes NMES or to a control group. In order to ensure that the two groups are comparable between treatment and control, the participants will be randomized according to gender. Randomization via minimization will be used in order to avoid an unbalanced number of women in the two comparison groups due to chance. A file of the computer-generated random assignments will be kept.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>NMES will carried out with four-channel myostimulator &quot;Beurer EM80&quot; (Germany). Self-adhesive electrodes locates above the quadriceps, the duration of the NMES session was 60 minutes, including 5-minute periods of warm-up and warm-down. Throughout the series, rectangular pulses with a frequency of 45 Hz will modulate. As a result, tonic contraction of these muscles will induce for 12 seconds, followed by a pause of 5 seconds. The amplitude of electrical exposure will select separately for each of the four channels until good muscle contraction (visually or by palpation) without pain. Electrical stimulation: 5-6 session per week, for 12 weeks, with 60-minuite session.</description>
