  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, FIH study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antineoplastic activity of RLY-4008, a potent and highly&#xD;
      selective fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) inhibitor administered orally patients&#xD;
      with unresectable or metastatic ICC and other unresectable or metastatic solid tumors. This&#xD;
      study consists of 2 parts, a dose escalation (Part 1) and a dose expansion (Part 2).&#xD;
