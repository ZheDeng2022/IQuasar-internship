      Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) are important clinical items for evaluating&#xD;
      injuries and recovery of the hand. Some of the most used Questionnaires, unfortunately, are&#xD;
      not available in Italian. This poses a problem when evaluating Italian speaking patients. Our&#xD;
      aim is to develop a culturally adapted Italian version of the Michigan Hand Questionnaire.&#xD;
      There is no risk involved for the patients, as the task of the recruited patients is to&#xD;
      answer a survey (online and in clinics).&#xD;

    <description>Validity will be assessed as structural validity, i.e., &quot;the degree to which the scores of the Health-Related Patient Reported Outcome (HR-PRO) are an adequate reflection of the dimensionality of the construct to be measured&quot; (Mokkink et al., 2010).</description>

    <description>Reliability will be assessed as internal consistency (i.e., &quot;the degree of the interrelatedness among the items&quot; [Mokkink et al., 2010]), test-retest reliability (i.e., &quot;the proportion of the total variance in the measurements which is due to 'true' differences between patients&quot; [Mokkink et al., 2010]), and measurement error (i.e., &quot;the systematic and random error of a patient's score that is not attributed to true changes in the construct to be measured&quot; [Mokkink et al., 2010]).</description>
