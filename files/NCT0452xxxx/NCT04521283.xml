  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ocular trauma is an important public health problem which is preventable and its etiology,&#xD;
      severity, and outcome depends on many factors in the changing environment . Even eyes&#xD;
      represent only 0.27% of the body surface area and 4% of the facial area, they are the third&#xD;
      most commonly trauma-exposed area after the hands and feet . It is estimated that, worldwide,&#xD;
      there are approximately 1.6 million people blind from eye injuries, 2.3 million bilaterally&#xD;
      visually impaired and 19 million with unilateral visual loss; these facts make ocular trauma&#xD;
      the most common cause of unilateral blindness . In population-based surveys, the percentage&#xD;
      of monocular blindness due to trauma ranged from 20% to 50% and of bilateral blindness from&#xD;
      3.2% to 5.5% .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ocular injuries vary with a broad range of severity and include simple subconjunctival&#xD;
      injury, lid laceration, corneal abrasion, traumatic iritis, hyphaema, lens injury, vitreous&#xD;
      haemorrhage (VH) , retinal detachment, traumatic optic neuropathy, retrobulbar haemorrhage,&#xD;
      orbital fracture, and ruptured globes. Ocular injuries are classified into 2 groups as open&#xD;
      and close globe injuries. Ruptured globes fall into the category of open globe injuries,&#xD;
      which are injuries resulting in a full-thickness laceration of the cornea and/or sclera.&#xD;
      Wounds can be penetrating (with one entry wound and no exit wound), or perforating (a&#xD;
      through-and-through injury with both entrance and exit wounds) . Closed globe injuries&#xD;
      resulting from blunt trauma can cause hyphaema, vitreous haemorrhage, retinal tears and&#xD;
      detachment, choroidal rupture, macular oedema, and even globe rupture, retrobulbar&#xD;
      haemorrhage and traumatic optic neuropathy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Kasr El Aini Hospital The majority of ocular trauma in their population was due to&#xD;
      assaultive injuries occurring mainly in males. Open globe injuries were more common than&#xD;
      closed globe injuries, and globe lacerations were more common than ruptured globes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      IN Upper Egypt Pediatric ocular trauma among patients referred to their tertiary&#xD;
      ophthalmology referral center over a period of 1 year was 3.7%. Of these, 67.3% of cases had&#xD;
      open globe injury, 30.7% had closed injury, and only 2% had chemical injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Posterior segment ocular trauma is still an important cause of visual loss and disability in&#xD;
      working-age population. With modern surgical approaches, many eyes can be salvaged with&#xD;
      retention of vision(9). These complications are retinal detachment (RD), vitreous&#xD;
      hemorrhage(VH), posterior intraocular foreign body (IOFB), dislo-cated lens, choroidal&#xD;
      detachment(10)&#xD;
