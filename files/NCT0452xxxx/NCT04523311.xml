  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to conduct an initial evaluation of whether a single, online, group-based&#xD;
      session of hypnosis followed by self-hypnosis can decrease symptoms of migraine and&#xD;
      tension-type headaches as well as improve quality of life and perceived self-efficacy over&#xD;
      the condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing a single, online,&#xD;
      group-based session of hypnosis followed by self-hypnosis for people with migraines or&#xD;
      tension-type headaches with a wait-list control. A battery of self-report measures and a&#xD;
      2-week headache diary will be administered online at baseline (weeks 0 and 1),&#xD;
      post-intervention (weeks 7 and 8) and at follow-up (weeks 11 and 12).&#xD;
