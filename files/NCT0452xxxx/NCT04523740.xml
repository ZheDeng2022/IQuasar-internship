      To investigate if long-term treatment of paracetamol can be discontinued without no worsening&#xD;
      on pain, health-related quality-of-life and level of function compared to continuing&#xD;
      paracetamol treatment in patients aged 65 years or more.&#xD;

      Aim: To investigate if long-term treatment of paracetamol can be discontinued without&#xD;
      worsening on pain, health-related quality-of-life and level of function compared to&#xD;
      continuing paracetamol treatment in patients aged 65 years or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design: Patients are randomized to either arm 1: standard care (paracetamol&#xD;
      continuation) or arm 2: experimental treatment (placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigation is double-blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are screened and recruited from Department of respiratory medicine at Copenhagen&#xD;
      University Hospital Bispebjerg. Patients with a daily consumption of 3 grams or more of&#xD;
      prescribed paracetamol and who comply with the other eligibility criteria will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the trial and asked for written, informed consent. If given we collect data&#xD;
      regarding the patient's medications, any medication changes during the intervention and&#xD;
      followup, frailty (FRAIL Scale), self-reported history of falls, recent admissions,&#xD;
      self-reported health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), level of function tested by hand&#xD;
      grib strength and sitting-rising test, and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is collected at baseline and after 2 weeks when ending treatment intervention, and a 26&#xD;
      week follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Comparison of changes in visual analog scale (VAS) pain intensity during the last 24 hours, from baseline value at week 2 between the control and intervention group. VAS is a 0-100 mm scale where 0 is &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 is &quot;worst pain&quot;</description>

    <description>Comparison of changes in EQ5D-5L index from baseline values at week 2 between the control and intervention group. EQ-5D is an abbreviation for &quot;European Quality of life - 5 Dimensions&quot; and measures Quality of Life. The scale has five subcomponents with scores from 1 (best) to 5 (worst). The five subcomponents constitute a health state that is translated into an index value using the Danish Crosswalk Index Value Calculator from Euroqol's website. The index value is anchored at 0 = death and 1 = full health and the range in the Danish population is from -0.624 (worse than death) to 1.0 (full health). Higher values / increases in index value is better than lower values / decreases in index value.</description>
