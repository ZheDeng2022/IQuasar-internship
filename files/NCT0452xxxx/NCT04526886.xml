  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is testing an intervention of an investigator-developed chemotherapy dose&#xD;
      adjustment algorithm. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the chemotherapy dose adjustment algorithm for reducing unplanned delays in patients&#xD;
      receiving FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin)-type chemotherapy, while&#xD;
      maintaining acceptable chemotherapy dose-intensity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study intervention will involve implementation of a clinical algorithm to guide&#xD;
      chemotherapy dose reductions and treatment delays in patients with neutropenia and/or&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia during treatment with FOLFOX-type regimens. The clinical algorithm was&#xD;
      developed by the principal investigator, and the algorithm has been iteratively revised over&#xD;
      time based on experiences from use in routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Features of the dose adjustment algorithm that differ from criteria used in clinical trial&#xD;
      protocols and routine care include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At presentation for cycle 2 and 3 - the algorithm employs proactive chemotherapy dose&#xD;
           reductions, without treatment delay, in patients with mild cytopenias (absolute&#xD;
           neutrophil count [ANC] 1000-1499/mm3 and/or platelet count 75,000-99,000/mm3). In usual&#xD;
           care, mild cytopenias during early treatment cycles do not trigger a chemotherapy dose&#xD;
           reduction, but these early cytopenia events often lead to more severe cytopenias and&#xD;
           subsequent delays in later treatment cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At any cycle - the algorithm employs chemotherapy dose reductions without treatment&#xD;
           delay in patients with moderate cytopenias (ANC 750-999/mm3 and/or platelet count&#xD;
           50,000-74,000/mm3). In usual care, moderate cytopenias trigger both a chemotherapy&#xD;
           treatment delay AND a subsequent dose reduction, whereas the study algorithm will&#xD;
           introduce a dose reduction without a treatment delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decisions about dose modifications and delays for reasons other than neutropenia and/or&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia will be made at the discretion of the treating clinician, as per&#xD;
      standard-of-care treatment.&#xD;
