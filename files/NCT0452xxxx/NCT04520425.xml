      This study evaluates a standardized osteopathic manipulative therapy (OMT) as a treatment for&#xD;
      chronic migraine headaches. It will determine the feasibility of enrolling patients in&#xD;
      standardized osteopathic manipulative therapy trials, the acceptability of this specific&#xD;
      treatment to patients, and evaluate its preliminary effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, 12% of adults suffer from migraines. Migraines are categorized as&#xD;
      episodic or chronic (CM). CM is less common than episodic, with a prevalence of 2%, but far&#xD;
      more debilitating, with three times the annual per capita cost, putting the total U.S. direct&#xD;
      and indirect cost estimate of CM at $15.5 billion dollars per year. Compared to patients with&#xD;
      episodic migraine, those with CM have a lower quality of life (QoL) and higher utilization of&#xD;
      primary and emergency care. CM has only two prophylactic pharmacologic treatment options with&#xD;
      efficacy demonstrated through randomized, placebo-controlled trials. One is Topiramate, whose&#xD;
      side effects, including fatigue, dizziness, mood changes and suicidal ideation, can&#xD;
      compromise patients' QoL and adherence rate to this treatment, which has been estimated as&#xD;
      under 25%. The other is onabotulinumtoxinA, whose side effects, including neck pain, eyelid&#xD;
      ptosis and worsening headaches, are reported in over 25% of users. Due to these high&#xD;
      frequency, debilitating side effects, Â¬there is an urgent need to develop effective CM&#xD;
      treatments with low side-effect profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) has been reported to improve episodic and CM&#xD;
      symptoms without major side effects. Improvements with OMT include decreased Headache Impact&#xD;
      Test (HIT-6) scores, fewer headache days per month and decreased medication use. While&#xD;
      promising, these studies have significant limitations, such as small sample sizes and high&#xD;
      risk of bias. Further, even higher quality OMT studies rely on the treating physician to&#xD;
      select from among several OMT treatment techniques, rather than using a standardized&#xD;
      treatment procedure. Together, these limitations led the most recent literature assessment to&#xD;
      conclude that, &quot;more study is needed before manipulative therapies can be confidently&#xD;
      recommended to prevent and treat headaches.&quot; To overcome these limitations, OMT studies for&#xD;
      the treatment of CM should apply rigorous methods, including standardized treatment&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a standardized OMT procedure to treat CM. The procedure is&#xD;
      repeated every two weeks over a ten week period. Over the past five years it has been&#xD;
      successfully used to treat 50 patients with CM in a single family physician's practice. Among&#xD;
      the treated patients, 40 reported improved symptoms, and none reported adverse side effects.&#xD;
      However, the procedure has not been formally evaluated using rigorous research methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of this pilot study are to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      of the standardized OMT procedure for CM, and gather preliminary data on its potential&#xD;
      efficacy when implemented in a primary care setting. The central hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      standardized myofascial release OMT procedure will improve symptoms of CM as measured by&#xD;
      improvement in HIT-6, Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS), Migraine-Specific&#xD;
      Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (MSQ), and self-reported and electronic health record (EHR)&#xD;
      medication usage and healthcare utilization. This hypothesis is supported by the&#xD;
      investigators' anecdotal clinical success using this approach. The specific aims of this&#xD;
      study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Assess the feasibility of systematically identifying and treating patients with the&#xD;
      standardized OMT procedure within the Penn State Health medical system. Feasibility will be&#xD;
      measured by the investigators' ability to identify and enroll CM patients in this study. The&#xD;
      investigators will enroll 20-40 adult patients with CM who do not have common confounders.&#xD;
      This data will inform the recruitment strategy of a future randomized clinical trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess the acceptability of the standardized OMT procedure. Acceptability will be&#xD;
      measured by patient-reported satisfaction and perceived benefit, completion rate and adverse&#xD;
      events or side-effects. This data will inform the sample size calculation of a future RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Assess the preliminary effectiveness of the standardized OMT procedure. Efficacy will&#xD;
      be measured by improvement in HIT-6, MIDAS, and MSQ scores; patient-reported headache&#xD;
      frequency, medication usage, and healthcare utilization surveys; and medication and&#xD;
      healthcare utilization documented in the EHR. This data will provide estimates of effect size&#xD;
      to better inform the sample size calculation of a future RCT.&#xD;
