      This is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1 study to evaluate safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of oral LY3410738 in patients with IDH1 R132-mutant advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors, including but not limited to cholangiocarcinoma, chondrosarcoma, and glioma or IDH2&#xD;
      R140 or R172 mutant cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes 2 parts, Phase 1 dose escalation and Phase 1 dose expansion. The Phase 1&#xD;
      dose escalation monotherapy cohort will enroll any eligible patient with IDH1 R132-mutant&#xD;
      advanced solid tumor or IDH1 or IDH2 mutant cholangiocarcinoma. The Phase 1 dose expansion&#xD;
      will include 4 cohorts to further evaluate safety and clinical activity - three cohorts will&#xD;
      be administered LY3410738 monotherapy and the fourth cohort will administer LY3410738 at or&#xD;
      below the monotherapy RP2D to patients in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140, or IDH2 R172 mutations will be identified through standard of care&#xD;
      testing as routinely performed at each participating site utilizing material collected prior&#xD;
      to patient consent . Molecular assays utilized for enrollment are required to be performed in&#xD;
      CLIA, ISO/IEC, CAP, or other similarly certified laboratory. Enrollment of patients with&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma, chondrosarcoma or glioma may be made based on molecular tests performed&#xD;
      in either tumor or blood. Enrollment of patients with other tumor types is limited to testing&#xD;
      performed in tumor tissue.&#xD;
