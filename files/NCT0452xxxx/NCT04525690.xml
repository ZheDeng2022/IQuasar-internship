    <textblock>
      This study will use a stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial to evaluate a health&#xD;
      system initiative to set defaults in the electronic health record admission order set to&#xD;
      nudge inpatient hepatitis C (HCV) screening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the leading cause of liver transplant and hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma in the United States, but direct-acting antiviral medications are now available and&#xD;
      can cure the disease in over 95% of those that are treated. The Centers for Disease Control&#xD;
      and Prevention (CDC) estimate that 75% of all chronic HCV infections in the United States are&#xD;
      among adults born between 1945 and 1965. The CDC and US Preventive Services Task Force&#xD;
      (USPTF) therefore recommends birth cohort screening for all adults born in this time period.&#xD;
      In 2016, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania signed into law a requirement that all hospitalized&#xD;
      patients born during this time period be offered HCV screening. In this study, a&#xD;
      stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial will be conducted to test the effect of&#xD;
      defaulting HCV screening into the admission order set to improve screening rates.&#xD;
