  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective observational, ethics committee approved study where patients&#xD;
      undergoing routine cataract surgery will have bilateral implantation of the intraocular lens&#xD;
      (LuxSmart, Bausch &amp; Lomb). The device under investigation is CE-mark approved and&#xD;
      commercially available. The device under investigation and all study products, including the&#xD;
      devices used for the study examinations, will be used within the intended use specifications&#xD;
      from the manufacturer. In addition, no invasive or other burdening examinations will occur&#xD;
      for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator is accredited and experienced cataract surgeon and researchers who have been&#xD;
      involved in similar studies in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device under investigation LuxSmart (Bausch &amp; Lomb) is a hydrophobic, acrylic copolymer&#xD;
      containing UV absorber intraocular lens (IOL). The IOLs will be implanted as part of the&#xD;
      routine cataract surgery on patients suffering from cataract development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total 30 patients will be recruited for this first clinical experience and receive&#xD;
      bilateral implantation of the LuxSmart. The maximum time between 1st and 2nd eye implantation&#xD;
      is 30 days, some patients may receive bilateral implantation on the same day. However there&#xD;
      will be a minimum of 1 week between the implantations in the first 10 patients.&#xD;
