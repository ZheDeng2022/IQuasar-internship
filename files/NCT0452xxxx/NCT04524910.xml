  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Being short sighted means that vision is blurry when looking at things far away. People with&#xD;
      a condition called &quot;pathologic myopia&quot; are short sighted due to problems in the back layer of&#xD;
      their eyes, also known as the retina. Some people with pathologic myopia can develop a&#xD;
      serious condition called myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV). In people with mCNV, new&#xD;
      blood vessels grow into the retina. These blood vessels can break, leaking blood or fluid&#xD;
      into the retina. This can cause blurry vision or a loss of vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers will find out more about how well drug aflibercept works and how&#xD;
      safe it is in Canadian patients with mCNV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers in this study will review information from the patients' eye doctor visits.&#xD;
      The patients in this study will include Canadian men and women who started receiving&#xD;
      aflibercept between May 2017 and August 2019. These patients were at least 18 years old and&#xD;
      had not received treatment for their mCNV before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will look at the results of vision tests to find out how well the patients&#xD;
      could read from a distance after they received aflibercept for 6 months. They will compare&#xD;
      the results of these tests to before the patients received treatment. They will also learn&#xD;
      more about how safe it is to have aflibercept injection into the eye.&#xD;
