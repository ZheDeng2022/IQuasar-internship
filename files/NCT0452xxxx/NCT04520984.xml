  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this application is to conduct a pilot study testing the impact of&#xD;
      integrated nephrology and palliative care versus standard nephrology care on patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes. This study is a preliminary study designed to determine feasibility of a palliative&#xD;
      care study inclusive of kidney disease patients and to look for trends in impact over a&#xD;
      12-week follow-up period. Measurements will be taken at time one (time of enrollment) and&#xD;
      time two (12 weeks). Our central hypothesis is that integration of palliative care with&#xD;
      standard nephrology care in the ambulatory care of patients with a glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
      (eGFR) ≤15ml/min/1.73m2 will trend towards improved symptom control, quality of life, and&#xD;
      increased documentation of advance care planning when compared to usual nephrology care. We&#xD;
      expect 10-15 patients per arm.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in IPOS-Renal symptom assessment score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>IPOS-Renal is a short measure (11 questions), combining the most common symptoms renal patients experience plus additional items from IPOS on concerns beyond symptoms, such as information needs, practical issues, family anxiety. The total score reflects symptom burden and can range from zero to 68, where 0 is least symptom burden and 68 is highest symptom burden.</description>

    <measure>Change in KDQOL-SF 36 Quality of Life Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The KDQOL-36 has five scales, including two generic HRQOL scales from the SF-12 version 1 (12 items total) and three kidney-specific scales (24 items total). The SF-12 PCS and MCS are scored on a T-score metric (mean=50, SD=10, in the United States general population), with higher scores indicating better HRQOL.</description>

The intervention in this study is addition of a palliative care team to the care team of the subject. This intervention will not change or impact their regular nephrology care. The subjects in the intervention arm will be seen by the palliative care team three times over the 12-week study period (once per month).The intervention will be delivered by a physician trained in both palliative care and nephrology, the PI of the study.</description>
