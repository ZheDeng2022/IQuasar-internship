  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot intervention is to examine the acceptability of a harm reduction&#xD;
      intervention approach to tobacco use for individuals with serious behavioral health disorders&#xD;
      and its association with a decrease in smoking. The intervention uses a &quot;dynamic&quot; approach to&#xD;
      patient choice, allowing participants the option to explore different strategies for harm&#xD;
      reduction, while providing support from counselors in the process. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators have chosen an observational study design in order to document and explore the&#xD;
      acceptability and outcomes of the intervention.&#xD;

      Background and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high rate of combustible tobacco use among persons with schizophrenia, affective, post&#xD;
      traumatic stress and substance misuse disorders is well documented. Over 40% of the estimated&#xD;
      9.8 million Americans, or 4.0% of the total population, who have serious behavioral health&#xD;
      disorders smoke cigarettes, at a rate two to three times higher than the general population.&#xD;
      The adverse health consequences and abbreviated lifespan for these persons is also well&#xD;
      documented. Given the greater rate of tobacco use, persons with behavioral health disorders&#xD;
      are at greater risk for morbidity, e.g., respiratory and cardio-vascular illness, and&#xD;
      pre-mature mortality. The relationship of individuals in these communities to combustible&#xD;
      tobacco in its pharmacological, sensorimotor and behavioral aspects is compelling. There is a&#xD;
      significant literature documenting the endorsement and benefit of nicotine and smoking&#xD;
      behavior for individuals in these communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical or personal context contribute to the barriers in making change, e.g., the social&#xD;
      acceptability of smoking, lack of support, poor access to interventions, the need to mitigate&#xD;
      stress and other symptoms of serious mental illness. The need for meaningful structure and&#xD;
      daily engagement leads many to use tobacco to fill time and as a distraction. However, many&#xD;
      individuals express a desire to quit or further reduce their tobacco consumption.&#xD;
      Conventional tobacco interventions and approaches, e.g., smoking cessation, quit lines,&#xD;
      informal telephone counseling, FDA approved Nicotine Replacement Therapies (NRTs) and&#xD;
      medications have limited documented success. Existing evidence indicates that the combination&#xD;
      of pharmacological intervention along with behavioral support is superior to either of these&#xD;
      interventions alone. However the behavioral support aspect is usually limited to four to&#xD;
      eight sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local Need&#xD;
&#xD;
      As documented by the State,California has led the way in the progressive decrease in&#xD;
      combustible tobacco use. San Francisco County has a 10.8% rate of smoking. Over 25,000 adults&#xD;
      received service on an annual basis from the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Of&#xD;
      these service recipients at least 6028 adults or 24% (18 or older) are smokers, 5722 persons&#xD;
      report having never smoked and for another 7926 (31.5%) smoking status is unknown. The larger&#xD;
      department of public health offers smoking cessation services however there are no dedicated&#xD;
      services targeting the behavioral health service user. Tobacco use is increasingly of concern&#xD;
      for behavioral health program administrators and managers. Recruitment of programs for this&#xD;
      research effort was met with enthusiasm and an unambiguous expression of a need for an&#xD;
      intensive, harm reduction approach to tobacco intervention. The local Health Department&#xD;
      division of Behavioral Health Services maintains a dedicated Harm Reduction policy regarding&#xD;
      substance use behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consultants were retained to conduct, record and analyze the experience, barriers, challenges&#xD;
      and satisfaction with smoking and smoking cessation attempts for individuals with behavioral&#xD;
      health disorders through the facilitation of four focus groups. In summary, focus group&#xD;
      participants report an understanding of smoking as an addiction integral to their daily&#xD;
      lives; that its pleasurable effects override health concerns; that cigarettes are a &quot;friend&quot;&#xD;
      and something to pass time and overcome boredom; that they understood restrictions on smoking&#xD;
      but also feel harassed or demeaned for smoking; and that not smoking requires &quot;willpower&quot;&#xD;
      against a powerful addiction. Some felt that a &quot;harm reduction&quot; approach, e.g., gradual&#xD;
      reduction was best and most acknowledge that relapse was a common experience. There was a&#xD;
      wealth of experience with smoking cessation and a diversity of satisfaction with various&#xD;
      intervention strategies. Gum and patch were generally reported as not satisfying; Chantix was&#xD;
      found to be helpful and a curiosity about inhaler or vaping as long as it is safe.&#xD;
      Individuals also reported on personal strategies to help with reduction or cessation. More&#xD;
      generally, individuals wanted more information about the range of choices. Some noted that&#xD;
      access through insurance was a barrier except for those who had both Medicaid and Medicare.&#xD;
      It is notable that participants report that they did not appreciate preaching or lecturing&#xD;
      about the need to stop smoking. The conclusion is that individuals express a desire to reduce&#xD;
      or abstain from tobacco use and also express the need for more help in doing so. Interest in&#xD;
      the various intervention choices is diverse however gradual reduction with some aide appears&#xD;
      to be the modal choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A Harm Reduction approach will result in a decrease in daily combustible tobacco use&#xD;
           when compared to baseline use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Support and harm reduction approaches will be important to acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does this Harm Reduction approach reduce combustible tobacco use when compared to&#xD;
           baseline use?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Which strategies or combination of strategies demonstrate a greater or lesser impact in&#xD;
           combustible tobacco use?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At what service intensity points, e.g., intervention dose as defined by number of weeks,&#xD;
           does combustible tobacco use decrease?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To what degree does this Harm Reduction approach retain individuals in this&#xD;
           intervention, i.e., acceptability of intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What are participants' experiences with factors that enable success or barriers?&#xD;
