             methemoglobin (e.g. lidocaine, prilocaine, benzocaine, or dapsone), drugs that&#xD;
             interfere with nitrite metabolism (e.g. allopurinol) and drugs that may potentiate&#xD;
             hypotension (e.g. antihypertensives, diuretics, meperidine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with an inherited or acquired blood coagulation disorder, congenital&#xD;
