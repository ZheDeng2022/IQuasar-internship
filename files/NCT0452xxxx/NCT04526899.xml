  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, multi-site, Phase II, interventional trial designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of BNT111 + cemiplimab in&#xD;
      anti-PD1-refractory/relapsed patients with unresectable Stage III or IV melanoma. The&#xD;
      contributions of BNT111 and cemiplimab will be delineated in single agent calibrator arms.&#xD;
      Patients in single agent calibrator arms, who experience disease progression under single&#xD;
      agent treatment, may be offered addition of the other compound to the ongoing treatment after&#xD;
      re-consent.&#xD;
