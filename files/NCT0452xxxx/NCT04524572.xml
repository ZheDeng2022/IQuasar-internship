  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective randomized controlled trial is to explore the role of a&#xD;
      motion sensor with accompany web application on step counts, energy balance, and metabolic&#xD;
      markers in nurses. Additionally, eating behaviours, behavioural regulation in exercise, and&#xD;
      mood states that may impact these parameters will also be examined.&#xD;
