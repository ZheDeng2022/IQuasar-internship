      The investigator aims to prospectively investigate the efficacy and durability of the middle&#xD;
      lobe only versus traditional complete photoselective greenlight vaporization of the prostate&#xD;
      in patients with prominent middle lobe. The investigator will select patients based on pre-op&#xD;
      cystoscopy if patients have a prominent middle lobe to participate in this study. Researches&#xD;
      will start to vaporize only the middle lobe then, at the end of this step, The investigator&#xD;
      will look at the verumontanum into the prostatic fossa and determine if the patient is having&#xD;
      adequate opened prostatic fossa or not. Patients with unsatisfactory opened fossa will have a&#xD;
      complete PVP of lateral lobes, while patients with a satisfactory channel will not receive a&#xD;
      complete PVP. Primary objectives of the study are to look into pre and post-operative&#xD;
      uroflowmetry and post-void residual, International prostate symptoms scores, need of&#xD;
      catheterization, and need for secondary interventions over five then ten years. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to look into erectile and ejaculatory status using the Male Sexual Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire (MSHQ) and MSHQ-EjD Short Form for Assessing EjD. Researchers will follow the&#xD;
      patients at three months, six months, one year then yearly for five years then an extension&#xD;
      to up to 10 years.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is considered the treatment of choice for&#xD;
      patients suffering from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) refractory to medical treatments&#xD;
      or in patients with refractory urinary retention (1). It involves complete resection of the&#xD;
      transitional zone of the prostate from the verumontanum to the bladder neck (2). Classical&#xD;
      TURP has a high risk of ejaculatory dysfunction (65-70%) (2), and a 7% to 13% risk of&#xD;
      bleeding that requires transfusion (3). To reduce these complications, newer technologies&#xD;
      have been introduced to lower these associated risks, such as greenlight laser, Rezum, and&#xD;
      Urolift (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dynamic of bladder outlet obstruction related to BPH adenoma site and distribution has&#xD;
      not been completely elucidated. In a study that looked into this relationship, it suggested&#xD;
      that the presence of intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP) has been associated with the&#xD;
      presence of prostatic adenoma with high sensitivity (95.4%), a high specificity (100%), and a&#xD;
      high positive predictive value (100%), with the negative predictive value of (50%).&#xD;
      Furthermore, the mean maximum flow rate (Qmax) in patients with only lateral lobe prostatic&#xD;
      adenoma evaluated by cystoscopy was 16ml/s, while patients with middle lobe only adenoma have&#xD;
      a flow max of 11.6 ml/s. When patients have both middle and lateral lobes, the mean Qmax was&#xD;
      8.9 ml/sec (4). These findings highlight the major role of middle lobe adenoma and&#xD;
      intravesical prostatic protrusion (which is usually an extension of the middle lobe), into&#xD;
      the urodynamics of bladder outlet obstruction. Also, the intravesical prostatic extension has&#xD;
      been suggested to cause a &quot;ball-valve&quot; effect that contributes significantly to the&#xD;
      urodynamic bladder outlet obstruction (5). In a retrospective study, middle lobe only TURP&#xD;
      for patients with prominent middle lobe adenoma and IPP of more than 10 mm, in patients with&#xD;
      bothersome BPH symptoms or urinary retention, was associated with improvement in Qmax,&#xD;
      Post-void residual and reduction of the international prostate symptoms score (IPSS), over a&#xD;
      follow-up period up to 12 years. The urodynamic outcomes were comparable to traditional TURP&#xD;
      results but with no change in ejaculatory bother scores pre and postoperatively. It also&#xD;
      enabled including patients with larger prostate sizes (up to 178 g) that would require open&#xD;
      prostatectomy or complete laser enucleation of the prostate (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Middle-lobe only TURP procedure has demonstrated durable, successful urodynamic outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with significant bladder outlet obstruction caused by middle lobe with IPP of more&#xD;
      than 10 mm, with no change in ejaculatory status after such procedure in retrospective&#xD;
      fashion (5). No prospective studies have been done to document this effect. Also, the use of&#xD;
      this procedure in patients with predominant meddle-lobe prostatic adenoma with minimal or no&#xD;
      IPP has not been evaluated. Furthermore, the use of greenlight vaporization, which is proven&#xD;
      to cause a significant reduction in blood loss, blood transfusion, and reduced hospital stay&#xD;
      when compared to traditional TURP (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will investigate the efficacy and durability of laser vaporization of the middle&#xD;
      lobe only laser vaporization of prostate in patients with middle-lobe predominant prostatic&#xD;
      adenoma occlusion, causing bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or urinary&#xD;
      retention that are refractory to medical treatment. The results of those patients will be&#xD;
      compared to patients who will go complete PVP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the difference in the incidence of inability to void that needs surgical&#xD;
           intervention after a middle lobe only PVP compared to complete PVP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the improvement in IPSS, Qmax, and post-void residual (PVR) in patients&#xD;
           with bladder outlet obstruction caused by middle-lobe predominant prostatic adenoma&#xD;
           leading to refractory bothersome LUTS or urinary retention, who will undergo middle lobe&#xD;
           only greenlight photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) or complete PVP in a&#xD;
           prospective fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the difference IPSS improvement in patients who underwent Middle lobe only PVP&#xD;
           and patients who underwent complete PVP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the change in ejaculatory status before and after the procedure Male Sexual&#xD;
           Health Questionnaire to Assess Ejaculatory Dysfunction (MSHQ-EjD) and compare the scores&#xD;
           between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subset analysis of the efficacy and change of treatment urodynamic outcomes based on&#xD;
           prostate size, PSA, and the presence or absence of IPP and/or lateral lobe adenomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documenting of the need for additional treatment of interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The documentation of the blood loss and the need for blood transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of the rate of patients that initially thought to have middle lobe&#xD;
           predominant obstruction on pre-operative cystoscopy but needed complete PVP due to&#xD;
           inadequate removal of adenoma after completing middle-lobe only PVP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documentation of changes in erectile function using the Male Sexual Health Questionnaire&#xD;
           (MSHQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of the need to be on BPH medication in both groups at each follow up&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documentation of the presence of dysuria and compare it between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Study Design and Plan: Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will conduct a prospective cohort study collecting patients with middle-lobe&#xD;
           predominant prostatic adenoma causing BOO who failed medical treatment and need surgical&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who tried medical treatment and have significant LUTS or urinary retention and&#xD;
           require surgical intervention will require cystoscopy examination, PSA and ultrasound&#xD;
           sizing of prostate as standard of care for this subset of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the patient fits the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study, the patient&#xD;
           will be recruited, and he will sign an informed consent form if he agrees to participate&#xD;
           in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will also collect:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patient's demographic data, such as age, co-morbidities and BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. IPSS, MSHQ-EjD, and MSHQ scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Pre-operative Q-max and PVR results.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Pre-operative BPH and/or erectile dysfunction medical treatment, used prior to the&#xD;
                surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Pre-operative PSA, transabdominal ultrasound sizing of the prostate, serum&#xD;
                creatinine and hemoglobin, urinalysis and culture, cystoscopy findings including&#xD;
                the anatomical distribution of prostatic adenomas&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will undergo Middle-Lobe only PVP procedure. At the end of the vaporization of&#xD;
           the middle lobe, the surgeon will evaluate prostatic urethra at its distal end to&#xD;
           evaluate the opening created into the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. If the endoscopic view shows absence of obstructing prostatic adenoma, the&#xD;
                procedure will be terminated and the patient will be included in the Middle lobe&#xD;
                only group&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If the endoscopic view shows significant obstruction caused by lateral prostatic&#xD;
                lobe, completion of lateral lobes vaporization will be carried out and the patient&#xD;
                will be included in the complete PVP group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The postoperative stay and perioperative complications will be documented, including the&#xD;
           postoperative hemoglobin, and the need for transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical treatment discontinuation: Alpha-blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors will&#xD;
           be stopped prior to discharge for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigators will document the success of the tria-of-void (TOV) prior to discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patients with successful TOV, the first follow up will be in 2 months as a standard&#xD;
                of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Patients who will have a failed TOV prior to discharge will undergo the standard of&#xD;
                care protocol for failed TOV used in standard PVP and TURP.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2a. Patients will be discharged home with a Foley catheter 2b. We will book a second&#xD;
           trial of void in the clinic within 5 to 7 days after surgery 2b1. If 2nd TOV is&#xD;
           successful, patient will be followed 2 months after the procedure as the rest of&#xD;
           patients 2b2. If the 2nd TOV failed, we will reinsert a foley catheter and we will&#xD;
           arrange cystoscopy to reevaluate the prostatic urethra and the bladder followed by a 3rd&#xD;
           TOV.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2b2a. If successful TOV, patient will be back to the regular follow up. 2b2b. If there&#xD;
           is a significant obstruction and failed TOV, a completion PVP will suggested as a&#xD;
           standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2b2c. If there is no blockage and a failed TOV, patient will be given the standard&#xD;
           options of clean intermittent catheterization, indwelling suprapubic catheter, and&#xD;
           indwelling urethral catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2b3. The data of patients who will fail TOV and their final outcomes will be collected&#xD;
           and reported in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative follow-up protocol for included patients will be done at 2 months&#xD;
           post-operatively, then at 6 months, then at 1 year then yearly, after. This is like&#xD;
           standard of care in patients after PVP. A postoperative visit will document the&#xD;
           following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. IPSS, OABSS, MSHQ-EjD and MSHQ scores in each visit&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Symptoms improvement and overall satisfaction with the procedure in each visit as&#xD;
                standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Recurrence of any LUTS as the standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Presence of urine culture-proven UTI The use of any BPH or OAB medications as the&#xD;
                standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. The presence or resolution of dysuria as standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Presence or absence of Incontinence, and type of incontinence, and treatment&#xD;
                response to incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Qmax and PVR&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. PSA in the 2 months visit, then annually as per standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Serum creatinine level if indicated as standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
            10. Repeat cystoscopy and/or ultrasound if indicated as standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will collect patients' data and present initial results at 5 years and will&#xD;
           continue collecting data after the initial reporting for future follow up studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients to be enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will enroll at least 140 patients in the middle-lobe only PVP group and at&#xD;
      least 140 patients in the complete PVP group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study recruitment will continue until reaching the target sample size. Follow up the&#xD;
      patients will continue until at least 5 years. Data will be collected beyond 5 years for&#xD;
      possible future studies if the patient agrees up to 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Conduct:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research team will recruit patients from clinical encounters, including clinic,&#xD;
           cystoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the patient meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patient will be asked if&#xD;
           he wants to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If he agrees, the patient will sign the informed consent and fill the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be allocated into either group based on intraoperative findings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative care and follow up will be carried out based on the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Discontinuation from the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient wants to withdraw from the study after signing the consent form and before the&#xD;
      procedure, the patient will not be included, and standard PVP procedure will be carried out&#xD;
      as a standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient after completing the procedure wishes to withdraw from the study, we will&#xD;
      discontinue his follow up but we will keep the data up to his discontinuation. the&#xD;
      withdrawals will be counted, and we will ask the patient about the reason for withdrawal if&#xD;
      he wishes, which will be documented in the research results. The follow up for such patients&#xD;
      will continue as the standard of care.&#xD;
