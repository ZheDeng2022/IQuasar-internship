  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how well 177Lu-DOTATATE works in treating patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer that is stage IV or has come back (recurrent). 177Lu-DOTATATE may shrink or&#xD;
      destroy the tumor or circulating breast cancer stem cells if they show evidence of the SSTR2.&#xD;
      177Lu-DOTATATE is a targeted therapy that uses DOTATATE, linked to a radioactive agent called&#xD;
      177Lu. DOTATATE attaches to tumor cells with SSTR2 and delivers 177Lu to kill them. Giving&#xD;
      177Lu-DOTATATE may help decrease the number and size of tumors and the number of circulating&#xD;
      cancer stem cells in patient's blood for the treatment of patients with breast cancer&#xD;
      positive for SSTR2.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess objective response in study participants receiving lutetium Lu 177&#xD;
      tetra-azacyclododecanetetra-acetic acid (dota) tyr3-octreotate (tate) (177Lu-DOTATATE)&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the rate of disease control following 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy. II. Evaluate duration&#xD;
      of treatment response to 177Lu-DOTATATE. III. Assess progression-free survival (PFS). IV.&#xD;
      Assess safety and tolerability of the 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy. V. Evaluate progression-free&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate changes in the number of circulating SSTR2+ breast cancer cells (including cancer&#xD;
      stem cell sub-populations) following 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess changes in gene profile among SSTR2+ breast cancer cells following 177Lu-DOTATATE&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive 177Lu-DOTATATE intravenously (IV) over 30-40 minutes during weeks 1, 8, 16,&#xD;
      and 24 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1&#xD;
      year.&#xD;

    <measure>Disease control rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post-therapy</time_frame>
    <description>A point estimate and 2-sided 95% CI will be provided for the DCR, defined as the proportion of participants achieving a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) (as assessed by the investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version [v]1.1).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months post-therapy</time_frame>
    <description>DOR will be plotted with cumulative incidence function curves (one curve for recurrence and one curve for non-relapse death).</description>

    <measure>Progression-free survival</measure>

    <description>The estimated distribution of PFS will be plotted using a Kaplan Meier curve and reported with median survival and a 95% CI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post-therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of the AE will be assessed by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Study drug-related AEs are those assessed by investigator as definitely or probably related. Using the safety analysis set, the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and non-treatment-related AEs will be determined for study participants who receive at least one dose of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (177Lu- DOTATATE). The point estimate and 95% CI will be reported for overall toxicities as well as for each major organ category.</description>

    <description>Change in the number of circulating breast cancer stem/progenitor cells (BCSCs), change in BCSCs with SSTR2 expression, and change in metastatic tumor gene expression profiles between baseline and completion of 177Lu- DOTATATE treatment or progression (whichever occurs first) will be summarized using descriptive statistics and compared with paired t-tests. If normal distribution assumptions for a paired t-test are violated, a non-parametric method such as Wilcoxon signed rank test will be considered. An exploratory data analysis will be performed to characterize underlying association between circulating BCSCs and measures of clinical benefit (e.g., ORR, PFS) of 177Lu- DOTATATE treatment.</description>
