  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of CPX-351 followed by donor stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      versus immediate donor stem cell transplantation in treating patients with high-grade myeloid&#xD;
      cancers with measurable residual disease. Chemotherapy drugs, such as CPX-351, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before donor stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation may help kill cancer cells in the body and make room in the patient's&#xD;
      bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients undergo alloHCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive CPX-351 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5.&#xD;
      Treatment may repeat for an additional cycle for a total of 2 cycles (on days 1 and 3 only of&#xD;
      cycle 2) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 60 days after&#xD;
      completion of CPX-351, patients undergo alloHCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study enrollment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.&#xD;
