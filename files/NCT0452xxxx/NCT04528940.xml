  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial carcinoma is the most common gynecologic cancer in the western world. Two types&#xD;
      are usually described. Type I is the endometrioid and is usually estrogen dependent. Type II&#xD;
      is usually more aggressive than type I and is estrogen independent. Type II endometrial&#xD;
      cancer is usually characterized as high grade while type I as low intermediate and high&#xD;
      grade. Ovarian carcinoma as opposed to endometrial carcinoma is not characterized by types&#xD;
      but by different histological backgrounds. It is also divided into high and low grade tumors.&#xD;
      Ovarian carcinoma is considered to be the most aggressive of all gynecological malignancies&#xD;
      resulting in most yearly deaths. Our immune system usually responds to foreign intruders&#xD;
      entering our body or formed inside and attacks it in order to destroy it. Cancer cells are&#xD;
      considered to be foreign to the body hence the immune system is expected to destroy it . The&#xD;
      immune mediated cells which are supposed to attack the cancer are called tumor infiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocytes or &quot;TILS&quot;. Many different cancers possess the ability to evade TILS in order to&#xD;
      survive and grow. Many studies have demonstrated that the presence of large number of TILS&#xD;
      improved cancer prognosis. One of these evasive methods is the PD-1/PDL-1 expression. The&#xD;
      question whether more aggressive tumors possess better capabilities to evade an immune&#xD;
      response via the PD-1/PDL-1 mechanism is currently unknown. All tumor types possess antigens&#xD;
      on their cell surface which triggers an immune response to some extent. Even though, the&#xD;
      tumor needs different methods in order to be able to avoid the immune system attack. TILS&#xD;
      express the PD-1 receptor on their cell surface and when it binds to PDL-1 or PDL-2, the&#xD;
      cells which express the ligand deactivate TILS hence deem the lymphocyte incapable of&#xD;
      inducing programmed cell death. PDL-1 which is expressed on tumor cells to evade an immune&#xD;
      response can be targeted by immunotherapy.&#xD;

        The sample consists of 100 patients from all ages and races. These patients have to be&#xD;
        diagnosed with either ovarian or endometrial carcinoma of all stages and grades. In&#xD;
        addition, the cancerous specimen needs to stain positive for PD-1/PDL-1.&#xD;
