  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the injection of gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) before controlled&#xD;
      ovarian hyperstimulation (COH), the scheme of prolonged early follicular period protocol has&#xD;
      obvious advantages in achieving ideal egg number, increasing endometrial receptivity to&#xD;
      embryo transfer, inhibiting endogenous luteinizing hormone (LH) peak and reducing cycle&#xD;
      cancellation rate. The full dose of long acting GnRH-a was also applied before COH in the mid&#xD;
      luteal Hypergrowth program, and the mechanism of its lowering tone was similar. But whether&#xD;
      the clinical and perinatal outcome of early follicular hyperlengthening is as effective as&#xD;
      that of mid luteal hyperlengthening has not been reported at home and abroad. Moreover, there&#xD;
      is a lack of prospective randomized controlled studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One injection of 3.75mg GnRHa was injected on the 1st-3rd or 21st-23rd day of menstruation.&#xD;
      The level of estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), luteinizing hormone (LH) in peripheral blood&#xD;
      and the number of follicles in bilateral ovarian internal sinuses were monitored on the&#xD;
      32nd-38th day after pituitary hyporegulation.Gonadotropin (Gn) will be given after pituitary&#xD;
      desensitization. When the diameter of at least two follicles ≥ 18mm or more than three&#xD;
      follicles ≥ 17mm, the trigger of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) will be given and oocyte&#xD;
      will be retrieved. The selective fresh single blastocyst transplantation will be carried out&#xD;
      on the 4th-6th day after oocyte retrieval. HCG test at 12nd day after transplatation.&#xD;
      Follow-up investigation will given during the pregnancy and perinatal period.&#xD;

    <description>Inject a full dose of GnRH-a in 1st-3rd day of menstruation (leuprorelin acetate, injection, 3.75mg), the level of E2, P, LH in peripheral blood and the number of follicles in bilateral internal ovarian sinuses were monitored 32-38 days after the depression. If the pituitary desensitization was achieved, Gn (recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone or urofollicle stimulating hormone, injection, 75-300iu) was used for contralled hyperstimulation, when the diameter of 2 follicles was ≥ 18mm，hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin, injection, 4000-10000IU) was used to trigger and retrieve the oocyte. Selective single blastocyst transplantation was performed on the 4th-6th day after the oocyte retrieved. β-hCG was detected on the 12th day after embryo transplantation, and pregnancy or not was judged. If patients get pregnancy, follow-up was continued until the 42nd day after baby delivery.</description>
